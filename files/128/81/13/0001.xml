2- THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr Perez de Cuellar, was continuing to be diligent in promoting his plan to achieve a settlement of the conflict &apos;between Iran and Iraq. His prospects of success had not, however, ^proved and the most recent reaction from the Iranian regime to his &apos;^P^oposals had been very unforthcoming.

rHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the United States Assistant Secretary of State, Ambassador Richard Murphy, was now .lowing up, in a series of visits in the region, the initiatives of ^lng Hussein i^UNTordan and President Mubarak of Egypt which were lrected towards &lt;jlhe opening of direct negotiations between Jordan, Srael and the&apos;S^KJe^&apos;inians. There appeared to be a general disposition among the partie/Qjyvplved to move forward, although there could as yet e no great optm^mwabout the outcome. Israel&apos;s capacity to make a Positive contr ibutTM^^^o the	peace process was being seriously

finished by the det4^  rf^ting situation in the Lebanon.

Africa

^HE FOREIGN AND COMMONWS^%I^ SECRETARY said that, against the isquieting background of a^^wi/bances and shootings in the African townships in South Africa, th^wjwl^K African Government was nevertheless aking definite steps along theL^ro^Kto political change, for example, lts announcement of an end t^/ch)skban on racially mixed marriages. e American Secretary of Stat&amp;&lt;/^p. George Shultz, had publicly ^affirmed, as the Western responfi^^Ko these developments, the need rther to encourage change without vrdl^&amp;e, to maintain economic links with South Africa and to pursue the wSlitical dialogue with the South rican Government.	This was clearlyvthe right approach.	The South

nican Government had also announced, on 15 April, its decision ^laterally to withdraw its troops from Angola; this was likely to ,Crease the pressure for a withdrawal of Cubd#-~iuroops as well, but the gltuation on the Angola/Namibia border was lixl^lyvto remain uneasy. The 0uth African Government was expected to re^^rraX imminently to the   P  sals put forward by the Multi-Party ConfMelWe/vin Namibia, which ^njoyed only minimal black support, for a transictjwray administration to Afr^ OVer from the South African Administrator Gg/h^aT.	The South

t riCan response was unlikely to be hqlpful and theMrcV^^h Government, ^  gether with the other Western Governments represente^r/tj&gt; the Contact 0aP with the exception of France, had urged the Sou^^^S^acans to do . lng which would be in conflict with the provis&apos;the United ations Security Council&apos;s Resolution No 435.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that an announcement would He made later that day of the expulsion from the United Kingdom of an Assistant Military Attache in the Soviet Embassy and of a senior member the staff of the London office of the Soviet airline Aeroflot. They ^^Puld be required to leave the United Kingdom within seven days. A XjPjFther three members of the Service Attache staff of the Soviet Embassy being required to leave within four weeks, but these additional 9&gt;Pl&amp;sions would not be publicised unless the Soviet Government ^^caPjSated against the British Embassy in Moscow. Finally, three Soviet Attaches who had previously served at the Soviet Embassy in Hon^jjK^gre being forbidden to return, and the United Kingdom&apos;s North AtlatE^ reaty Organisation allies would be informed of their permanent exclusThe purpose of these measures was both to meet the serious concern&lt;yrfT the Security Service over the increasingly aggressive conduct and tactYfcs of agents of the Soviet military intelligence service (GRU) and. at the same time, to make it clear to the Soviet Government that the current improvement in the climate of bilateral political relations implied no wea^n^ng in the United Kingdom&apos;s determination to safeguard lts security. f^TKj* matter was being handled in a manner designed to minimise its po^-^l^Ec^i, impact.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMOlWEM^m SECRETARY said that during his visits, from 8 to 13 April, to the X^rn^n Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia and Poland, he had been str&lt;^k^y the unanimity of all three regimes in their support of the Wa5^to\Pact&apos; s current approach to East/West relations and arms control.^%Rall three countries, his interlocutors had echoed the recent statemeVlx^yand proposals, of the General Secretary oi the Communist Party of they^Ld^ket Union, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev; and close contact between his threw^hreus. Governments during the course of his tour had been reflected i&lt;/tt&amp;&gt; progressive development of the counter-arguments put to him when	argued the Western position on,

.0r example, the strategic imbalanc  ^^P^u  urope. Despite this, the style rn which the East Europeans had	their dialogue with him had

een less wooden than before and	had demonstrated a genuine

disposition to recognise the particulaf^contribution made by the United *-ngdom to the revival of a wider dialogue between East and West:	this

clearly owed much to the Prime Minister&apos;s visit to Hungary in February and to. Mr Gorbachev&apos;s visit to Britain yf^S^cember 1984. There was evidently a significant fund of goodwill to((thi/ United Kingdom in all three countries; in Czechoslovakia and Po1ot^^N&gt;6 theme that their Peoples and the British people had fought sidt((by^^ide for the ideals expressed in the Helsinki Final Act had made soW^Olpact. In each of e countries, the areas of contact had been difIn Poland, for example, the Polish Prime Minister, General Jaruzela^^v^d dealt almost Perfunctorily with questions of arms control, putting cWo^ost emphasis Poland&apos;s internal economic problems and evincing	s desire

0	gain international respectability. It had been clea^XtrjpWthe talks, However, that the Polish leadership lacked sufficient	into the

eture of their country&apos;s economic difficulties to de^^^S^f fective s  lutions to them. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary N^a^/that he


   had emphasised the connection between Western perceptions of the Polish regime&apos;s approach towards human rights issues and the prospects for normalising political and economic relations. He had made contact at high level with the Catholic Church both in Czechoslovakia, with /^Pardinal Tomasek, and in Poland, with Cardinal Glemp: from both, his .^OvP-tiative had met with a very warm response. In Warsaw he had visited   rave   f the late Father Popieluszko at the Church of St Stanislaw ka; this had been an exceptionally moving occasion, attended by a rowd of ordinary Poles, but not by Polish officials who, although    rpj^n^ied of his intentions, had demonstrated their disapproval of his c  w;ac^ with representatives of opposition groups by boycotting a at the British Embassy. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secr&lt;hr&amp;Z/said that, in general, his three visits in Eastern Europe had c  nfview of the importance of seeking further to improve the dialogu^Abetween East and West.

3&apos;U AArat*la 4 April

THE Prime MINISTER, ftr^&amp;Vaccount of her visits to Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Sri Lankaand Saudi Arabia, said that in Malaysia the Physical elegance and maYp^al well-being of the capital, Kuala Lumpur, testified to Malays ia1 s&lt;^&lt;a^ks as a newly industrialised rather than developing country. Her\^rjMjfcipal host, the Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr Mahathir, had proved, jJ^Vfc^ec ted, a difficult interlocutor:	his

sPeech at the banquet in M^ev/dionour on 5 April had included what amounted to a diatribe agaiCommonwealth. The British High Commission had subsequently tolhowever, that had representatives other members of the Europeanj&gt;dpt^inity been present, they too would have come in for their fair sha  ej?  &gt;discour tesy. The Prime Minister Said that her visit had never the le^r^jj*3\ved to remove the main bones of contention between the British aM^lalays ian Governments:	she had

  tfered to extend, for 1986-87, th(i/x  p?cial fee support scheme for Malaysian students in the United KiMdom, and the dispute over air aervices had been resolved by granting ari additional flight to London by Malaysian Airline System (MAS) in return for the Malaysian Government&apos;s Withdrawal of a discriminatory tax advantage fiar MAS passengers. The rime Minister said that Dr Mahathir&apos;s equi/CpcM attitude towards the aited Kingdom and the Commonwealth was evid4|v  J^-apt shared by all his lnisters, by whom, as by the Malaysian people     &quot;&quot;a\whole, she had been m    t warmly welcomed. The British contr	to the virtual

e ruination of Communist influence from Malaysia fc^  #v/}^arly recognised, a Was the British contribution to such projects as Mre/Kedah Dam, which e had visited. Excessive capital expenditure had  /fc&amp;K^n its toll of e Malaysian economy, which had implications for Yrf&amp;xe bilateral ^rade; but the visit had served to remove outstanding^^&amp;rcatles to the atisfactory development of United Kingdom/Malaysian rela&apos;^o^A


   THE prime MINISTER said that, during her short visit to Singapore, she had been impressed by the bold scale of the public works programme \ over which Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew&apos;s Government had presided. ^Lessons applicable to the United Kingdom could perhaps be drawn from ^Xhese efforts.

PRIME MINISTER said that the main conclusion which she had drawn \W^her entire Asian tour was that Britain should devote much more ^&gt;^cion to Indonesia, and particularly to the development of United H   ^j^m^Jndonesian trade. There was great goodwill towards the United Hin^tfojp^n this vast country of 160 million people and no post-colonial iegac?y^t^&gt;complicate relations. The Prime Minister said that she had been ijroj^S&apos;ped by the achievement of President Soeharto in giving nationar-\  %itv to a conglomeration of many islands and by his regime&apos;s success iw/^veloping the economy, in which agricultural production had been nearrX trebled and self-sufficiency in rice achieved. Under the direction or the Minister for Research and Technology, Dr Habibie, Indonesia had also made progress in advanced industrial technology, including the projkr^&apos;t ion of helicopters and light aircraft. The Prime Minister said th&amp;^Jiespite Indonesia&apos;s evident interest in developing trade with the Un^ejGXingdom and desire to purchase, for example, the Hapier ground-to-airMails/sile defence system, British aid to Indonesia at Present amounted to\wj^W  30 million and no soft loans were available. Given that the	&apos;s first priority must be to generate

Profitable business wVntotX ^jiuld create jobs in the United Kingdom, consideration should be givW&gt;to placing a greater emphasis in British ard policy to countries su  k^  \ Indonesia at the expense, if necessary,   I less economically health^y^/^ecipients.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that x^ev&gt;ftd noted from her visit to Sri Lanka fchat the United Kingdom appe^^tAAo have reaped few political or commercial dividends from its ^rfs^erable aid effort there. In Particular, the grant of   113 milli^rfVif British aid for the Victoria which she had commissioned durimj/Jrer visit, had been followed only a request for further aid for ^^^ro-electro project and by a disappointing response to representatia^/&gt;oncerning the 10 per cent limit imposed by the Sri Lankan Govermrent on the share for British m  rchant ships of westward bound carg s out of Colombo. The Prime Minister said that President Jayewardene, although well disposed and a   anof independent judgment, was burdened by the intractable problem of Tamil separatism and terrorist activity//&apos;   &apos;jkhich the elected rePresentatives of the Tamil community refused R^lJgjc4v to condemn. The People of Sri Lanka were notably pro-BritishTT^uM the country was impoverished and the Tamil problem overshadowed ali^^j^

THE PRIME MINISTER, in an account of her short visit	Dehli, said

^at it had become clear from her discussion with &lt;yt^,J^dian Prime jnister, Mr Rajiv Gandhi, that he had virtually decided .rf^Nto proceed ^ith the Indian Government&apos;s purchase of Westland W-30 he lA^iwers. The rime Minister had told him that, since the contract had b  ^^xeed on basis of comprehensive evaluation tests, it would be es^ret^J^il for b   Indian Government to state clearly, in writing, the	in

wbich the Westland design had failed to meet the Indian specrfW^S^on.


   The Prime Minister said that she had discussed with representatives of Westland&apos;s, in New Dehli, the complaints which the Indian side had \ raised; these were new to them.	She had therefore handed over to

/&gt;Mr Gandhi, before her departure, a letter reaffirming her request for a written statement setting	out	the Indian allegations	of

&lt;^^hortcomings in the Westland design; and the Indians had been promised a &apos;&apos;&quot;   ^&quot;^.operational demonstration of the Westland W-30 helicopter on the for which it had been designed. The prospects for the successful h&apos;^jj^.usion of the contract nevertheless remained uncertain.

THE	MINISTER said that, during her short visit to Saudi Arabia on

her	journey to the United Kingdom, she had been received with

8reat	lity and, despite the brevity of her stay, elaborate

earemonvS^^^King Fahd, in a lengthy exposition on the situation in the Middle EaS^/had shown that he appreciated the objectives of Ambassador Murphy&apos;s diplomatic activity and that he was also aware of the United Kingdom&apos;s ability to exert a helpful influence on United States policy.

THE SECr/^ARv OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that figures on earnings and on employm^n^draH been published the previous day. The annual rate   T growth in ear  (ngi/tfas down from 7.5 per cent to 7.25 per cent. This Was Probably the re^Lc of a reduction in overtime working and could at least partly be ex^dtof^by reductions in police overtime following the end of the miners1	. On employment the figure for new jobs

created during 1984 was&apos;w^2)000. This was an encouraging figure even Ihough many of the new^^5W\ were part-time or for women; the United Kingdom was one of the Pew^d^untries in Western Europe with more people at work at the end of	than at the beginning. He was still

concerned about the extenty^N^fpaud in the unemployment benefit system and was proposing to mountV^^Aia jor investigation, probably in the Reading and Slough area. T^re^was some evidence that, despite an employment level of 8-10 pLr	, vacancies there could not be

illed.	He had aiso institute^^a/^ystem of twinning towns in low

unemployment areas with those ^jK^h-igh unemployment areas whereby vacancies in the former were advert^a^Cj^in the latter. At present, this twinning was restricted to Aylesbury ^md^lewcastie and to Milton Keynes and South Shields.

1   discussion the following points were made -

a* The increase in new jobs was even mOT^encouraging when viewed over a longer period. There had been ar\(inMiease of 613,000 in the Period since March 1983. It was unf ortSj^rT^ that the impact of Such news was lost in the unemployment fMjic^Ax every opportunity should be taken to increase the emphasis on eijjefifoyment rather than unemployment and on the positive steps that we/c  /}&gt;  ing taken, many   f which were spelt out in the i White Papers^^wJ^hed since the Budget.

k*	There was an increasing amount of evidencaAtjra/t. attitudes

towards employment at the lower end of the income ratrg^^rad changed as a result of increasing familiarity with the bey^&amp;ipN sys tern. Claimants were now more sophisticated in operating tmsb^y/t^em and


   in securing the maximum benefit from it, and there was anecdotal evidence that benefit income was often topped up by income earned \	in the &quot;black economy&quot;. There were some 1.3 million long-term

unemployed, many of whom could only expect to secure low-paid work. As their benefit income might approach 90-95 per cent of their vHv possible earnings, there was little incentive for them to look for V/i&apos;/ work, even in those areas where it was readily available. It was AK^erhaps significant that half a million of the long-term unemployed &apos;v//^kre in London and the South East. Experience in the United States America had shown that changes in the form of benefit after a ^j0X  d period of time often had considerable impact on individuals&apos; ^J^i^Wions about employment. There might be some argument for ir^rjxjScing such an approach into the British system, or even going fuididier to provide opportunities for manual employment for those who\!&gt;ould otherwise remain unemployable. Extra staff might also be justified to police the benefit system. But such measures were likely to prove much more acceptable against a background of falling unemployment.

c.	Whils^^/^Jtrateed attitudes to receipt of benefit and to low-paid employment w^rjv/urot&gt;ably a nationwide phenomenon, it had to be recognised tRajJ^ysgional differences in unemployment rates had a significant efrecXj^vJobs which would attract no applicants in the South East, ffe  /&apos;&apos;&apos;^  ample, were the subject of considerable competition in ifers^y^Lde or the North East. Any measures to increase the attrac  Kw!^f low-paid employment must take account of this factor.

d.	One of the reason  x  ^rMregional variations in employment might

be the increased centra^j^rflfion of investment decision making in London and the South	But this had been going on for

many years and Governmeno&apos;^ppo^cies could and should play only a limited role in encouragi^gjpprestment in particular locations. The same concentration in tjtf^^jltHith could be observed in the location of Government Deparfor example, the Ministry of Defence had a very large prepoQ/f&amp;^a^ice of establishments in the South as compared with the Nort^(^ The Government could have a direct impact by taking firm but difficult decisions in this area.

TliE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discuss ion,sa id that it would be sefui for Ministers to have a further discu^ff^vn on the issues which ^ad been raised, in particular the extent to(ChiMithe operation of the enefit system acted as a disincentive to se^/^mployment. For this, orther information would be needed about the sttW^po and distribution the income of the unemployed as compared witT^^T/eir likely income 6Vels in employment. New proposals to help regior/^^psmbalances, such ?S twinning, should also be explored , further. In M^fJ^O^antime it was important to put over the wide range of relevant acp&apos;&amp;n which the ^overnment was taking and which had been set out in^^^veequence of lte TaPers on employment and other issues published sLjvg/xJ^e Budget. e forthcoming launch of an all-party group on employmenc&apos;Tjmrt^i. provide urther opportunities to explain how the Government was already JSyackling

   The Cabinet -

1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of the discussion.

   	2. Invited the Secretary of State for Education

^&gt;and Science, in consultation with the Secretary of ^xS&apos;tate for Employment, to discuss with the Chairman of /   &apos;&apos;&apos;thte Social and Economic Research Council what ^Xtfrther WOrk might be done to improve information &apos;C^r&apos;Jrais area.

3.^XTnvited the Secretary of State for Employment, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Social Services and the Minister without Portfolio, to prepare material for further discussion, including relevant harfj^trmation on levels of benefit and their relationship i  &gt; earnings at different levels and in different Ni  Q^52&gt;of the country.

The Dollar

THE CHIEF SECRETARY, ^iXKpllJRY reported that the dollar had recently strengthened slightly ag#  ^\ sterling and other currencies, perhaps in anticipation of a figu^^rather better than had at one time been expected for the growth r^^wican Gross Domestic Product in the first Rnarter of 1985. Sterling^SuK&gt; fallen that morning to $1.26 but had strengthened in relation to cikm^yfeuropean currencies.

The p _. . prir 311 lCe Index

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMF^Tr^l-d that it was expected that the &apos;Harch figure for the Retail PriceV^njd^k (RPl) to be published the following day, would show a rise in t^index, as a result of a number   f factors, incuding rises in the^prices of petrol, fruit and vegetables, and clothing and footwear. A rise in the RPI by the middle the year had of course been predicted in the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s. Budget Speech, and that month&apos;	should be seen and

Presented in that context. It was too earlyf(to predict the timing and extent of the downturn in the trend which hadVaS^^Keen predicted by the ancellor of the Exchequer:	much would dej{&lt;(nd//ipon the timing of

changes in mortgage interest rates.
