PRIME MINISTER said that Cabinet would wish to congratulate the Lord ^W^jdent of the Council on the successful conclusion of the first two

the Committee Stage of the Local Government Bill in the House of The defeat of the new clauses which would have replaced the ^re4^0^ondon Council and the Metropolitan County Councils with other elect^]yMdies was a significant victory for the Government.

THE LOR^PsS^IDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that much had depended on good speeches^yV^e Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Minister of State, Depf^tment of the Environment, and on the great efforts made by

factions. The Lebanese armeo^^^es had not intervened to stop the fighting. Christian refugees	ported to have fled from the

villages around Sidon, many of vS^S^/sputh to the border area still held by Israel. The situation in Lebani6^&lt;rts thus very unsatisfactory, and l!: was unlikelv to improve soon. /yvs

fHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Soviet authorities had not expelled any more members of the Br itish^SShassy in Moscow, other than the three already expelled. It was U30 %pon to conclude that fhey would not do so. But, as time passed, thisS&amp;y^msH increasingly likely. The Soviet Union had cancelled or postponW^rtte^or two Anglo-Soviet contacts; in particular they had postp^^^^avisit, which had been due to take place from 26 April to 3 May, by Minister of the Chemical Industry, Mr&apos;Vladimir Listov.to be hoped that this would be reinstated. The Foreign and Commfo^alth Secretary said that he would be seeing the Soviet ForeignQ&amp;pdSj&apos;ter,

Mr Andrei Gromyko, in Vienna on 15 May; this might help to&apos;^cirojs&apos;N Anglo-Soviet relations back towards normality.

^0\THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that during the Council isters (Foreign Affairs) on 29 April the European Parliament had nPS1 su 11ed on the revised Own Resources Decision. The Chairman of the/rat&amp;sii had maintained on all essential points the existing satis  ^f^ry text. The representatives of the European Parliament had not cOnLg^fed strongly the inclusion of the United Kingdom&apos;s 1984 1,000	ecu (about   580 million) abatement on the revenue side. A

minor araefS(W)t of the text on a separate point was agreed, subject to a German resVc^e. It was expected that this reserve would be withdrawn shortly. Th^ Community&apos;s draft 1985 budget would be before the European Parliament the following week. It was possible that the European Parliament might switch the 1,000 million ecu abatement to the expenditure side	budget. He doubted, however, whether they would

be able to sustain(thVs in the next round of discussions.

THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTHj&amp;^MSHERIES AND FOOD said that the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) woubi^e. meeting again that day in order to make a further attempt to agree	1985-86 agricultural support prices.

The Federal Republic of Germ^x^dH not changed its opposition to any reduction in cereal support prtf*e  \&gt; The Commission, however, appeared bo be holding more firmly to tm^p/av^n proposals. Although no other member state supported the Uniin arguing for a cut in cereal Prices greater than that proposed a^jpreNvCommission, it was possible that eight other member states, but	Federal Republic of Germany,

could agree on a cut of about 2 per ca^^^-&lt;There might, therefore, be another deadlock. In discussion it wa  -rfj#ued that, as the President of the Commission, Monsieur Delors, was him^&gt;  /caking a strong line on Prices and guarantee thresholds, there wa  ^ good chance of isolating the Germans. If the Germans were to use ttvi language of the Luxembourg compromise in resisting a vote on cereal prices, this also would be to the United Kingdom&apos;s advantage. It was also notejLpsj1 relation to budgetary discipline, that a revised package migh^M^) estimated to cost considerably more than the Commission&apos;s present p&lt;Op^5^1s but not to breach the guideline. It had already been agreed tttatJHf this actuation were to arise, there would need to be cons^6^^Zon between the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, the Chancellor of&lt;^fW^^tehequer and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.

4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the April unemployment figures showed an increase of 5,000 in the headline total and of 29,000 in the seasonally adjusted figure. This latter figure was .disappointing and puzzling. The increase in seasonally adjusted ^employment over the three months February to April averaged 18,000 per Jjtynth compared with 10,000 per month over the previous three months.

the six months to April the increase of 14,000 per month was at the ^a^e^rate as over the previous six months to October 1984. In o^a^hting on the figures he would say that, against the background of the/^Sauraging increase in new jobs and the report that week by the ConYedje&apos;j^jion of British Industry about the improvement in prospects for empltymejrO particularly in manufacturing industry, the April rise in unempl^yJnejjTs appeared to be erratic and should not be seen as a change in the JT^f]  ing trend. He would also point out that the figures did not refleVl^tlne measures announced in the Budget.

5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Energy on privatisation of the gas industry (C(85) 10).

jtfHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that his Department had _ feeder taken intensive work on the possibility of privatising the British ^4 Corporation (BGC), including a full review of the Corporation s activities and assets, and a thorough study of regulatory arrangements ^or the supply of gas elsewhere in the world. He had concluded that it would be impossible to go ahead with so major a privatisation while the coal strike continued to preoccupy his Department, but there was now an opportunity, if action were taken very quickly, to complete the privatisation of BGC before the next General Election. Such a move would r$pre^nt a significant contraction in the size of the public sector, would4provide a substantial new opportunity for wider share ownership jf and would for the first time give BGC1s employees a real   PPortunit^Cp^ticipate in the success of their business. It woul not be feasible (    introduce competition into the supply of gas to domestic and iWlustkial consumers, and the privatised company would be required to comffty wiih existing obligations to supply customers even where the costs of doii|g so were particularly high. The accounting arrangements requi^Klkr the operation of the necessary price regulation would pi^luJLconcealed cross-subsidisation of the sale and servicing of appliancW^where there was already increasing private sector competition with BGC. Moreover, the disciplines of the financial markets would give the new company a strong inducement to make better use of the assets represented by its high street sites. He had reviewed the possibility of privatising JfiC as a series of regional utilities rather than as a single compa*W  ut this would have meant several year = delay while the necessary reg^J43i|arganisations were built up, as well as increases in prices in regio*r\wh&gt;re gas distribution costs were relatively higher. In order to ^	proposed privatisation

timetable, the necessary legislati   would need to receive its Roya Assent before the Summer Recess the^^j^wing year; two experience teams in his Department were ready t^begin detailed work as soon as Policy approval was given, and financi* advisers would need to be recruited as soon as possible to help wTOle preparatory work.^ His Department would seek to draw to the maxluiiAtenC on the experience o the Department of Trade and Industry in th^rWatisation of British Telecom. He would be putting detailed proposals on specific aspects ot the privatisation to the Ministerial Sub-Committee on Economic Affairs (E(A)) as soon as possible; meanwhile he sought the Cabinet s endorsement for his general approach, and for the ena^ment of the necessary legislation during the next Parliamentary^W^ion.

In discussion the following main points were made

a.	The timetable was extremely tight, and left iSj^ra*in for overcoming unexpected difficulties. Moreover, the	in

financial markets as the next General Election approa^WJould not be predicted with certainty, and it might not in the ev^gjge possible to go ahead with the flotation in the autumn envisaged by the Secretary of State for Energy. On the o^fer^nd, the fact that the process of privatisation had begun, even


   of the payments for the shares had not yet fallen due, could be helpful to the Government in the course of the next General Election campaign.

|i  k b. The financial markets should have no difficulty in absorbing

the privatisation of BGC, with the payments staged over a period of &apos;	\ several months. The Government had considerable flexibility about

V. the timing of the payments for this and other privatisations, and demands on the gilt-edged market would be correspondingly less. Moreover there were signs that financial institutions were investing less of their funds abroad, and were keeping substantial liquid assets against the probability of new privatisation issues.

c.	| Although there could not be competition in the supply of gas to&apos;e generality of domestic and industrial consumers, the Government should encourage other centres of initiative in the producCv^jW^d marketing of gas. The treatment of imports and exports oL ga% would be particularly important in this context, if a situation was^to be avoided in which either the new company or the suppli^^B^^kgas from the United Kingdom Contintental Shelf enjoyed an urapSHi^ible degree of market power.

d.	Particular ^df^tion would need to be given to ensuring public

confidence in fui^re regulatory arrangements covering safety and gas prices. Much of BGC&apos;s present responsibility for safety would be transferred to the Health and Safety Executive. No commitments should be made about the form of price regulation, or the identity of the regulator, until thAlK arrangements had been worked out in detail.	Ilf.

THE prime MINISTER, summing up	cuss ion, said that the Cabinet

endorsed the objective of privatgas industry within the timescale proposed by the SecretarJEif^^ate for Energy. They recognised that other substantial	need to be dropped from

the legislative programme for the nej^ament ary Session, in order to make way for the very substantial g^E^flkystry Bill which would be Required, and would turn their attention^S^^s problem as the next item on their agenda. The Secretary of SK^gpk^r Energy should make a Preliminary announcement of the Government &apos;^^lntentions in the course of the following week, and should thereafter bring detailed proposals on hhe major aspects of gas industry privatisation, including the form   f regulation, the continuing obligations and responsibility of the Privatised gas industry and the treatment of gas impoi^ and exports, before E(A) before the Whitsun Recess.

The Cabinet -

    v\

1.	Took note, with approval, of the Prime Mimstefs    

summing up of their discussion.

2.	Invited the Secretary of State for Energy to make

a preliminary statement of the Government&apos;s intentions	^


   during the following week, in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Lord Privy Seal and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.

3.	Invited the Secretary of State for Energy to submit a further paper to the Ministerial Sub-Committee on Economic Affairs before the Whitsun Recess on the major - aspects of gas industry privatisation, including the form of regulation, the continuing obligations and responsibilities of the privatised gas industry and the treatment of gas imports and exports.

The Cabinet? considered a memorandum by the Lord President of the Council	about the consequences for the legislative programme

*985-86 of th^^nT^ision of a Bill to privatise the gas industry.

THE LORD PRESIDOM^aTHE COUNCIL said that it was most undesirable that changes should be^madgwto the agreed programme at such a late stage.

To do so imposed grai^ drains on Departments and Parliamentary Counsel. Nonetheless, the Queers Speeches and Future Legislation Committee (QL) had considered the indications for the legislative programme of the Cabinet&apos;s deciding to include a gas Bill in the 1985   86 legislative Pr  gramme. In view of the size and complexity of a gas Bill, they had agreed that they must recommend to Cabinet the deletion of two medium-sized Bills from the programme to make way for it. This was made accessary by the size and difWaulfcy of the existing programme and the timetable requirements of the^hs Bi^. itself. The fact that Royal Assent was required for the gas ^D^%efore the Summer Adjournment of 1986, coupled with increasing pressure* for the Summer Adjournment to begin earlier, would make the handl^^^^the programme with the delusion of the gas Bill part icula^S icult. The decision of the sub-Committee on Nationalised IndustrTe^^Mt the Nationalised industries Bill need not be proceeded wT^tht$  e following Session had Provided the first candidate. QL had, hdl^eW found it very difficult to identify a second candidate. The omis^o^^ some short Bills would make no practical difference. Most other BSTls had a very strong claim   a grounds of preparedness or political significance. They were left Wlth a very few candidates which in their view it might be possible to Postpone into the 1986-87 Session. They had concluded, with great reSret, that the Northern Ireland (Emergency ProvisioMji Bill was the   ne that would have to give way. He should also remind Cabinet that there were three other Bills - on Housing, Dockyards^jtid Deregulation of usinesses - on which final decisions had yet to be ta^H|^l  out their ^elusion in the programme for 1985-86. QL were agreed^MgP^fcf any of ese Bills were to be included there would have to be eq$|va$ent eletions and they would report further to Cabinet with	in a

tew weeks&apos; time.

SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that he was mOpS -^appointed about QL&apos; s recommendation; the reopening of the agreed


   programme was most unsatisfactory. The Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill would implement most of the recommendations of the ^Report by Sir George Baker on the operation of the Northern Ireland ^Emergency Provisions) Act 1978. Many of the recommendations would fflltoProve the civil rights of Northern Irish citizens and would complement recommendations of the Jellicoe Report which had already been   lacted. Legislation on the Baker Report was widely expected in^ &apos;IJOriHiern Ireland although no firm commitments had been made on timing.

The 1978 Act had to be renewed every six months and further delay in implementing the Baker recommendations would therefore give at least two m  re occasions for the Opposition to criticise the Government&apos;s handling of the Baker Report. This would be significant because of the impact such criticisms would have in Northern Ireland, in the Republic of Ireland ffijwu the United States of America. He therefore hoped that Cabinet wcflftlPiLable to find an alternative Bill for deletion from the

Programme.

THE Prime mtnrfa   gi^Afitiwiming up a brief discussion, said that there were great difficul^esfinding any suitable candidates for deletion from the following SeTsJ^*programme at that stage. There seemed to be no alternative to th^5^&gt;rthorn Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill and Cabinet was extremel%^rueful to the Secretary of State for Northern Preland for agreeing t&lt;*  l^ deletion in these circumstances. They also agreed to the deletion^o the Nationalised Industries Bill from the Programme. If, however, for any reason, another Bill was delayed and could not realistically go forward into the following Session&apos;s Programme, the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill should be ^stored. it should in any caseg&amp;a given a firm place in the 1986-87 Programme and the Secretary of(sVate for Northern Ireland could indicate that legislation would be brougffK^p|?ard in this Parliament. QL should look further at the implia  t\p)     of restructuring the programme to include Bills on Housing, Dock^fc-JjP^d Deregulation and report back 1:0 Cabinet by the end of May.

The Cabinet -	&lt;SP^4-

1.	Agreed that a Bill, to enable tTfcJ^tfatisation of

the gas industry and for consequential&apos;	sh  uPh be

added to the legislative programme for t^o5-86 and that the Nationalised Industries and Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bills should be deleted from the programme.

2.	Agreed that the Northern Ireland (Emergency E^j^isions)

Bill should have a firm place in the 1986-87 leai^*ive Programme.

3.	Took note that the Queen&apos;s Speeches and Futur^^pp|lation Committee would consider the possibility of further chants

LIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEX CC(85) 15th Conclusions, Minute 7 Thursday 2 May 1985 at 9.15 am

&apos;OClAt

The Cabinet^jS^fe^ered a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Services (C(^) 9) about the review of social security.

tHE SECRETARY	QF S&apos;TATE FOR	SOCIAL	SERVICES	said that the reviews of

Provision for retirement, supplementary benefit, housing benefit and children and youn^jB^e initiated in November 1983 and the first half of 1984 had been cofl^Eifl^. Some 20 public hearings had been held, over organisations had	oral evidence and 4,500 pieces of written

evidence had	been received.	The	reviews	had constituted the most

comprehensive	examination of	social	security	since the Beveridge Report

  ver 40 years	before. The case for	reform of	the social security system

was overwhelming; in particular present arrangements were excessively complicated, failed to make J^#|tbest use of resources, and did not strike the right balance betwfej thie responsibilities of the State and the individual. He was thereWre proposing a comprehensive reform of social security based on the &quot;W^jillars&quot; of the State providing a basic level of support with individuals .supplementing that level through working, saving and occupation arrangert^ts. Other key objectives were piping those most in need, helping people to help themselves, and s^plif ication. His most imp or tant^iAm^sals were in the field of amily support, supplementary benefit, Tiousmg benefit and pensions but bHore were also proposals on many oth^^a greets of social security Provision. He suggested that the Cabi~ yp^puld consider his main

Proposals in turn.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said thaAm  le the position the elderly had improved considerably over th   previious 20 years there had been no comparable improvement in the posi^on ^f low-income amilies with children. Those out o&apos;f work would be ^jjpfcdth by his Proposals for supplementary benefit. For low income	in work

e existing Family Income Supplement (FIS) scheme was	Tory   

t did not provide adequate help for large families; it wa^^Wlseen as Part of working income because it was not paid alongside	had

f7en_ open to manipulation by those claiming it; and it c^^^jJted Slgnif icantly to the unemployment and poverty traps. He me^m^ce


   Proposed to abolish FIS and to replace it with a new system of Family Credit for low-income working families. This would be the counterpart l of income support for those out of work and would be structured on a ^imilar basis. Most importantly it would be paid by employers through P&amp;e wage packet with the effect that working families receiving the ^%dit would be able to keep more of their own money and have higher take home pay. It would substantially alleviate the poverty and ^^^^loyment traps and tighter qualification rules would reduce the scope for abuse. He also proposed to replace welfare foods (except for formula milk for children up to two years old) and free school meals with additional cash payments to recipients of Family Credit. The universal Child Benefit was extremely popular and must, in his view, continue. (Jlfeowever, the existence of an effective family support scheme would reduce rhe need for regular uprating. The additional cost of Family C^Jic ^ikely to be   70-100 million per annum) could be found by limiting thKXgL uprating of Child Benefit to   7.00 per child per week.

io discussion    following main points were made -

a.	The	for Family Credit was far-sighted and ingenious

in dealing wl&amp;^Rkf needs of low income families in work. There must be a pos^JrnS^ that rates of take-up and, consequently, the cost of the scheme would be greater than anticipated. There might also be great pofftical difficulty in resisting pressure to uprate Child Benefit regularly thus jeopardising the source of offsetting savings. On the other hand, the additional costs of Family Credit would not be large in relation to total spending on Child Benefit, and the	concept	of redisgr^uting the sum available	for	family

support	to give	more help	to the low-paid would	be	widely

understood.	- X

h. Payment of Family CrecTOb thrpugh the wage packet would be a significant advance. The schRe ^ould also improve incentives to work by reducing, though nTOgfl^iminating, the poverty and unemployment traps for low incoirejfli^ilies. Complete elimination   f the traps would be very expens

c. About 250,000 families would glfcn an average of   4.40 a week from the establishment of Family Credi^^hnd some 110,000 families lose an	average	of   4.70 a	week largely because the	new	scheme

would not be skewed towards small families as was the case with FIS. There would, however, be transitional protection to ensure that no	beneficiaries under	the existing scheme suffered	a cash

m.

PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the disqussicyi, said that e Cabinet agreed the proposals for Family Credi^^^g  ^.uding the lscontinuance of free school meals and welfare g^od* for its Recipients, as set out in C(85) 9. They were particularl|^|g|acted by le Proposal for payment through the wage packet, and the	the

?r  Posals on work incentives. They also agreed that univ^^SMkChild er&gt;efit should be retained and that the additional cost of ^^Sg^Rmily re&lt;iit scheme should be met by limiting future Child Benefit upr^ii^||*


   The Cabinet -

1- Agreed the proposals on family support in C(85) 9.

   Sir*

1	SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that the present system ^^   upplementary benefit was too complex for claimants to understand and .or staff to administer.	Even if he had wished to do so, it would be

impossible to leave the system unchanged. He therefore proposed a radical restructuring with the following main features. There would be s basic income support scheme under which the level of benefit would epend	on marital status and age with additional provision for

arailie    ||l  hg:[onerg and the disabled. There would no longer be extra Payments^  for| example, for heating related to detailed assessment of lndividua]^Sj&gt;i%unistances and assistance would not be available with mortgage iircerest payments during the first six months on benefit, ere would mye^gg- be a discretionary fall back scheme of social aid or emergencies* and ispecial needs operated within cash limits, with no egal entitlementJli^wietailed rules. The levels of disregard for both capital and earnnigs ^ould be increased to encourage the incentive for help. Ther^^loAd be significant numbers of both gainers and sers. As with FamiipP%redit, transitional provision would be made to ensure that no-one suffered a cash loss as a result of the changes.

discussion the following main points were made -

a- The proposal for imcpme support was a radical simplification which was greatly to b    *cpmed. There was certain to be much controversy over the abopftjPkof heating allowances. Even though what was spent on them woi^^^, consolidated into the basic rates, those in particularly cold areaa or with particularly high fuel costs would suffer as a cons^Lew^. There would also be greater difficulties for the power sup^JfH^iiustries in dealing with unpaid dills.	On the other hand the	allowance was a relatively

recent innovation, the rules for calculating payments could not easily be defended, their removal lHfc^be a great simplification, and those still in real need would h^^p|kess to social aid.

k- The concept of a cash limited back up social aid scheme with no legal entitlement was a good one. In fact, however, it seemed inevitable that guidance and case law would develop rapidly, and refusal of aid might become difficult even in the absence of legal entitlement. There would also be criticism ||$E*e cash-limit was implemented in such a way that claimants were^javing to be refused aid in one area while funds were still availably another. The relevant section of the Green Paper would need to meet such criticisms in advance.	;

&gt;	The proposal not to help with mortgage inter^jiJ^payments

uring the first six months on benefit would be cri^JrfpW as a disincentive to home ownership, and by the building slml^  gs on


   whom the burden would fall. However, building society policy was generally to be as helpful as possible to the home-owner in these circumstances, those in long-term difficulty would receive assistance, and increasingly insurance could be taken out against the risk in question.

[: ^   	There must be doubts about the overall effect on public

^expenditure when so many aspects of supplementary benefit were being changed at the same time. It was also uncomfortable that the proposed transitional protection for loses would depend on continuing inflation for its success. Given the uncertainties it might be better to be less generous in some respects, for example the .capital and earnings disregards. In fact, however, the uncwjbtyities were not as great as had been suggested and the introduction of the capital disregard, which would apply to housing benefit as -well as supplementary benefit, would actually save money overaladdition, many payments under the social aid scheme would be ^^c dyer able.
