THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that violence was

  &apos;n South Africa. The South African Government had extended f the police to detain persons during the emergency and the the police against public proceedings. Restrictions had on the activity of the media in the districts where the rgency applied. The British Government had been pressed to ntations to South Africa about the restrictions on the he Foreign and Commonwealth Office had issued a statement in terms. So far, only Mr Malcolm Fraser of Australia and uora Barber of the United Kingdom had been formally nominated to the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group, which had been established by the Commonwealth HeadjNof Government Meeting in October 1985. The nomination of l/ard^Barber had been widely welcomed. India appeared likely to nominsjjxjljia former Foreign Minister, Mr Swaran Singh. It aPpeared that Mr Tpid^au of Canada might be reluctant to be nominated.

The French President, Monsieur Mitterrand, and tlC^^tferal German Chancellor, Herr Kohl, would be discussing the issues at wipdi&gt;meeting during the present week.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY s^d^sAat on his recent visit to Washington he had made very clear to the^^mTyd States Secretary of Commerce, Mr Baldrige, and the Uni ted	Trade

Representative, Mr Yeutter, the particular importanc^^/^he United Kingdom of exports of semi-finished steel products and/^k&gt;&amp;\of structural steel. The agreement, however, on restrainc^nXC^mmunity exports of steel to the United States, which had now been r^hed ad referendum between the United States and the Commission, satisfactory, in particular because it did not provide suffx^ifejUX assurances on semi-finished steel products. The United Kingd^tW^^ P  sition was fully reserved. We had immediately brought press^re/  o   ear both on the Commission and on the United States to ensure Is6w^t&gt;e


   necessary assurances were obtained. In the near future no United States company could provide the semi-finished slab steel which the British Steel Corporation planned to export to its United States partner at .Tuscaloosa. There were some signs that Mr Yeutter would be ready to \Xeach an agreement which would largely protect the increasing United 2&gt;Wgdom exports to the Tuscaloosa plant. In discussion it was pointed ^WVythat the United States should not take for granted British support ^P^r^ttpade issues when difficulties of this kind arose.

5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord President of the Council (C(85) 26) about the 1985 Public Expenditure Survey.

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that at their meeting on 11 July (khe Cabinet had decided that the public expenditure planning totals vshould be   139.1 billion for 1986-87,   143.9 billion for 1987-88, and &apos; fl48.2 billion for 1988-89, and invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury to bilateral discussions of expenditure programmes with the Ministers responsible. On 3 October the Chief Secretary, Treasury reported progress. The Prime Minister had invited him to be the Chairman of the Ministerial Group on Public Expenditure (MISC 120) to consider and make recommendations on those issues which had not been resolved.JpXhe Group&apos;s recommendations were set out in C(85) 26, which also ga^e\amef descriptions of the policy implications of the agreemenPfti%:hed bilaterally between the Chief Secretary, Treasury and the spendiVn^^miis ters. He wished to express his thanks to the other members of the Group and to the Chief Secretary, Treasury and spending Ministers foi^th^x, hard work and co-operation.

MISC 120 had re^OlwL^greement with the spending Ministers about the recommendations t^mmit to the Cabinet on all the outstanding Programmes except houSi$k. Following extensive discussion in the Group, the Chief Secretary, XfMfeurv and the Secretary of State for the Environment had been sole to reach agreement on the recommendations for the housing programme; MISC 120 endorsed that agreement, which had been reached too late to be incorporated in his memorandum. The recommendations on housing provided for net additions to the total Programme of   197 million,   177| million and   157 million respectively for the three Survey years. ThA^ecretary of State for the Environment Would be able to find room, wl^sSgikhese net changes, for a substantial increase in expenditure on renomS^h of public sector housing; the Secretary of . State would make ev^ApHlfort to ensure that the provision made for renovation was actually spent by local authorities in the way the Government intended. MISC 120 Recognised that the proposed settlements on the individual prograimn  (^^uld require the Ministers concerned to take difficult polit ical   #$P|pns; this was particularly the case with the programmes which were^|W&gt;^esponsibility of the Secretary of State for Social Services, in making the difficult, but necessary, judgments about priorities, the   jFnad been concerned that the established arrangements for the apportionment of public provision to the different parts of the United Kingdom represented a serious constraint on their work; they therefore recommended that a new assessment of need for such provision should be unde^j^ken covering all Parts of the country, to serve as a basis for decision yaking in future public expenditure rounds.

THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that thanks to the^Qp^ of the Group it had been possible to present to the Cabinet a broa  y successful outcome to the 1985 Public Expenditure SurveyW The recommendations for the individual programmes produced a C^^jJ^utcome not far from the previously agreed public expenditure planning totals; and where increases above baseline were proposed - for exampl^^yi^ ^ health, law and order, housing renovation, roads, science and


   programme - this reflected an appropriate assessment of social and political priorities. On the basis of the figures presented in i C(85) 26, together with the subsequently agreed proposals on the housing &apos;programme and the changes to the social security figures resulting from latest projections of the number of claimants and the take-up of &apos;t^loefits, there were gaps to be bridged of about Ei billion,   ^/4 y^^-on, and   3/4 billion respectively for the three Survey years. It &apos;v&apos;as^ssential that there should be no change in the published public expenditure planning totals; but the latest estimates suggested that receipts from special sales of assets were likely to amount to some   4^/4 billion in each of the three Survey years, and this would reduce the gap to   */4 billion in each of the first two years (and eliminate it comple t^djPbn the third year). The remaining gap could be covered by adjustments to the Reserve, which would then stand at   4i billion,   6^/4 billion aS   8 billion respectively for the three Survey years. Such figures wera^igher than had been shown in previous years, and it was aPpropriate t&lt;?/^  ve a larger margin for the most distant years when Possible cl a i	additional public expenditure could less clearly be

foreseen. For	, there were bound to be substantial claims for

additional local authority current expenditure, where the figures shown for the programme were constant in cash terms for the three years, while the social security^igure for 1988-89 was provisional pending the conclusions of the current Review. For the current year, it appeared that the Reserve of   5 billion would be fully spent, in substantial measure because of additional demands following the end of the miners&apos; strike; it was very important that the planning total should not be exceeded, and every effort should be made to avoid further claims. For the future years the provision ifor the Reserve was realistic rather than generous, and there would remm)$ a .constant need for the tightest control over claims on the Reserve.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER slid that the results of the 1985 Public Expenditure Survey would be publisrl^d iWpart of his Autumn Statement on November. This Statement would iq^Wllil, the latest economic forecast f  r 1986, of which he gave the Cabinet, a summary account. It would not, however, include any figure for the &quot;implied fiscal adjustment&quot; in his 1986 Spr ing Budget; the margins of erroi^^i^gxample through the effect   f exchange rate changes on oil revenues, were^uch that no meaningful figure could be produced. So far as publicrexpenditure was concerned, figures for each programme would be given for each of the three Survey years rather than, as hitherto, for the year immediately ahead only. It Was important that departmental Ministers should be ready at the same time to present the results of the Survey as they af^^ted their own Programmes in a positive way; and it would be up tdMK^rtments rather than the Treasury to answer any detailed questions W  u  ^||ny of the

Programmes.

In discussion the following main points were made -

a. If the impact of asset sales and nationalised industries&apos; financing were excluded from the figures, the resulting^Mfjf^^ate for 1979-80 was   2i billion below the planning total. current year, the comparable aggregate would be   1.2 billron^jt^/e


   the planning total, and by the end of the Survey period, it was projected to be   4 billion above the planning total. Although the privatisation programme could be expected to continue at a high level, for which the Government should take credit, receipts from ^	asset sales could not be maintained at present levels indefinitely,

w\. with the implication that either programmes would eventually have \ v to be cut back or taxation levels increased.

b. Apart from the contribution privatisation made to the better functioning of the market economy, it was reasonable for the Government to realise some of its assets in order to create new houses, hospitals, roads, etc. It was also reasonable for the Government to take credit for the improvement achieved in nst^tfpMised industries&apos; finances. On the basis of the results of thdKl985*Survey, the public expenditure planning total gross of rec^pts from asset sales would be broadly constant in real terms from	to 1988-89, and steadily declining as a proportion of

the Gras8domestic Product.

THE Prime MINIS^jP^Jjlumming up the discussion, said that the Cabinet thanked the Lord ,Presijdent of the Council and the other members of MISC 120 most warmly for their work. It had been an outstanding achievement that evp^y jfepgramme had been settled without reference to the Cabinet. The Cab^P^^approved all the recommendations for the individual programmes, both those agreed bilaterally with the Chief Secretary, Treasury and those agreed in MISC 120, as set out in Annexes    to L of C(85) 26; they also endorsed the agreement reached by the Chief Secretary, Treasury with the Secretary of State for the Environment on the housing prqgrfMjtyne. The resulting figures for

1986-	87, 1987-88 and 1988-89	appear in the Chancellor of the

Exchequer&apos;s Autumn Statement, nBj^%feublished on Tuesday 12 November; more detailed figures for each p^Ogr^me in each year would appear in the 1986 Public Expenditure White^afrerr, At the same time the Cabinet c  nfirmed the Government&apos;s adherencm^^the agreed public expenditure Planning totals of   139.1 billion for^ 198fi|-87 and   143.9 billion for

1987- 88, and agreed that the total foTshould be set at   148.7 1Hion, as noted in paragraph 4 of C(8q) 26. Care should be taken to

to-ordinate the presentation of the Government&apos;s decisions in the most Positive way, taking credit for the addi11omilffiove baseline on the Programmes to which the Government attached^the highest priority, but at the same time emphasising that firm control of public expenditure had een maintained. Each Department should prepare a presentation of its 0wn Programme consistently with this general approach. So far as the current year was concerned, it was essential that the^teserve should not e overspent; all Ministers should make every effortrain expenditure on their programmes, to ensure that thi^i^m^ive was achieved. The Cabinet were not ready to reach a decision on the Proposal for a fresh assessment of the need for public provision in each Part of the United Kingdom. Questions from the media abcK:	outcome

^ the Cabinet&apos;s discussion would be answered by saying	Cabinet

   confirmed that expenditure would be held to the previously published totals for 1986-87 and 1987-88 and would be broadly the same in real ; terms in 1988-89.

the FOREIGmB^COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he and the Secretary of State for	Ireland had on the previous day had a useful meeting

with the DepufiMPMme Minister of the Irish Republic, Mr Dick Spring, and the Irish Foreign Minister, Mr Peter Barry. This meeting had gone reasonably well.* Botlr Governments were moving towards final decisions   n an Anglo-Ir ish^^^^went. The Irish Government were expected to take their deci sion on the tollowing Tuesday, 12 November. During the feting on the previWls^piw the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland ad left the two Minis^Ps^from the Irish Republic in no doubt of the importance attached by the British Government to improved co-operation against terrorism. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland had obtained assurances that the Irish Government would take seriously their obligations in this regard under^^rticle 9(a) of the draft Agreement and ad secured a strengthening of^^^fcsassage on this subject in the draft communique for an Anglo-Irish	The Foreign and Commonwealth

Secretary and the Secretary of St.ifee&apos;&apos;^jpr Northern Ireland had pressed e Ministers from the Irish RepuD^^g^i the question of early Irish ^ignature of the European Conventioi^on^he Suppression of Terrorism, as istmct from a mere announcement of^toa^ik intention to accede to the onvention. The Ministers from the Ir^$SP|Jp!public had said that there c  uld be constitutional difficulties fo^Riem in signing the Convention   me time before their Government would blPoAfe position to ratify it, that they would consider the matter,	discussion of the proposeed

ntergovernmental Conference and its Secreta^pl^^ there had been Agreement that these bodies would be located in Belfast or certainly in rthern Ireland. But it had been possible to bring home more clearly ian before to the Ministers from the Irish Republic that there were Practical difficulties and important security difficulties and that it    ight not be right for the first meeting of the Inte^JS^rnmental 0r&gt;ference to take place in Belfast or for the Secre  JUR^to be establisbed there very soon after an Agreement entere^intoforce.

the SECRETARY of STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that, i^A^jeeting on previous day, he had made clear to the Ministers from &apos;ihfi^y.sh public that he would continue to press, after conclusion cSp^mL ^sreenent, for increasing co-operation against terrorism. Th^B^mh e were sensitive to anything which seemed to suggest that n Cross-border security required action only on their side. Th.it;


   difficulty could be circumvented by referring to the improvement of security co-operation. The security dangers in holding the first meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference in Belfast or in the early establishment of the Secretariat there had been made very clear to the &apos;&apos;,^rish Ministers. The Irish side continued to try to enhance the status the Secretariat. It was symptomatic that the London correspondent of Irish Times, in an interview on the British Broadcasting Corporation&apos;s Radio 4 that morning, had said that the new Ministerial ^&gt;dys ie the intergovernmental Conference, and the Secretariat would oversee&quot; Northern Ireland policy.

in discussion the following points were made -

a.	Th|re would be a difficult period with the media until the Agr%ljie&apos;ht was concluded. Once that had happened, the Government couldxpoiht to the terms of the Agreement in order to correct misuncberstanking and misrepresentation.

b.	Meanwhile, Ministers would continue to make clear, in the face of rumour and misrepresentation, that there would be no change regarding rewSWihlity for decisions in Northern Ireland. The Prime Ministef^^^onark, made recently in the Dnited States, that decisions in Northern Ireland would be taken by the United Kingdom and decisions in^PWe^South by the Republic could be repeated.

c.	Total misrepresentation of the proposed Agreement, as in the remark on radio by the London correspondent of the Irish Times about the Intergovernmenta^Xonference and the Secretariat overseeing policy in Northern ,Ireland, was most unwelcome. It was for consideration whethermMS^e representations should be made to the Irish Embassy.

The Cabinet -	rail

yzi

Confirmed its invitation to the Rrima Minister, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Sec^^^4|v of State for Northern Ireland to report to the Cabinet, before conclusion of the Agreement, on further changes in the^exSksecured in the final stage of negotiation with the Irish Government.
