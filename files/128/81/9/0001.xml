   *W\PRIME MINISTER said that, at the conclusion of the Cabinet&apos;s

&apos;&apos;&amp;j&apos;^  &gt;rSsion for conveyancing by employed solicitors the previous week, ^kW^net had invited the Lord Chancellor to consider ways, alt    rfa  iVe to the &quot;basic service&quot; proposed by officials which they had discus^c^of enabling employed solicitors to provide services to house buyerswtj^ch would avoid the problems of conflict of interest set out in C^85)6-C&apos;?IJ?&gt; had subsequently looked again at the undertakings given to HouseboT^ommons, on the basis of decisions reached in Cabinet in December/f983, in particular by herself in reply to an Oral Parliamentary Question on 20 December 1983, and by the Solicitor General   n 16 December 1983 and 17 February 1984 and in his letter of 12 January 1984 to Mr Austin Mitchell MP. All of these stated unambiguously that the Government we/^ntimmitted to bring forward legislation to enable solicitors employfiji M^institutions such as building societies and banks to undertake conveWoilY^. It was in the light of these assurances, among others, that Mp-^^ahell had withdrawn his House Buyers Bill. The difficulties in satis^e^o^ly resolving the problems of conflict of interest might not then/ww  \been fully foreseen, but the undertakings had been categorical, an&lt;^4&amp;&apos;vpuld be a very serious matter if they could not be honoured.

THE SOLICITOR GENERAL said tN^J&gt;xf\Mitchell&apos;s main objective had been to secure the possibility of estatf&amp;^&amp;ng a system of licensed conveyancing hy people who were not solicito^/^nd had used words in the House of Commons which suggested that it	fj  $fcby any means so important to

him that employed solicitors shoul^W^le to provide conveyancing services. Moreover the statements	the House of Commons had made

clear the need for any arrangements tQ^^-^ibject to safeguards to avoid conflicts of interest. Having regard	hat had been said in the

House of Commons on the subject, he did ^t^fiimself consider that he or the Government could be accused of dishonwrable conduct if, having looked further into the matter, they felt obliged to tell the House that they had found the difficulties much harder to overcome than had been expected.

THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he was well aware ts^ytfSSNstatements made hy the Prime Minister and the Solicitor General tomi/)i the Prime Minister had referred. At their last meeting the CitSZttU had invited him to consider alternative ways, which would avoid pVoqy^jJis of conflict of interest, of enabling employed solicitors to providk^rfy^yancing services. Work in pursuance of this remit was now in hdnd^aftd would be rePorted to the Home and Social Affairs&lt;Committee as soon	ible.

He would pursue this work in good faith, and with the statCT^^^^to which the Prime Minister had referred very much in mind, and^^^yxjld Use his best endeavours to find a way of enabling employed so^c^Wlrs to undertake conveyancing which would avoid problems of conflict Interest and which he could conscientiously recommend to his coll^^u^y.


   THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet endorsed its earlier conclusions on the subject, and would wish the importance of honouring undertakings given in the House of Commons to be ^given full weight in the search for alternative solutions to the problem.

   C^T^The Cabinet -

CoEndorsed the conclusions reached as a result of (/ChVt previous discussion.

&lt;^&gt; . .

2^/\LQvited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with

otfe^bfoHeagues concerned, to seek strenuously to find

a waWp  ^ nab ling employed solicitors to undertake

conveyancing, which would avoid problems of conflict of

intereVt, which he could conscientiously recommend to his

colleagues, and which would enable the Government to honour

the undertakings given by the Prime Minister and the Solicitor

General in kJvT~Mtouse of Commons and to Mr Austin Mitchell MP.

2* THE FOREIGN AND CO^kjtfwiALTH SECRETARY said that there had been no further substantive devela  &gt;$ents in relations between the United Kingdom and Nigeria. Difficulties iraJcjuiued over securing consular access to the two employees of BristoV^keMcopters Limited who were under detention in Lagos and in sedsE^rdX improvements to the conditions in which they were held. Their ewf^l trial, of which the outcome was unpredictable, could have an impih^^&amp;int impact on bilateral relations with Nigeria. The Foreign and ConuhOT&gt;Skalth Secretary said that he hoped that the joint assessment, which hejjjro^he Home Secretary were conducting, of the available opt ion^^Ltj5&gt; regard to the future status of *-he exiled former Nigerian Minister f tfP^rftjisport, Mr Umaru Dikko, would completed before the trial took plaC^y^i^ce the denial of asylum to Mr Dikko, should the Home Secretary decia^dh this, would be helpful to fhe outcome.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatNikires&apos;had been a substantial and continuing flare-up of hostilities (vejMBan Iran and fraq: air raids, artillery bombardment and missile atr^yks had been carried out by each country against the other, and a rewdjjKair raid on Tehran had inflicted about 500 casualties. In the lan(r^a^^e, there had been some indication of a further use of chemical weapora^by the fcaqis but this was not yet confirmed. &apos;There had been no vjjrfxfniis of casualties among the British communities in Iran or Iraq. TJaa/lJirited kingdom Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Sir JoKn\^\&gt; Thomson, was being instructed to encourage the Secretary-Gener^lodOthe


   nited Nations to use a meeting of the Security Council that day, which was due to discuss the treatment of prisoners of war in the Iran/lraq I conflict, as an occasion for renewing his appeal to both countries to stain from attacks on civilian targets.

^^^PIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the pattern of revslL^ion and counter-retaliation by the withdrawing Israeli forces

SrouPs South Lebanon was continuing. In a debate in the niteyh^&amp;tJ^ns Security Council a draft resolution tabled by the LebanefyA^  aa sought to ascribe to Israel all responsibility for the eterioMting situation and had contained no reference to the role of the Unitea Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. In view of the lack of alance in the draft, the United Kingdom, in company with Denmark and ustralia, had ajzatained; and the United States had exercised its veto, urther bloodsh^fTyn South Lebanon could be expected and the threat to   th United Ki^^oij(L-and United States interests in Beirut, including the two Embassies, ha/y&apos;Ttrareased: existing advice to British citizens not to remain in the Lebsm^t^rss being maintained and would be renewed. Helicopters at the	gn Base Areas in Cyprus were standing by to

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECREH^J^sa id that the Chief Minister of e Turks and Caicos Islands, Mr Nftfrmajv&apos;Saunders, and his associates,

0 were being detained in Miami on&lt;o  aj5^s of complicity in drug mafficking, were due to appear beforey^Gp^nd Jury that day. Their ^inisterial colleagues in the Turks anSo^fcos Islands were endeavouring 0 carry on the Government, and the Acting Chief Minister, Mr Nathaniel j ancisj was thought to have advised Mr Saunders to resign voluntarily   m his post. It seemed unlikely that Mr Saunders would adopt this   urse; but his continued absence from meetings^ei the Executive Council Quid result in his disqualification from rema/uiTnB in office. There a been some individual threats against the GG^Y^prois. of the Turks and aicos Islands, Mr Chrisopher Turner, but the Me bi/op&lt;^M t an Police ^pecial Branch advisers who were now there believH^^^t the security atuation was under control. The Foreign and Commo&lt;JWa^n^h Secretary aid that he would ascertain whether there was any fcmw^^Lon for newspaper reports of a broadcast by the Governor in	had been

uSgested that Mr Saunders need not resign.


   

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that members of the Cabinet would have learned with sadness that the Prime Minister of Barbados, Mr Tom Adams, had died on 11 March. He had been succeeded by the Deputy ^Prime Minister, the Hon. Bernard St John. Her Majesty the Queen would &apos;yf represented at Mr Adams&apos;s funeral on 16 March by His Royal Highness Duke of Kent, and Baroness Young would represent Her Majesty&apos;s    ^S^jrnment. Mr Adams had been a staunch figure in the Eastern Caribbean and his death was a severe loss.

THE FOKgnSS^AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the arms control negotiatiWa/^etween the United States and the Soviet Union had opened, as plannedi^in Geneva on 12 March. It was too early to comment on their substance: wieir initial phase would be devoted to setting out the Positions of both sides. It was clear that a long haul was in prospect but the resumption of dialogue was welcome.

The United Kingdom had been ren^^eHted by the Minister for Overseas Development, Mr Timothy RairofOyho had informed the Conference of the British Government&apos;s provisioiC&amp;&amp;f90 million of emergency aid to Africa fa 1984/85 and its commitment ^f\JjiX&gt;vide at least a further   60 million in the following year. Mr RaisWp^tf/account of the extent of voluntary fund-raising activity in the UniceftK^wftgdom, which had been second to n  ne, had been well received by thVj^p^rence.

THE prime MINISTER said that she had attended the funeral, on 13 March in Moscow, of the late President of the Union of/f^S^iet Socialist Republics and General Secretary of the Communist/^a^y of the Soviet Union, Mr Konstantin Chernenko. She had, duringNJ}^  ^4&gt;iNief visit to Moscow, had a discussion which had lasted for nearl^JW^our, considerably longer than scheduled, with the new Geite^i^Secretary, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev. It had been clear that.Mr GorbacheVvery much enjoyed his visit to the United Kingdom in December ana^^^^he was conscious of the extensive international publicity which tPfW^vent had Brought him. The atmosphere of their discussion had been &lt;^^rfk\and easy, its substance had concentrated on two themes: the ne\^d_^  /jj^ improved political dialogue and the arms control negotiations^M^^en fhe Soviet Union and the United States which had just opened nkuWfeva. 0n bilateral relations with the United Kingdom, Mr Gorbachev had/W/^ indicated his appreciation of the style of the exchanges which haQ^a^P


   Place during his visit and his wish to continue them as well as to develop the commercial, cultural and scientific dimensions of the v relationship. Mr Gorbachev had agreed with the Prime Minister that the &apos;^Tenth Anniversary of the signature of the Final Act of the Conference on ^^ecurity and Co-operation in Europe offered an occasion for the renewal commitment to political dialogue; and had indicated that the Soviet ^S^ign Minister, Mr Gromyko, would probably visit the United Kingdom in &lt;*WN&amp;ourse. On arms control, Mr Gorbachev now realised that the four which she had agreed with President Reagan at their meeting at CsCHfo^sjyid on 22 December 1984 embodied the first clear acknowledgement by (irfc^ited States that any deployment of defensive weapons systems in sPace&lt;^tf  &apos;^be preceded by negotiation. The Soviet leadership was clearl^jjx^pghensive, nevertheless, of the implications of the United States rSaSrtS&amp;tch programme resulting from President Reagan&apos;s Strategic Defence Irf^^r^ive and very conscious of the speed and effectiveness with which^fiis programme might be conducted; the Soviet Union consequently^hankered after some agreement by which the research effort could be constrained. She had emphasised the unrealistic nature of this objective in view gj^the fact that the application of contraints on research could nojf/t5enver if ied.

Although it had beet//cTeir from Mr Gorbachev&apos;s remarks that the Soviet leadership would likb^  &gt;9fee the arms control negotiations in Geneva succeed, it was also e&lt;  f/Cwl   that the Russians continued to mistrust the Americans and suspect ttyw^a^seeking a degree of military superiority which would enable them tMwnfot a successful strategic first strike against the Soviet Union, ijra^^oneluded from this that the first Priority should be to bring ^oyp a resumption of dialogue between the Soviet Union and the United S&gt;    e^it was not clear whether President Reagan had extended a specif ic^  xwPx$al Mr Gorbachev for a summit raeeting. She thought that Mr Gd^bjirf/w now recognised that he could not expect to succeed in driving a wed^e^oftween the United Kingdom and the Duited States, although he was aware&quot;ar  ^he significant influence which the United Kingdom still commanded inW^ftington. Although Mr Gorbachev, as the first General Sec5^rg*&gt; to have a university education, represented a new kind of Sov&amp;^t^eader and evidently gave a high priority to economic reform, his casern: mind remained rigidly Communist and he was incapable of thinking\^.n other than Marxist/Leninist categories. He faced the classic and fundamental Communist dilemma of having to increase the scope for local and individual initiative in order to improve economi   ^hsults but, at the Same time, of being unable to tolerate any devia^^nVfrom ideological orthodoxy or from centralised discipline.	uj)

in discussion, the importance was recognised of contigjw/g^to give due emphasis to the Soviet Union&apos;s own research effort in tfrt^rteld of offensive and defensive weapons in space. It might be ng/^iuary to damp down unrealistically high expectations, which the Western rww&amp;were over-inclined to encourage, of the significance of a new stvpjrti the Soviet leadership; and to put this into perspective, againsK^j&amp;/\ background that the nature of the leadership remained essentia^^che Same. a more personable and more competent leadership in Mosc^X^s/ not


   without its dangers for the West, particularly if the Soviet Union Played its hand in the Geneva negotiations more skilfully than in the Past. it was noted that the new leadership&apos;s approach to human rights issues, particularly in the context of the Tenth Anniversary of the ^velsinki Final Act, would be an important gauge of the extent to which VN^s character had or had not changed.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thd^^^Counci 1 of misters (Environment) on 7-8 March had not reached(^cwfclusion on Vehicle emissions. The Federal Republic,of Germany hifa&apos;QeJpAsed to make anY move, and considerable difficulties, particularly onsjpt&apos;&amp;Smi cars, remained. There would be a further Council meeting on 20p&gt;lanyh. If aSreement could not then be reached on satisfactory terms^vX^^uestion w  uld no doubt be submitted to the European Council. In th^^&apos;X&apos;^ negotiations so far on vehicle emissions the Commissioner wir^&gt;kw


   Responsibilities for the Environment, Mr Clinton Davis, had not been helpful. Furthermore, the Commission&apos;s indication of its future I Programme on other environmental issues seemed likely to introduce new ^S^oblems and difficulties. In discussion it was pointed out that, if no \a$reement were reached on vehicle emissions, there would be a confused JjirPuation and the Germans would probably go ahead with even tougher emission controls. On the other hand, the prospects of an ^*^pvent within the Community which was actually to the United

advantage were also poor. It was also suggested that there w  uladvantage in co-ordination with the French, who were also   PP&lt;^  t3r^ the extreme German position; and, in view of the Commission&apos;s attituXK/V^far} ft might be helpful if the Foreign and Commonwealth Secreta&apos;p^/were to speak to the President of the Commission, Monsieur

CHANCELL0R\l2gJpffiv EXCHEQUER reported that the Council of Ministers finance) on 11 Marcj)Jhad reached agreement on an opinion on the financial provisthe agricultural structure measures for 1985-89. The ceiling of 5.25&lt;^tslLn^on ecu was well below the Commission&apos;s original Proposal. This was tyj^&amp;Nrst time that such an opinion had been given to the Agriculture Coiim?&apos;^iMui implementation of the arrangements on financial discipline s temn  Mj!\ f rom the Fontainebleau European Council, ft was, therefore, an imp^^ffa^n: step forward. The related question of integrated Mediterranean pcrr^romes remained to be dealt with, probably In the European Council.

THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE,	AND FOOD said that the Council of

Ministers (Agriculture) on 11-12^&gt;far$&gt;l\had held a general discussion on t&apos;le Commission&apos;s proposals for agr^efiMJiral support prices for 1985-86. ft was apparent that there would be J?  ffious difficulties with the Germans, who intended to seek price^rfScfe^ses above the level proposed y the Commission. The Council had reVm?^ agreement, however, on the whole package of agricultural strueturek  reasures. This included the Provision on agriculture and the environment for which the United Kingdom had campaigned. The estimated cost of the whole package c  nformed with the figure decided by the Finance Council. Some of the pavings might be open to question but it was noijSbheless a decision of 1 importance for financial discipline. He had r/asi^j)ed strong pressure to agree on a package of which the estimated costNiWj3&gt;have slightly e*ceeded the figure set by the Finance Council, flnillie end the residency had abandoned any attempt to exceed thV-  r  ure and a atisfactory settlement had been reached. There wouM&apos;cy A$2doubt be j   l-milar difficulties in the future if and when the fxj^ne^il guidelines . an effect on agricultural decisions, and the UnitetMOuJcflom might Xr*d itself isolated. In discussion it was said that	on


   agricultural structures was to be welcomed, both because of the assertion of the principle of financial discipline and because the environmental initiative had been achieved.

4. Thg^abinet1 s attention was drawn to the serious outbreak of footbaK^-ttS^liganism at a match between Luton Town and Millwall on 13

March.

the SECRETLY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that a considerable number of serious charges had been brought following this event. He welcomed the fact that the Home Secretary would be making a statement shortly, encourag/    i\&apos;magistrates to make full use of their powers to Heal with offencI^_ov this kind. Representatives of the Football Association and thsVfSS^all League were coming in to see the Parliamentary Underl^fi^j^tary of State, Department of the Environment (Minister for Sport) th^f/a^ternoon. An interdepartmental working party had been set up to conslo^^Xhe problems presented by football hooligan:ism&gt; It had pre^rrceii a report, which had been issued with a consultation document. A fu^per report would be available in a few weeks, following those con&amp;ttJtayi.ons. In his view, there was no need for legislation creating newyS&apos;Qi^lVces; and the Football Association and Football League had considerah&lt;fewi$i)wers to take action, if they would only make use of them.

Fu discussion, it was noted that tfc^\w^blera was confined mainly to a very few clubs. Any action that ne&lt;$4d)fcp be taken should so far as possible avoid damage to those clubs ^^^^d-\Supporters created no Problems. In Scotland the passage of &apos;?  ^dlation banning the sale of alcoholic drinks had had a material effe  *V&gt;fi hooliganism. But drink was not the only problem: there was evid^trce that the hooliganism was   ften deliberate and premeditated.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said^that the Cabinet agreed, in the light of recent events, that it \/ksiy&gt;t enough simply to condemn football hooliganism: more effective acr&apos;^Z^P^ded to be taken to deal with it. When the Parliamentary Under Secrfet^rWof State, Department of the Environment (Minister for Sport)Vaj^ne representatives of the Football Association and FoottWyjM^igue, he should urge them to take effective action, and to make\^x^f^jjse of their Powers as necessary in order to do so. They should be SsK^d^o report within a week what action they proposed; to take, and coul^^M/vold that fcHe Minister for Sport would be reporting direct to the Pr^^Xip^ster and to the Home Secretary as well as to the Secretary of Stat^^M^the Environment. If the Football Association and the Football Leaguv^puld n  t or would not take effective action, the Government might consider legislation; but there was no reason to suppose that the^/^Y


   existing range of offences was not sufficient to deal with the problem, if suitable charges were brought.

The Cabinet -

l

1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s wA*summing up.

Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment tp^arrange for the Parliamentary Under Secretary of

Department of the Environment (Minister for Sport) guided by the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up at his with the representatives of the Football Association and the Football League that afternoon.

3. Took note that the Prime Minister would convene a meeting of Ministers directly concerned, to consider the respoH^tT^f the Football Association and the Football I^agMSL to the proposed requests for a report on the ac t nfiy&apos;SFhuich they proposed to take.
