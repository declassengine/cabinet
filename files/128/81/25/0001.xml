TliE LORD PRESIDENT{OFU&apos;HE COUNCIL said that it was most important that Presentation of Gov?y^fl?t^t policy should not go by default during ugust. Each DepartnrejjJrAbould ensure that a duty Minister was available close to Loii3^wflL all times, ready to appear on radio and Revision as necessary.//j^yas important to ensure that reactions to ^ritical or adverse comme^^Jol^Government policies were rapid and that misters were prepared, to sae^. about all aspects of Government policy and not only those related ^^Wir own Departmental responsibilities.

THE PRIME minister, summing up	discussion, said that rapid

  sponse to criticism of Governtf^p^^licy was most important, and misters in charge of Department^/^ejMd implement the arrangements Proposed by the Lord President of tfc^CAW&apos;cil immediately. Press reactions to the recent statements b^tlie^linister without Portfolio on ^regulation and the Secretary of Stata^  %^Employment on Wages Councils    owed how well the media could respondcSx^zrie correct approach.

p   . THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that a letter to the rime Minister from the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Moderator of the ree Church Federal Council and the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster, received that morning, had urged that Hercules aircraft of the Royal Air ^Prces, presently engaged in transporting food supplies for famine /^Jrle^ in Ethiopia, should remain available for this purpose after the September. The Ethiopian authorities had more than enough road uwves for distribution of food supplies. The Hercules aircraft had ^PJKl^ovided temporarily, while road transport was organised and for 10 T ^vv  n t*16 ra^ny season. The Government had announced on the aircraft would remain available until the end of P	The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office and

n^Ste^3^\0verseas Development was currently in Ethiopia. He was Urging t^^^fthorities to transfer sufficient vehicles to famine relief, ar&gt;d he	in a position to assess whether the aircraft would

eally be ridded beyond September.

*n discussion, the following points were made -

a&gt; All the/vfaaYiical arguments, notably the relative cheapness of using vehicl&lt;k*  -  py-&gt;their availability in Ethiopia in sufficient numbers, were i^/rawour of withdrawing the Hercules aircraft.

b* There would	t&amp;rous criticism, however unjustified, if

the aircraft were w^#!xfo^wn and the distribution of food suffered as a result.

c&gt; It was for conside^rfxi  n whether the Hercules aircraft should t&gt;e diverted to Western S  2^^\7here the need for distributing food aid was now perhaps great^^ajjm. in Ethiopia.

d* The United Kingdom, in adflH^kbn to providing the Hercules aircraft, had given money for Vhcj/p^j-chase of trucks for famine relief in Ethiopia.

e* It would be worth the Governme?&gt;iyt^lking to Mr Bob Geldof, who had organised the &quot;Live Aid&quot; concert^^n 13 July to raise funds for famine relief, to establish whether nh^p was needed in distribution   f the aid.

f:	The Soviet Union was providing much mili&lt;2^v and little famine

aid to Ethiopia. In recent months, India,	^/ample, had

Supplied ten times as much food aid as the Sbi  y  fc   &gt;tJnion.

NE Prime MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said nT^^he decision on c er to continue to provide the Hercules aircraft wm/iro/^&apos;equire very qov Preparation, if it was not to be misunderstood aJX^^Tb^expose the a  t^rnment to strong criticism. A decision should not be UjWtfLuntil r r t*le Minister for Overseas Development had returned Was rt6C* on visit to Ethiopia. The provisional view of N^hja/^abinet that it might be very difficult to withdraw the Hercules aircC^t at


   the end of September. Meanwhile, efforts should be made to bring home to the public the extent of all types of British Government aid for famine relief. A full and firm reply to the Church leaders&apos; letter ^should be quickly prepared.

The Cabinet -

&lt;^x\V\^l. Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary arranSe for the preparation of a draft reply from &lt;^//JPrime Minister to the Church leaders, on the lines (x*   $\ated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.

Belgium

THE FOREIGTTaND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the next general Section in Ntelgium had been brought forward from December to October 1985. This was an indirect consequence of the football tragedy in Brussels on 29 May. The Francophone Christian Democratic Minister of the Interior, Mon  &lt;eTr^ Charles-Ferdinand Nothomb, had been criticised in fhe Parliamentary\Y^qJp-0 conducted in Belgium into the tragedy. This had provide the opp/  rt7irtity for the Francophone Liberal Deputy Prime Minister, Monsieur	, to pursue his long-standing campaign

against Monsieur No thoigf^i^^t temp ting to resign in protest at the latter&apos;s refusal to do s/&apos;X^he Prime Minister, Monsieur Wilfried Martens, had offered theCtf^&amp;ion Government&apos;s resignation, but this had been refused by King Baudwi&gt;o. There was bound to be a feeling in Belgium that the troubles o^wienpovernment had been caused in signif iCant part by the footpy^v^Xagedv. and a risk that this might affect the standing in Belgium^rf&amp;^ United Kingdom. The forthcoming general election was not likely^Q/^yycrease the stability of government ln Belgium.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY s^K&amp;at President Reagan was ound to take some time to recover fully brc&gt;m the major operation for cancer which he had undergone on 13 July. He was expected to return to Work within about 10 days, but his convalescence would in practice continue through the summer break. His ability to^articipate in the ^ ecis ion-making of the Administration would inev^rab]^ be reduced during that period. Despite the presence of an experierKsd^J-^am of advisers in e White House, there might be a certain slowness ran J/yking decisions, ^here were, however, good grounds for hoping that Pre-M*fept Reagan would e working normally by the end of the summer break. ^

HE HOME SECRETARY said that he would shortly be signing an eX^at&amp;tion /eaty with Spain which would fill a notable gap in the UnitecKviJ^pm&apos; s international arrangements for extradition. The treaty would

   ^VN^ECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that intensive discussions were ^V^&amp;^ding, in a very fluid situation, to see whether agreement could be Procee  l with joint production of a European Fighter Aircraft lEF^/y^kthe five countries hitherto involved or by these without Eran&apos;^&apos;e^^&apos;^j.s present judgment was that the project for an EFA was still aHVe i af/Jbast as regards the four countries other than France. The latest	by the industries concerned in the five countries revealed

*-he familMV^jJ^vision between France and the others about the specificatSwfjr^for the aircraft. He was adhering to the British position and the cou^ries involved other than France were advocating an aircraft broadly in line with this. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany were showing signs of departing marginally from the agreed sPecification and	making further efforts to find a basis for

sgreement between(thelyfive powers, or at least between the four powers. The Secretary of StS^^jbr Defence said that he would consult colleagues again if there was aC(o^j22j&gt;ion of arrangements for the Project Definition   f the aircraft whicna^^mot meet the requirements laid down by Ministers at the meeting/ij^bhe Defence and Oversea Policy Committee on 7 May 1985 (OD(85) 5th	.

In a short discussion, it wSj^rtStted that France was still trying to .lay the Project DefinitionW^^for the EFA, so as to make progress Wlth their own design for a fuLrfj^^ighter aircraft. This was an argument for trying to proceed	to Project Definition for an EFA.

11 this was achieved, France wouKr&apos;^^^V^ubt continue to try to secure changes to enable them to join in. (

j?* THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said b^TT^it the meeting of ommunity and other Western European countries iA^af4^. on 17 July there ad been strong support for the United Kingdom view//fha)d increased 0 operation in high technology under the EUREKA laol^^^h^uld be market-led and market-based. The French President, MsfrWs^r Mitterrand, a ar&gt;nounced further support from French public funds	jects.

e majority of participating countries, however, did noV&apos;^jt/Jhe Emphasis on public spending but on the development and expLd&amp;j&amp;ion of p e Products of high technology in a sufficiently large and^^enlmarket. 0r this reason the United Kingdom&apos;s suggestion, known as EuYeW(  \for 0iae guarantee of access to markets for the products of such

laboration had also been well received. The majority of	X/7//O


   Participating countries had also been- in favour of carrying forward the consideration of the EUREKA programme by setting up a high level group.

In discussion it was said that the strategy of the French Government ^ould no doubt be to direct the EUREKA programme into those areas where /^Kench companies could take the lead in bilateral or multilateral v-SvjiUpings, such as the recently announced collaboration between French j^Jj^Tw^rwegian industrial interests. It was important that this should &gt; that there should be co-ordination of action in the civil tary fields, particularly since the United Kingdom had a key r  l^P&lt;fj^o-ordinated defence procurement; and that British companies shoulA^&gt;&lt;f^&gt;ncouragecj to play a major part. To some extent the French could&apos;Wallowing an approach similar to that of the Japanese, which W3S to	a dominant position in certain sectors before moving to

a more	stance on these products. In reply it was said that

there was V^eneral recognition among the participating countries that Western Eurd^e was already spending heavily on basic research in high technology. The main problem was the continued fragmentation of European industry and of the European market. There was, therefore, pressure for greab^r^vo-operation between commercial companies in development of prb(jucreand corresponding action to open up markets. It had been made quite^y^^lh that United Kingdom companies were interested, and at least one col\^bSa&lt;ion - that of the General Electric Company of the United Kingdom, Th^^n^of France, Siemens of the Federal Republic of Germany and Phillips	Netherlands - had very recently been

announced.

THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FI^^^S AND FOOD said that at the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on	there had been no change in

Positions on the 1.8 per cent cut ia^c^Val support prices. The ommission, which would be managing $re^^reals market on the basis of t is price reduction, had announced so^J^^tber related measures including the possibility of some intet&apos;^jtolon for breadmaking wheat at the end of the season. The Commissioner ^k^ndriessen, had given assurances that these arrangements would ^^budgetarily neutral in 1985.

n the autumn there would be further proposals from the Commission for amendment of the cereal support regime, probably in line with the ideas recently set out in the Commission&apos;s document on tj*a. development of the C  mmon agricultural policy more generally. Sinc^Vt^  ^ Commission was stressing the need for price restraint, it seemeoi^i&gt;^Y that any new Proposals on the cereals regime would lead once agaam a deadlock stmilar to that which existed now. On health stand^^K$&gt;r pasteurised milk the Council of Ministers had reached a very sati^faw^y agreement ?n directive. This would probably lead to the with\U^X^^. of infraction proceedings by the Commission against the UnireawlQppgdom.

n er the arrangement now agreed there would be free trade^WK/v^ Pasteurised milk within the Community from 1 January 1989 b(^^MUnited lngdom would be able to enforce its own higher standards whrci^wbJ-d ma^e imports difficult. The agreement had been well received Producers and the milk industry.

SAURIES

SgB0M

Y^NVpthe Cabinet considered a Note by the Secretary of the Cabinet

) about the recommendations of Report No 22 of the Top Salaries Rev^^Wy (TSRB).

^HE PMm^&gt;lNlSTER said that in making their recommendations the Review Body ha&lt;j/s^g&amp;ht not simply to update salary rates by reference to developmhTiW^sjnce their last report the previous year, but to conduct a comprehen^y^review, including not only a major re-examination of salaries at&apos;Osenior levels in the Civil Service, the armed forces and in fche judiciary but also a review of the underlying pay structure in the senior Civil Service and an extensive study of the judicial salary structure. in their^recommendations on senior civil servants, the Review Body had t/^en^Lnto consideration evidence on recruitment, retention, motivar^3o&lt;S&amp;d morale, and rewards available for people in jobs of comparable responsibility in other walks of life. They had also taken into account tm?^mw5)rtance of being able to offer a reasonable career structure, in	salary, in order to attract and retain

People of the right qualV^^^fill the top posts in the public service.

They had accordingly recomm^^i^k^vchanges in the salary structure for senior civil servants with	introducing into the pay

arrangements at these levels Vrt^ker degree of flexibility to take account of differences of perfand of job weight. In particular they had recommended a substantiajJ^^gjee of salary differentiation in rade 1 (Permanent Secretaries) by^Je^e^ence to broad considerations of Job weight; and the introduction of ijjJrtVnental scales, including some ,^Screhi  nary increments for high performance, for Grades 2 and 3

ePoty and Under Secretaries and equiv^l^r^s). They had taken similar considerations into account in arriving i^t/j^piommendations for senior members of the armed forces and the judic^rcy, with broadly similar esults. Although the recommendations wouW entail substantial lncreases of remuneration at the top levels, those levels would still be below the salary levels of people at comparable levels and with r  adly comparable responsibilities in the privajf^r^ptor.

inisters directly concerned had met under her chai/vffSra^hip to consider ^hese proposals. They considered that the Review B^d^^Yecommendations   . as to salary structures and salary levels should^ra^e^epted in Principle, but that their implementation should be stagpj^^^as to contain the amount of the increases in 1985-86 to broadas e amounts of the increases already agreed for lower gradaa^^Td ranks ln the Civil Service and the regular armed services (4.9 arfa/74^.) per cent respectively). They also considered that it would be pxE^^ble to ^omplete the implementation by stages within the current finam^^i^M^ar. w  uld be possible to spread it over two years, or even more;\fc&gt;ra/any


   \k Creases Paid after 1 April 1986 would themselves have to be dynamised ^&apos;Min^n^ ^urt^er increases the Review Body might then recommend. The

isters concerned therefore proposed that the increases recommended by nview Body should be implemented in two stages, the first payable wJuly 1985, the second from 1 March 1986. They had considered options for distributing the implementation as between the two were set out in paragraph 14 of C(85) 19. An important su  i&lt;^vat:i0n cboosing between these options was the effect upon 28T2^ati0n entitlements   f those retiring between 1 July 1985 and gove&apos;nmf 1986. Annex C of the Note by the Secretary of the Cabinet which&apos;^u/j&apos;&apos;&apos;^!*&quot;^6 examples of the effect on superannuation entitlements, of th	particularly large for officers at the most senior level

prev.e	services. The Government had taken and announced the

Ca-US ^ar the firm decision that superannuation benefits should be rej.. ated on the basis of salaries actually in payment before occas&lt;7ment   	the Government were to depart from this decision on this

iscussion, the following main points were made

?q Senior Service officers and others retiringMra^we^jn 1 July

and 28 February 1986 would still benefit from sm&gt;^  antial lump Sum and pension increases and, in relevant cases, f	November

^Prating of public service pensions. Any concession^^eK^as eeming the proposed salary increases to have come intop/faf^qnal ect from an earlier date for superannuation purposes jvAwwrKl


   create the most serious problems with nurses and other categories already similarly affected, and it would be wrong to make any exception.

\ b. Although the Review Body&apos;s recommendations were based on j\ considerations of recruitment, retention, morale and motivation, and not on the concept of comparability, it was right to bear in /NA/\jnind the rewards available to people in jobs of comparable \\^fesponsibility outside the public service. Unless the public ^/^fcyice offered the prospect of a career structure with a

0^e^*^nable salary it would be even more difficult than at present tj^^rep^ruit and retain people of the right quality to fill the top

c.	(Wj^ormplications of the proposed increases, and the justification for them, would need to be borne in mind in relation to Boartf members of the nationalised industries, whose differentials were small or non-existent, and teachers, where the National Unionjaf Teachers had opposed any increase in

differential9&lt;/f5y\ heads and deputies and teachers in science and mathematics.

d.	Although iccg^^Veasonable to retain the principle of payment

Review Body&apos;s proposal f^^&lt;^N.ntermediate higher salary for the Permanent Secretaries of t^p^Mtistry of Defence, Home Office and Department of Health and So&amp;j^^Becur ity. Neither considerations of management responsibility	other pressures seemed to

warrant this. The creation oiVsu^J^m intermediate grade might also impede future transfers beMre^H^ermanent Secretaries, although it would be possible to &lt;(^jjjC&amp;in existing salaries on a personal basis. If this proposal w&amp;S^^ejected, the salary of the Comptroller and Auditor General shoif&amp;^Qso remain linked to that of ordinary Permanent Secretaries.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet approved the proposals set out in C(85) 19, subjea^anly to rejection of the Review Body&apos;s recommendation for salary diff&lt;/^n^.ation for the Permanent Secretaries of the Ministry of De fencefice and Department of Health and Social Security.

1. Approved the proposals in C(85) 19, subject to rejection of the Review Body&apos;s recommendation for salary differentiation for the Permanent Secretaries of the Ministry of Defence, Home Office and ^Department of Health and Social Security.

Agreed (subject to the view of the Public /A^^unts Commission) that the salary of the &apos;   &apos;   topm^xo 11 er and Auditor General should be linked of ordinary Permanent Secretaries.
