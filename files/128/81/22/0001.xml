2- THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that Lambeth Borough Council were expected to try to make a rate on Wednesoay 3 July. He understood that opponents of the rate capping legislation would attempt to prevent this by disrupting the Council meeting, if necessary with ^Violence. The police would not be able to intervene unless the person    pairing the meeting called them in. In similar circumstances in other controlled authorities, Mayors had shown considerable reluctance the police to restore order. Although the Otticial Opposition that they could not condone illegal action, they had not Uly condemned the actions of those local authorities and who were refusing to obey the law.

THE StCM^pXry OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that he had imposed a rate thdUCt^N^^&gt; Edin&apos;--r8h District Council but there was every sign that th Coui^A/Vj  &gt;uld refuse to recognise the instruction. Grants would erefore	withheld and it seemed likely that the Council would run

  ut of mon^ to pay their staff by October. If this happened, it might oome necessary to consider the appointment of Commissioners.

^ PRIME MINISTER  ?^s\jtnming up a brief discussion, said that any form of Government. ^intervention, such as Commiss ior.ers , should be regarded as a laPr^FteVort to &apos;be adopted only if the breakdown of essential services	yed	to be imminent. It would be wrong to

sea THE SECRETarT OF STATE FOR N0l  7^^&gt; IRELAND said that the marching 0tl	Northern Ireland was nov(^5&gt;&amp;  ^.nning and would last until

Most of the events we^^^^^alist ones, but a few were pgQ1?03^ls*        As was normal for the tidtOyt year, the temperature among oeen 6- COncerned with politics in Northe&amp;   Ireland was rising. This had DeiI) ^lustrated by his meetings on 20 June with tr.e leader of the UlstCratlC Unionis: Party (DUP), Mr Ian Paisley, and the leader of the the 6r Unionist ?=-ty, Mr James Molyneaux. The i^^al position regarding Irei marcHes was that it was for the Secretarf(^o$ State for Northern of tt^ Himself to decide on any bans of marche^y^^sNyne recommendation of i Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Const^fou^Y     The question res a faring the routes of marches, without baftx&amp;yp] Xhem, was the thesenSlbility   f the chief Constable. In recent KfS&amp;X&apos;ne nature of (jec^6 events had deteriorated:	the element of enjoyirr^^^radition nad

0  j.elned. and the element of violence and hooliganism	increased,

   anned this	march	three weeks	previously. The organisers had then

Port^ t0	^	on	27 June	and he had	now banned it again.	In

\v ^ 0WT1   . three Loyalist parades were planned in the following three e s, which would go through the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic area &gt;  own as the &quot;Tunnel&quot;. One of the marches was planned to go through the /Ny&gt;nel four times	in	a single day - a case	of blatant provocation.	In

v^JJ^Pase of	Portadown	there was	no question	of banning the marches,	but

Constable would have to decide whether to negotiate or, if impose a change in the route to reduce the likelihood of Nat i(/rw?Vv. V10^ence    	The last event in the marching season would be a

Qai	Procession to mark the anniversary of internment. Mr Martin

(NORa t	Northern Aid Committee in the United States

to ^	raanaged to be present at this event in 1984, might try

ai	*ssue of aviation security, it appeared that the Air India

IrelaSvT^ wb*cb had crashed into the Atlantic off the south coast of at T	^3 June and the explosion on the same day at Narita airport

of	have been caused by Sikh extremists. The whole subject

avia6l0^security required new attention. At United States, Canadian ana Rt-j	   	.	*	,	r .

insistence, a meeting of the terrorism experts of the seven

lik111^*&quot; countries had been brought forward to July. There was also

^ to he discussion of terrorism against aircraft during the

ropean Council  qeting in Milan on 28 and 29 June. The subject would

aY a central /yt5Ta\ in the talks when Vice President Bush of the United

btates visited l^djkon 3 July.

following poin&apos;IyS-^^t&apos;V noted in discussion -

There was s/mAo forensic evidence to show conclusively that fhe Air India disa^  wv  ad been caused by a bomb.

_	The Interna	Civil Aviation Organisation, which was

    eting in Montreal,&apos;^wfV^nsidering airport security; the United lngdom was represented ^f^wijisterial level.

The Greek Governme^^/^spite earlier resistance, had now agreed under United States /p^e&amp;uire to bring forward a review of security at Athens airport, anrf/^delegation from the International lr Transport Authority was on^^^pot.

The British Government we^^VaJ^o in touch with the United ates about encouraging othei&gt;v^&lt;Suntr ies to improve airport -security. There was an importantNMifference between the measures needed against hijacking and those needed against bombs on rrcraft. The prevention of hijacking required surveillance of Passengers. The prevention of bombing reap-is^ed surveillance of all aggage and cargo on aircraft. This was/aBarge task: a selective aPproach, concentrating on the airlines Imports thought to be m0st a*- risk, might be desirable but would p/^s^emjt difficulties.

6    N   precautions against aircraft terror^^S^ejpuld be totally 6 lable- That having been said the British pe^  #ra^nce on airport ecurity could be robustly defended, for instatfjei^i^. response to questions in Parliament; it was very good. NonetheJ^*p*. action was hand to consider any possible improvements, and	all the

c^  Ce ures to make sure that they were fully impleme^v^  ^y^\lt would th6ar^ contrary to the public interest to reveal ^a^Mcly all t^e measures that were being taken. Stories of journal^JV^alking rough the controls at British airports and reaching	had

een checked and were untrue.	&apos;/K


   f*	The British Broadcasting Corporation had broadcast an

interview that morning with an American citizen who had admitted that his organisation in the United States had trained Sikhs among others in certain techniques of violence. It would be interesting to discover whether Irish terrorists could have received training ) from organisations such as this.

Minister, summing up the discussion said that it would be to follow up all these matters with urgency.

^escribe the package of measur^Sy^iounced in Tokyo on 25 June. This red100- ?rogramme included tarift/W^^ctions on 1,800 items; but the EurUCt^DnS Were small and most of ^frtfe^istems were of no interest to the inr  pean Community. in the impq  *1upk case of confectionery, for j ance&gt; there was no change in the	f but only an undertaking of

   \ t^ea sbort discussion it was noted that the Commission had asked whether 6 United Kingdom would support strong anti-dumping action by the /^p^Promunity against Japan. They had been told that we would do so, where was justified. The changes on tobacco in the Japanese Action am&apos;1&apos;6 c  uld be helpful to British exports.
