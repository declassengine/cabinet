^prt\gECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that he was concerned about the N\\*  5&gt;cy   f Select Committees to appoint as advisers people with

^   publicly known and often extreme positions on subjects th&apos;^&apos;-^T^Vph they would be advising. An example had just occurred with 1 eHa  ^,^&gt;  ment as an adviser to the Environment Select Committee of a 4-jf er^^^he opponents of nuclear power at the Sizewell Inquiry, nu	Commit tee had a second adviser who was more in favour of

ear	his appointment by no means balanced the first.

ParrSCUSS^    it: was Pointed out that difficulties were arising in ad .laraen*- not only as a result of the appointment of inappropriate paVJSers to Select Committees, but also because certain Members of t^r lament (MPs) /^TttXretained to represent specific interests. They th6n 8F  Re and vo^d^n response to the views of their paymaster rather c 3n In fhe interei^^T^their constituents and the nation. This was t  ntrary to the strictof the House of Commons and went further an the expression o  &lt;^jWal views by, for example, a farmer or a c  mpany director.	(^\

Ibv   PRlME MINISTER, summing^^V brief discussion, said that there were intl0us dangers in attempt^jg/&apos;fdNalter current practice on Members&apos; 0peerests    Nevertheless the\tH^retat position was unsatisfactory and thenpto criticism and should b^^ined. The first stage would be for shoui jVernment to determine how\ij^37&gt; ought the role of MPs as lobbyists Point be constrained, given the &lt;^YjK&amp;rities, which were bound to be inc t6d   Ut    between a paid lobbyiWj^Aa MP who had a second source of be   me 3S a farmer or a member of L1&lt;^Q2&gt; for example.

I JUrks and laicos

Islands

^^REIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that a difficult situation     //v?n the Turks and Caicos Islands. This dependent territory, WUV5^j?ulation of under 8,000, was progressing towards independence 0n f^Tp^aiu model but so far had a relatively unsophisticated _

under which an elected Legislature chose a Chief Minister. ihe PreWiaCumbent of this office, Mr Norman Saunders, had been arrestedjVp^gfether with two political colleagues, by the United States rug Enforcement Administration in Miami on 5 March on charges relating 0 drug trafficking. They were due to appear before a Grand Jury in ten a?8&apos; time, and bail of $2 million was being demanded by the United ^tates authorities*:   -\This created problems for the government of the islands. The Goi/frndV took the view that government could not continue under the leaderslw^SSNa Chief Minister who was either under detention ln the United StateT(or)bwait ing trial on bail. The Governor was therefore seeking	Mr Saunders&apos;s resignation. There were some

indications that other^ni^^FS of the Administration, including the scond Minister Mr FranMS^vjight help to bring about this outcome.

If&gt; as a result * of his dlteV^n, the Chief Minister failed to attend Stings of the Legislaturd^teVcould be required to resign on this account. In the last resor^MWer, it might be necessary to empower be Governor, through an Order^O&amp;ouncil, to remove Ministers who faced ,eri  us criminal charges. Such\^M))n might be open to accusations of ^gh-handedness or of presuming^W/Uilt of the accused. The British ^overnment was in the ambiguous poM*! of being concerned, on the one t0 do everything possible to ar^f^raffic in drugs but, on the   ther   of being obliged to respond to^ffrSeals for consular protection :  r the Chief Minister and his collea^fe^hile they were in the United *tes- Such an appeal had in fact beero/pd&amp;ed, and British consular j-tticiaig were on their way to visit theWtainees. The question of -  11* and of any possible liability by th^British Government to provide lit Would take some days to resolve. If the Chief Minister were to be .ased on bail, his eventual return to the United States to stand rial would be dependent on the normal extraditL&amp;TVrocedures. In the eantime, necessary precautions for maintaining IktjWl security in the ^rks and Caicos Islands were being taken: the Roy^T^Vy&apos;s Caribbean ard ship was on station within two hours&apos; sailing^ufc^from the ^ stands; and a company of British troops in Belize wa^m^even hours tlce to move. Two officers of the Metropolitan Poli^S^pral Branch q re their way to the Islands. In Parliament, a Pri&apos;Wt^&apos;lWtice ^ estion on the episode had been disallowed on the previou  O^X^but miSht well be revived.	&lt;OL

a short discussion, it was noted that in equity a voluntar^^^X^^.   stgnation by the Chief Minister, although the best outcome t^aWfor, 0utd in theory by temporary, pending the determination of his


   innoCetlCe   r   u^t&gt; although in practice he would be obliged, if found \ cons ^nt    to regain his position afresh through the relevant ,&quot;ritUtio&quot;al Procadures. The possibility that the United States vWldritl6S ra^^lt ^a:*-l to sustain their charges against Mr Saunders

n0t excluded; but the evidence against him was strong and the money involved substantial.

The reviSe(jt^0u^&apos;lt that the Germans had accepted to go aSwiywith the latest ^eca-si  n providing new resources from 1 Januaryat the aces,,.! u*- *-he Germans had made this conditional on rat^mb^tion of the cbanges     creatles with Spain and Portugal. Such misundhrM^jjdings or some fr ln t*1e German position had become more common and ^^^vSausing it wasrKStrat:   &apos;on within the Community. In discussipn it wa^^vj^mk that 1,000 .ec  ming unrealistic to expect that the United Kingdom^xx^v, reviSe   1^&apos;^^on ecu abatement would be implemented in 1985 throu&apos;^h&apos;M^hfc c  uld h   Wn resources decision. If so, there would be criticis^^p^ph e   f political importance. It might therefore be better t^ffr^Ks


   now for the abatement to be covered in an intergovernmental agreement. mn other hand, it was argued that, although in the end the decision 8 C t0 implement the United Kingdom&apos;s abatement in 1985 through an   *8  vernmental agreement, this could give rise to difficulties in the TV laments of some member states. It was too soon to conclude that it not be implemented through an article in the revised own resources \\a\v^011. Both options could be kept open, at least in the next Foreign Council. It was also pointed out that the Germans were

taking the view that, because they were the largest net on	to the Community budget, they should get what they wanted

national interests; recent examples were the authorisation of Cou^  ??^^^jnents to German farmers, the dispute at the Dublin European addition of sugar to German wine and the current kU(j 1Cu^t^e^^hich Germany was making on the handling of the Community Bet ancK[Vhe increase in own resources.

b* Before anything was done to ventilate th^argVments in public, consideration should be given to how the Govern2S  w*A7ould react if the Speaker rejected a complaint of breach of pr^^L^e, and what sanctions could be imposed if a complaint were uptwVVj^ the Committee of Privileges.

At that ac   ?5 had beeriv^d&amp;ght that the former would be rather easier to Casleve than the latfprn In practice, this had not proved to be the CQSe and legislatioi^Jv^tablish the profession of licenced j^ncers was now b^f^^&gt;the House of Lords in the Administration of confi&quot;Ce Bill. On emplo^xj^klicitors, however, real difficulties of sol&apos;     C   f interest had&lt;^^r  ad which made it arguable whether employed off    CUors should be allowad^&amp;Nof fer conveyancing services. A group of dev*Clals had been asked to^rfuM the problems involved and they had min^S(;d a &quot;basic service&quot;, as^3^^ibed in Annex A of his memorandum, to adv^m^Se conilicts of interest^XxJlrU &quot;basic service&quot; would not include matt  e about the mortgage or otft^*%Anancial issues or about any other coi 6^S   n which the interests	and lender might not

a nClde* The Home and Social Aff^r^^mmittee had been unable to accee whether, on this basis, confli*^s/^f interest would be dealt with as ePtably and whether che advantages	would ensue to the consumer

reda result of adopting this course of aww would justify the risk of ConsCed c  nsumer protection. They had rfeta^nised the attractions to the servUmer   f the Building societies providing a more comprehensive than106    but a^so that the service would be significantly more limited unabithat provided by an independent solicitor. The Committee had been to be6 *&quot;   reach a final conclusion and the issue^jSk. therefore referred to Cabinet for a decision.	uf v

^scussion, the following points were made -

The work of the group of officials had estadthat such c  oflicts were more extensive than had been thougrM^wke^ the matter was first considered by the Cabinet, and the Service&quot; which they had suggested minimised but did rrefx^lykminate them.	i	\A//a


   b   Independent evidence had shown that the cost of conveyancing by sol icitors had already been reduced as a result of increased Price competition and this would be reinforced when the new profession of licenced conveyancers came into being.

. c* The &quot;basic service&quot; was limited by constraints upon the ^employed solicitor not to advise in specified areas, and whatever ^arnings to this effect he gave to the house purchaser, it seemed !i\ely that in practice many purchasers, especially first time v^^Vts, would tend to accept the services of the employed &lt;5^v4tor. The purchaser would view it as more convenient and m^^believe that it would influence his chance of securing a

He would tend to underestimate the dangers of conflict even if they had been explained to him. There must be ^oubt^that the explanation would in fact be such as to convince an untutowsd customer.

d* The arguments against the use of employed solicitors would be more impresa-do^if they did not assume that advice currently given by independent solicitors was both effective and uninfluenced by their relatio^s^fT^) with the building societies. At present, a Purchaser gpinsmall independent solicitor might find himself ^eing given adviq^^n3   f was considerably less able than that which might be given by	organisation.

e* The examples of c^^rict of interest which had been suggested as being seriously damjrfKn^\ to the use of employed solicitors would occur only in a limited\JHmp^: of transactions. It would be worth risking some diminution o^^iMumer protection at the margin in order to secure the advant&amp;  ^/:o the consumer of the use of employed solicitors.

f- Whatever the balance of advlmJ^fee between reduced consumer Protection and increased consumejJ^^t^JjPpe &gt; it was clear that any iegislation put before Parliament*^  xyld^vaeet with considerable

difficulty.	&lt;7Z&gt;

One way of avoiding conflicts of interest might be to limit bbe use of employed solicitors to those cases where the loan was awarded by another institution. This could jjtEan, for example, that tbe solicitor employed by one building soci/aty }yould be able to advise his client on all the aspects of a t*W2  Sdon, including a   an by another society, without restriction. uJE\jen_ a solicitor in this position might, however, seek to influencV-J^/client to ransfer the mortgage transaction to his employer tmpliCations of such an approach needed further in^^^^^ation.

The position would be different when the new prcCra^Jrvsn of ruenced conveyancers was established. A client mightA^^iv^nably xPsct advice on a wide range of topics from a solicitorbe would expect a licenced conveyancer to undertake conveya^ohW^ork 0nly. The use of employed licenced conveyancers would the^PfonpA^^ Ptesent different questions.


   THE priME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet did n  t accept that the proposal for employed solicitors to provide a &quot;basic service&quot; (as set out in the Annex to C(85) 6) for house-buyers was a fisfactory way of resolving the problems of conflict of interest.

, j)j remained, nonetheless, a strong body of opinion that it was

   at all possible, to find an acceptable way of enabling citors to undertake conveyancing. Further consideration en to the possibility of allowing conveyancing to be solicitors employed by institutions other than the one he loan, or to limiting the service in other ways eg to the one or to employed licenced conveyancers when these were The discussion had also revealed considerable disquiet lity of the service currently provided by independent jP in particular the ability of the Law Society to ^&apos;         PUne^embers of the profession and provide redress where iciency^or malpractice had occurred.
