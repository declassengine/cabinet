1* The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House of Commons in the following week.

   V  POOl ^ Council

A^B^SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the position on the ^0&gt;*^cial viability of the Liverpool City Council was still uncertain. ^*1w  aXtions were taking place that day between the City Council and the of Metropolitan Authorities, and Mr David Blunkett, Leader   f	field City Council, was also involved. It was possible that,

ln	of these negotiations, the City Council would be able to

Put tog^tfppf a financial package that would keep them afloat; if they failed, WfoAj^money would run out in that or the following week. He had made it pl^on on a number of recent occasions that for as long as the present situation obtained there was no more money available from the Government. One factor in the situation was an idea being canvassed by fhe Greater London Qoimcil that they might be able to transfer to Liverpool the uss&apos;vSTyteome of their unused capital allocations; the legal Position on this &gt;\-anp  -particularly the statutory position of the Secretary of State,/wa^junder urgent consideration in the Department of the Environment. He^+tap^atisfied himself that, if the City Council allowed their finance^ft/^llapse, the urgent voluntary services would Le able to keep going	immediate future. He hoped that, while

the situation was poised^e^cmlicately as at present, colleagues would feel they did not need to wjra  \to the City Council about the conduct of services in their areas of^n^poVsibility. If the City Council&apos;s current discussions did not	a financial settlement, he had it in

mind to have an early discus sirafV^ji^h Ministerial colleagues responsible f  r the main services affectingv^fer^People of Liverpool, but he doubted whether it would be necessary to ximene a meeting of the Ministerial Group on Local Government ContingeWc ip^oat that stage.

THE prime MINISTER said that she had &lt;jy  &amp;d^:hat Che Home Secretary was ln correspondence with colleagues aboupN^e maintenance of the Magistrates&apos; Courts in Liverpool. It waioc^early essential that the courts should carry on with their work anaA. if it proved necessary to take any special action to that end, her strong preference would be to enable them to use receipts of fines and fees, which seemed to offer the rafniraum of publicity.

The Cabinet -

Invited the Home Secretary and t;he Chief Secretary, Treasury, to pursue the possibility of Magistrates&apos; Courts in Liverpool using receiptff^/^^ of fines and fees to finance their continuing work.

2. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that the debate in the House of Commons on the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 15 November 1985 would take place on 26 and 27 November. The Prime Minister would open the debate and he would speak first on the second day. The Summit yfneeting on 15 November between the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, had gone well. There had been only one small JJ^vonstration nearby. The Prime Minister&apos;s statement on the Agreement House of Commons on 18 November had found exactly the right tone ^Py/U^e public in Northern Ireland. Nevertheless, the Anglo-Irish A^jp^m&amp;ot had contained more substance than the Unionist community had expej^p&lt;^c&amp;in advance. There was genuine and widespread concern about the Agreem^t&apos;, The provision for the Government of the Republic of Ireland to hav-^S^ftAice in Northern Ireland affairs was anathema to many UnionistY/Opnionist Members of Parliament might resign their seats after ther^rebate on 26 and 27 November, possibly in pairs rather than aH at onc^&gt; He was working hard to reassure Unionist opinion as a whole. Particular efforts should be made, despite the difficulties, to communicate with moderate opinion among Unionists. He would take every opportunity to enfptrakise that oppposition to the Agreement should be e*pressed by con(a  irational means. He would be seeing Mr John Hume MP to urge that the SomaViDemocratic and Labour Party (SDLP) should e*press more clearr^-^p^ssuppport of the Agreement.

The situation in the pu4fWJ  ^order in Northern Ireland was generally quiet. The incident in &lt;^Mclvhe had been involved on the previous day had not been caused by any	of loyalty on the part of the Royal

Ulster Constabulary, in wht^lyh^ had full confidence. There would be a major rally on 23 November r^^p^ition to the Agreement; the security forces were taking all necessawJVpwecautions. The public order 8ltuation could of course deteriorate at any time.

fn discussion the following pointA^SJep^Sonade -

       

a- The Government should adopt^V^a^m style, maintaining a firm and consistent policy for as lon^^^might be necessary.

b. At the same time, there was a &lt;ranger that Unionists, if they failed to gain sympathy or achieve results through their opposition to the Agreement by political means and in the courts, could become increasingly truculent. The Government there-fore had an interest in finding means of reassuring moderate UnVonis&amp;ns opinion. The question of finding a step which would be	consistent with

present policy but might provide a safety valv   fa): Unionist frustration should be considered.

Although the Unionist Members of the Northerri^^&lt;^nd Assembly   ight at present see that body as a platform for propbk^da and not as a forum for contact with the Government, it would	f  r

the Government to make any move to reduce the role of ^jeA&apos;ssembly. Unionists might come to see it as a forum where they couijK^rtwiress their views, while nationalists&apos; views were being expresl^\lj&gt;iv&gt;ugh the Irish Government in the new Intergovernmental Conferenqg^/A


   d.	The Prime Minister would see Mr John Cushnahan of the Alliance Party, some of the members of which wanted the Assembly to be dissolved, on 22 November.

v\ e. if the SDLP could be persuaded to enter the Assembly, the latter could become more effective. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland would be seeing Mr John Hume of the SDLP later \&apos;^/Sthat day and would argue for the Party&apos;s paricipation in the &lt;^y/Assembly. Subject to Mr Hume&apos;s reactions, it would be for

/^/consideration whether the Prime Minister should send a message to //   ^Taoiseach asking the Irish Government also to put to Mr Hume t^je^ase for SDLP participation in the Assembly.

Prime Minister would be replying to a letter of 16 Fra^dmber from Mr James Kilfedder, Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Her reply might indicate that the Government had&apos; no wish to see any reduction in the role of the Assembly.

g.	Anothev^pS^ssible means of providing reassurance to Unionists would be son4 increase in the role of the Standing Committee on Northern Irera/ffPbvf the House of Commons, which included all members sittin&apos;jLj/r^constituencies in Northern Ireland. A further possibility migfT^  /to make less use of Orders in Council in relation to Northat*//beland, and greater use of primary legislation applyiryg/&apos;^o&apos;Othe whole of the United Kingdom. But the first of these ideas wpjttjk be difficult to implement quickly and the second might be cr^ytcyeed by the minority community in Northern Ireland, and o^-^e/enrs, as an integrationist measure and thus to run counter to tl^^pxjri-t of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.

h.	Yet another possibility   y^/frt be to require persons elected to public positions in Northern (j/elAKd to make a statement rejecting violence. This would appeal tq  /ne&gt;JJnionists, who were worried at the participation in elected bodi^ej)! members of Sinn Fein.

THE PRIME minister, summing up the discu^^^, said that it was essential to maintain the balance betweerMoie interests of the rotestant and the Roman Catholic communities in Northern Ireland, very effort should be made in the forthcoming debate in the House of mmons on the Anglo-Irish Agreement, and subsequently, to ensure that nionists were made aware of all the constitutio/^TSWenues already a^ai^a^le to them for putting their views to the\^yer-Rment. Everything also be done to urge the Unionists to expres/sr tHeir objections to e Anglo-Irish Agreement by constitutional means. xE^/^hmed likely at the Ulster Unionist Party would come to take a d^d&apos;TA/^nt view from j.   Democratic Unionist Party with regard to the Agreen^K/wid such 1 terences might be helpful to the Government in gainin&lt;gpimWc aCceptance for the Agreement in Northern Ireland.

The Cabinet -

1* Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s &lt;^&apos;7//} summing up of their discussion.


   2.	Decided that the Government should take no action to reduce the role of the Northern Ireland Assembly.

3.	Invited the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, in consultation with the Lord President of the Council and the Home Secretary, to consider whether any steps should be taken in relation to the Northern Ireland Assembly to provide

&gt; reassurance to Unionists; and to propose a draft reply from i/the Prime Minister to Mr Kilfedder&apos;s letter.

Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in conjunction with the ^&gt;  ^  tary of State for Northern Ireland, to consider what in Parliamentary arrangements at Westminster would bec^fepisible and suitable as means of providing reassurance to	s ts.

3   . THE FOREIGN ApTOMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the statements which had just be^^ipWe by the President of the United States,

Mr Reagan and the Gtrferml Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Mr Mikhail Go&lt;jy^K^v, at the press conference concluding their Summit meeting in GenaCy^^)4W been warm and positive in tone. The contents of the Joint S^^nJ^nt signed by the United States Secretary of State and the Soviet ForM&apos;^Mjtanister in the concluding ceremony were not yet known. The raeetinj^  J*^ed to have fulfilled the higher level of expectation in that, having ^rov^ned the full range of arms control and regional issues in their discne^d^Vs, President Reagan and Mr Gorbachev ac* agreed to meet again in 19^^r^n^the United States and to accelerate current arms control negotiation^^/-

a brief discussion, it was noteal/^^, despite the good atmosphere generated by the Summit, the statememf   s/^y the two leaders indicated at no substantive agreement had beer&lt;^  ei^hed on major issues. There ould be no illusions about Mr GorbacneVy^a-jm of improving the public image of the Soviet Union without changiir&amp;^xs policies.

^^^REIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, as widely reported, tt*e^s^\p of the disaster, following the eruption of the Colombian v  ib^rfS^W)evado del Ruiz on 13 November, was enormous. The response from tbe UjrJ^efi-&apos;Kingdom had been swift and generous:	the Government had made

a cont^SSj^inn of nearly million. The Royal Air Force (RAF) Hercules aircraft^Afe^o Puma helicopters and the RAF medical team deployed to the area had S&amp;en warmly welcomed by the Colombian authorities. The speed a^d scale of what had been achieved was an excellent illustration of how the United Kingdom responded to such disasters.

tHE FOREIGN AND COMMQ#w  aLtH SECRETARY said that the point was being reached when the Unit^dy^d^gdom should withdraw the RAF Hercules arrcraft, currently depxJ^%^i\in Ethiopia. Progress made in relief operations and the planngavUJnure of Addis Abbaba airport for refurbishment for a per iod^J^^io months presented an opportunity for Withdrawal which would perm\\_^Amore flexible use of these aircraft for   Perational training and otheT^Ja^pses.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETi^Y^rid that at the Summit meeting ^etveen the Prime Minister and Preside^r^fta/tterrand of France on

November a common approach had been syycppe fully achieved on major issues relating to East-West relations, a^ms control and the European   ramunity. Progress on the Channel Fixed&apos;^ink had been particularly

encouraging.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the resjaara^dVice ceremonies gr     .ln the Far East during the previous week, involv^^^^iows of ritish servicemen killed in the Second World War, had MxJaOdeeply ^ lng. He considered that the Government&apos;s arrangement&lt;^T^C^ds visit war widows to the Far East had been valuable in balancing&apos;x&amp;i P asis placed on the European theatres of war in other remambDance eremonies that had taken place that year.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the United Nations debate on the Falkland Islands would take place on 26 and 27 November.

&gt; Argentina was expected to table a draft resolution couched in seemingly /^rnoderate terms, calling for negotiations on &quot;all aspects of the future _y/f the Falkland Islands&quot;. United Kingdom lobbying efforts were exposing /Vw implicit insistence in the Argentine text on negotiations about the \\N^&amp;reignty of the Falkland Islands and were stressing the importance of inciple of self-determination. A United Kingdom amendment would emphasising self-determination which, if carried, would have thV^e^^t of wrecking the Argentine text. If the amendment failed, how^gr^^i number of the states which had abstained on similar resol&lt;    ofjS\ in the past would probably vote for the Argentine resolur

in a briefodiscussion, it was noted that much diplomatic effort was devoted each year to countering successive Argentine resolutions on the future of the Falkland Islands, and that this could use up the United Kingdom&apos;s credit	other countries. France, when faced in the 1960s

with resolutionsf/aboyt Algeria, had simply made clear that she would not feel bound by the&amp;y&lt;^--s\

The Cabinet -

2. Invited the	and Commonwealth Secretary

to consider in the conrm^of future United Nations debates on the Falkla&lt;MxfevNand whether the United Kingdom should again exaawA high level of diplomatic effort in lobbying againsi^^^ntine resolutions.

tHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SE(^E^rf&amp; said that the ntergovernmental Conference had met agS^T/at Ministerial level on

November and there would be two furtings before the European Council on 2-3 December. The United Kingrom was still succeeding both 111 lowering unjustified expectations and making the texts more s3tisfactory. in discussion it was said that some unexpected change in e French or German positions could not yet be excluded: both the rench President, Monsieur Mitterrand, and the	German

ancellor, Herr Kohl, had not sd far been closaA^cpacerned with the ^ctual proposals under discussion. It was thererotfV^3^irable that the lted Kingdom should keep its own tactical positiars-^cra-A at this 8tage- &apos;

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that he was pressing the United States hard to modify their position on semi-finished steel products. He had spoken to the United States Trade Representative,

UMr Yeutter. The United States authorities had indicated earlier that yhey would put forward new proposals but they had not done so. He had -dpW clear that the United Kingdom could not accept the agreement -^Q^ied ad referendum between the Community and the United States unless were satisfactory assurances about semi-finished steel products.

Fir&gt;ance

THE CHANcVm  &amp; OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Council of Ministers (Economy aMFinance) had a responsibility following the European Council in Malian for examining any proposed Treaty changes on monetary matters. At its meeting on 18 November the Council had discussed a Commission proposal_for including references to the European Monetary System and to Ecoroi&apos;^c and Monetary Union in the European Community Treaty. There p V-J par division of opinion in the Council. The United Kingdom, thiTFi^Val Republic of Germany, the Republic of Ireland and Denmark had seert&lt;2*v  fhcess i ty for, and some harm in, these proposed amendments. The Dutch^^Hion had been slightly more open, while some other member states had/lJi^jiX^n favour. Nothing had therefore been decided. No doubt the Ctfaffc^s^ion would try to come forward with less ambitious proposals. The UjH^eU Kingdom should, however, maintain its Position for the time bein^^ari)icularly since the Germans were taking a firm line because the cons^tWP^Rnal position of the Bundesbank would be affected. The situation so^mVas satisfactory. The Council had also agreed on a loan of just	,000 million for Greece because of

its economic difficulties. The	Id be made available in two

instalments and strict conditions w^r^^^tached.

THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES An1*&lt;F00D said that the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on 18-19 November VTad discussed but reached no conclusions on the Commission&apos;s latest unsatisfactory proposals on cereals; nor had they reached agreement on sugar on battery cages^ for poultry. There had been a difficult discuss  /&gt;n{^n the Commission&apos;s proposal, which in their view could be decided bj&lt;2  u^I&gt;fied majority, to han the use of all hormones as growth promoters in waTyJe. The United Kingdom was resisting this proposal^ which was not o&amp;a&amp;Cpn sc ient i f ic evidence.	^

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that the Council

(Transport) on 14-15 November had reached an agreement on driv^YS^^purs

and on the full liberalisation of road transport by 1992. The

Had also come close to an agreement on an important package of meg^n&gt;t/e^\


   on shipping. The French alone were standing out and it might yet be possible to push them into an agreement before the end of the year.
