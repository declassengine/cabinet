&apos;^^OSECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that at the meeting Sub-Committee on Economic Affairs of the Ministerial Steering GpjjKfi^ee on Economic Strategy (E(A)) on Monday 9 December the Secretary Defence had been authorised to explore the possibility of an acoe^Cable proposition by a consortium of European companies to

as an alternative to the proposition put forward by United^^^W^i0gies (UT) and Fiat. The meeting had decided that the Governmefrfp^ould not regard itself as bound by the recommendation of the National i^maments Directors (NAD) of the United Kingdom, France, the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy (that certain helicopter requirements should be met solely from aircraft designed and built in Europe) if Westlgw-eL had not by 4.00 pm on Friday 13 December received an acceptable EuroMannproposal. In the event a European proposition had een made to Wes^anxKshortly before that time, but the directors of Westland had not rraganaed it as sufficiently firm or attractive and had accordingly announs^J^el^t they would be recommending the UT-Fiat proposal to their sh^r^Ap^ders. He had accordingly announced in his statement in the Housq^o^^frommons on Monday 16 December that the Government was not bourt^wulie NAD&apos;s recommendation, that the directors of Westland were recommendj^S^the UT-Fiat proposal, that the Government had ensured that Westland^ra^HVi alternative European proposition to consider, and that it was f^^V^&apos;S&apos;tland as a private sector company to decide the best route to folT&lt;5  ^0^ order to serve its future and that of its employees. In answer to ttarri^hnentary Questions the following day the Prime Minister had conf irmetfJ^n^ Westland was a public liability company and must make its own deq^rt^e. Details of the UT-Fiat proposal had now been announced, an^/ffctfther details of the alternative European proposal would be announced	shortly. There would be an

extraordinary general meeting of the^  efllfta]tiy on 13 January 1986, at which the shareholders could decide vm^^^p  oposal to accept. In the meantime the Government should continue^^say that the decision was one or the company to take, and that the Go^rnment was not advocating one solution in preference to another. Ministers should not be drawn into Pu lie comment on the comparative merits of the two proposals.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that th^dVVectors of Westland W6re.rac  mmending the UT-Fiat proposal, and tha^j^rmjsal had the conditional acceptance of the company&apos;s bankers, ^ubjejet to there being no better offer. Details of the proposal by the	consortium,

w ich included British Aerospace pic and General	Company pic as

we as three European firms, would be announced very/^ljm^ly. He had een authorised by E(A) to help to establish the genui^l^^,^of the uropean proposal: this could only have been done by a Mi^rfee\r&gt; since involved discussion with and ensuring the support of orMfryiuropean misters of Defence. The Prime Minister&apos;s answers in the^H^u^vof ^ommons on 17 December had been clear and helpful. Because	role

ln t^le matter and his responsibilities for defence procuremen^^h^Owas


   inevitably asked many questions. As the Ministry of Defence was a major customer of Westland, he was bound to answer questions, whether from the V UT-Fiat groups or from the European consortium, about the implications )l defence procurement for the workload on Westland, and to ensure that ^^jnformation on this matter was equally available to both the UT-Fiat x\\a^oup and the European consortium group as well as to Westland and its \^*  Akers.

MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that, in view of the con^jr^Lng public interest in this matter, she would certainly face fuMhmj^uestions in Parliament that afternoon, and it was important that^g^e^j^ouid have the agreement of the Cabinet to what she proposed to SaT^/She would confirm that the statement made by the Secretary of State f64&gt;^ptade and Industry on 16 December (based on the decisions of a Cabinet \5ommittee on 9 December) and her own answers to questions on 17 December represented the policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government; that it remained the policy of the Government that it was for Westland to decide what was the best course to follow in the best interests of the company and its employa^JjA)and that, given that that was the Government&apos;s policy, no Minlkt^eiV^as entitled to lobby in favour of one proposal rather than anotTravTyShe would make it clear that major issues of defence procuremenXjtwpc for collective decision. Information about the implications of defe^yorocurement for Westland&apos;s workload should be made equally availablV/^j^both groups as well as to Westland and its bankers, and questions^Irf^be subject should not be answered in any way which favoured one group^j^^roposal rather than another.

2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECREW#^aid that the Ministerial meeting of the North Atlantic Council ofnrt2-13 December had gone well. There had been general agreement that thd^opportunities in arms control opened up by the recent United States/Soviet Summit must be grasped; but the United States Secretary of State, Mr George Shultz, had made clear that the United States would not enter into agn^jembjits that were unsatisfactory. The impression in some of thefmedva that the Europeans ad lectured the United States at the meeting oh^M*e~vbeed for results in arms control had been false. The Europeans had, uow^ry^r, underlined the importance of abiding by the second Treaty on Strat-e^c/Arms Limitation ^ ALT II) and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.	been a

^iscussion at the Ministerial meeting of the questiorN^&amp;^t^V^ inclusion 0 British and French nuclear weapons in the Geneva negowa^ions on nuclear arms control. He and the French Foreign Ministe^^J^^welcorned r Shultz&apos;s confirmation that such inclusion was unnaccep^hl/Ml This was a matter which the Government would continue to watch csa^^  *^Lly.


   The Ministerial meeting had also endorsed a strategy for the improvement co-operation in armaments manufacture among the members of the . Alliance.

Sovie|-

^r  Posals

for

Constraints   n Nuclear Weapons Testing

REIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Minister-Counsellor C Jyy  V^et Embassy had that morning conveyed to the Foreign and

*5launv^plth Office various Soviet proposals for constraints on nuclear weaP^^sting. The Soviet Union had offered to prolong;its unilateral H  ratCW   n nucTcar weapons testing beyond the end of 1985, provided a tl^/jw^ted States would also observe a moratorium. The Soviet ion haa- also proposed the resumption of tripartite negotiations etween c&amp;e United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom on a comprehensive ban on nuclear weapons tests. The Soviet Union had expressed willingness to take advantage of the offer by India, Sweden, anzania, Greeca^I^texico and Argentina to accept seismic monitoring stations on th(/j^ territory, to help in the verification of a comprehensive nhc!V^5Xtest ban. The Soviet Union had said that it would    e willing, if th&lt;  (unUed States would co-operate in this, to consider some measures of oh   inspection to verify a nuclear test ban. The oviet Minister-CoutftfM^&lt;  ir had expressed the hope of a positive British response to his appro4^^Vs.

The Foreign and Commonwe^^^^ecretary said that his initial impression 0 the Soviet approach wa^tfnaj it was an attempt to increase pressure on the United States to aco^j^MjVnstraints on nuclear weapons testing.

e offer of on-site inspect^l^^ould require careful handling: it might be of interest or it m   |/^ mere propaganda.

In a brief discussion, it was no^ertf^h&gt;at the Soviet move had already at^fcte&lt;T considerable publicity. ^^tfe^Government&apos; s initial line, in pu lie comment, should be that the apjj^oach was being considered carefully; but it would be importan^^fcrtC^r^rk out a considered response quickly, so that the Soviet Union wereyy)t^4eft holding the propoganda initiative for too long.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said th^ftMa Soviet Embassy had comp ained about a recent break-in at its press^a^ejion. As chance

have it, there had been a number of recent /ime^aents of this kind oviet premises in London. The Soviet authorre very ensitive, just as the Government would be sensitiv^^y^&gt;At such n.1 en^s ^ relation to British premises in Moscow. ^&gt;j  i  teillance on oviet premises in London had been intensified.

the FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Eminent Persons Group of the Commonwealth had made a good start at its first meeting on 12-13 December in London. The members were getting on well together. Lord Barber was keeping the Government informed. The Group&apos;s first ^jpproach to the South African Government had conformed to the Group&apos;s

to proceed with discretion and without publicity. The approach had conveyed to the South African Government by the British, Canadian 9%j^ustralian Ambassadors in Pretoria. The initial South African x^^pphse had been cautious but not unhelpful. The Group had agreed that period alloted to it in the Commonwealth Accord was not a deadyfife but a &quot;review period&quot;.

been further trouble on the border between South Africa Aral its neighbours: in this case an incident close to the border with Ziim^pbwe in which six white people had been killed. It was uncertain how far the Government of Zimbabwe gave support to the operations of the African National Congress, which had acknowledged responsibility this incident. The Government had made clear their shock at this Micifflent and were trying to exert influence on both sides to prevent an Vtj^nt^-^e in tension. The Government had made clear to South Africa that//th# hoped that there would be no &quot;hot pursuit&quot; operation across Ktrg^tA-der into Zimbabwe. The Prime Minister would also be writing to ^K^JJ^ime Minister of Zimbabwe, Mr Robert Mugabe.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEA    o* JRETARY said that the peace agreement between the Military CounciT^akc^ihe National Resistance Movement had been signed in Nairobi on 17^e    if&amp;er. It was a real achievement for the President of Kenya, Mr Dai^e^/^ap Moi. But it was far from sure that the agreement would be effTension between rival groups remained strong and there were no	arrangements for the handing in

of arms. All concerned knew that^h^^^iited Kingdom was not prepared to participate in arrangements for monv  j^*j3hg the agreement. Major General Pollard of the British Army, who wasT^ha area, would only provide advice, notably on the merging of the VWal forces into a single army. Canada might send one or two army officq^s to exercise a similar function. Consideration was being given to the possibility that the seven members of the British Military Advisory and Training Team, still at Jinja in Uganda, might support Major General^-Rollard in providing advice.

3- THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Foreign Ministers meeting in the Intergovernmental Conference on 16-17 December had followed up the points remitted to them by the European Council. The Kingdom had maintained its position close to that of France and Federal Republic of Germany; this had headed off attempts by Italy, \&gt;j^Parficular, to reopen or add to the texts which had been agreed by of Government on 2-3 December. There had been agreement on a v^Vv   Cat^  n tlie text indicating that there would be no automatic W5%nsequences if some proposals for the completion of the common mai^^Wre not adopted by the target date, 31 December 1992. The text ?n tjj^J^uropean Parliament had also been clarified but without extending lts	there was now a clear provision that in cases covered by the

new proWcjja^e a Commission proposal would lapse if it were not adopted within a^ime limit. On sea and air transport the United Kingdom had een successful in applying qualified majority voting to Article 84 of the European Community Treaty; this was subject only to a safeguard clause which already existed elsewhere in the Treaty. Other proposals 3d been satisfat^E^rily set aside. The results of the Intergovernmental Conference wou//bqJincluded in a European Act, the United Kingdom aving ensured &amp;Kte/f3Hection of the proposal to entitle this a Treaty of European Union. Tneyjttiited Kingdom had maintained its specific reserve 0n the voting promw^ on measures to protect health and safety at

making clear	could not accept majority voting which would

ead to a burden on s(i^4nd medium-sized enterprises. The general reserves of Italy and wfn&apos;l&amp;apk remained. It was clear, however, that the anish Government was lik^H^V) commend the package to the Danish Parliament. Despite theu^tfonaern to take account of the views of the European Parliament, the	were looking for ways in which they

could commend the package to^  t^ro own Parliament. Subject to these reserves, the texts would now^bg^j^bmitted for iegai and linguistic checking with a view to submisfSd&apos;dvp^h Governments for signature early in Despite some histrionic c^atpl^iSnt about the inadequacy of the package from Monsieur Delors, the ^  t?j^pdent of the Commission, the Predominant reaction of Foreign MinLa^drs of the member states was relief that agreement had been reacnesTcSjW recognition of modest Progress.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the C^Juteil of Ministers u get) and the European Parliament had not reached agreement on the ommunity&apos;s 1986 budget. The figure proposed B^Dtf&gt;5X;ouncil was already too high but the European Parliament had now vot^/^i) favour of a higher 1gure. it was expected that the President of thV-ft^apean Parliament would sign and that the Commission would seek to imp^pk&amp;t a budget Y lch, in the view of the United Kingdom and other m^ajS^Vs tates, was * egal. Since the European Parliament should not be	to set

rgures above the level agreed by the Council of Minis t^^^^&amp;udget), it was now necessary for the Council, acting by a simple maj^itM, to take is question to the European Court of Justice. If such avmafro^ity were oot obtained, a number of member states in addition to the lngdom were likely in any event to challenge the budget by l^mrjabiing


   proceedings in the European Court of Justice. It would also be ^necessary to decide soon what contribution should be made to the budget ^^bile the judgment of the European Court of Justice was awaited.

SjV ^iscussion it was argued that, as the United Kingdom would be a

iciary, for example under the Social Fund, from the extra money put the disputed budget, it was desirable that, if possible, a legal sh  uld be made by the Council as a whole or by a group of fates acting together rather than by the United Kingdom alone.

11	ported that there was already support from other member states

  r	in the European Court of Justice. The Federal Republic of

Germanv^^he Netherlands and Luxembourg wanted legal proceedings by the Counci	ranee was likely to agree. The United Kingdom was making

rePresent\p4p&lt;jG to Belgium and Denmark which were undecided.

Number of

European

Councils

THE FOREIGN AND CG^S&amp;NWEALTH SECRETARY said that, in line with the United Kingdom&apos;s mewjthat the number of European Councils should be reduced from threeM^T^o a year, the Dutch Presidency had decided to cancel the meeting Moph^ad for the following March. The next meeting would now be on 26-2986. Although the formal position was that there should be at leasy/  y  \meetings a year, it was expected that the

normal position would no   ^kC^o hold no more than two European Councils each year.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRaS^MH?MNDUSTRY said that the United i-ngdom had been trying to persutf&amp;dmembers of the International Tin Council to take their responsibil	a settlement of the

outstanding problems. In order to ga^a^bandwagon rolling for such a settlement, the support of the Europeap^rommunity was important. France and the Federal Republic of Germany,	had not been prepared to
