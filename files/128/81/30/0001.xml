2- THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the discussion of South Africa had been the central feature of the Commonwealth Heads of | Government Meeting (CHOGM) in the Bahamas from 16 to 22 October. The ^Trime Minister had faced an extremely difficult task and the Vfcpmonwealth Accord on South Africa, which had resulted from the s jgussion   bad been a major achievement. It expressed a position far to British views than might have been expected. The decision on easures against South Africa had accorded with the position already adopted by the United Kingdom jointly with the other members of the European Community, with the addition of two measures: to preclude so Ear as possible the import of Krugerrands and to preclude Government unding fox^trade missions to South Africa or for participation in exhibitions and trade fairs in South Africa. A Commonwealth Group of   inent	was to be appointed by seven Governments and the

Commonwealth Secretariat, to promote the process of dialogue in South Africa on tnm*basis that it was for the people of that country to etermine thefe future. After six months, the seven Governments c  ncerned were^^^ket to assess what had been achieved.

inside South Africa, there was no sign of a reduction in terrorism. The number of incident^^^^Lf anything increasing. A group of by-elections on the previous day ffbd ^|||oduced a swing to the right. A racist party, ne Herstigte NationaTP^Partie, had, for the first time, won a seat in arliament. These elections results would make it harder for President   tha to continue with the process of reform. They would also make it ^arder for the Commonwealth Group of Eminent Persons to produce results.

f was important that the Group j^iould produce results, since that would Provide the best hope of continued resistance to sanctions.

THE Prime MINISTER said that the^M|f|&gt;ssion of South Africa at CHOGM had een very tough going, particular^jjpj^ng the weekend &quot;retreat&quot; for eads   f Government. All other memlfrs^Df the Commonwealth had been guided by the view, fashionable in ^^jiibmonwealth, that to speak against sanctions was to invite the a6&lt;ti||ffi^on of supporting apartheid, g the final session of the discussion,^President Jayewardene of

1 Lanka had admitted that his country had a preferential arrangement   n tea exports with South Africa and had ^^M^ntion of giving it up.

,r Jayewardene had asked why so many people ^proimd the table were being ^. Pocritical. During the discussions the Prime Minister had experienced rscourtesy and offensiveness as well as hypocricy. She had put forward ao alternative draft communique, embodying what the United Kingdom would wjsh to say about South Africa, and had made clear that she would be ilr&gt;g to publish this. She had also made clear th|[t  ||!e whould not wh^66 t0 3n^ measures without studying them fully. ^he$^|:actics, in Off*?&apos;1 t*le Permanent Under Secretary of State, Foreign an4 Jemmonwealth lce&gt; had supported her with great skill, had even tu^l^jy^ped to Produce an acceptable result. It was a positive feature v?mmonwealth Accord that, at British insistence, it callec^  &gt;S|bi end to ^^olence in South Africa. The choice of the British member ^^Egho Group Gro^m^nent ^ersons would be important, since the other member^^Sj^ie s Up might not be seriously interested in progress and were uKl|lte  V to cure the co-operation of President Botha. It had proved possrble^^^


   save the day on sanctions at CHOGM but the problem would remain and further efforts would be needed.

discussion, the following points were made -

Ik a* The opposition of the United States to mandatory sanctions had ip: seemed recently to weaken. But President Reagan and the Secretary state, Mr George Shultz, had assured the Prime Minister that they had no intention of agreeing to mandatory sanctions. It would be important to continue to seek such assurances from the United States Administration.

b.	ffi^sident Botha had done more in six months to dismantle apafrthei&apos;ck than had been done over more than 20 years previously. Indus*1:j  gKSouth Africa had played a leading role in the recent relaxa^jJksL It would be misguided to harm through economic sanetions(fffffl|| very people who were encouraging change.

c.	The Scttith African economy was probably the strongest in Africa. It would-be folly to destroy it. It would also be wrong to harm the eaucffifel black middle class which had emerged. The right approachencourage their participation in the political process^iy&apos;V

THE PRIME MINISTER said that	that morning received a message

from President Reagan about thWBjvLtion of the United States on nuclear arms control in advance of the rBypjgnt1s Summit meeting with Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, General Secreod^hf the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, on 19-20 November l^K^ffl^Geneva.

fa a short discussion, the following {joints were made -

a. There had been a risk that th^gecent Soviet counter-proposal to the United States on nuclear arms^^ftta^l, which contained imaginative points but was simplistic^   could create a public impression that the Soviet Union held tile initiative on the subject.

f&gt;. It was noteworthy that President Reagan had been willing to listen to British and European advice on this mat^r and on various other important occasions. The United Kingdom	play a role in

influencing the United States because British commitment to the Alliance was widely recognised in North America aad Efl|jSurope.

c    The role of the United Kingdom in influencing UmlKie  States decisions should not be revealed in public. But the tfeite^Kingdom could associate itself fully with the American policies^wyjjji emerged as a result of British representations.	VN


   d. There was a prospect that the Government of the Netherlands would shortly announce its decision that cruise missiles could be deployed in that country. The last of the Allies which had agreed in 1979 to accept United States intermediate range nuclear systems would thus be carrying out that decision. This showed that all the Soviet propaganda and all the domestic agitation in Western Europe against the modernisation of ^.intermediate range nuclear forces had been powerless.

THE SECRETAj^ OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that there had been two Particular^^oblems in the talks with the United States about the role fchat the^United Kingdom should play in research under President Reagan&apos;s Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI). The first had been to ensure that there was a^low of technology to the United Kingdom, which could be exPloited in ^fis^ountry. The second had been to ensure that the v  lume of Britn^^fcrticipation in SDI research was satisfactory. He had reached agreroient ad referendum on these matters with the United States Secretary Of Defense, Mr Caspar Weinberger, on the previous day. This agreement for^SJ^Tmprecedented arrangments for an exchange of technology which shoMdJaitove highly advantageous to the United Kingdom and a scale of Britistl^pircicipation in SDI research which would be

substantial.

3   THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that his recent discussions in Washington indicated that the tide of protectionism,in (.the United States Congress might have slightly waned. The United States &apos;^Administration seemed now to believe that it was unlikely that &apos;&apos;l&amp;otectionist legislation would obtain a sufficent majority to override Wv Presidential veto. There was also a reasonable chance that the ypjinfslation setting a limit on the Federal budget deficit would succeed. &apos;^T^^teould be expected to have an effect on interest rates and on t^s^v^sne of the dollar. He had also discussed in Washington specific tra^^Veues such as relations with Japan, negotiations under the Gener^^A^reement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the United States&apos; pr  Po^rt^^ strengthen their restrictions on imports of steel from the EuropeanyCprfjkmnity. He had found the United States&apos; negotiating Positionrwfi steel very tough.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Q^un^Ll of Ministers (Economy and Finance) on 28 October had agreed	though there

w  uld not be an immediate rectifying letter, the v^omdU^ion should Propose an amendment to the Community budget dur ing,/  9#4^to further lncrease the United Kingdom&apos;s rebate. The extra amou/^v^bove the Provision in the draft 1986 budget of 1,400 million ec^(Q^put _ million), was currently estimated at about 264 milliarj^cu (about 55 million) but would be known more accurately in 1986VV^Pfras decision emmonstrated that the Fontainebleau agreement was warkingV^me Council j*d also set in hand some work on adapting the financial guTMVm^ under e budget discipline arrangements to take account of the ac^s^es  i&lt;^n of Pain and Portugal.

   irectives on unit trusts and similar bodies which would allow them to &gt;   Perate throughout the Community. This was to be welcomed. The , ^President of the Commission, Monsieur Delors, had also indicated to Jjthe Council of Ministers his view that the Treaty should be amended to ^*J\clude a reference to the European Monetary System. This had been ^psed, in particular, by the Federal Republic of Germany. It was \  jW^Qrtant that discussion of this proposal should be carried forward at &apos;Pyvj/&apos;Jtage, as agreed, in the Council of Ministers (Economy and Finance) ai(^n^K within the Intergovernmental Conference.

LIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEX CC(85) 30th Conclusions, Minute 5 ft ursday 31 October 1985 at 10.30 am

THE PRIME MjNf;^fER said that, although negotiations between United Kingdom and Irish officials were continuing on some points, the time had come for tHe Cabinet t^^^Aider the major aspects of the draft agreement which had been negot iated^^J^ ferendum. Some of the gains which the Government had s  ught in the negotiations had not been attained. The Irish Government had declined to	tides 2 and 3 of the Irish Constitution. There

would be some impro^me^k in co-operation with the Irish Republic on security matters, but,,tj|$re^t&gt;rospects on this were less clear than they had Previously seemed. There was no commitment by the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) to participate in the process of government in orthern Ireland. On the other hand, the agreement made absolutely clear that all decisions north of the border in Ireland would continue to be taken by the United Kingdom G	nent. The United Kingdom had conceded

n  thing significant, apart from thesestablishment of a framework in which the Irish Republic would have u|e opportunity to advance views and Proposals on various aspects of	Ireland affairs. At Irish

lnsistence, there was still a refei enc&apos;a in Article 8 of the draft Agreement to the possibility of estw^rsAlng mixed courts in Northern reland and in the Irish Republic, bu&lt;C tmls reference was now very weak and attenuated. The Irish Republic ha(L|j^i&apos;j^drawn its readiness to announce a decision to accede to the European^Convention on the uPpression of Terrorism, but was willing  ^ isjknounce its intention of acceding.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that the memorandum which s and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had circulated (C(85) 25) owed how the proposals discussed by the Cabinet on 16 February 1984 and ~ July 1985 had since been taken forward. A number of.Jbenefits were to expected from the process o|i which the proposed dgre^pient was the ^entrepiece. The agreement could open up the prospeolfcifefinding the   g-jam in the political processes of Northern IrelandM^pi- would Represent a constructive move, helpful to the Government domestically and ^nternationally. The only way to achieve further improve^^^^i the ruggle against terrorism in Northern Ireland was to securagjfnkfa greater ma.  P  rati  n on security matters with the Irish Republic.

^jority community in Northern Ireland, the agreement contaii  pl||m lcle 1 the best undertakings that could be secured on the sH^^fc^of


   Northern Ireland without running a risk that the agreement would be vulnerable to constitutional challenge in the Irish Republic. For the minority community, it offered a mechanism - the Intergovernmental Conference - through which their point of view could be expressed. The ; Proposed agreement was not an alternative to devolution in Northern Iceland; on the contrary, it was structured to encourage unionists to look l^|re favourably upon devolution, since a number of subjects would be I r  ||Pved by devolution from discussion in the Intergovernmental Conference.

also probable that the agreement would put pressure on the SDLP to ncrease its role in Northern Ireland politics since, if they did not, the rrsh Republic could become, through the Intergovernmental Conference, the mam channel of expression of the political views of the minority and the    1DLP could become redundant. There was also a prospect of considerable unds, notably from the United States, for expenditure in Northern lreland;Ait was essential that this money should be additional to existing ^ritish public ^xpenditure in Northern Ireland, since otherwise it would

The issues stj^^^er discussion between United Kingdom and Irish 0 facials incl^yWLe composition and location of the Secretariat of the ^ntergovernmentara. Conference. The Irish Government wanted their Secretary 0 be a very seni* official and they wanted the early establishment of e Secretariat in&apos;  (|   t, Another issue requiring further discussion was the deployment or th  . Garda in the border areas. So far, the Irish a not undertaken that&quot; the increased deployment would be sufficiently extensive or durable. It was essential that the work of the Intergovernmental Conference should not be a one-way street; and one of j    most important things that the United Kingdom would require from the rish Republic in that context Moid-d be substantial improvements in c  -operation against terrorisrtj, particularly in the border areas.

Present evidence, the best as^e*8tn0&apos;nt was that the reactions in 0rthern Ireland to the proposed agreement would be containable. But that   old change rapidly, depending in p|rt^bn how the agreement was presented POolicly. The pre sentation should bP^^&amp;key, describing the agreement as sensible, not a dramatic, step forward^ ^he Secretary of State for ^orthern Ireland concluded that on balance right course was for the ernment to embark on the constructive &apos;proposals foreseen in the draft a8reement, subject to clarification of the^temaining points under

ne8otiation.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY agreed that on balance it would be g 1 to proceed with the agreement. The problem of Northern Ireland had pr^U^SC* successive British Governments and a single agreement could not ovide a solution. But the proposed agreement was |f|p which was as 5   ^eTp in dealing with&apos;the problem over time^J^^tehould be seen Putting in place a framework for an evolving discussiO|^*rith the Irish p J-lc&gt; in which problems of security, such as po 1 icv&apos;bAuihe border br^aS? could play an important role. It would also offerJ^Ffibspect of tnging the minority in Northern Ireland to involve itseS^M^k in the an^Uctures of government and should thus undermine support I^Cpnn Fein ne t&apos;?e Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA). To abandon^RJi^k otiations at this late stage would cause disappointment in North (ten


   Ireland as well as in the Republic, would weaken the position of constitutional nationalist representatives in Northern Ireland and strengthen that of Provisional Sinn Fein and the PIRA on both sides of the border, and would damage the reputation of the United Kingdom in the &apos;United States, particularly among the large and influential Irish American #%roups.

^3 discussion a few members of the Cabinet expressed grave reservations ^  out the proposed agreement. The Republic of Ireland was committed by lts constitution to be objective of &quot;reintegration&quot; of the &quot;national territory&quot; which was defined as the whole of the island of Ireland. The Proposed Intergovernmental Conference could be used by the Irish Government&apos;s representatives as a place in which to put foward demands upon thalp|Ltish Government, and as a lever for intruding into the national, sovereignty of the United Kingdom. The suggestion that mixed courts w^r^Whossibility for consideration, however hedged about, would be seen as^^hXinnation of this, since mixed courts if instituted would be ln fact an infringement of sovereignty. The agreement would be seen as the first st^g^nyan irreversible process for altering the constitutional status of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom. It would arouse great concern	unionists in Northern Ireland: the only question

was how great and\how violent the resulting explosion would be.

Most members of the	, however, took the view that it would on

alance be right to conclude an agreement with the Irish Government on the lines proposed. At this advanced stage, and after a long process of negotiation, to call the negotiation off and abandon the agreement would give rise to a widespread sense of disappointment and would entail risks Certainly no less than those vrdpfkent in going ahead. There were more Positive reasons for proceedibgy &apos;||ie changes proposed were institutional n  t constitutional: the status^f Northern Ireland as part of the United kingdom was fully protected. The declaration on the status of Northern Ireland to which the Irish Government would be committed by Article 1 of the agreement should be a positive ^||^lr|Mrance to the unionists that that status could not be changed unless aqd tfht.il a great many more people -deluding unionists - in Northern IrelaM^jtesired that change. The Irish Government would be committed to greate^^P^peration in combating terrorism. The minority in Northern Irel  |ra %?uld have the reassurance that their views and concerns would be able to be represented in the counsels of the British Government in Northern Ireland as a result of the nsh Government&apos;s participation in the Intergovernmental Conference, nere were reasons to think that the reactions of unionists to what was ra  re than a modest development- - significantly more modest than the evelopments agreed at Sunningdale in 1973 - would be^  ontainable. The overnment would be given credit at home and overseswror attempting a constructive step in a situation of long-standing dr%i^^Aity and stalemate.

e hollowing points were also made in the course of theMiswission -

*    The mention in Article 1(c) of the draft agreement^pPttie very idea of a united Ireland would give concern to unionists. On the other hand, Article 1(a) and 1(b) made it clear that the iKPtcuk of


   Northern Ireland would not be changed without the consent of a majority and that the present wish of a majority was for no change. This should give significant reassurance to unionists. Article 1 should help the Government to convince unionists that there was no question of allowing the start of a gradual process of unification in Ireland.

k b. The establishment of mixed courts would be an infringement of sovereignty and the mention of the possibility in Article 8 of the draft agreement could provoke strong unionist reactions. It would be desirable on these grounds to delete all mention of mixed courts from the agreement. On the other hand, the Irish Government had insisted on a mention of mixed courts and the sentence in question had been furthat attenuated since the Cabinet had last discussed the draft agreement. United Kingdom Ministers and officials had made clear repeatedly to the Irish that the Government saw very great difficulty in the Mea of mixed courts and could enter into no commitment about their establishment now or in the future. The relevant sentence in Article ^K&gt;f  he draft agreement was consistent with this. The Irish side in tTw^iegotiations had moreover been informed that the Government wStild make clear in public, after conclusion of an agreement, tffi^Vkhile they were willing to consider the possibility   f mixed cour tm&apos;fci^Lhe Intergovernmental Conference and did not exclude the possibility of mixed courts being feasible and acceptable at some future tiSarte, they could not see any easy or early way through the political and other difficulties.

c* Irish accession to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism would be helpful in the context of extradition of terrorists. It was desirjttjK^that the Irish Government should be brought to announce, in the context of conclusion of an agreement, the firmest possible commitnijent to accede.

d* Increased co-operation wi^T t||fe Irish Republic against terrorism would be one of the principal British aims in concluding an agreement. The Irish should be pressei to give the fullest possible advance commitment on this.	&apos;

e* The United Kingdom should continrc^Athe Intergovernmental Conference to press for greater cross-border co-operation on security matters.

The location of the Secretariat of the Intergovernmental Conference in Belfast would provide a focus for unionist resistance to the proposed agreement. The Secretariat couUXlp be the object of terrorism, notably in the early period afterm|p4jaceement entered mto force. The Irish side should be pressed to ^gr,e%that the Secretariat should not immediately be established in Belfast. There might be advantage in finding a permanent location for the Secretariat elsewhere in Northern Ireland.


   g.	Although the reactions in Northern Ireland to an agreement should, on present prospects, be containable, there would be a period of greater difficulty in the early stages. It was essential that the Government should stand firm during such a period of difficulty.

h.	Mr Molyneaux of the Ulster Unionist Party and Mr Paisley of the Democratic Unionist Party had suggested to the Prime Minister that, if the proposed agreement was registered at the United Nations and be came a binding agreement in international law, it might (since it related to matters wholly within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom) become subject to United Kingdom law, and thus to judicial review in United Kingdom courts. But the changes foreseen in the agreement were institutional, not constitutional, and their essence was that a framework would be provided in which the Irish Government wotfid be free to put forward views. It was therefore unlikely that th^agreeraent would be subject to judicial review. But this point should be looked into further and the text of the draft agreement should be examined to ensure that any possible risk was eliminated.

i.	It wbuld be damaging for the Government&apos;s image if the United Kingdom abandoned the negotiations at this late stage. The response in Parliament; and in the country to the proposed agreement was likely in general to\be positive.

j.	It was most^important that the contents of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion should not leak to the media. In the circumstances of Northern Ireland, it was no exaggeration to say that leaks could cause people to be killed. The media should be told only that the Cabinet had discussed the fubject, that there would be further negotiations with the Irish Republic and that there would be a further report to the CanH^k

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up t^^^W^iSsion, said that the Cabinet considered on balance that the Govffnm^nt should conclude the proposed agreement with the Irish Republic iir    ssentially its present form, with such improvements, in line with the OTWtiwLls discussion, as could be s  cured from the Irish Republic in the%inal .stages of negotiations. The Agreement should be presented in public^pK   B^gpdest but useful step   rward. it should be signed while Parlimneal^was sitting.

The Cabinet -

1* Decided in principle that an agreement on the lines proposed should be concluded with the Irish Republic in the next few weeks.
