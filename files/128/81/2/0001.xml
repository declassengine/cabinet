\$%^KCRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that he would be answering a    w/^Question *-hat day, informing the House of Commons that, on an ini/KpOissessment, the cause of the explosion in the block of flats at Pntnev^^f^l0 January was a crack in a cast iron gas main. Further concern^w^? likely to be expressed as a result of a further but less serious^^rtS^sion in Mitcham.

Plnancing of L  ndon Regional lranSport

THE SECRETARY OF b([AT&amp; FOR TRANSPORT said that the courts had found in favour of the GreaW/^hdon Council (GLC) in their appeal against his determination of the\Vauiqlitt which the GLC should contribute to London Regional Transport (L^^QX 1984-85. He was currently taking advice on the possibility of an aykktfe. The effect of the court&apos;s decision was to leave the GLC with   50	which they had rated for but would not

now have to pay to LRT, and&apos;i^seave LRT with   70 million less than they had expected. He was also	ring the relationship of the outcome

  f the case and the possibill$a^tf\an appeal to the early need for an Order establishing the size of &lt;U^^tepayers&apos; levy to finance LRT for 1985-86. He would be consultin^c^Veagues further.

Rate

Uniitation

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONM^^^said that there was a tendentious report in that day&apos;s Times wty  j^auggested that the visit to him of representatives of rate-capped LabMr local authorities meant that the Government had abandoned their timetable for rate limitation.

He was doing his best to counteract this view. The fact that the authorities had left it to the very last minute to^nake representations f   him might increase their chances of success i//su^equent legal ^ Proceedings. He would make every effort to minimis^iaHs possibility.

Pr  secn        of Off tl0n Biii fen^s

THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that there was likely to be sub^^^^l difficulty in securing agreement during the Committee Stagq  ^w5/&quot;yhe Prosecution of Offences Bill in the House of Lords to the pR&amp;^Aipms for the review of lenient sentences. The provisions were, howevet^^ffc^jji Government policy and would, if necessary, have to be reinstatb^Vp^he House of Commons.

THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that sterling had come under pressure towards the end of the previous week, and had fallen to 1.1225 against &gt; the United States dollar. It had steadied on the Friday afternoon after increase in interest rates, but had opened on the following Monday jtythe Far East exchanges at 1.1025. The use of the Bank of England&apos;s &quot;^vwnum Lending Rate of 12 per cent for one day on that Monday had N^P^upced an appropriate effect and the rate against the dollar was now Matters had not been helped by press reaction which confused that the Government had no specific target for the pound with ^tal/^ncern about its level. Other contributory factors were unease at tlre^u^ire prospects for oil prices, the strength of the dollar, and groundC^^^Ears that the Government&apos;s strength of purpose in controllTswjj&gt;Mietary aggregates had ebbed.

the prime M^IISTER said that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was currently in Washington and would be discussing these issues with the United States Government and other western Finance Ministers. This should not encoura^e^any expectation of change in United States policy. Even if this did (tfaketJjLlace, the effects would take some time to come through.

2* the FOREIGN AND COMMONWEA^^^SJ&amp;RETARY said that the problem of the Hcitish subjects who were being lCe^WJtostage in Libya remained unresolved. A final decision on t4&lt;fir&gt;SEpture was unlikely to emerge before the forthcoming meeting of tl^de^ral People&apos;s Congress in two 0r three weeks&apos; time. Meanwhile, the^^Wshop of Canterbury&apos;s special envoy, Mr Terry Waite, was remaining il^FJ?^poli against the possibility that an earlier indication from the Liby^*  ^  k^:horities that the hostages w  uld be released into his care might be ^&lt;flfilled. So far, the hostages had only been moved to a different place of detention.

Waite was conducting himself ably in difficult circumstances.



THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, in an accou\*t^&amp;%is recent Vlsits to Zimbabwe, Zambia and Kenya, said that these&lt;^^relatively stable and moderate countries in which the United King&lt;ApjjKHis^l substantial interests. In Zimbabwe the Prime Minister, WOL&amp;ert Mugabe, had paid a tribute to the United Kingdom&apos;s aid prc^grajjixte and to the work of the British Military Advisory and Training Teairf^?wWdse contribution to the creation of a unified national army had

indispensa

    Mr Mugabe had reaffirmed his intention of holding free and fair eiect  ons the near future; but there was perceptible ln Zimbabwe over the strength of the Government&apos;s commitment to abid&gt;/tt^


   the terms of the Constitution. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, against a background of more than two years of drought and low copper prices, the economic situation in both Zambia and Kenya was,

) hy African standards, relatively reassuring. The Presidents of Zambia    ^T&gt;d Kenya, Mr Kenneth Kaunda and Mr Daniel Arap Moi, were clearly aware the need to move faster in reforming the pricing and management ^fTuctures of the economies of their countries; had learned the lessons disastrous consequences of socialist policies in Tanzania; and    ^^ej^howing considerable interest in economic developments in China as possible relevance to their own circumstances. The Foreign and Comn^jr^alth Secretary said that on Namibia he had, during his tour,

Consly taken the line that although the British Government yec  gn(y^Aio formal linkage between progress towards full, early independence for Namibia and the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola, the presMice of troops in both countries was a factor of which account inevitably had to be taken. His public remarks to this effect in Harare had, however, be^n reported selectively and partially by both the   ritish and th^H^ath African media.

ln a short disc^jrf^Vi\, Mr Mugabe&apos;s stated intention of moving towards a one-party system\&gt;o^2&gt;fSbabwe only in accordance with the terms of the Constitution was cojdwU&apos;fed with the apparent impatience of some other members of his Gover^m^&lt;\with the constraints which the Constitution imposed. it was note^rta^ although the situation in Kenya might not 8ive rise to serious con^rtsin the immediate future, the implications for that country of an ^^r  Vating population explosion, combined with uncontrolled de fores tatio^-aml&apos;sthe consequent advance of the desert, had disturbing implications foixli&amp;mi&apos;s social stability and economic survival in the longer terrn^

3- THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that in the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on 14 and 15 January there had been a further discussion on measures to improve agrdS^Ltural structures. He insisted that Agriculture Ministers shouwcl b^/ guided on financing by the views of Finance Ministers in the Council^^S-vtoisters (Finance). This would be the next step but might lead to ^A^c^^Lict. There had Beeu some further support for the United Kingdom&apos;^^itritiative on conservation. On the milk levy the Commission haa	forward with

some technical changes which would help the Uni ted	It was

Possible that they might also have the effect of removft^the need for Payment of levy in Northern Ireland. It was clear fro^&gt;ft\bilateral contacts that other member states, including the Nethei^B^^ud Belgium, would not collect or pay the levy in the immediat^Vwure. In these circumstances the United Kingdom shou.ld maintain itss^piys^&apos;hion. In


   discussion it was noted that the German Minister of Agriculture was already in favour of Community support price increases, particularly for cereals, in the 1985 agricultural price fixing which were not \ justified.

THE SECRETARY Of STATE FOR ENERGY said that 2529 miners had returned to work so fa^that *feek, about 300 more than the previous week&apos;s total.

Even in South^^Ma, where the strike had been most solid over 200 were now at work. DjadflPI# the record demand for electricity resulting from the abnormally ^3wWather, stocks at power stations fell the previous week by less thanT300,000 tonnes; even if the cold weather continued Unti 1 mid-April, s^0t^kt power stations would fall only from the present 14 million tou^pl^to about 10 million tonnes. Despite the one daY industrial action^n British Rail (BR) Eastern and London Midland Regions, coal movements that week were expected to amount to more than 900&gt;000 tonnes. Although the Executive of the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers (NACODS) had made the gesture of walking out of a regular meeifl$.l|g with the National Coal Board (NCB) on 15 January in protest agaiAjlhe failure to resume negotiations with the National Union of Mineworl^lrs (NLTM), they were putting the Board&apos;s Pay offer to a ballot whose resi^R^re expected on 25 January. The Presence of Messrs Scargill, MaGa^y and Heathfield of the NUM at the Coal Industry Social Welfare Organi^^^a meeting on 16 January was an indication of the NUM&apos; s increasing ai\xietk to resume negotiations. The threat of a split in the NUM between Thfiw^lands areas and the rest was a source of increasing embarrassment to^jy^^abour Party and the Trades Union Congress and was adding to pressur^&amp;^Pi -dbe NUM to take steps towards a resumption of negotiations.	likely that

negotiations would at some point be resumed^on the basis of a battlement already offered; if a settlement were not then reached on those terms, a massive return to work would probably follow.

T   SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that, in addfc  ion to disruption in the coalfield areas of the London MidA^    nd Eastern Regions of BR, sympathetic action at Waterloo and Kings |E  SS had affected other services. BR had indicated that they were Considering the possibility of seeking damages from the unions cond%raed:jfor the losses incurred as result of the disruption, although it ^^s^ilikely that they would think it worthwhile to proceed.

THE HOME SECRETARY said that picketing and intimidation had cWrf^^ed at the somewhat reduced levels of recent weeks, The courts contiM^o make progress in dealing with the more serious offences, and


     f five year&apos;s and three year&apos;s imprisonment had been passed on 11 January in one case concerning an assault on the police. He proposed that no special facilities should be given to the Group of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) inquiring into police activity during the &gt;miners&apos; strike.

^ATTORNEY GENERAL said that negotiations in Luxembourg were now at a ^ij^cate stage, but it was hoped that the Receiver would gain control of   5.2 million deposited there by the NUM within the following 24 hours. The Yorkshire working miners&apos; case against NUM intimidation had begun to be heard that day, and the similar South Wales case was scheduled to begin the following week.

The PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that most aspects^Ag^ situation were continuing to develop satisfactorily. The Government* and kj.ts supporters should be careful to avoid any comment on the possible sjrf^t in the NUM. In view of the substantial inquiries already made ^ Mrliamentary Select Committees and by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission which had endorsed the need for closure of uneconomic pits&apos;, th  e should be no question of accepting any fresh independent inquiry onkthis subject. The behaviour of the police in this country was entirely outside the responsibility of the European Parliament, and then&amp;overnment should have no communication with any Group of MEPs making ^^i^ries into this subject, although replies would have to be sent to individual British MEPs who put questions to Ministers in line with the normal practice on any matter. The NCB and hief Constables should be advised to adopt a similar approach. The oreign and Commonwealth Secret^v should write to the President of the uropean Parliament explainingtjhp Government&apos;s position, and c  nsideration should be given^JIflie scope for challenging the legality of expenses incurred by MEPs in^purs^ing these inquiries. It would be Preferable if no Conservative ME^SMj^part in the the Group&apos;s work.

The Cabinet -

!    Took note, with approval of the PBome Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.

2. Invited the Foreign and Commonwea&lt;|jjm^ecretary to write to the President of the European Parliament on the lines indicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.
