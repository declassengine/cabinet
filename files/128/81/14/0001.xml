Statement

V^fvCHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Opposition had asked for a &apos;&amp;  &gt;)&apos;y?ment to be made that day about the outcome of the recent European (EC) Budget Council. It had not been the practice in the past to^3^\oral statements about Budget Councils and there was a danger that^sup^ a statement in this case would create an inconvenient Preced^^-v

1   discuVv^fi, it was pointed out that there was a general presumption that statements would be made about the outcome of EC Council meetings where the Opposition requested them and their nature and significance were such as to justify an oral statement.

THE PRIME MINIS^^R^said that the outcome of the Budget Council was stgnificant in t(vU/  EVwould result in an additional net payment by the United Kingdom of n  38/)nillion. Cabinet was therefore content that an 0ral statement shouS^SdW made, especially as a refusal to do so might Prejudice the subseqMe/ra&apos;^Foreign Affairs Debate. This would be in accordance with the getwraJ^Drinciples to which attention had been drawn discussion and shodl!dV    t affect future decisions on statements ollowing EC Budget Counci^^^Skings.

?   	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH 5Z^ETARY said that, as he had

ln ormed the Cabinet on 18 April, immedi\fce publicity had been given to Emb^ tW  	the ^^&quot;Ve exPuls:   -ons from the United Kingdom of Soviet

assy and	airline	personnel.	It had	been made clear to	the Soviet

authorities that publicity would be given to /  Jrt?\\remaining three, and e ceiling	on the	diplomatic	staff of	the 8&amp;vi6s_Embassy	reduced by

at number,	only in	the event	of Soviet	retaliaT^ofTwainst	the British

m assy in Moscow. Despite this warning, the	Government	had

^xPelled two British Service Attaches and one cidiplomat from scow and had delivered a warning concerning the i^  $ftties of four urther members of the British Embassy. The Brifi^&apos;^&apos;M^sponse had r ^re^ore been to publicise the expulsion of the threp^kkssians and Uce the	Soviet	Embassy&apos;s	diplomatic ceiling correfrronaingly:	in

Ponse to this, the official Soviet news agency had pufe&gt;  &lt;  ksed the yarning given to the other British Embassy personnel, althwj^ywithout _ yet naming them. All Soviet accusations against membajr&amp;^of the 1 lsh Embassy in Moscow were totally without foundation antr^    ^*een


   firmly denied. It was still not certain whether any further expulsions from Moscow would take place. It seemed possible that the latest Soviet public statement was intended to draw a line under the episode.

$*}Ey70REIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, with the Secretary of Defence, he had attended a session of the Council of the Wea^erjr^European Union (WEU) in Bonn on 22 and 23 April. The meeting hud &lt;feeep^ useful in reinforcing the commitment of Western European Govern$  f  ta-, to greater technological co-operation and to improved collab&lt;5?^^5n in the field of defence procurement. There had been a substantiC^V^liscussion of the nature of the European response to the invitatioi^Cfrom the United States Secretary for Defence to Western European Governments to take part in the research programme associated with President Reagan&apos;s Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI). Most Participants in	Council meeting had been inclined to favour a

Positive react i/on|)ind there had been considerable pressure for agreement, at t lre^C&lt;JI33vc i 1, on a co-ordinated European response to the United States. Th/(Fo)neign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he and ff&gt;e Secretary of Sra-fc^^or Defence had resisted any formulation in the final communique whi^^f^t beyond a commitment to further collective

consideration of the pr\rtS    ^

THE FOREIGN AND C0MM0NWEAL3^^^CRETARY said that, shortly before the WEU Council meeting, the FreMJwnad put forward their proposal for a European Research Co-ordina^T^^gency (EUREKA). The thinking behind the French proposal remained YfacS^N:; it appeared that, although it had coincided and could in theory^d^4x|.ap with consideration by Western European Governments of the UnitM/l&amp;ates invitation to participate in SDl research, no firm linkage was^fwtended. There had been little enthusiasm in the Council for the Fren^Jr initiative.

In a short discussion, it was noted thsiwpj^ United States invitation to the Europeans would need to be more jrt^cisely defined before a firm resP  nse could be given to it; and that\&gt;the scope for co-operation in research between Western European countries would require more detailed examination. The Finance Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRg), Dr Gerhardt Stoltenberg, was evidentL^-^sluctant to allocate unds to a co-ordinating agency such as thatiXpropAsed by the French, although the FRG Foreign Minister, Herr Hans-Dii^T^ Genscher, had at   ne stage appeared to be more enthusiastic aboutx^th^^roject. It was urther noted that United Kingdom law relating to ir^^Mrctual property, and in particular the fact that the publication in a^ojirf&amp;e journals of e results of scientific research precluded subsequesfrtf^ytenting, was ess satisfactory than the relevant laws obtaining in othej?^#Vntries.


   The Cabinet -

1* Invited the Secretary of State for. Trade and Industry to investigate the industrial \ implications of the present state of the law concerning intellectual property.

THE F^fAND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the resignation of the e anes?/4rruae Minister, Mr Rashid Karame, on 17 April had marked the laps^j^y/ the Syrian-inspired Government of National Unity; but that 3test rV/p    s indicated that Mr Karame1 s resignation had been withdrawn.w^There was now likely to be an attempt to put together a new government vn similar lines, and it seemed probable that Syria would av   to play a more active political role. The kidnapped British ^itizen, Mr Alec Collett. was still being held hostage. The British overnment was vfrhlDntact with the Syrian Government, the Palestine oration Organ^La^ian and the United Nations	Secretariat about

tk	but theyC~Smd so far been no response to these approaches.

e circumstances	the British Ambassador in Beirut and his

remaining staff wer^/^ypring to work continued to be extremely isagreeable, and it v^LsP/^  p ropriate to record appreciation of their efforts.

fHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALI^/^RETARY said that, following the th   3n^es concerning the Indian^c/p      ase of Westland helicopters with had ^P^33 Prime Minister, Mr RajW^G^sJhi, of which the Prime Minister informed the Cabinet on 18 wtfrifo there had been two further eetingsj on ig ang 22 April, be t^^a-^^ndian technical experts and ^  Presentatives of Westland He 1 icopterlfT^yme Indians had not raised, at ^^.er meeting, - any	of	the	technical &lt;%&lt;  rnts	mentioned	to	the Prime

w^lster by Mr Gandhi	on	13 April; indeeoS^they	had claimed ignorance of

q 3	been said on that occasion. When the Minister for Overseas

g^Ve^  Hment &gt; Mr Raison,	had	met Mr Gandhi on	24 April,	Mr	Raison had

attention to the apparent discrepancies ami^fcnconsistencies in the lan position.	He had also drawn Mr Gan^hil^ attention to the

^1.Cati  ns for the United Kingdom&apos;s aid prograwto^tX India of failure Mr lnalise the contract for the purchase of the [ijeytlLand helicopters. r Gandhi had undertaken, once more, to look into rhe^Mtuation; Hut the on remained profoundly unsatisfactory.	//xk

re 3 .sblort discussion, it was pointed out that all^nj^^conditions hel^ ln^ certification and performance evaluation of thdC/^gyland W-30 tjla^CoPter laid down	by	the	Indian Government	had been	and

West! ^ecause   f the tight delivery schedules laid down in tT^^^iract, pre ands had already embarked on manufacture. It was note^Yhift: the t^e n Indian position probably owed more to changes of perMfyrjfc^Xin relevant part of the Indian bureaucracy than to any ca^nurne


   2	technical difficulties; and that it seemed likely that recent ^contradictory Indian statements concealed a decision to renege on the Ijfontract. It was recalled that the United Kingdom&apos;s aid budget for       bad been underspent in successive years and that this had played a \&lt;y^ in the decision to make aid funds available for the purchase of the Hlopters by the Indian Government. The currently unsatisfactory would have to be brought to a head, while bearing in mind that th^/v^jSug of United Kingdom exports to India amounted to   800 million anmwj^iwand that the collapse of the helicopter contract would have grave o^fsequences for Westlands.

It was	oted that, although the Prime Minister&apos;s public statements

concernifujOfhe activities of Sikh nationalists in the United Kingdom had helped to&apos;^duce Indian hostility on this score, Indian opinion remained extremely sensitive on this issue. A close study of the statements made by the Sikh leader, Dr Chauhan, prior to the assassination of the former Prime Minister, M    \Indira Gandhi, tended to confirm that the strong and continuing Indian}) reaction to his activities was entirely understandable.

THE FOREIGN AND C0MM&lt;Wt^  !KH SECRETARY said that the two British employees of Bristow Helhdmfoers Limited in Nigeria were still under detention:	their trial h^fpbaan adjourned until 13 May as a result of

fcbe plea of double jeopardy^s^pd^ed on their behalf, on which the judge concerned had so far reservdavjro decision. The position regarding consular access to the two ch^faindes remained most unsatisfactory and tbe conditions of their detenWm^re appalling. The Nigerians had responded to British representati^Jrfs^Xth counter-allegations concerning tbe treatment in prison in the Un^e^,Kingdom of Mr Mohammed Yusufu, Sentenced for the kidnapping of the filled former Nigerian Minister for Transport, Mr Umaru Dikko; a firm reo  ^) of these allegations would be wade in a message to the Nigerian^/p*  ign Minister, Dr Gambari, uccompanied by further pressure for aVcpss to the British detainees. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary s^id that he continued to be in dose touch with the Home Secretary on the question of the request by Dikko for asylum in the United Kingdom. In general, the state of relations between the United Kingdom	Nigeria remained

unsatisfactory, but everything possible was bHing^done to resolve the

Problem.

TbE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY &apos;said that the &lt;de^^&gt;on 21 April 0 the Brazilian President-elect, Senor Tancredo Neves, ^M^created an uncertain situation, although there was some evidence	trend to

^ally round his less popular successor, the former Vice-Pres-wJei^, Senor Se Sarnay. Pressure might, however, develop for new w^inential


   elections. It seemed likely that President Sarnay would retain in \office the existing Ministers concerned with economic affairs, although /yhe would have less authority than his predecessor to carry through the ^Klicies which Brazil&apos;s economy required.

THE^^MiETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that he had undertaken an interesting visit to Japan from 15 to 19 April. It had been that the internal political situation was volatile and that the con)tVsj  &gt;to succeed the Prime Minister, Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone, was well unSer^way; the Minister for Finance, Mr Noboru Takeshita, had made n   secretvof bis own ambitions. Japanese Ministers and officials had evidently been shaken by the virulence of the United States reaction to Japanese trading policies but remained reluctant to take the requisite action, especiaLTy^kn the area of Non-Tariff Barriers.

The Secretary cfor Trade and Industry said that he had made it very clear that the~j}Qited Kingdom looked to the Japanese Government to take action on that   , as well as in the areas of capital purchases and of the opening the Japanese market, including the internal financial market. stressed the strength with which Western European countries wouWN^t to any move by Japan to conclude a deal with the United States a^xMfoir expense. It should not be forgotten, however, that the United SilraQs bore its own share of responsibility for the situation which had d&amp;ZM&amp;fod, in that it had arisen largely as a result of the United deficit and high interest rates, bilaterally, relations betwe  h^Q United Kingdom and Japan were very good; the     Japanese clearly^OlX^ a positive view of bilateral manufacturing projects and of f&amp;rth?  VJapanese investment in the United Kingdom. The Secretary of State^ro^^rade and Industry said that, on the question of a new General Agreejf^lit^on Tariffs and Trade round, he had urged the necessity for all pa^^J^ants to have a clear view of fheir objectives before a firm date foi^Aj&gt;^round was set.

TEE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he^e^sd that, following the meeting of the Interim Committee of the In^ern^c ional Monetary Fund, United States&apos; willingness to go along withNab^pr^posed international monetary conference would be given a lower prom^xh. There remained a risk, however, that this question might becomeN   ~-aJ^i/ssue at the Bonn Economic Summit on 2-4 May. The United Kingdom w^s/&gt;j&gt;  ^supporting the Suggestion.	Some other countries, including \trfr  W^ni ted States

fhemselves, saw little or no advantage&apos; but had been draww^rtjto some form   f support for the proposal. There was a risk that itrouse but n  t satisfy expectations.

3* THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that at the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on 22-23 April the Presidency had ^produced an unsatisfactory compromise. It was not sufficiently rigorous ^0 cereals, made no provision for the continuation of the beef variable w^mium, proposed unjustified changes on sheepmeat and was too generous ^^Mediterranean products. Those member states, including the United i^om, which opposed the compromise had been successful in ensuring made no progress. The major problem continued to be German   P&amp;0^rt  on to any cut in cereal support prices. The Commission had taken^^rirmer line, in particular on the budgetary consequences. There further meeting of the Council beginning on 2 May, when it ^as possVb)^&gt; that the Commission might adjust its proposals. He though xt unliid  fy that this would lead to a breach of the financial guideline^

In discussion it was pointed out, in relation to budgetary discipline, that the situatij2JK could also arise in which there was an increase in the cost above(/thaj level of the Commission&apos;s present proposals but no breach of the	a 1 guideline. In this case there could be a

question of whethrar a&gt;f not to call for a joint Council of Finance and Agriculture Minis&amp;ej^k^ The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, the Chancellor of the 0tf^p&lt;J&gt;er and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food would need ^jx^^jdAcide the United Kingdom&apos;s position, if this situation were to arisvf^Ops the beef variable premium, it was confirmed that the United Kingdom h^^luade clear the high importance it attached to the maintenance of f^fe&apos;/|\heme. On milk it was confirmed that, despite the absence of agr^cMkk on prices, the reduction in quotas had taken effect. It was to^/^axuy, particularly because of the late spring, to say now whether	would be any levy to pay under the

quota scheme in the United KiM^oprfXlater that year. It seemed likely that levy payments would be req^KCrstk in some other member states, and some levy might become due in the t  i Kingdom.

TliE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER saidN^hat the Council of Ministers (Budget) on 23-24 April had reached agreement that 1.9 billion ecu &apos;     1.1 billion) should be financed by an intergovernmental agreement in 1^85. xhe Economic Secretary had negotiatedCommission&apos;s proposed figure of 2.3 billion ecu down. The Font/^neq/eau arrangements for skating the United Kingdom&apos;s contribution w  33Ld!^Apply, so that the United Kingdom&apos;s net contribution after correctibn/^ould be reduced to ab  ut   38 million. This was less than the net^-ew^ibution of about million under the 1984 intergovernmental agreejfcjJt. The figure sgTeed by the Council of Ministers (Budget) include&lt;4/Sra^uate provision or the Commission&apos;s current agricultural price &apos;^pwopksals. The Commissioner responsible for the budget, Mr Christoj^H^^&apos;n, had not ruled out the possibility of proposing a revised	a more

expensive agricultural price package were adopted,	United

lngdom should try to prevent such a proposal. The Comrfmi)^^! s 1985 raft budget, including the United Kingdom&apos;s abatement of 1jd^kfrinillion ecu (about   580 million) would now go forward to the&apos;/J^^pean

6


   Parliament. The European Parliament might shift the United Kingdom s abatement on to the expenditure side of the budget, but might not maintain this position when the Council remained firm.
