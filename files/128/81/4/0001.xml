had	^TARY said that the Home and Social Affairs Committee (H)

a discussed the recommendation of the Committee of Inquiry into Proposals to amend the Shops Acts that shop opening hours should be completely deregulated. They had agreed with his proposal that the ^overnment should ^*j    pare legislation to give effect to that

ommendation. /Mewks committed to making an announcement of the t^ernment:&apos;s inte&apos;nDLrfJChaarly that year.

Their ^Position would have its	on Members of Parliament, especially

cle	MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that there were

to ^ advantages in an early announcement of the Government&apos;s intention   PerT^1S^ate	t*ie next Session to remove the r^t^^ictions on shop

hours. The ensuing debate would give some pointers to the Thg lculties which might be encountered with subs5qtf  nr\ legislation, dis WaS 3 danger that the existing law would be xjjc*4&gt;rftingly c^a^e^ayhe&lt;f during the period between the announcment^^M^ie forthcoming but ln the law and the coming into effect of the new&apos;dra&amp;slation;

Cab^v^^^**^ MINISTER said that, at their meeting the previous week the agreed to resume discussion later of the Ministry of Defence ^ era^k^&apos;two further Type 22 frigates. As a result of further hadCUSS	t*ie Ministers most closely concerned, new proposals

Se 6611 &apos;wrculated to the Cabinet under cover of a minute from the cretaryy,f the Cabinet to the Lord Chancellor of 25 January . The mai&quot; features were -

a&gt; One of/rTnyvtwo orders for Type 22 frigates should be placed with Camme\M_ iWird (CL) and the other with Swan Hunter (SH) on the basis of exia&apos;MrTkN tenders .

b   One Type 12&amp;fryta.te. should be ordered from SH on a single tender basis.

c* The Secretary of/^a.te for Defence would absorb in the Defence budget the extra d i	t s (  7 million) of ordering one Type 22

frigate from CL rathe^i^Ap\ SH and the cost of whatever cash mjection into CL would^foOi^cessary to keep open the option of Privatising CL. The Der^nc^budget would also absorb any aHditional cost arising fn  o&lt;f^^rtting a Type 23 contract to SH on a n  n-competitive tender.

b    The indirect losses of thi^proposal (  1.5 million at SH and fb million at CL) would add E6.&lt;&apos;^m|  i3^ion to the External Financing Limit (EFL) of British Shipbuilde^^XBJ) in 1985-86. There could also be an adverse effect on the receipts of the Yarrow Privatisation (possibly of the orde^of   5-10 million). This would require a corresponding further adjustment to the EFL of BS.

3* THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Libyan authorities had conveyed a message to the Italian Ambassador in Tripoli to the effect that the decision to release the four British hostages was now final. The arrangements for the release of the hostages might \nevertheless take some days yet, and it was also clear that the Libyans Wpected the British Government to reciprocate with a goodwill gesture ^JjAPositive political signal of some kind. The Archbishop of CYy^rbury   s Special Envoy, Mr Terry Waite, had been authorised to the Libyans that the British Government could accept their for special arrangements to be made with regard to visas for a VlKp^t*kthe United Kingdom by relatives of Libyans detained here. The 0utc^lP*rmvertheless remained uncertain.

he FOREIGN^AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that despite the formal leakdown of talks between the Israelis and the Lebanese, the first Phase of the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon would be completed by 18 P^tfpvtary. The Israelis would do their best to co-operate with iha fcal^anese authorities in averting bloodshed but the e anese Government/tfS^Will failed to make the clear and specific bequest to the UnitaS^^^ons which was necessary if the United Nations n ^national Force iiM^ifcdnon was to play a positive role in this. It seemed likely that the yi&amp;&amp;fcse Government felt unable to take this step without Syrian approval.&lt;/^^Joreign and Commonwealth Secretary said at he had already been iry^rfNact touch with the Lebanese Prime mister on the matter and^^rs/^nsidering a direct approach to the Yuan Government as well.

Min&apos; THE F0REIGN AN0 COMMONWEALTH SECRET^^said that the Council of nisters (Foreign Affairs) on 28-29 January had made little or no pQ  ?r  ss   n the accession of Spain and Portugal. The Community&apos;s agreed be ltl0? on fisheries and on certain agr icultural^ssues, however, had 0n6n maiotained in the negotiations in line witn^Un^ted Kingdom views. pr related question of integrated Mediterran&amp;3b&lt;^*5sgrammes the new muphldent   f the Commission, Monsieur Delors, was tt6Wjta.to propose a more modest programme.


   

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said there had been further iscussion in the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on ~29 January of the revised decision on the Community&apos;s own resources ^and on the financing of the 1985 budget overrun. The Germans were now /^lraost isolated. He had received conflicting replies from Herr &apos;nnscher&gt; the German Foreign Minister, to the question whether the

Government would be willing to go along with solutions acceptable United Kingdom and the majority of member states. The Commission resident responsible for the budget, Mr Christopherson, had &apos;	that the 1985 budget overrun was now estimated by the

     5&apos;is^\n to be higher than the earlier figure of 1300 million ecu. In r  Ply^Ce^&amp;  d made clear that such estimates would need to be scrutinised p1 e^V&apos;eniA. care. The previous year&apos;s experience showed that the    niss$^&lt;%&apos; estimate of additional financial needs had been stanti^/W&gt;above the amount finally required.



THE MINISTER OF A^I^LTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that the Commission now made its	Is for agricultural support prices for 1985/86.

r most products tl^y&gt;\imission proposed a price freeze or cuts. For    Principal cereaT&amp;I^^^net effect of the guarantee theshold and the ProP  sal would	of 3.6 per cent in the intervention price.

t r miTkj on which the 45^^v?rran8eraents had been introduced, the ^rget price would rise 6y\&gt;^&gt;&gt;per cent. The price proposals would give inSe to serious problems	iation among Agricultural Ministers:

onn particular, the southern^mtfir states would strongly resist the cuts forMed^erranean Products anV-  ^n^ny would oppose any fall in support grain. in discussion it w&amp;T&apos;w&amp;d that any increase in the target 1Ce ^or milk was not justified^^/,%

TtWur^djusted figures showed an increase of nearly 122,000 .j-tween Decembei^~i48ti&gt;^nd January 1985, while there was an increase of &gt;000 on a seasoKm/ad jus ted basis. The average monthly increase in the seasonally adjus^rf/figure had fallen to 9,000 over the last three    onths, as against lbyWj^during the previous three months. The flow of vacancies was conM^M at a high level, and the indications from e private sector weretltm^prospec ts for new job opportunities were   ow better than they had &lt;Jx^rVfor some years. In commenting on the 1gcres he would draw a11o the continuing adverse impact on employment of the miners    stp*k  \and to the importance of moderating e growth of earnings if newVjsb^Swere to be created at a faster rate. t tFl0ugh the numbers unemploye^^wl/^ at a record level in absolute th 1118     ^ percentage terms they f^jalivl^ed well below the 1930s peak, when wie burden of unemployment fell a1m#&gt;t\^exclusively on men (as compared ^ tbe present position when wom^rTa^^ounted for 1 million of the taF 3*3 million unemployed).

RETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he had considered the m^nne^^which the 40th Anniversary of Victory in Europe (VE Day) should ^^mmemorated in the United Kingdom. He had been impressed by the stre^fcth of public feeling in favour of a commemoration which emphasisecr the theme of peace and by the extent of support for a commemorative service in Westminster Abbey, in view of the presence there of the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior. On the question of the most aPPropriate dat/^fbjh the commemoration, he had considered the Possibility of (ZbptMing one which fell between VE Day and the anniversary 0f t^VT^tory over Japan (VJ Day), but had decided in avour of the ac tuAl^  /\Day anniversary, which fell on 8 May. He therefore intended^*ke arrangements on this basis. These

arrangements would prd(ftpNfor those who were killed in the war against apan to be properly c^^^m^rated in the service on 8 May. He would   ive further consideratioff/&apos;j^ the question whether and, if so, how to commemorate VJ Day, bear itf  j^ft\mind that this anniversary fell in the middle of the summer holicf^j^j^jod.

CqE b0RD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that ths&apos;/HD^ie and Social Affairs S0cmittee (R) had discussed a proposal from th^vj^e^yt^tary of State for SeCl*l Services to bring forward urgent legislati/yTTy) the current mo(.fl0n outlaw commercial practices in connectl^anoji^h surrogate intherh    d* The recent case of &quot;baby Cotton&quot; had a^fefed mucb public fi ?rest and concern about the operations of commericifl&gt;  &amp;encies in this th ^ and there was considerable public and Parliameiu^^j^&apos;^jressure for the G  Vernment to take action. Such legislation would be^p^line with and peCOmmendations of the Committee of Inquiry into Hum&amp;MSe|\tilisation how Embryol  gy (The Warnock Committee). H Committee had 3e .Ver&gt; that it would be preferable to deal with this aspeiTj^riS^he Seslsiati  n which it was intended to bring forward in the foSN^wj^N*

Sl  n to implement the Warnock recommendations as a whole.


   introduction of earlier legislation would allow insufficient time to think through the often complex issues, particularly legal issues, in \ this field, in view of the political and Parliamentary concern, nhowever,it was right for Cabinet to take the final decision.

y\P&amp;PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that the C$7r  duction of commercial practices in connection with surrogate yvMJ^hood raised political and moral issues wich demanded an urgent from the Government. If legislation could successfully be for early introduction this would be the best course. In view, howey^^of the uncertainties over whether the legal issues that arose C0Ul^M5p/dequately dealt with in the context of early legislation, a Syoup	Ministers primarily concerned should examine the proposed

ill in waft and report whether any insuperable problems were raised.

Cont    	STATE FOR ENERGY said that the return to work was

lnuing at rather less than half the previous week&apos;s rate. Following Per Unsuccessffil^eeting on 29 January between Mr Spanton, Member for Secr  nne^ 3t	Coal Board (NCB) and Mr Heathfield, General

lnv^tary   f Chy^iJpt^nal Union of Mineworkers (NUM), the NCB had cl     6	. e NUM to specify the constructive new initiatives they had

Con(.I!le^ Che meave made. It seemed likely that the NUM would prec^^r rest	on their willingness to have talks without

*-he NUM11&quot;^0118* There^ras^io indication that Mr Scargill, President of 0r * had changed his position about the closure of uneconomic pits pre at a majority of the NUM&apos;s National Executive were at present c  uld h t0   PPose him. Negotiations were unlikely to be successful and was h 6 C*rawn out hy the NUM t^^.ow down the drift back to work. It resumeWeVer amP  rCanC that th^M  onsibility for any failure either to sett-] neS  tiations or, if negl^J^Aons were resumed, to reach a thp ement should be seen to res*t!:Vvlb Che NUM rather than the NCB or

ne Government.
