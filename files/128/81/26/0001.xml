There was no doubt that Cabinet I^a^fiken the right decisions on the report of the Top Salaries Review BodV/^n if they had not fully foreseen the volume of protest to which th^Vhad given rise.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE	THE ENVIRONMENT said that he understood that

a statement was to be mac  ^t&amp;t day about the Government&apos;s intention to lntr0duce a Confirmation	the southern route for the proposed

  Rehampton By-pass. He agrea4^Hh the underlying decision but it would    fiercely contested by cons^^/awion interests, and it might be better to Postpone a statement for	being.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSP^MWaid that debate about a by-pass 0r Okehampton had been going on	20 years. If a decision was

not taken now in favour of the soutrarjvp^ute it was his judgment that anY by-pass for okehampton was uniike&lt;f^U  &gt;be built much before the end   f the century. The by-pass was imports^[J&gt;^sr the local economy; there Was great pressure locally for the issut^T^W decided, and a large majority of those Conservative backbenchef&amp;^mo had expressed a view Were in favour of the southern line. The d^iouncemnt would be controversial, and the subsequent Bill would no doubt be vigorously   Pposed by conservation interests; but he saw nothing to be gained from delay.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion ^^rfS^that the Cabinet agreed that action on a by-pass for Okehampton shouMjnotfbe further elayed, that the proposed statement should be made	the Recess,

THE	OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that he would be

announ^tf^j:hat afternoon the main decisions on the rate support grant Settlemen^/for England for 1986-87. The decision to abolish targets and as^trS^Sted penalities responded to pressure over several years, especiallyYYr^ Government supporters in the shire counties and low-spendirfexauthorities, and should be widely welcomed. He would be

emphasising/^however, that it had only been possible to take this decision because rate limitation was available to restrain the exPenditure of the high-spending authorities and that the settlement was nonetheless a touaK^o^e using block grant pressures.

THE PRIME MINISTER/&quot;VutfffitYig up a brief discussion, said that it was important to put ov e	these points strongly. The fact that the

abolition of targets	many authorities, including Government

Supporters, had been pre/  raj\for for some time should not be over-emphasised. The setX&amp;W%I would not be universally popular; it would have a particularly sey^  e\effeet on some councils which had only nome under Conservative conn^rja recent years and where it had not yet een possible to bring the le&amp;SS^X&amp;f previous high-spending completely ander control. The precise eff^pAMi these and other cases would, owever, depend on the details ox&gt;t$sy settlement which would not be ecided until later that year.

eached on 24 July between the Indian Prime MinistenTMyy Rajiv Gandhi, the President of the Sikh Akali Dal Party, Sant tkHCTSnd Singh 0ngowalJ to end the crisis in the Punjab was a very &lt;Mi%A&lt;&amp;rable achievement. The major difficulty had been to overcomeCwx&apos;S^kh fader&apos;s unwillingness to engage in compromise and thus ^agreement with the extremists in his party. There was	chance

at the agreement would be effective, despite the risk of actions to sabotage it.

AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Sikh Asian Games ^	/v&lt;\t0 take place from 26 to 28 July at West Bromwich and other

loca^onJ  \i.n the Birmingham area. This year&apos;s games had been named in honoui^^fj^e two aneged assassins of the former Prime Minister of lndia, ^r^Jadira Gandhi. The Indian High Commission in London had aPProach #For eign and Commonwealth Office and the Horae Office about the matter^/*^ had said that the naming of the games in this way was a Serious insist to India. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary Proposed thar approaches should urgently be made to the Members of Parliament for constitutencies in the area where the games would take Place, to the loca ^authority there, and to the University of Aston in trmingham, where /yffeVbockey tournament would take place.

1   discussion, the f^^^^ing points were made:

a   The Governmei&lt;  yrc^A no power under law to order cancellation of the games. This	regre t table, since the naming of the

games for Mrs Gandhi&lt;&amp;\vr^eged assassins amounted to an expression   f approval for murdery/wNvouId cause deep offence in the United Kingdom as well as in IiWiaj)

h. Given that the event ^Du^a^not be banned, the right approach would be to use every possiWl^^iyeans to secure the withdrawal of the naming of the games for MrA/^y^\Ah i1 s alleged assassins. The leaders of the Sikh community	be told in no uncertain terms

that such naming of the games Wcrejr^e^ignant to the Government and to British opinion. It was poss i1$&lt;  ^j3^at some of the people indirectly involved, such as the VT^S^CJ^ncellor of the University   f Aston and the Chairman of SandwelSMKstrict Council, were not aware that the persons for whom the g^ses had been named were in fact the alleged assassins.

c* The games had not so far attracted publa^I^v. Efforts by the Government to secure the withdrawal of the rt^miiii of the games for the alleged assassins could stimulate publicthe other hand, it was in the Government&apos;s interest that	for ts to

secure a change in the offensive naming of the g^jKg^/should receive publicity. Such publicity should help in partici^ar/^^s. show the Indian Government that everything possible had beeu^xro^to secure a change.

d* While the Indian Government understood the dif f icu^cie^&apos;s. arising from the British legal system with regard, for in^WjWJ to deportation of Sikhs to India, it could not understand why^tn^ British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) sometimes paid favou  aW&amp;p sttention in its broadcasts to the activities of Sikh dissid\\


   the United Kingdom. The Government should therefore try to ensure that the BBC did not pay great attention to the Sikh Asian Games.

PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that urgent X^&amp;Proaches should be made to Sandwell District Council, the University &apos;^v3y4ston, the leaders of the Sikh community and other individuals who

have influence in the matter, in order to secure the withdrawal of \A^I&gt;ay&apos;ing of the games for Mrs Gandhi&apos;s alleged assassins. High level should also be made to the BBC and the other radio and tel^f(An news organisations in the United Kingdom about the ur&gt;desi^^r^ity of major publicity for this matter.

Africa. The Canadian Government appeared to be moving in the same &lt;*  w^  ion as France. There was a major risk that the African members of    ^s^^urity Council would seek to amend the French draft resolution to Pandatory. The United Kingdom Government should seek to avoid Sanc(j^cm&gt;k against South Africa, which would bring major economic loss to    this	while also avoiding isolation on this matter and the

There would be a majority in the United Nations Security Council for a resolution about sanctions against South Africa; the questions were whafV^rtiyt resolution would contain and whether, if the United Kingdom had^ojvs  o it, she would do so alone or in company with the United States, ((j)

Tn discussion it was pointed out thV  \tj^proposed United States restrictions on steel imports posed ddrae^*-isks to trade, which would be harmful both to the United States them&lt;^  &gt;e^ and to the United Kingdom. The United States should be made aware	they were to take_

AppAlRS

THE PRIME &apos;MINISTER said that the talks at official level with the Irish Government^authorised by the Cabinet in February 1984, had reached the stage where ^Kr^t agreement had been prepared. The state of play in the talks was cufs&lt;jribed in the memorandum by the Foreign and Commonwealth Sefrfl^w and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (C(85) 20) of 23 Tujiokfo which the draft agreement was appended.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE^$% NORTHERN IRELAND, introducing the joint memorandum, said that^he core of the proposed agreement was that the Irish Republic would have a consultative role in relation to a range of Northern Ireland affairs, but decision-making would remain in British hands. The United Kingdom Government would seek to use the machinery set up for consulting the Irish^^ernment in order to obtain much more systematic co-operation with AX  u.sh Republic on security matters.

The main potential benefits o^^roi  |jpji|reement on the lines proposed were that it should provide a prospe^^Jj^taie one hand of greater ef fectiveness in the fight again^, terror ism and on the other hand of unfeeling attitudes of the nationalistMinority to the institutions of government in Northern Ireland and ^us^ducing the reluctance of the minority to participate in political YjjpJ^He judged that the agreement Went about as far as it could be prude^5^W^&gt;: not much further concession should be made to the Irish GW^rtient, for instance regarding the question of joint courts or^reg^^ing the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) or the Ulster Defence Re^ment (UDR). The unionist reaction to an agreement on the lines proposed would be very negative;

ut his present judgment was that it should be manageable. If that Judgment were to alter before the time came to sign an agreement, the matter would have to be reconsidered. It was importai^that opposition an agreement should be channelled as far as poss^fe|^into Parliament. The first meeting of the Intergovernmental CommissidR io be established y the agreement should not be held until Parliament	QVe^

agreement. An agreement on the lines proposed could b   o   substantial enefit to Northern Ireland, especially through its long-^^Hr^^effects. ut it was not a solution to the problem of Northern	would

e only a step forward, and there was a risk that the intef*^^i|B^l reactions to it, notably in the United States, could overestimate its lmP  rtance. The Government should therefore present an agreeiflfcmw. Public in modest terms.


   THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that during the negotiations the arrangements sought by the Irish Government had been greatly scaled    down. xhe proposed agreement did not involve any kind of joint iWj&apos;thority. On the other hand, it did include good features from the ^f^itish point of view, notably concerning the status of Northern Ireland ^3p|gthe prospect of improved co-operation with the Irish Republic over    ^Wity. He agreed that the first meeting of the Intergovernmental Commission should take place only after Parliament had considered the agreement. He also agreed that it would be important to present the agreement modestly, so that it was not seen internationally as more important than it was. On the other hand, failure to achieve an agreement would have a serious effect on the United Kingdom&apos;s internatifcW^J.mage. This applied especially in the United States, where supfort for the Irish Northern Aid Committee (NORAID) could grow again.

In discussion \4||pv^llowing points were made -

a.	The OfTiAft^Unionist Party would probably seek to focus its protests at an Anglo-Irish agreement in the Parliamentary channel. Mr Ian Paisle^^^e Democratic Unionist Party might well try to destroy an Anglo-^Mp^ agreement. To do so, he would need to unite unionist opinion,&apos; which would nowadays be difficult. The most dangerous development would be industrial action, which Mr Paisley might try to organise. He had failed with this method in the late 1970s, and the workforce today was less politicised and less likely to react violently to an a^hement. The Government had contingency plans for dealing with stefn&apos; and experience suggested that a determined Government cou^Ail^t strikes in Northern Ireland.

The later an agreement was Signed in the year, the nearer the possible period for strikes	to Christmas, and the harder

it would be for Mr Paisley to iWm^Uihem successfully. If, however, (as was possible) unio^R^s^e act ions to an Anglo-Irish agreement were much stronger than^&gt;|wPjtfitly foreseen, and the Government came to the view that tree reaction would not be containable, the agreement would havmjb^^ reconsidered.

b- The question of joint courts was fJfrtiCularly difficult. The Government had made it absolutely clear to the Irish authorities that we could not agree to the principle of establishing joint courts; the furthest we could go was to agree that the new Intergovernmental Commission should consider the Mssibility of establishing joint courts. But the dif f icultie^l^nijl objections that could be foreseen made it unlikely that su^^H|w^ideration would lead to the establishment of joint courts. ,No farther concession on this matter could be made to the Irish, jffl^re was indeed a danger that if the agreement provided for c*i||ration of the possibility of establishing joint courts, that co^|^^j|ve an over-encouraging impression of the likelihood of the British Government being able to agree to their establishment. Moreover, reference to joint courts in the agreement could be a spanflnkjro, would ignite loyalist violence in reaction to an agreement^^.Frjk


   this point of view, it would be preferable to have no reference to joint courts in the agreement. On the other hand, the Irish Government, and the Taoiseach personally, attached great importance to joint courts and had not yet been brought to agree that the wording on the subject presently in the draft agreement was sufficient. It was most improbable that the Irish Government would l conclude the agreement if the British Government insisted on having I&apos;t&apos;o reference in it to joint courts. It might be possible in the Intergovernmental Commission to explore without commitment the question of what actually constituted a joint or mixed court. The wording on joint courts presently in the agreement might also be recons idered.

c.	i|l  ^refuse a unionist call for the recall of Parliament would ris^ffl^^elling on to the street unionist reactions to an agreement and stimulating criticism more widely in Parliament. On the otlner haM, to recall Parliament early would pose major problems xpfer^cjge business managers. It would be greatly preferable^, therefore, for the agreement to be signed at a time when Parlia^^JPya its normal course of business could debate it.

An Anglo-Iri^ Summit to sign an agreement might be fitted into the Prime Ministe^^?^!i|fcry between 24 and 31 October 1985.

d.	The difficul^^iT delaying signature of an agreement until October was that rumour and speculation would proliferate, making it difficult to hold the agreement together. This difficulty might

reduced if an interim statement about the negotiations was made by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland; but such a statement could, unless v||rml^refully worded, send the wrong signals.

e.	The Opposition in the I^Sp^^liament would no doubt denounce

an Anglo-Irish agreement on thj  fli#s proposed as a sell-out to the British. But the Taoiseach and^^Acish Foreign Minister would present the agreement as a step	and majority opinion in

the Irish Republic would be likely^Ku^Kept this. The Irish Government would not sign the agreet^  |^^ess it was satisfied that the Social Democratic and Labou^^arSk (SDLP) in Northern Ireland would endorse it. SDLP endorse^fTt^was also important from the British point of view:	the Irish Government&apos;s behaviour in the

Intergovernmental Commission would be greatly influenced by the SDLP, and the Irish Government might even withdraw from the Commission unless the SDLP was satisfied with the Commission&apos;s performance.	   

f* Any steps concerning the RUC or the UDR, wh^B|  !^Suited Kingdom might take in the context of concluding an^a^j^ment with th Irish Republic, should be justified on their merrc|jp!Sj| not on Presentational grounds alone.


   g. Paragraph 3 of the text for an agreement should be clarified: the final clause - &quot;as set out in this agreement&quot; - should come earlier in the paragraph, to follow more or less directly the word , &quot;deal&quot;.

      &apos;&apos;i h. The risk of concluding an agreement on the lines proposed was .life, that the present situation of relative stability in Northern ^^^Ireland might turn into one of conflict. On the other hand, the

proposed agreement presented significant advantages, notably in the security field, and on balance it seemed worth taking the risk involved. The alternative of not proceeding with the agreement would leave the Government with the depressing option of mainrtaiuing direct rule, while trying to make it more palatable in Nor^ern Jreland, and continuing the very expensive struggle agaSfe the terrorism of the Provisional Irish Republican Army.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet considered on^^y.^Mce that the Government should seek to conclude an agreement on thX^Cqes proposed, subject to developments on the ground in Northern Ireland and provided that there was a good prospect that the SDLP would supporRlSOkd support the Irish Government in carrying out the provisions of l^fc^ig*ement. The wording concerning the question of joint courts in the	agreement should be further considered in

the light of the discussion. The Cabinet should discuss the proposed agreement again before it was signed. Signature should take place while Parliament was sitting, so that the reactions of the unionists might be focused in the Parliamentary channel. Talks with the Irish Government at official ievei should meanwhj^^be pursued. Careful thought should be glVen to the public presentation of an agreement.

The Cabinet -

Invited the Prime Minister, thffiEo%ign and Commonwealth Secretary and the S^plWkry of State for Northern Ireland:	^

a.	to be guided accordingly negotiations with the Irish Government;

b.	to bring the proposed agreement back for further consideration by the Cabinet before it was signed.
