Challenges V

to the	&lt;

Government 10 Courts

MINISTER said that the Government&apos;s power to implement policy under existing legislation was being increasingly challenged in h^^O^ts and it seemed that more and more cases were being lost. It was nuclear whether these defeats arose from failure properly to pyeP^2^3jl)d draft legislation, or whether they reflected changes in circurtf^/f(np^s which could not have been foreseen when legislation was first   MjPced:	perhaps there was some truth in both propositions. One

very significant factor was the changed relationship between central and local government on which new examples were arising all the time. A number of Welsh local authorities had, for example, taken the Secretary   f State for Transport to court in respect of increases in tolls of the Severn Bridge. /V&amp;yyjrther example was the action being taken by certain Scottish authoi^^i^L^to prevent siting of Trident missiles at the Faslane submarine/blisM in Scotland. Legislation was drafted on a basis that those affect\^d^&lt;6j*pld be expected to behave reasonably, at any rate s   far as local aut^w^ies were concerned; but local authorities could no longer be counted	the agents or partners in good faith of

central government. S^^a^necessary to examine new legislation very carefully to ensure that^t^rmld withstand the sorts of pressures that were now becoming commonf&gt;  a  ^\\

pHE HOME SECRETARY said that there w5w\53^rcreas ing pressure on Members of ^rUameat from those who opposed the MMay opening provisions of the   PS Bill} though it was clear that th^^e opponents of the Bill who ^re Rooking for compromise were far fronr agreed on what it should be.

THE Prime MINISTER, summing up a brief discussytonJ?aid that the

It was important that any compromisaAg^nAion which might suggested in the House of Lords should not movel^W the area of employment protection for young people.

  HE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that recent events in the House of Commons in gelation to the Johnson Matthey Bankers and the Channel Fixed Link had ^ghlighted the difficulties involved in the declaration of Members&apos; interests and in Parliamentary privilege. The conventions relating to declaration of interest in relation to a matter being discussed by House were no longer as clear as they had been and recent events had that neither Members nor the Speaker could be relied upon to /them, as before. There was to be a debate on the Report from ^^Jjp^lect Committee on Members&apos; Interests on Tuesday 17 December, but

iteration might be required after this before any action was The i-ssue was being used by elements of the Opposition in an p	discredit Conservative Members, including members of the

This issue paralleled the exploitation of Parliamentary Privild^a^to make allegations about members of the Government in ^elatiorv^o certain financial scandals and so to insinuate that the nservative Party were ready to protect those involved in financial rca Practice or fraud. It would be necessary to undo this harm during e progress	Financial Services Bill and other debates which

would take plap/e tWe following year on the banking and financial services sectoK^/&apos;~&apos;x

In discussion, it^isi^j^mbinted out that there was grave difficulty in responding to alleg^^n^ that the Government was protecting the Perpetrators 0f frauc^vfJfejXfraud investigations took so long. At Y s in particularseemed to be extraordinary problems in ecuring sufficient eviderf^J^to prosecute those who had already been investigated by Lloyds tn^m  !lyVes. It was not clear whether the time xng taken in such invesc^gtu^iAns resulted from lack of adequately pUR	staff in the FrautP^u^ and the Department of the Director of

U 1C Prosecutions, or whethhr^ijO was due to the inherent difficulty of pro ucing sufficiently firm ev^rfaWp^ to convince a jury. Lord Roskill&apos;s report on the procedures to be	dealing with fraud cases in the

courts was expected to be published^tfltfore the Second Reading of the

mancial Services Bill but it was known what its recommendations would be.

THE Prime MINISTER, summing up the discfc^^Lon, said that it was s	essential that those investigating complex frauds should have

wU l h   ^ resources to undertake their investigtions swiftly. She ^ou ask the Attorney General to report on the resources of the new ParV* ^rosecut:*-on Service in this respect. As     &lt; the exploitation of ^ar lamentary privilege by Opposition Members /^&quot;&quot;rarliament to impugn e motives of members of the Government, the \gj}Sw3^s.lay in the first coaCe t*le hands of the Speaker. Every effort ^VlouM be taken to ounteract any suggestions that the Government we&lt;e^r^tecting those who re suspected of fraud; or impropriety.	^11/5

fR [HEWASTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE AK0NES9OY0UNG) said that the United States Secretary of State,

Mr George Shultz, had held meetings in London on 10 December with the rime Minister and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary. With the oreign and ConwfJ&gt;3&amp;ealth Secretary, Mr Shultz had unexpectedly raised 6 9uestion o((th4) United States budgetary deficit. He had said that e Gramm-Rudman^MlJe^Hment to the Debt Ceiling Bill was likely to be Passed in the Hnit^diJtates Senate. It would introduce a degree of automaticity withVerfa^ to reductions in the budget, which in time could affect the deMrtK^mdget.

THE PRIME MINISTER saiw*t^a)Lher talk with Mr Shultz had concentrated on sub&apos;^n^teC* 8tates Strate^i^^kfence Initiative (SDI) and related 1	a60*   8*	next Summi(gleaning between the United States and Soviet

s^a ecs was likely to take^I^e^in June or July 1986. The United

ates Administration appear^hS^hope for the same kind of intellectual contribution to their policy	from the United Kingdom as the

atter had made through the Q,awtfJlp&amp;LA four points at an earlier stage ln the discussion of the SDI.	y\

a&quot;1 3 s^ort discussion, it was pointed^Jut that the Gramm-Rudman men ment, which had been passed in ^j|  djraited States Senate on the Previous evening, was designed to put^r^x^re on the United States k ministration to curb the budgetary de^tfit. In this it was likely to ^u(_succ  ssful    The amendment was therefbyje a welcome development, omatic cuts in the budget were foreseen only as a last resort.

The Forvfjj^v^nd Secm  nWea^t^ Secretary had discussed the matter with the JJj0  hd States satre^ry State on 10 December. Neither had been optiirfv^t^a that It kS aCt  ry amendments to the New Zealand legislation couiit4^\ecured. should ^6en aSresd that the public comments of the two Gover^&amp;V^ u be as few and as unprovocative as possible. The Unite^Jpr^es


   ^as eoncerned that other countries might emulate the New Zealand \ bu^lH a,:^?n, and *-n particular that pressures in this direction might t ^ ^ Aus*:ral:ta* The United States Administration had warned lf afverse legislation was enacted in New Zealand, they would &apos;V^^iew their obligations to that country under the ANZUS Treaty, though might well leave the the ANZUS Treaty intact, as an inducement to C&apos;^jfJv^ealand return to more acceptable policies. The next step for ^^^^ted Kingdom would be to agree with the United States about the to^fJlTvb111 t*le ^6W ^ealan&lt;^ legislation which would be necessary in order Mor	t^e tW   countries to resume naval visits to New Zealand,

re YaXTx*16 ^eW ^ea^an&lt;^ legislation was not the only problem. Before Q~SUmr!r/y^l visits to New Zealand the United States would want an but N x?  ramrrie   r such visits which included all classes of vessels; res ew	was unwilling to accept visits by cruisers. Failure to

int VS t^16 ma*:*:er could have implications for Western security erests, as well as for bilateral relations with New Zealand.

Mr D S^?rt disc/^s^n, it was noted that the New Zealand Prime Minister, v  g^avi ban8e&gt;\&gt;aDp^*j^ed deliberately to have closed the door on naval not;1 ? means ofivfh^jproposed legislation. British naval ships could COu Vlsit Mew ZealV^sjK^ri&apos;hile such legislation was in force. The only seemed to be	t until there was another New Zealand

the minister of state, foreign and commonwealth office said that the

oreign and Commonwealth Secretary had held thorough talks with the ^ rime Minister, Senor Felipe Gonzalez, and the Foreign Minister,

/i&gt;enor Fernandez Ordonez, of Spain in Madrid on 5 and 6 December. The s had been dominated, as expected, by the question of Gibraltar.

Ministers had adopted a hard-hitting approach in private but public line had been reasonably restrained. Senor Gonzalez had Tp^RRted to argue that the British commitment to respect the views of ^^-^altarians was a ploy which was likely to cause prolonged delay   n&apos;^/^Jesti  n of the sovereignty of Gibraltar. He had said that, if Un&apos;	tWeen the United Kingdom and Spain were to prosper, the

n 11e^N^^  gdiom must agree a framework in which a solution on this matter c  uld t^/^^ght within three years.

Sec3	discussion, it was noted that the Foreign and Commonwealth

retary had given a firm reaction to the unjustified suggestion of a new framework for considering the sovereignty of Gibraltar. Spain would wish to put^Jt^Nrisk her valuable bilateral relationship with the kingdom (/specially since the interests of the two countries Wlt m the Europ  ^rf^^mniunity would often coincide.

perhaps 40 or 50 extreme opjh^JJetfh^i of the Agreement had attempted to assault the police outside tlraTs^ryatariat building. A march of some ,00 workers from Short Brotnwrt^Jumited and Harland and Wolff Limited a taken place in the middle or^m/^&lt;&amp;ay but it had not lasted long ecause the management of the tw&lt;xfjp^  ^had insisted that workers should Return to work after their lunch b^fak^^The meeting of the intergovernmental Conference had tak^J^pi-ace in a good atmosphere. ere had been progress on the major	of enhanced cross-border

The rish side had accepted this in a constructive ^^TlsYt. As the Joint stement on the meeting said, the Irish Goverimgntvliad agreed that ter^3 fesources should be deployed in the border^^^to combat

rrorism. There was now hope for much broader coA^p^Ation with the P _c* There would, however, be no instant succa^&amp;/ in combating ^errorism and there might be setbacks.

The early television reports of the meeting of the IntergoveWinw^vl

erence had concentrated on the demonstrations, but later r  p  y/s*had


   ^ given due prominence to the strengthening of the Garda deployments in

tl}e border area. It was unfortunate that press reports that morning had highlighted the plan to introduce a new Code of Conduct for the RUC; the _^^eports had ignored the clear statement in the Joint Statement on the o*Am^eting that the Chief Constable of the RUC had for some time been &apos;\^5^Paring such a code, and had thus given the impression that its V^  p^duction might be a concession to the Irish side.

Moreover, some people in Northern Ireland were D^S^nning to say that the Anglo-Irish Agreement should be looked at more clv^^y, Any trend away from outright opposition to the Agreement and towards an objective analysis of its merits would help the

Government.

THE SECRETARY OF S^M^OR ENERGY said that it was an objective of tbe members of the OrganiS^^pn of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) both to try to keep thei^^Swe^tauota arrangements in effect and to put pressure on countries outa^^//he Organisation to cut down oil production. Saudi Arabia	willing in the past to reduce its own

production in order to keep \JsTr  rPisutput by OPEC countries within the target area but, for balance cv^rayments and other reasons, was no longer willing to do so. At th^/r^clrtat OPEC meeting it had been clear   th that OPEC countries wished ro^mi^i^tain their quotas and that, espite the effect on price, Saudi^kraJypa would now be ready to bring rts production more nearly into ling  ^1jih&quot;\its quota. The conclusions of this meeting and the remarks of SheilSi^Mani, the Chairman of the Ministerial Executive Committee of OPE^X^a given rise to a fall in oil prices. It would be wrong for the UnitM^Kingdom to react to this by reducing the volume of North Sea oil procwlction. The United Kingdom had consistently made clear that the Government did not control and was not prepared to control commercial oil production in this way. It would, in any event, make little difference to world prio^?T\\ The current estimate was that, if OPEC countries respected their quiU~a J/ymres, supply and emand would not be seriously outf of balance.	did not, prices

were liable to fall further after the winter.
