IN CABY  &gt;

    THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to the publication of reports in ^ e press and other media on 6 and 7 June 1985 which purported to -cl  se what had passed in the course of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion of     e legislative programme for 1985-86 at its meeting on 6 June, and   *X*rticularly an exchange of views about whether a measure to deregulate Private rented housing should be included in the programme. The ^^Rlosures in these reports had been an embarrassment to Department of xVv&apos;^&apos;Vlr  nment Ministers in subsequent debates in the House of Commons.

clear that the information on which these reports were based was wheO^AV	Flanc*s tFie j  urnalists concerned by 3.30 pm on 6 June,

inf	Press Secretary had been asked to comment. The

r^titfe could not have come from him, because he had not been presant^^^hg cabinet meet;ing and did not know what had passed at it. rePa^g%were sufficiently accurate (though they were not entirely or iclear that the disclosure could have come only from Cab6006	at the meeting. It would be generally agreed by the

thatVit was deplorable that such disclosures should be made.

^ rankness indispensable for effective Cabinet discussion depended on c 6 Proceedings and^exchanges of view in Cabinet being kept in strict b     1 en(ye* If mMrtSer\s of a Cabinet could not rely on that confidence 1[ig maintained, \fc^e^-would be inhibited in their readiness to express Slr vlews freely awomankly in discussion.

It was pointed out in ^^  *&gt;sion that some of the press reports in offistion had referred to^^^dance&quot; on what had occurred. Once reports Cab     1S	came out, jcwfhjajp^ts inevitably rang up members of the

cr	^  r comment* In ths^^^ircumstances a Minister could not

t 1 ^ claim ignorance, and^aruything he said by way of comment would en to be described as &quot;guid  5  3^J\

this^^^ MINISTER, summing up C^^scussion, said that the lesson of of s episode was that it was essenyj4  oto maintain the confidentiality proceedings in the Cabinet; she^ru^Wid that all her colleagues would guided accordingly.

It was not, however, possible at this stage to y e ict whether five-power agreement on the characteristics for a /^oropean Fighter Aircraft would be obtainable. Lord Carrington, the fferetary General of the North Atl antic Treaty Organisation, had made a the previous day urging greater armaments co-operation among the &apos;^nn^v311 a^^es hut referring in particular to the need for British - as distinct from Government - to make more forthcoming thiS field*
