SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that he had received an Application from a private British citizen, a Mr Khera, to hold a rally vjP&apos;AHyde Park on Monday 8 April. The application was on notepaper headed blic of Khalistan&quot; and the rally would obviously be used to further CJ^^Rterests of those supporting an independent Sikh state under that a5^PvThe Prime Minister would be in New Delhi later that week, and it Wa^ kjtfpW that the Indian Government were very sensitive about the in this country of Sikh extremist organisations.	The

Metrop^fx^n Police had advised on the basis of previous Sikh rallies and   ^A^tormation presently available that there was no reason to slieve\Nhat the rally would attract any violent opposition or otherwise give rise to significant public order difficulties.

In discussion thft-^following points were made -

a*	Sepisode of the Golden Temple at Amritsar and the

death of Mrs/y6aMhi, the former Indian Prime Minister, at the hands a SiklTN^-^xrtection officer, the Indian Government had demonstrated	sensitivty about the activities of Sikh

extremists in ttfe^Jn^ted Kingdom, some of whom were advocating the secession of a ^&gt;foft.&apos;^tate and further attempts to overthrow the Indian Government by^&apos;kolent means. The Indian Government would not readily underat^tficlA an apparent failure by the British Government to contar^--^p\activities of such extremists and deny them opportunities to/A^^ public attention to their seditious Purposes, and the risk (^^Mat^age to Anglo-Indian relations was very

considerable.

k* Though the MetropolitanXPSOice saw no special reason at this stage to fear that signifvcap^/ breaches of public order would occur, any such demons tratici^&apos;-&apos;SSjjHd be bound to heighten the tension between the Sikh commimyyy^  nd other Indian communities, and to increase the risk that tfwrfX&apos;tens ion would erupt, if not on this then on some other occasion, VLnto serious violence and public

disorder.

c* There were some signs that the orgap^ra  rs were expecting that Permission would be withheld, and might M&lt;$itVuiraw their application tf they came to believe that that was the\^c*JHbJe outcome.

^dE Prime MINISTER, summing up the discussion, xa^K^hat the Secretary ^tate for the Environment had been right to	his colleagues

ore reaching his decision as to whether to use liQ^^aWrs to ban the the^  SeC-	rally in Hyde Park on 8 (April. It wa  /l!^e^lear view of

t u ^abinet that it was in the public interest that theJ^^Cdv should not juse. Place, and that he would be in a strong positiori/fiondefend and Stlfy a decision to withhold permission for the rall^^&gt;p^ild it be


   subject to challenge in the courts. If the Secretary of State decided to withhold permission for the rally, the Cabinet would not wish to object, should he decide to give the organisers 24 hours notice of his intention; thereafter, if they did not withdraw their application in ^ that time, the Secretary of State might think it appropriate formally to ^proceed with the refusal of permission, without reasons being given.

The Cabinet -

nvited the Secretary of State for the Environment, vvM deciding whether to use his powers to withhold

/^^mission for a Sikh rally in Hyde Park on Monday 8 April, into account the views of the Cabinet as

2- THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE (BARONESS yOUNG) said that     2Nnew General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Mr(^LLM)ail Gorbachev, was placing strong emphasis, in his statements on in^rliw3\ policy, on the need for improved order and discipline in a (feintfan reminiscent of the line taken by the late Resident Yuri Andro^tjS^/ Mr Gorbachev had already embarked on measures, including the dismissome Party officials, designed to reduce corruption and inefficiWrttfTXP the Soviet Union. There was, however, no indication that radical	or fundamental change were in prospect;

Mr Gobachev&apos;s policies app&lt;s^^3\so far to be directed towards improving the performance of the exXj^olgv system.	On foreign policy issues,

Soviet public statements sino^&lt;ft^ Gorbachev&apos;s election had signalled continuity; the Soviet Union ^/tfHVteral relationship with the United States remained the central fo&lt;  wj^&gt;policy issue, and this was being addressed in a businesslike and u^6l&gt;bn.cal manner. It seemed unlikely that Mr Gorbachev would make an e^H^Uresponse to President Reagan&apos;s Proposal for a summit meeting; but Mjr^orbachev might accept President eagan&apos;s invitation during the latte^io^X&apos;ff of 1985, perhaps combining ^bis with a visit to the United Nation^/p^he autumn. Attempts by the Soviet leadership to divide Western Eurofe^from the United States could e expected to continue, as could increased emphasis by the Soviet Union 0n the need for unity in the Warsaw Pact.

THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE, said that the billing of a United States Army officer, Major Arthur Nicholson, on the staff of the United States Military Liaison Mission in the German Democratic Republic on 24 March could have become a major diplomatic &gt; incident between the United States and Soviet Governments.	The fact

^that it had not done so was due to a notably restrained reaction on the of the United States and to private assurances from the Soviet -   W^horities that the killing had been a tragic accident. United Kingdom    ^S^S^pials were in close touch with their United States and French \^~Jl^rparts to assess the implications of the incident for the British    VyAtjie r Allied Military Missions to the Group of Soviet Forces in Ger^rf^v meanwhile, the British Military Liaison Mission was maintaining its	functions.

In a bi^SE^liscuss ion it was noted that the incident, and in particular tlle faiM^e^of Soviet personnel to give Major Nicholson medical treatmentv^rter the shooting, showed the Soviet regime and the Soviet system at t^eir worst. The brutality of Soviet conduct on this occasion was in sharp contrast with the restraint habitually exercised by United States personnel on occasions when members of the Soviet Military Liaison Mission /fjr^the Federal Republic of Germany approached United States restrictecKare^a.

n aty r^a  isation

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR	said that he had attended a meeting

of the Nuclear Planning GroAk^C^PG) of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) on 26-27 tM^fe^in Luxembourg. The meeting had deceived a detailed report fromwWASupreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), General Bernard Roge^^/&gt;on his recommendations for implementing the NPG&apos;s decision, at ^^Weting at Montebello in Canada in October 1983, to reduce the stockp5?^^rnuclear warheads held by the Alliance in Western Europe to 4,600 byThis would be the lowest evel of nuclear warheads held by the A^viance for 20 years. SACEUR&apos;s rePort would now be carefully studied ^n Alliance capitals in the context of NATO&apos;s agreed policy of maintaining an effective, modernised eterrent capacity while reducing the nucleins, stockpile wherever

Possible.

The meeting of the NPG had also considered the iWvi^tions conveyed by ^He United States Government to its Allies (inckwKj^aa France, Japan, Israel and Australia) to participate in the &lt;^^^ch programme associated with President Reagan&apos;s Strategic DefenceC^Jxt^ative (SDI).

. e Allies had been invited to convey their national	to this

lnvitation within 60 days. There &apos;had been some dis^jf^rof1 Ln the margins of the NPG meeting of the desirability of &lt;^^7//iorm of c  llective Western European response to the American itw^caf^n, an aPproach which was favoured by the Secretary General of NATW^/bamong


   others. The view had been expressed that such a response, for example by the four major Western European Allies, might make it possible to negotiate a more favourable arrangement with the United States than any   ne Ally could negotiate individually; and would enable the Europeans to share among themselves the results from four areas of research. The ^Secretary of State for Defence said that he would be seeking urgently    ^Xhe views of his Cabinet colleagues with a direct interest in^ this ^^tter; and that the Ministry of Defence would proceed in close liaison the Department of Trade and Industry. The feasibility of a M^v^Ptive European response would be examined in exchanges between the X*  wial Armaments Directors of the Allied countries concerned.

discussion it was suggested that the United Kingdom might be able j/fegot iate a more favourable arrangement with the United States   n SDI^^^g&gt;rch if this were done on a bilateral national basis rather than	a collective Western European response. A collective

response	result in a smaller role for the United Kingdom than that

to which Kat industrial and scientific capabilities entitled her; and would in any case raise problems of technology transfer as between the United Kingdom on the one hand and France and the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) on tte\other. France, in particular, could be expected to turn such an ar^ng^nent to their own national advantage; and it was questionable whet&apos;nSpC^t&apos;Ci view of the weaker French military commitment to the Alliance, thfe(WyjHbility of such an outcome should be tolerated.

was also noted,	r that the United Kingdom, if it responded to

the United States invIyQaj^^n on a national rather than a collective basis, could not preveft^ATC^ngements being reached between the United States, France and the TR&amp;V&amp;v well; and that, if there were to be a disposition on the part ofC^^^yJuited States to take British solidarity on the SDI issue for grantediv^tw^vother European Allies might be able to extract a higher price from~^N^nited States for their support than could the United Kingdom. N^w/^ombination of a British national response and a collective respon^^^^ the other leading European Allies could, equally, be detrimental to	interests.

Agriculture

THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES /^NT^NFOOD said that the discussions in the Council of Ministers (AgricuikuT^-^on 25-27 March had shown that the Germans were holding strongly tc//tftie) view that there should be no reductions in Community agriculturalprices. They were also seeking arrangements which would weaken th^P^^traints in the railk sector. Some other member states were allowing t^e^rcmans to make bhe running for a less restrictive price package addition, Mediterranean member states were seeking higher for Mediterranean products. The United Kingdom was standing f^ml^jwith the Commission against unjustified increases in the price was stressing the role of the financial guidelines; and was resl^^h^Xrench


   attacks on some elements of the market organisation for sheepmeat. It should be noted, however, that, although the Commission had held to its price package, the Commissioner responsible for agriculture,

Mr Andriessen, did not take the same view of the application of the ^ financial guideline as the United Kingdom.	It was possible that the

^Federal German Chancellor, Herr Kohl, would raise the question of ^Agricultural prices in the European Council on 29-30 March. The Council Ministers (Agriculture) would meet again on 1 April and was unlikely A^XV^rrive at an agreement. In discussion it was pointed out that once the Germans, because of their role as the major financial ^wAkutor to the Community budget, were insisting that the Community sol^2^^^v must take full account of their national needs. The United Kfngdp^Ajust continue to mount a strong defence of a restrictive a8ricnil&gt;^al price package. The current price negotiations were not a matter&lt;^  c3S^ the European Council. One element of the agreement on budgetaryWra^ipline was that, if Commission proposals were likely to be exceeded, ^^flere was provision for a joint Council of Finance and AgriculturevMinisters. It might be necessary to invoke this, and the Italian Presidency had been informed.

Steel

THE SECRETARY OF SW7MIR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that the results of the Council of Minis  ^/^( Industry) on 26 March had been reasonably satisfactory. The Coun    r\had reaffirmed that payment of aid to the steel industries should ^e^^^from 31 December 1985. The United Kingdom had supported the extensiop^^^v the deadline because of the position of the British Steel Corpora^wfjhollowing the miners&apos; strike. If other member states sought to incl^^Naids, the Commission would be pressing them for further capacity cut^^^\Shere had also been some difficulty     an.d a strong French reaction&apos;\&gt;w{wrecent actions by the United States which were threatening to dam arrangement between the United States and the Community in this sWtpr\

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER reported \^hat the final payment from the Community of the United Kingdom&apos;s 1983 budget refund had now been made.

ving

Tt was pointed out that there were some suggest(b6n^))in the press and efsewhere that France and Germany might be prepVe-w  7 to give up the arrangements (the Luxembourg compromise) under whY^^^  . member state could ask that discussion should continue because	y important

optional interest was at stake and that a vote should noAbOtaken. In discussion, it was said that France and Germany continued&lt;4  /3temonstrate


   the importance which they attached to not being outvoted on their important national interests. The United Kingdom&apos;s position on the need for the Luxembourg compromise had not changed.

A.	Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of State for

Defenp^xjc (85) 8) seeking approval for the draft of the Statement on the Defeirce^^timates 1985.

THE SEa^rawjY&gt; OF STATE FOR DEFENCE, introducing the draft Statement, said thaumber of amendments had been made to the text following discussion\^n the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee. The Statement sought to underline the determination of the European Allies within the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) to strengthen equipment collaboration anstress, particularly to the public in the United States, the mafk Contribution which European nations made to the Alliance. The Sr^WitiS^t was also an opportunity to educate the public generally about ma(fax/4Afence issues and he had taken account of two Criticisms which hadTJ^era made of previous Statements, namely that these hfld not contained suffjO^^ft material on major policy matters and that the statistics on the^roiwice of forces between East and West had exaggerated the Warsaw Pap^k lead in nuclear delivery systems. A substantial essay on the^^^^nt programme had been included, and a summary of this would be n}$d  w^dely available. He accepted that the figures illustrating the Wars^W^X* t&apos; s lead in nuclear delivery systems had been presented in a mlhkip^ which exaggerated the difference; adjustments had therefore beMf^p  ^de to the presentation of the statistics in	question in consufc&apos;atPm) with	the Secretary	General	of

NATO. jt had	been necessary to i^Jrce^&amp;^e the	price of both	volumes	of

the Statement by 50p. Abridged vers^&lt;  rf^-Wi French and German were being made available. Subject to the Cabirf  tf^views, he proposed to publish fhe Statement early in May.

Tu discussion	it was suggested that it vrould	be helpful to	include	in

fhe Statement	a paragraph drawing attention	to the success of	the

building contractors involved in the construction of the Falkland islands Airport in completing their work on schfeduM and within the cost limits set. This would be a useful advertisembW^IT^ the competence of   ritish firms to undertake demanding overseas conraraoHs of this nature, it was also noted that, although the study into t\  -^?ure availability   f merchant ships for defence needs, described in	ph 460 of the

Statement, was essentially a fact-finding examinat&amp;ttVWt would be essential also to identify ways of halting the continuMg^^^line in the size of the United Kingdom merchant t fleet as quickly at&amp;fxjSkible. Of e9ual importance was the need to ensure that experienced	seamen

Were available to man ships which might be needed for defenc&amp;^p^^ses.


   THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that, subject to the inclusion of a reference to the success of British firms in undertaking the construction of the new airport in the Falkland Islands, the Cabinet approved the draft Statement on the Defence Estimates 1985. It should he published early in May, as the Secretary of State for Defence &gt; proposed.

5* THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the United States dollar had been weaken wJg^Nrapidly, particularly against sterling. Although doubts about ce/(7ihJ United States financial institutions were partly responsible f or^b^NSdollar&apos; s decline, there was now a deeper understanding that touVial lar had been overvalued. The Budget had been well received by th     *6*  ets. It was unlikely that this would have an immediate impact on rates, but news of an impending further reduction of    per cenr^tfTx&amp;e National Westminster Bank&apos;s base lending rate (which would no doubV^e followed by the other clearing banks) underlined the fact that Wte/S&amp;ilding societies had acted precipitately ln raising their rates.
