c*	AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that since the

^onvictij^^ 0f those responsible for the attempted abduction of the b*1 ed former Nigerian Minister for Transport, Mr Umaru Dikko, he had r en working to limit the potential damage to British interests in ation to Nigeria- To this end he had conveyed messages to the end8rian Forei8t/?f^nster   Dr Gambari, both directly and indirectly, Un&apos;taV  U^ing tothe workings of the judicial process in the

ed Kingdom. Tl/tfrelWre some indications, in the Nigerian response, ther^C  8n^t^  n   n t^y^^t of the Federal Military Government (FMG) that c 6 ^mPrisonment of M^fotommed Yusufu followed inevitably from his ^ ^viction and there w/jS&apos;^wfar no public or political pressures in geria on his account.^Ttte^Nigerians nevertheless remained very For  ^CUP^ed w:*-t-h Mr Dikko	    Although Dr Gambari&apos;s reply to the

co	and Commonwealth Safcrfedary&apos; s message had been tolerably

bii  lliatory and had exprestf^^C&amp;ish to avoid any further disruption in givateral relations, it had aW^5Stated the Nigerian belief that, to M11	Political will, the	Government could act with regard

Sec r D^lco as the FMG would wisnyT^/rthe Foreign and Commonwealth Prob^tary Said that he and the Hodf^&amp;^a^etary were in close touch on the impl&apos;   f Mr Dikko-s future; it woVWji   important to consider all the two gC^fons   f any action before reai  f^u  2!\a decision. The case of the com ritish employees of Bristow He lic^SW^V^ Limited, who were due to couldUP.for trial in Nigeria on 19 Marchuks disturbing since they agai flnd themselves in the position of Ntostages if the verdict went dLgnat them. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, m Pndlng   n the outcome of this trial, it might be useful for him to eet Dr Gambari.

zeal EEIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE said that the Pr^^^^sister of New pu an    Mr David Lange, was about to arrive in the UnV^o^^ngdom on a the	private visit, during which he would speak m V^bate at

morai*   rd Dnion in favour of a motion condemning nuclear wj&amp;^Wios on somewh^r  UnC*S * Although the original terms of the motion neverth*    moderated, Mr Lange&apos;s participation in the debate wa^sCv Lange ,e^ess unhelpful. During his recent visit to the Unite, Mr vitLd had been told of the United States Administration&apos;s decisr  w/f*j&gt; Zeaiar!W.a11 bilateral co-operation between the United States and(J^wV\ fn the defence and intelligence fields, in retaliation


   be New Zealand Government&apos;s refusal to allow naval vessels carrying &quot;uclear weapons to visit New Zealand ports. Secretary of State Shultz v {ad Ascribed the American action as being such as to avoid turning a It riend into an enemy; but the United State&apos;s response was, nevertheless, Arguably heavy-handed. One of its consequences was that the United &apos;N^Wfdom would have to exclude New Zealand representatives from the Joint V^^Uigence Committee; but there was no case for restricting defence v*/  &gt;Reration between the United Kingdom and New Zealand in any other

no	discussion, it was noted that since the United Kingdom could

n0t1	the New Zealand Government&apos;s requirement that the presence of

. eay/^5f)ns on naval vessels should be declared, there could be no

Zealand by ships of the Royal Navy for the time being. The ZMtlSh| vernment would, nevertheless, continue to defend New Q-aland&apos;s interests in the European Community. The point was made that 2ge^~re^cti  n against the New Zealand Government&apos;s position by New

aland&apos;s allies^-m^ght serve only to strengthen domestic support for Mr minfe a?d his Wfiqfes, although the cessation of Royal Navy visits blght .disturb N^Jegland public opinion more than the absence of visits y ships of the UMtea) States Navy. The New Zealand Government&apos;s de(.emP^ to roitigare^  $  ^problem by offering to make its own We erinination of wht^Hj&amp;k^r not a naval vessel was carrying nuclear apons clearly did n(^   er a satisfactory or acceptable solution.

^ OREIGN and COMMONWEALTH&lt;^S^^TARY said that the agreement between pg^_g Hussein of Jordan and th^E^i^stine Liberation Organisation, in the peaS  n   f Mr Yasser Arafat, wa^^Vj&amp;^ded to improve the prospect for nev e neS  tiations; although a svd^,imthe right direction, it was cons^dheleSS replete with ambiguit&lt;J^s^5d very fragile. There had to be etlc 1 erable scepticism concerning ^tx^cJaances of success, and presUHaSement for iC should thereforS^^^fcautious. The proposal by Stat 6nt Mubarak of Eygpt for talks b^W  h the Arabs and the United lsra6?&apos;^ have gone bey  nd King Husseins original intentions, ground S reaction to these moves had so Mr been mild but there were no Comm0 ^ ^  r excessive optimism or for any initiative by the European Syri*^71* it was necessary to recognise the difficulty posed by fUrtf S negative posture and to continue to pr^er^v, if possible, any ler deterioration in the situation on the i^sty&amp;ank.

Cou T^E MINISTER of AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that the unci! of Ministers (Agriculture) on 25-26 February had reached     ement on changes in the Community arrangements for wine in K,u^^?raent:ation of the decisions taken by the European Council in

in. There would be an effective guarantee threshold, operated comPulsory distillation at low prices. There would also be    JVfO   Ures to grub up vineyards; and a restrictive price policy would be ^7/^^ined. This should lead to a reduction in Community expenditure on yegime, and the cost of the measures themselves should be up to ke^ow the earlier estimates. On milk the Council of PermCr    ^*ad n  W a  reec* to a permanent change in the quota system, whol	m&apos;*&apos;xe^ businesses some facility to exchange quotas between

and	retail supplies; this had been a United Kingdom objective

Certa&apos;1	WaS very satisfactory. The Council had also agreed on

^c  ttish ^A^ ^ e^aTE FOR SCO^ijjMft^^aid that the strike action by Althou&amp;l teacbors was a matter o/A^Preasingly serious concern, the act&apos; 0n^ three Scottish Educabi^n^Authorities were unaffected by ^c  ttish  n-	ma^n focus was on ^le^^nstituencies of all eight

With Serious h   exam^nations only a few weeksoaway, the action threatened action ama8e to the prospects of the children concerned. Because the the whol3S ^e^berately very selective, and its costs were spread over the teach teacb^-n8 force in Scotland, there was^e.financial pressure on reSolvi rS to en&lt;d the strike. Nor was any cju^arYway open for w^bespregcjt:&apos;1? dispute; and if the action were sJErgn^-y^d is continued, the a disaffection of the teachers would rem&amp;rnJj

EnSlandRETARY   F STATE EOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE satdWjU* teachers in S :hUy discontented. The performance oQ&gt;  ^a\schools left them to do^ t0 ^ desired, and the Government were pu^P^j^pressure on Parental etter, despite a social climate in wjiich thep  /j^j\ less the intr ubP  rt and the children were more unwilling to %&amp;avjn He saw Combined actlon of some form of assessment of teachers&apos; pefcf^phance, ^niProvemeWlt:&apos;? more and better in-service training, as the ke^^gwi wbo were v, 10 tlle ^tuation; some limited improvement in pay\fp^&gt;ythose   wn to be good teachers would need to be introduced


   Period of time consistently with the narrow financial contraints within ich the education service worked. The pressing need for better V?rhin   standards had to be accepted both by the teachers and by the ) er community, while at the same time teachers&apos; unrealistic ^5APectations about pay had to be reduced. The introduction of new ?v  &gt;?lnations in 1988 would increasingly facilitate the identification of teachers; if agreement could not be reached on the 1Cm teacher assessment procedures, such procedures might ^JpKbe imposed by Government regulation.

^^^W.ng further points were made in discussion -

a* vv^&quot;tral Government which bore most of the cost of the Provision of schools had no managerial control over what went on in them-Vand the customers had neither freedom of choice nor any interest in minimising the costs of the service. Teaching and non-teaching rnst-s per pupil varied far more widely as between Local EducaStTJ^v Authorities (LEAs) than the underlying Oircumstanika Js  janted. If some more effective central managerial control coul3/fie^\\riposed, perhaps on the French model, this might e helpful inV^e^^ing financial pressures within the education Service and in	g the extent of the problem of local

authority finance,

    Effective countey^Xsures should be prepared against Elective action by n  a&lt;e?fia^s. A number of English LEAs were Preparing to impose pa^sfejkfctions in respect of teachers&apos; refusal to undertake certain dut/^Xp^ grounds of breach of contract. The teaching unions would not\b^wzlling to bear the financial oonsequences of an all-out

c* Concentration of action o&lt;^Mp&amp;sters&apos; constituencies was a ^ery serious matter. Although t$^jy?  liminary advice given by the ouse authorities was that this	was directed against

misters in respect of their Mini^^^l responsibilities and not ln their capacity as Members of Par^fciment, and therefore did not represent a breach of privilege, thepressure depended for its fo eCt^veness on the fact that the Ministers concerned were members r their particular constituencies.	s.

action^h^ MINISTER, summing up the discussion, l^d^jtat the industrial justif- ^ teachers was a very serious matter: teacr^rs)Vere not Ia condtakin^ action damaging to the interesrC^^K&amp;heir pupils. c  atr   , emi}an8 such action Ministers should however awdJLfyAge the cifcu U 10n ^eing made by many good teachers in diffi^uj^v^. c  nsuitta^Ces* Tlle Secretary of State for Education an&lt;v^  )ugy:e, in should at:Lo? with other Ministers with educational respons^M^JN;ies, relation  nS^der further the Government&apos;s policy towards teaMe^in PriVy g11	to the current dispute and to the lopger termi^&apos;-^n^Lord

   there were further legal and other arguments which could be put c   t^le House authorities on the possibility that industrial action   ncentrated on Ministers&apos; constituencies might involve a breach of \ ar lamentary privilege.

Finally6 poss*-ble to add one or two further Bills to this

5 tbe Lord President emphasised the importance of ensu^xhg^hat


   Sills were ready at the beginning of the Session if at all possible and &apos;-Sat they should receive Ministers&apos; personal attention at all stages of

Preparation.

following points were raised in discussion -

a&apos; The work which was being done on deregulation and the removal ^ burdens from businesses would almost certainly require a Bill in next Session, although it was too early to say what it would ^/p^tain. Deregulation was at the heart of the Government&apos;s policy, if necessary, less worthwhile Bills would have to be ^&apos;g^yficed. On the other hand, it might be possible to deal with

A the points emerging from the review either in Bills already *-nprogramme, in a Finance Bill or by secondary legislation.

b* It was necessary, for the balance of the programme, to include some short and relatively uncontroversial Bills, such as Latent Damage.

c* The S$^JfcS.ecurity Bill was a very important element in the Pr  gramme, bi|ftMre must be serious doubts about its timing. The size of the BtBStfiVld depend on the outcome of the reviews of social security^mA/^ihe policy decisions taken as a result.

Policy on th^ft^panalised Industries Bill was far from settled and much of v&amp;XVpact on the privatisation programme could be achieved without Wisfflation. On the other hand, it had been agreed that the propo^k^Kould be put out to consultation and it seemed likely that this&lt;&apos;w  &gt;AJ^ produce some common ground. The Bill Was fa the mainstream of\S  P  ^nment policy.

Policy on the Royal Do&amp;kyaj^hs Bill was far from settled even ln outline. The next stage w^irPpkconsult on the basis of two main options and if this went well,	might still be a candidate

for 1985-86.

The Merchant Shipping Bill wa^yieeded to halt the decline of bhe British shipping industry. It Mid had a place in the present Session&apos;s programme but had had to be dropped because of pressure on Parliamentary Counsel&apos;s resources. Although the industry would e disappointed not to see the Bill, it woK^f^Sbe a suitable candidate for 1986-87.

8* Dog licences now cost significantly morl^i^yollect than was Raised in revenue. Legislation was needed urgj  j  M^and the lack of 11 would be severely criticised. Nonetheless	not be

acc  mmodated in what was a very tight programme.

b* On Housing, the proposals now put forward woul^^^Vj-t in complete deregulation of new lettings in the privateN^j^Asector ut would increase public expenditure as a result of ii^p^^d ousing benefit payments. Such an increase would be ^n contrast to the Government&apos;s general approach to housing


   and would additionally be critised because the money would in fact &gt;	be going to private sector landlords. The disadvantages would

emerge very quickly and before the General Election, whereas the /j\ f  ng-term advantages would materialise slowly. On the other hand, the private rented sector was declining quickly and urgent action ^vO^was needed to save it. Revival of the sector had been party policy the whole period of Government and supporters would not stand continuing inaction. The cost of the addition to (^rovT.ng benefit resulting from the policy had been assessed at   8 &lt;  pT^pn in 1986-87,   38 million in 87-88 and   31 million in 88-89 &lt;^^Si^ures f  r Englan&lt;i only). The Secretary of State for the ^Y^^jSrtjhent had agreed to a transfer of half of these amounts from expenditure a Hoc at ion to that of the Secretary of State f  r S&apos;wyfal Services, the remainder being found by the Treasury.

hro	MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet

(   0	agreed with the programme proposed by QL and listed in Annex A

bUr,	5. Thera^wa\ also a good case for legislation to remove

pol.ens.on busineMsesVand to deregulate the private rented sector if fSsues coul3^^^Bsolved. It was also possible that a Bill on good   ^al dockyards Vfcjgfi^Xbe justified if the policy could be settled in Pol-	The positi^yvmuld therefore require to be reviewed as

PrefCy   n these issuesb^^ more certain. For the present it would be d^s erahle to proceed wittf^S&apos;l^programme suggested by QL. Further priCUSSl  n should take place%  \the possibility of deregulating the ex	rented sector withora^nMurr ing any additional public
