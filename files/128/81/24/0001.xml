THE SECRETAR^OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that debates on the motions on the English and Welsh Rate Support Grant (RSG) Supplementary RePorts on Tuesday lfuJuly, rather than later in the week as had originally been plafmeoV, might produce complaints from the Joint Committee on StatuB^ww^I-RStruments (JCSI) as it would not have had an opportunity to consid/^tme Reports until that day. In addition the RSG SuPPlementary Report VfiU^^id) (No 3) 1982-83 had had to be withdrawn ar*d relaid because of t^e^M^d to make final adjustments. This too could occasion complaints althoygf  &amp;Lscussion of that particular Report could e delayed until the autunwr^j/n^out difficulty.

THE Prime MINISTER, summing up^swrt discussion, said that it would be est to proceed with all the KSl^^^ates on 16 July. Every effort should be made through the usual^^jurhels to head off complaints from

the jcsi.	V&gt;/

The Cabinet -

Invited the Secretary of State for&lt;^keiKnvironment and the Parliamentary Secretary,	to be

guided accordingly.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said th^t &lt;)ie Prime Minister ad written on 4 July in strong terms to the Pres	the South

African Republic, Mr P W Botha, warning that the Unire^Kj^gdom would be J-rkely to take specific steps in reaction to any furtJre^^haid by South rica like the one on Gaborone on 14 June. Mr Botha&apos;	of 5 July

ad been negative and unhelpful. The Prime Minister had&apos;^^\^im a Urther letter on 10 July reiterating the British position an#2-v ejnphasising that raids into neighbouring states were an inawjrj  {fyiate resP  nse to terrorism. The United States had made similar ^presentations to South Africa. The effects on South Africa c^w3\pot yet be foreseen. Meanwhile, world opinion continued to move to  ^ro^ythe


   adoption of economic sanctions against South Africa. The positions of \Canada, Australia and New Zealand were changing. The United Kingdom ^ould therefore have difficulty on this subject in the Commonwealth.

T&quot;Sy    &gt;StelGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Government had aniMmMX on 8 July the ending of restrictions, deriving from the FalkCsfidjs\^ar, on Argentine exports to the United Kingdom. The Govern&lt;$  nt/}jad been under increasing pressure from British importers and had conc^ra^i that it would be difficult to defend in law the maintenarteS^M the restrictions. The decision had been presented Publicly a^X^Pelpful move designed to open the way to negotiations, which the U^Ued Kingdom had long sought, about the re-establishment of more normal relations with Argentina but not about the question of sovereignty over the Falkland Islands. The press reactions to the lifting of the restrictions had been favourable. The timing had been well chosen and thy^a^e had not been rumoured in advance, so that it achieved the maxiirf^jA^ct. The Argentine reaction had been characteristically ci/rmuiWonly. According to first reports of it, Argentina had offered&lt;a^^ssions within 60 days on a broad agenda which would include the quessovereignty over the Falkland Islands. No reciprocal move by Argeny^^Y^oncerning trade had been mentioned. This Argentine reaction contaim^&amp;nMhing new and the suggestion of talks including sovereignty of the^KMands was unacceptable. The news of the British lifting of the r&lt;a  rj)dtions had been helpful during his visit to Brazil from 8.to 10

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETRV^re^-ting on his visit to Brazil from 8 to 10 July, said that it had brto&amp;^ome to him the enormous Scale of the country and its economy. TftS^were very great economic problems, although growth had now resumed\o^ne problem of external debt remained very great:	Brazil had to assign&apos;s^ large part of its export

earningS to debt interest payments, and the magnitude of the debt was not diminishing. Brazil, had, however, achieved a small positive balance on its external account in 1984 and was	to achieve the

same in 1985. Brazil would probably reach a furt&amp;erAgreement with the international Monetary Fund although it was always^^kcult for the country to meet the conditions set by the Fund. Br^iV^as worried that the President of Cuba, Dr Fidel Castro, was seeking tre^U^use opinion in Latin America against Western banks and creditors generar^^^N This could have an explosive effect in the area. Paradoxically, d  ^$  \&gt;Brazil     s economic problems, there were opportunities for British	and

exports in Brazil, which the Foreign and Commonwealth Secr&lt;&amp;&amp;yVDroposed to discuss with other Ministers concerned.

the FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) was co-ordinating the views of the seven countries ^involved in the Economic Summits on the question of banning flights to from Beirut International Airport. The matter would also be    ^^cussed in the following week by the political directors of the

Slinistries of the European Community countries. Judging from    eactions, France seemed unlikely to participate in a ban on &gt;ut the FRG would consider it. The need was for effective arrangements at Beirut Airport, but our policy meanwhile was to widest possible suspension of flights.

THE SECRETARY OF aMTFVFOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that a conference had taken place in Hels^tf^TTyUnder the auspices of the Economic Commission for Europe, about thl&apos;^ajyiusion of a Protocol to the Convention on L  ng-Range Trans-BoundPollution, under which states would undertake to reduce sulp]^u^j|\oxide emissions by 30 per cent by 1993.

The United Kingdom had co$rt  i&amp;d to decline to accept the target of a 30 per cent reduction by l/w\ There now seemed to be more understanding of our reason^^ercS^his position, but our claim that we would achieve the targe.t by LKfc^Kpf the century was seen as Meaningless, because we would r^alAvihis result automatically without further anti-pollution measures \&gt;tt^ontinue to receive a bad press for   ur position on this matter; it w  7W^-to persuade people that the Government cared about pollution. 4tfO  &gt;rliamentary Under Secretary of tate, Department of the Environment	degrave) had represented the

There was much las t-minirv^wspraeuvr ing among the participants. The British position had not bee//ma^ easier by the Outcome of the meeting of the European Council in MriSa^C^ 28-29 June.

|\ ignificant change in the previously rigid French opposition to some ^&gt;V&gt;eralisation of air fares. France had become worried about the &apos;s\j\cess of the United Kingdom&apos;s bilateral agreements with the ^^x^yer^ands and the Federal Republic of Germany. It was too soon, to ther this would lead to an agreement with France. If such an did prove possible, it could also have a favourable effect

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that at the Council of Ministers inance) &gt;5n 8 July a satisfactory agreement had been reached on the r*T erence framework for the Community&apos;s 1986 draft budget. This was an ement in the n^arrangements on budgetary discipline, and the result was consistent j#^fR\\the earlier agreement of the European Council. Two ssues remained\to J^kdealt with in the budgetary procedure - the ar,dling of some	ia 1 commitments from the past and the size of the

The Cabinet -Took note.

4* The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C(85) 17) on economic prospects and a memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury (C(85) 18) on the 1985 Public Expenditure Survey.

(^HE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the short-term prospect for economy was broadly similar to that foreseen at Budget time.

^^though inflation had risen further than expected, and the next two J|^^.hs1 figures would remain high, the Retail Price Index should decline 0 some 5^/4 per cent in the last quarter of 1985, and to below 5 per cent by this time next year. The prospect for output growth was better than foreseen at Budget time. He expected a full 3* per cent increase this year, and some 2i per cent in 1986. The latter was better than it seemed, sLxce a decline in North Sea oil production could reduce Gross Domesti| product (GDP) by * per cent. Although he did not expect any substantial in unemployment, the June figures had been encouraging, especially since the effect of his Budget measures had still to come through, the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement was also on course for the   7 hillid^g^ for 1985-86 in the Budget.

There were stil^gfaowever, major uncertainties. Internationally, these related mainly td^^^Hmorices and the course of the United States economy. Althougffiippktic demand in the United States was still holding up, the satlfefjJkLon of this by increased imports would add to existing protectionis^^p^ussures. He was also concerned that the United States Administration were not making progress on reducing the Federal budget deficit. At home, the level of pay settlements was too high and there were great pressures for increased public expenditure. Although the ending of the commitment to-3 per cent real growth in the defence budget and the easing off of |he 4ise in unemployment might ease the Position in some respects, it^jas most important to resist these Pressures and to maintain firm OT|?t^line over public expenditure.

Without this it would not be pos^ftta^o reduce the tax burden and enable the private sector to gener^^^^Sj^ie economic growth that alone could pay for the provision of public services. It was therefore essential to keep public expenditure^WkJ^ly level in real terms as Proposed in the Chief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s paper.

THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that^r f|  6-87 and !987-88 he was Proposing that the aim of the survey round^^Md be to maintain the r1gures in the 1985 Public Expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 9428) plus the changes announced in the Budget together with a few minor adjustments, his would give planning totals of&apos;   139.1 billion and   143.9 billion in those two years respectively. For 1988-89 he proposed a figure of ^8.2 billion, which represented a 3 per cent uplift on the 1987-88 tgure. This would give planning totals broadly	real terms

over the survey period. His colleagues had put forwlKlWhbstantial additional bids in all three years, rising from some   32^on in 1986-87 to over   8 billion in 1988-89. These bids incmflR^emand-led lds&gt; such as those on the social security programme, an^|^fcroposals cr additional provision for local authority current expen^f^^     which ^d already been agreed. Against these bids he was ready toJ^H^^ate   1 tllion of the Reserves in 1986-87 and 1987-88. This would LOTTO,, Reserves of   5 billion,   6 billion and   7 billion in the three^fr^v


   ^8a^s&gt; which was the minimum he considered the Government could

Polish in the plans for the new forward years. He was also | re ? t0 set against the proposed increases the higher estimate of gi  ceipts from privatisation which he now put at   4i billion,   3i billion ClU	k^-llion over the three years of the survey. But he warned that,

|^^^0uSh receipts from privatisation and asset sales would count towards ijpLeving the pUb^  c expenditure control total, their effect was T^tially

a financing one and did not warrant permanent reductions in xation or increases in expenditure.

lgg0Unn^n  .costs&gt; he proposed that reduct ions should be sought for o	which could be carried forward to the two following years. The

hi v,3 ^ lllcr^ase of 6.3 per cent in 1986-87 proposed was unacceptably t	necessary to reach agreement on tough but realistic

pri^e^s eact| Department. In doing this he wished to give greater rec rity Iw^^^Jiiency in achieving output performance. On manpower, he runn^niS6^	to give higher priority within overall totals for

whose^ costs to bn* staffing of services aimed at controlling fraud or costs werqgJjjj^&apos;Sy.y recovered by fees. The overall targets he had co-P  Se3 Yere tou8$fflfc believed they were realistic and he sought the   Peration of his^Bfc^gues in achieving them.

poT iSCUSSi  n    *-bere v^aj^^neral agreement with the approach to economic gXc^Cy an&lt;l public expenditure&quot; outlined by the Chancellor of the Inipor^11617 3nC* t&apos;le	Secretary, Treasury. It was particularly

cie0rtant&gt; given the other uncertainties, for the Government to make it r that they stood firmly by their stated public expenditure policy.

following points were alsoiA  r

There was some concern	the ability of manufacturing

industry, which currently had^g|L:i^ce trade deficit, to fill the gap as oil production declined	next decade. On the other

and, general prospects for mani7R&lt;^B  ing industry seemed good. in real growth had been 3i per Tejpp&apos; the highest since 1973, and investment had increased by 14 percent ip real terms. Exports were currently 14 per cent higher in^^Pl^terms than a year ago, and many of the imports financed by n^ AM^exports represented capital goods to re-equip manufacturingWndustry. Improvement in e manufacturing sector would in any case depend primarily on ecisions by companies themselves and would not be helped by higher Pnblic expenditure or interest rates.

The level of unemployment remained a matteA^^^erious C  ncern, and the continuing rise in the working popul^ion would make any substantial reduction difficult to achievi. The trend, owever, although still rising, was slower than in The recent past, and the measures already taken by the Government gave^a^ fBospect of eversing that trend if economic growth was maintainei &apos;UN


   c* The high level of real interest rates also remained a cause for concern, together with the effects on competitiveness of a high exchange rate. Continuing economic uncertainties, including the oil price, would make it wrong to take any risks on a premature reduction in the level of interest rates which despite its effect on mortgage rates, was helpful to the priority of getting inflation down. On the other hand interest rates would not be held at present levels longer than was necessary:	there were currently

some signs that interest rates were weakening slightly.

d- There was general support for the approach of the Audit Commission in securing greater efficiency and cost effectiveness.

particularly relevant to the question of reducing current c  sts so that resources could be made available for capital expenditure and expenditure on essential maintenance of existing asset  Sj|^^cularly in the politically sensitive social fields such as educatiot(| health and housing.

The Government should pay more attention to the presentation as well as^^P*gubstance of public expenditure policy. There was a risk of getting fche worst of both worlds; criticism for cuts the Government haulajtit^ade, and no credit for spending on priority areas. There wouijpP^e advantage in giving a clear message that the Government had piTBlic expenditure under firm and well managed control with the right priorities within the resources available.

It was important also not to encourage damaging publicity by leaks about the public expenditure discussions.

In some cases econoft^^in small programmes could attract public criticism disprop^fiopafe to the amounts saved. On the other hand, substantial amdCSp^bf some of the large programmes, such as social security, we^ alraady pledged. All Ministers would need to contribute constructi\l^^^Mi the search for further reductions.

The United Kingdom was unique amW^ its major partners in the lack of opportunity available to pi^kJrceAindividuals to contribute from their own income to services such a stealth and education. Controlling public expenditure so thatTit declined as a proportion of GDP would help to increase the scope for this, as well as making rt possible to reduce tax thresholds.

h* The Chief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s proposals rA^arding manpower were generally welcomed, there was a case, wi|t  |the Government&apos;s overall objectives for reducing the public	some

relaxation of policy on manpower where the benefadditional employment could be shown to exceed the costs inv^K^pH^

^ pRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that c^dNjjsinet

y and unanimously endorsed the proposals for the publi&lt;^^Jfflw^iture (-rann^n8 totals in the three years 1986-87 to 1988-89, and f^E||a  L e ea*-ment of the Reserves, running costs, manpower and surplu^^^pia^nd raPty housing, in the Chief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s paper C (85)


   The Chief Secretary, Treasury should pursue bilateral discussions with the Ministers responsible and then report further to the Cabinet which would review the overall position before any outstanding questions were I dealt with. Ministers responsible for expenditure programmes should ^Co-operate constructively in achieving the agreed public expenditure ^^   anning totals and objectives, bearing in mind the need to maintain an   P^0priate political balance. In reply to questions, she would explain the Cabinet had discussed public expenditure and agreed to maintain ^he planning totals for 1986-87 and 1987-88 at the levels in the 985 Financial Statement and Budget Report and to maintain the total roadly unchanged in real terms in 1988-89. She suggested to her colleagues that they should stick to this line if they found themselves unble to avoid having to comment to the media.

SUPPORT &lt;



\	&apos; The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of State for

J\ ^Cation and Science (C(85) 16) about the review of student support, to ^^VLCh was attached a draft consultative paper.

X^*}^ECRETARY 0F state for EDUCATION AND SCIENCE said that he was

)Hted to publishing a consultative document on student support by

July* The draft paper attached to his memorandum touched on s	other possibilities for reform of the present student

&apos;UR^S^^ys,:enij but concentrated primarily on the possibility of c	3 ^oan scheme. Under his proposals tuition fees would

bentl&quot;//S^e Pa^ full by the State but the maintenance grant would ^ePl4    &lt;p&apos;/Dy loans. He had concluded that a loan scheme was no SrabV   grants, because it could be advantageous if students did r    embark on adult life totally financed by the taxpayer, and it was    that students who benefited from higher education should make some    u  :	Many otheir developed countries had a student support system

no^c mvolved	at least in part. The paper was deliberately

sh*1 Prescr iptiv\^niviLoans, but he had felt it right that one loan option .Id be descrilwv&apos;Th \some detail in order to focus public debate. The Cha10n	tratefN^^J^  k:ted very favourable terms, to which the

staaceH  r of the Ex^ffjmar had agreed, in order not to discourage U   nts from low-incon  x3?amilies from applying for loans. The loan U ^e repaid over	of 15 years, beginning two years after the

ompletion of the course jmd^zith grace years in those periods when the ear	t*ie Sraduate fe^/^jSow 85 per cent of the national average

be	No interest wouTX.J^Aharged on the loan, but the debt would

Ce^5?Vafue&lt;f on an annual basT^^ti^. ine with inflation, subject to a att lng.oF ^ per cent. In anwts^mpt to make the scheme even more

ractive, he proposed that tlw^v/rxent parental contribution should be wouiT&apos;1 by one third over a periorcr^dnMO years. Despite this, there The	be a considerable lon^f^pi^ saving of public expenditure.

0n COst estimates were necessarily&apos;sn^p^ilative and would depend in part degree of default on repaymen^js^l-jte had no reason to believe count*&quot;^S WOu^ exceed the 10 per cer^t&apos;^L&amp;vel experienced in other cour ri6S and defaults would not alway^/rare to be pursued in the ob&apos; S* The Pr  Posals in the Green PapeXwould serve the dual reduC^1V6S oF making the student support systern more equitable, while an UClr*E public expend iture in the long term. He sought Cabinet&apos;s r  val to publish the draft as a Green Paper oju^2 July.

following main points were made in discussion ^

A system of loans for students would res^v^) young people eginning their careers burdened with debt at	le time when

*-bey might well be taking on other, family and h/mrafte, commitments. The loan repayments would be a very^^&amp;n^ficant Percentage of the disposable income of young graduatg^^even taking into account the favourable terms which were suggesw    /^\

b* Children from working class families would be partJ^XT^ly iscouraged from entering higher education on this baswould a so tend to discriminate in practice against the entry women into higher education.


   c    Although Members of Parliament, when discussing earlier JJ Proposals to alter the basis of parental contributions to the

existing grants, had indicated some support for a loan system, it seemed likely that they would cease to be so enthusiastic when ^aced with the detail of a particular proposal and with the ^/A&lt;^nevitable complaints from those who would lose from the change.

Although the drafting of the Green Paper could be improved ^9^*rake the loan scheme look less like a firm proposal, as well as &apos;^^M^hasise the fact that tuition costs would continue to be paid ^&quot;y^Jjtate, it would inevitably be regarded as a Government PrOR(y&gt;rfl. As such it would be heavily criticised, especially at the sent time when there was so much ferment in the educational world, and by all those who thought that they would lose from the change.

e- It wasf/lio&apos;ln easy to see how other sources of complaint, such as the parentiA^cjjtt-fcribution, could be dealt with, or valuable public expenditure sjM^Tngjs be secured in this area, unless the proposal for loans wasforward. It would also enhance student&apos;s sense   f responsibili^^iw^ commitment.

Cab-^*^ MINISTER, sumi^t^^p the discussion said that, although the laet recoSnised the bene  &amp;e in principle of bringing home to young educ 6     t^e ^act that the M^rfAkges which they would gain from higher should be paid,	were also impressed by the
