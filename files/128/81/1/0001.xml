PARLIAMENT AFFAIRS	ary	2^/Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House of QpmrShs in the following week. THE CHAJJTCLJrfPR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that it would be difficult for him to parr$?^  te in a debate on the Opposition motion on the reduction of unemploym/ofx^hrough public expenditure on 17 January because of a prior commitmentO&apos;o a meeting in Washington. The Cabinet - 1. Invited/^ro\Lord Privy Seal to seek to arrange for the debated; cw the Opposition motion to be taken on Tuesday 15 Jatra^7\\

pate SuPport Grant Debates		THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TOB^NVIRONMENT said that the debates on the Rate Support Grant (RSG) Ref&amp;^^w&gt;n 16 January would raise again the problem of the way in which y^ji^j^nding authorities were affected by the RSG settlement. He would T^Yft^ulting colleagues on a possible form of words for use in the de\wju  ^&amp;out prospects for these authorities.

		THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brie^&amp;cussion, said that previous commitments of this nature had proveov^p costly. It would be very important in 1985 to show that public &lt;^p^fi&amp;ture was being kept under

^Plosion at Utney Kin		THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that th^p^sJiad been an explosion that morning in a block of flats on Putney {yi.ll which had killed several people. It seemed likely that an esOo&apos;S^t gas was the cause, although this had not yet been confirmed. HenhajPksked for an urgent report from the Health and Safety Commission.&apos;^?w  ^lats were in the constituency of the Parliamentary Under Secretary OTy^^^e, Home Office (Mr Mellor) who would be precluded from asking a Notice Question (PNQ). It might therefore be appropriate for him tVaAke a statement to the House of Commons. Alternatively, a neighbqta  j&amp;vMember of Parliament might ask a PNQ. V*-&apos;VV,\

		THE PRIME MINISTER said that there were precedents for a neighbMr*9ntj  s Member raising such matters on a PNQ when the constituency Member^jw^/^

Tl}e Prime Minister 1s Visits to People&apos;s

Republic of China; Hong Kong; and 8 the United States

3.	^pfeJ&amp;IME MINISTER said that she wished to inform the Cabinet of the ova^re  &gt;. visits which she had made during the week before ChristmJCs^^The main purpose of her visit to China, from 18 to 20 Weaker, had been to sign the agreement on the future of Hong Kong. The&lt;Xhinese Government had extended a very warm welcome to her and to her {V^rty and had done everything possible to emphasise the significance and status of the visit. She had, during the course of a single day, called on the four most important members of the Chinese leadership: ChairjI^f^^Seng Xiaoping, President Li Xiannian, Prime Minister Zhao 7.iyl&amp;g Vnd the General Secretary of the Communist Party,

Hu Yaobang. This ra^Mon was unprecedented for a visiting Head of Government. It was VM^&amp;CAfrom the discussions in Peking that the Chinese were keen to c^JdTude more trade agreements and to increase the volume of business with/rti  2  nited Kingdom. It had not, however, been thought appropriate to	commercial negotiations on this occasion

since this would have riskedvj&amp;interpretation, in Hong Kong, of British motives in concluding the	pg agreement. The Chinese Government

had arranged for over 100 Hob^Jgpw people, representing all walks of life, to attend the signing	and banquet. The Prime Minister

said that she had also been wamjyfftlcorned on her subsequent visit to Hong Kong itself. The people of^M^ong had shown a good understanding of the purpose and n^^^e^of the agreement on Hong Kong&apos;s future, despite some reservations on ^jSrfwicular points such as the nationality issue.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that from Hong	had travelled to the

United States, where on 22 December she tr  jx  ngaged in three hours of discussion with President Reagan, mainly rn^arms control issues and on the Strategic Defence Initiative in particular. During the talks she and the President had identified four main points of agreement, which had subsequently been embodied in a public statement ..^E^was significant that the United States approach to the meeting irKGei^va on 7-8 January 1985, between Secretary of State ShulNi^rfji^the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr Gromyko, had been based on the Uoc/Tpoints which she had agreed with President Reagan. Her impressiorMx^feshington had been that the American position was not at that stage n^j^teve loped and that the United Kingdom&apos;s contribution, carefully wcH^S^yt in advance, had been timely and welcome. President Reagan&apos;s Narj^Oial Security Adviser, Mr McFarlane, had come to London on 9 Jan^ji^^vdirect from Geneva, to inform the British Government of the out come meeting between Mr Shultz and Mr Gromyko. It was clear, that been very successful. The Soviet objective of putting a stop ta^^w^A Strategic Defence Initiative had not been achieved; the United Sc


   would continue with the research programme which was in full accordance k both with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 and with the four ^points which she had agreed with the President, but testing and ^Steployment, together with all other aspects of strategic defence    ^Vrstems, in which the Soviet Union at one time seemed to have i^  d^blished a lead in both research and deployment, would be on the The Prime Minister said that although she did not share r Reagan&apos;s dream of eliminating all nuclear weapons, since these ca^//J^^t be disinvented, it was important that the United States should balvffca^Soviet efforts to develop defences against them. In the talks at Ga^v^Owhich had resulted in agreement to pursue negotiations on the three	of strategic weapons reductions, intermediate weapons

reductiSfvS^nid space weapons under one overall umbrella, the United States ha^i^^ae it clear that United Kingdom and French nuclear weapon systems woMd not be the subject of negotiation. The Prime Minister said that tFte detailed modalities of the eventual negotiations remained to be worked out and that her forthcoming visit to Washington, in February, would consequently offer a further opportunity to provide a United Kingdom ca(^??a^ution to American thinking. It would be important in the period f olVfcwufc.the Geneva meeting, which represented a significant success /rorSVresident Reagan and his Administration, to keep in close touch with	ted States and to make full use of the close

relationship with th&amp;	States leadership, both political and

personal, which the Uni^^^jKingdom enjoyed.

Minute l

THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN^wfvDMMONWEALTH OFFICE (BARONESS YOUNG) said that the Foreign and Commo^e&gt;  9h Secretary had completed his visit to Zimbabwe, during which he had &lt;Z^yt^Afriendly and businesslike meeting with the Prime Minister, Mr Mugabe^/   MiyMugabe had expressed his pleasure with the Prime Minister&apos;s	to him and had extended an

invitation to her to visit Zimbabwe thyf/yegv. He was very satisfied both with the performance of the BritiJ^^Ef^ritary Advisory and Training Team and with the British aid programmeTVm^ted undertaken to review his Government&apos;s present preference for tra/&apos;purchase of French, rather than British, helicopters and had expressea^the hope that the economic upturn might now permit some relaxation of controls over funds blocked in Zimbabwe. Mr Mugabe had claimed that dissident violence in Matabeleland was declining and had made clear his^fSho commitment to full, free and fair elections in late February otKMawh. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had met other Zimbabwea?IA&amp;5wrs, both black and white, but it had not been possible to arrange	either with

Mr Nkomo or with Bishop Muzorewa.

In a brief discussion it was noted that, if free electitfr^C^ indeed imminent, the inability of Mr Nkomo and Bishop Muzorewa to m^jft^he Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary was curious. Reference	to

reports that Mr Mugabe might intend, following the elections^tpMtolish the Zimbabwean Upper House; any such move would give rise to among Government supporters in the House of Commons about the iri^q^prty of the Zimbabwean Settlement. It was noted that under the terms


   Settlement the Constitution of Zimbabwe could not be amended until 1990 without a unanimous vote to that effect in the Zimbabwean Parliament.

Angola

rf&gt;ffiVtINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE said that three Xfc#2ih subjects were among the prisoners taken by force by the Union f^y^m&amp;Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) on 29 December, although twoV)tW&amp;6 had escaped and were safe. The captives were now being marctt  a&gt;d&gt;thwards to UNITA&apos;s base but were unlikely to arrive there before^^^-eyd of January. The British Ambassador in Luanda had sought and obtlwlSr assurances from the Angolan Government that they would do nothing w$Zrf$night jeopardise the safety of the prisoners. The Internatio^VL Commission of the Red Cross had been asked to intercede with UNITA ;md a UNITA representative had given assurances to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office concerning the eventual release and repatriation of th^-JJiree Britons.

In a brief discui^^reiit was confirmed that although the British Government wished t&lt;^V?Te^\ the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola and of South African fort^V^ftom Namibia, it did not favour a direct linkag between them. It was	ly that Cuban troops would leave Angola

until President dos San|^  ^e!Nd Dr Savimbi, the UNITA leader, had reache an accommodation.

Chemical

Weapons

In a short discussion of chemi^^Oy^pons the Prime Minister reaffirmed that the British Government&apos;s prd&amp;fitt^kolicy of pursuing negotiations with the objective of securing the^p^^prual destruction of the Soviet Union&apos;s stockpile of chemical weapon^^owld continue.

4.	THE PRIME MINISTER said that it had been intMndeVto provide for the supplementary 1984 finance under the Intergove^j^TChl Agreement by an Order under Section 1(3) of the European Commi^^^fj^yAct 1972. A challenge in the courts had not been successful but CTl^jJtmsequent delay into 1985 gave rise to some risk under this procedure. AM&amp;Oitovernment would therefore proceed by a Supplementary estimate and &apos;^ftffi&apos;^lidated Fund Bill.

THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that the Council of Ministers (Fisheries) on 19-20 December had reached complete agreement .on total allowable catches and quotas for 1985, subject only to a United Htingdom Parliamentary Scrutiny Reserve which would be lifted shortly, &quot;rjftis was the first time the agreement had been reached before the year 4p/Vhich it applied. The result was good for the United Kingdom and had &apos;&apos;^Mm^wel corned by the fishing industry.

Previ0us Reference-  (84) 4lst ^&quot;&apos;lusions,

Minute 3

THE Mm^JtfEJLOF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD reported that in accordai^artfitth the conclusions of the Cabinet, as a number of other member statm&gt;j^iad not charged their milk producers with the supplementarylevy, the United Kingdom had not collected or paid over to the Community the small amount of supplementary levy due in Northern Ireland. He would be seeing Mr Andriessen, the new Agriculture Commissioner, this week and would press him to take strong measures against the French^jfei apparently still did not intend to collect or pay over levy. In ths maygins of the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on 14-15 January, he wo&lt;  kR^1so sound out other member states, such as the Netherlands, in the Uajj^/ppsition as the United Kingdom, in order to see whether they would aiT^ff/jilling to collect and pay over the levy if the Commission undertooy*  0^ike strong sanctions against France. If so, the United Kingdom craJ^O^pconsider its position. He doubted, however, whether they would^^IXbe ready to follow this line. If they would not and there was a	defer the levy collection until the

end of the milk marketing	), he would have no option but

to go along with it. United KT^&lt;?SA producers attached great importance to the undertaking that the UnPreaw^dVigdora should not be in a position in which she kept the rules while^Wp$s did not. In discussion it was also argued that the present situa(jn^*Tyas not in the United Kingdom&apos;s interest. An important agreement had^y?Mi reached on the milk quotas and levy. Now the French were apparent^l^^iot ready to pay the levy.

The United Kingdom had pressed for andv^ejjfi^ed arrangements on budgetary discipline. Those arrangemencsly&apos;yw^i be more difficult to defend, if the milk quota and levy scheme^^^e not being respected. Furthermore, the Commission&apos;s decision to lmduce, as a penalty for non-compliance with the milk quota and levy scheme, the money advanced for expenditure in support of the milk sector in January fell disproportionately heavily on the United Kingdom.this reason it was desirable to achieve as soon as possible a comnonyiine with other member states that all, including the United Kingckaty^w^ild collect and pay over the levy due provided that effective sanctifc/ns .Were imposed on

Steel

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY reported that &lt;  ejj)ijted States had now confirmed their acceptance of the arrangement w&apos;rtjfv&amp;e Community on the export of steel pipes and tubes to the United uffOm market. Following increases in Community exports the United StaPe^^/acL


   intended to cut back the market share in 1985 to 5.9 per cent but had now agreed to 7.6 per cent. The United Kingdom&apos;s share, which under the earlier arrangements had been 0.42 per cent, remained almost unchanged 0.4 per cent.

THE SECRETARY OF   TATE FOR ENERGY said that some 2,500 miners had returned to wiMk^Biis week. The movement back was particularly significant ii^llcotland and the North East. Out of the National Coal Board&apos;s (NCB1s)^rigure of 170,000 potential miners, 73-74,000 were expected to be woi^Mgjffi^jy next weekend, ie. 43 per cent of the total National Union of $w|*%  kers (NUM) work force. Miners were now at work at every pit in YorlShijre,. while coal production had begun for the first time at Kellingley, odfroT the largest pits. Ten miners had gone into work together that day at a Welsh pit for the first time. 512,000 tonnes of coal had been moved from the pit-head during the two-week period over Christmas and the New Year, although no such movement had Been allowed for, and 900,000 tonnes were expected to be moved this week. Provided that these coaf moyements could be sustained, the Central Electricity Generatin^jBaj^L (CEGB) had informed him that no power cuts would be required dus|W8^^85; and he had himself drawn attention to this in a press stati^iij^j*|Over the New Year holiday. The CEGB had met without difficulty thifw  k the highest peak-load ever experienced, and this had also been^lto^Apublicised. Indications were emerging of pressure on the NUM leadeeilly in some areas (South Wales, Lancashire, North Derbyshire) to find ^pP5|,:j^ re-opening negotiations.

Lt seemed unlikely that there would be any significant developments arising from that day&apos;s meeting of the NUM exl^utive, and no new initiative was expected from the Trades UnL^^p   ^O&amp;ngress; however, if the drift back continued at its present rate, pressure on the NUM Executive Was likely to increase considerably by the time of their next meeting on 28 January.

tHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that the Nagjl  nal Union   f Railwaymen and the Associated Society of Locomot  n|||Wj^ineers and firemen leaders were trying to organise industrial	suPP  rt   f

the miners on 17 January, on the pretext of alleged ma  efent and Police harassment of railwaymen. The complaints had arisen ftrom the replacement of two Leicester signalmen who had retired o^^jftjth grounds By men more co-operative with the management, and from a qpit|% unconnected incident at Coalville where a number of railwaym^jW|^been charged with theft of railway property. The unions had not	to

   


   agree any detailed plans for industrial action at a meeting on 9 January, and although some sporadic disruption was expected in the kEastern and London Midland Regions, the Chairman of British Rail did not jixpect the overall impact to be very substantial.

:	HOME SECRETARY said that picketing was continuing at the reduced

level experienced before Christmas, with a maximum of 300-400 pickets at locations each day. There had been some overall reduction in intimidation. The number of more serious cases dealt with in the Crown Courts was increasing, and in one recent case one miner had been sentenced to 3 years&apos; imprisonment and several more to 2\ years for arson. Substantial publicity was being given to this. There had been a number o||4rosecutions under Section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act for &apos;besetting&apos; (picketing outside working miners homes). He WOilld shortly be drawing attention in a public speech to the fact that intimidation and vandelism could lead to prosecutions under

THE PRIME MINlS&apos;W^Aumming up a brief discussion, said that there were now indications	.much greater number of miners were coming to

understand the lonmRi^ adverse impact of the strike on the future o the industry. As tfflfc NCBUiad made clear, if the strike continued for a further extended peri^jbb losses could be as high as 50,000. Any advantage to the United Kingdom coal industry arising from the fall in sterling against the dollar would be far more than outweighed by the extensive damage arising from loss of coal faces and other effects o the strike. For the time being, the Government should continue to encourage the drift back to	thout emphasising this long-term

damage. However, as soon as fMjjjgter was over, it would be right to bring this point home vigorouslj^Wkanwhile the NCB should continue to warn individual miners of the fa^yMt or at risk at their own pits.
