THE

Serious^t^^^ STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that there was &lt;^HQ  hthy and de  andin eacb  rs&apos; dispute in Scotland. The union concerned^ji&amp;N. the nor   1an ^ndePendent pay review and had refused to conMfl^nVise of e  fective negot^ating committee. They had adopted an extremE^y^X c  nstitu matbod of industrial action which was targeted upon^m^y. 8t  Pped aacies Scottish Office Ministers. This had effectiXXw^

uoation in those areas, at very little cost to the union6^/&lt;^


   Tli

ey were now threatening to disrupt examinations. Quite apart from the general reasons for standing firm, it was most important that this new &gt; c nique of targeting Ministerial constituencies should not be seen to &apos;jlyCceed: it could easily be extended into other disputes.

PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that it was

to stanc* fast. It had been suggested that the technique of industrial action on Ministerial constituencies was a breach aut&lt;^l^ment:ary PrivileSe&gt; although the preliminary view of the House

was that this was not so. It would be necessary to consider further.

-

^jvited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland, to investigate the possibility that industrial action by the Scottislv^tSJichers involved a breach of Par 1 iamentarwp(/Lvi lege .



thatStCRETARY   F STATE	DE AND INDUSTRY said that it seemed likely

the Government might s\yf&amp;x a defeat in the House of Lords over the

issue of p	   xv/JA

view ^rown preference io^njmplvency. It was necessary to take a w whether any concessions^e^Pti or should be made.

atmos ^inister of Gibraltar, Sir Joshua Hassan, /aff^ie same day. The hoped^ 6re 3n&lt;^ content of the talks had been as &apos;gwd&apos;ZJW. could have been notiCg Eenor Moran had raised the question of sove^eiepty and given issue6 t^lat would in due course put forward form*  ^?  ^posals on this part     T^e Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said	f  r his

pnbli arians- In his press conference after the talks, Senb^jtoJran had interes^ acRnowledged the importance of the feelings (as wellNAsVt^ra sover ^tS   F t*ie PeoPie of Gibraltar. Following the exchangea^^xv//^ eignty5 the talks had moved immediately into the consideratip^  &gt;f\


   Practical matters arising from the opening of the frontier. Both Senor .ran and Sir Joshua Hassan had conducted themselves with good sense and N   lth dignity: a bilateral discussion between them had probably exercised &apos;y helpful influence on Senor Moran&apos;s subsequent press conference. It ^?wnoteworthy, in the context of Gibraltar&apos;s future, that there was an \&apos;y*^uraging growth of business for the commercialised Gibraltar

This would weaken the political opponents of Sir Joshua 7^^\s policies.

^HE F  k^^XND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that it was hoped that the ur   riM|sh subjects who had been held hostage in Libya would be ^turningN^o the United Kingdom later in the day, following a series of ast minute delays and frustrations resulting from Libyan sensitivities, g asideration had been given to bringing the hostages home on

ebruary, imme^^Kely after their release, in view of the possibility adverse LibyO^i rvactions to the trial, now in progress in Manchester, Wa&apos;^  Ur b*byans i^/t^vArchbishop of Canterbury&apos;s special envoy, Mr Terry aite&gt; had howevenXaflyXa.ed against hastening their departure. Last    ^nute difficultieV^^y stiil possible and it would be advisable forth6 ^r^t^-sLl Government&apos;LK&apos;^sdopt a low key approach towards Libya until b e release of the hol^^i^had taken place. The efforts of Mr Waite in rmgmg about a changeor^ar t on the part of the Libyan President, ,  lonel Qadhafi, so far a^pS\British hostages were concerned had been a^a&apos;*&apos;ua^Le; but there had wtgjff/po fundamental change in Libyan attitudes ab the members of the sizeaK^^titish community in Libya would remain CQ risk. jy[r Waite, whose miflaWi/had been conducted in close ^nsultation with the British T^rarpment, had meanwhile been authorised ^Ss  ^er two gestures to the Lib^mJrS^thor i ties: a strictly limited fj.Sue      visas in Tripoli for urgejpk^d^mpassionate and medical cases, be 111 V^ich the relatives of Libyansjl^^^ined in the United Kingdom would Italflt    and   ne round of bilateral &lt;  &amp;^&gt;at official level under ini *ai\aUSpices* In a short discuswas stressed that cir l3tives&gt; such as Mr Waite&apos;s missiof  &gt;^mi.ch might in certain sucCUmStanCeS be needed to supplement tftk diplomatic process could UnCCaed only if the Government&apos;s involvement with them remained Brit&apos;llCiSed&quot; The Publicity which had just been accorded, in the Pal lsh media, to the Prime Minister&apos;s private contact with Lambeth simil6   ver the hostage affair would make it d^/fffi^ilt to mount a initiative if comparable situations wer^3t^rZ2*rise in other

where British subjects might be impriscraecO^r at risk. It was r lcult but necessary to impress this aspect ofob 1 em upon esentatives of the media.

orE0thlME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said trf^S^rliamentary re^e er Public statement by the Government on the circu^a^^ffaes of the ase   i the British hostages would not be necessary or^felb^ful;


   related matters such as the position of British subjects in Libya and &gt; the status of the Libyan People&apos;s Bureau in London could if necessary be ^  vered in a Written Parliamentary Answer.

^E SECRETM  ^ STATE FOR ENERGY said that about 4,000 miners were expected td^^abandoned the strike by the end of the week. Deep    J-ne ProducaoR^gd movements of coal by rail had the previous week been he best sincHfchJjfLtrike began; power station stocks had fallen by not much m&lt;&gt;re than 100,000 tonnes, and over 13 million tonnes were still in stock at power stations. There was increasing pressure to end the strike within the	Union of Mineworkers (NUM), whose National

xecutive was meeti^ tjkf morning, but there was no sign that the resident of the NUM, 1 Mr Stargill, was prepared to give ground. One Possibility would be an organised return to work without an agreement, with a ban on overtime and a work to rule. The meeting would be Preceded by a discussion with leaders of the National Association of -olliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers (NACODS), who were looking for    ays.  f putting pressure on tip Government in order to assist the NUM. Point of particular imp or t anj  ,g&apos;  iw$)&gt;&gt; Id be the operation of the colliery eview procedure contemplated iS|HLpational Coal Board&apos;s (NCB&apos;s) greement with NACODS; the NCB h%Vviven the Government further ormation on how they saw this P1w^^,0re working. There had been no   W public statement by the NCB aboJ^jybible negotiations to end the T	*&quot;be	had, however, given tl|PlH|te General Secretary of the

a es Union Congress a private indicat^fpjjt^f what they would regard as ac&lt;^ePtable wording of the first item^HEhe agenda at any possible gotiation to end the strike, and this W%^im was now in the hands of Cgr c  rgill, the General Secretary of the N^P^wr Heathfield, and rtain other members of the NUM Executive.

def-P^lME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that a clear and nite end to the strike seemed increasingly less likely; if the 0Vger   returned to work without an agreement, and tl^B^inposed an Would1   6 ban and work to rule&gt; the Pressure to clos   uneconomic pits event increase still further. Meanwhile the Government co^ld only await
