LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Government had lost one A~\f/&gt;!er division, on the Inner London Education Authority, during the 5ee Stage of the Local Government Bill in the House of Lords d&apos;	wee^    They had however successfully resisted several other

f1	anc* i-mP  rtant amendments, as a result of very good support

r  m^bn^rvative Peers. Lord Home of the Hirsel had made a Partic^^ptY helpful and influential speech. A number of difficult ssuesbut, in his judgment, the Government had gained ground

. HOME SECRETA^X^s^id that a White Paper announcing the Government&apos;s CLS10ns foIIowkc^, review of public order law was to be published at day. There weroe ya major flaws or lacunae in the existing law; but some changes were ne&amp;  j^^ry to take account of developments since the ast Public Order ActM^^36. His concern throughout had been to construct a package whi\^^?tf&amp;^   sense in policing terms. The main anges were to give the^pd^i^e powers to impose conditions on static emonstrations as well as	ions; to extend the grounds for

imposing conditions on bothv^Jeipohs trations and processions to cover the iisk of serious disruption tV^T^^^U-fe of the local community including th*2 C  ?rc   &apos;on individuals amN^pisous damage to property as well as ? listing test of the risk o^^rj^us public disorder; to make universal the requirement to give /afwahce notice of processions; to make   rrestable the offence of intimidati^rwoder the Conspiracy and option of Property Act 1875; anaVar^Pevise and codify the common law Co 6l?Cea riot, unlawful assembly ang-^r^ray as proposed by the Law mission. The proposals did not incliMe^aJiy power to ban static The0riS,:rat^0nS *	resu^t was in	3 balanced set of proposals.

2- THE FOREIGN AND C OMMMO NWE ALT H SECRETARY said that there had had601&quot;^ ^een two worrying incidents in Sri Lanka. The security forces shot 12 Tamil youths and blown up a building containing others, ami terrorists had attacked the religious and historical site of N|nuradhapura, and about 220 people had been killed. The situation in Lanka was deteriorating. There was a risk of a backlash from the lf\V^ese community. There was no sign of the Government asserting

of the situation. The British Government could advise tourists rVaf/  &lt;^kaWa^ ^rom Sri Lanka and urge President Jayawardene to take a line, but there was little prospect of influencing him.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWE^  m^j CRETARY said that the results of the regional elections in Nortt^$  rtyi-Westphalia on 12 May had been a major setback for the Federal Cham*^t^p\. Herr Kohl. The Social Democratic arty ^ad secured a big success^\n area where it was traditionally strong. The Free Democratic Pa^V^H^d secured more than 5 per cent of e vote, and thus would return	regional parliament. The Green

the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that the results of the district elections in Northern Ireland, held on 15 May, would begin to appear later on 16 May. The election, like the campaign, had passed ^ quietly. Attempts by the Irish Republican Army to cause explosions in ^Belfast had failed. This had been the first election in Northern /^Feland where documents had been required of voters, so as to eliminate ^E&apos;V^sonat ion. It appeared that this had been successful. The Sinn Fein had concentrated on winning seats rather than amassing a high NX^^Kof votes. It had said that it would be content with winning 30-35 ^*&gt;^/but judging from the Party&apos;s past performance, when there was , it was capable of winning 70-75 seats. The test of its perr&amp;rjrat^e in the elections would be how near it came to this number.

The European Democratic rouP Had done much to obta^^^&amp;is result, together with the action which the French and German ^wOrments had taken, on British prompting, with French and German memberV^^lf&amp;NJiad now discussed with colleagues e handling in Parliament of rtte^bjj&apos;ftised Own Resources Decision and the intergovernmental agreement on	or 1985. They had decided that

t ere should be a single Bill, whi^n  Xp6    ld designate both the revised wn Resources Decision and the interg#$H*x)nmental agreement as Community treaties under Section 1(2) of the Etfro^wi Communities Act 1972. The aim would be to introduce the Bill in   ^  ^^cond half of June, on the assumption that the Community&apos;s 1985 bucda^t^w^uld have been adopted.

Minute 3

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY reported tR^^rh^ Council of inisters (Agriculture) was still in progress. The \K  d4j&gt;  l German for1Ster    ^err Kiechle, had rejoined the Council aftei^raA^rning to Bonn   ,or further discussions with his colleagues. The Feder^r^^toublic of ^armany was continuing to insist on no cut in cereal prl^s^vecause of j S concern for the incomes of German farmers. They had coipH^itJse -t  r example, in a letter from the Federal German ChanceKohl,

   the President of the Commission, Monsieur Delors - to mak^^go^CRlicit ^ nngness to invoke the terms of the Luxembourg compromise^/vAo^ am that morning the Presidency had produced another docume)^t/0


   including a cut of 1.8 per cent in cereal support prices, which the Germans were still rejecting. It appeared that it remained the Commission&apos;s intention to offset additional costs which might arise ^ above the level of their own revised proposal. The estimated costs were Ofx11 within the financial guideline. The extraordinary contrast /J^tween the Federal German attitude to budgetary expenditure in general

Ssition in these agricultural negotiations was notable.

ion it was pointed out that the latest Presidency document d the limit to which the United Kingdom could go. The of the Council, Signor Pandolfi, was clearly trying to avoid the German Minister. It would, however, be in the United interest to avoid further changes in the proposals and to r^n8	to a vote. In this way the Federal German Government

would eifwj/have to accept a cut in cereal prices or invoke the Luxembourg^Jjifipromise. The Commission were continuing to stand by their   wn proposes.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the latest Presidency documenJr~i&gt;n agricultural support prices represented the limit to which the Unit^raK^yngdom could go.

The Cabinet -

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FO^ERfej}^ said that the National Coal Board GB) had been in discussion witn^raj/^nions in the coal industry about a revision to the colliery review m^xfe^lure. There were also a number 0 prts which, as a result of the str^y were in such poor condition that the NCB did not wish to reopen	The NCB had informed the

unions of its intentions in relation t^rt  ^&gt;pits which were not to be reopened, and the National Union of Minevro^xe&apos;Jss (NUM) had agreed to an srrangement by which miners could transfeSPjto other pits or take redundancy terms. The NCB had however failed to take sufficent care in ,ie handling and presentation of the issues. The impression had been given, incorrectly, that the NCB had gone back on the agreement about a revised colliery review procedure reached the pre^Jwia October with the fMtl0na^ ^ssoc^ation of Colliery Overmen, Deputi^aivJ Shotfirers

CODS). Mr Eaton had now been brought back as Netey^Trokesman to handle t e Presentation of these issues. NACODS had, howemZj^lloted its em ers on an overtime ban and the result was 1 ikely txMije^nnounced ater that day. The latest estimate was that they would^jxS  \get a wo thirds majority but might get more than 50 per cent ^\^H&gt;our of the an* A two-thirds majority was required for a strike, but tJYj^^ule on e required majority was less clear in relation to an overarjrejhan. If the rSSU^t	short of a two-thirds majority but exceeded 5^wAcent,

e outcome might be that there would be no ban in some areas kWsV^t ast ^or a time, a ban in others. It was hoped that support


   und ^ ran^ and file NACODS members would fall away after a few weeks pressure from NUM members wishing to earn overtime payments to \	^  r earn^n8s l  st during the strike. Provided that the ban did

^ r  h -aS^ to   ^on8 it ought not to have a significant effect on the ^^NCRU1^&apos;^n^ Power station stocks by the autumn. In the meantime the would need to consider carefully the handling and presentation of iscussions on a revised colliery review procedure and announcements ^/Tc^ly to be made about the future of particular pits. NACODS had made \X~$^nreasonable demands, for example that the time taken by the

review procedure should be increased not from six months to wi	aS	had Proposed but for a longer period, probably

to Putting off pit closures beyond the lifetime of the went	iament. The NCB had announced that, if the overtime ban

a]_n 3	further talks about the colliery review procedure

^erange3-^X^^vj^(]0DS for later that week would be cancelled. A ^esumptio^/^^the talks might be desirable, and the NCB would need to ure that\^.ts position was seen by the public to be reasonable.

a* ^he Trust which administered grants to yfp3k.bal 1 grounds for ety improvements was trying to assess wha^wljfi required in ^ootball grounds to minimise fire and other sS^ryNr is ks, and would mi fndaavour^n8 to estimate the cost of carryix$g_Jirap*work out. It *    hue course be appropriate for the Gove?^Mt contribute r   1 e funds required for this purpose. One possil/r^ty might be a th UCt^  n tax on football pool betting, on the o^J^rS^anding a the pool promoters would invest more in contributTn^to the ^raprovement of safety at football grounds; but it migl^^diV\be

   k. The Lord Mayor of Bradford had established a disaster relief ^	fund. The Bradford City Council had decided to give   100,000 to

ty*.	this fund, and had asked that this expenditure should be subject to

disregard. it would clearly be difficult to penalise the Bradford Clty Council for making such a contribution. On the other hand the contribution subject to disregard could set unwelcome /^fkecedents, both for contributions by other local authorities, Jpi^ibly without any close connection with Bradford, to this fund respect of contributions by local authorities to other ^^ses (not necessarily always of a strictly charitable nature). I&apos;t^^jrfld be necessary so to define the purposes for which disregard wa^jp^jrg allowed as to minimise these risks.

c* &apos;kt was for question whether the Government should also make a contribution to the Lord Mayor of Bradford&apos;s disaster fund. The Government had not contributed to the relief fund in respect of the Ibrox Park .dJShster or to other similar disasters. Apart from the risk of maUng(jLt difficult to withhold contributions from other disaster ret^d^H^mds in future, there was also the consideration that there co(AdA^ll in due course be massive claims for damages against the Brhtraunfl City Football Club, to the funding of which the Government rod^d^ell be pressed to contribute. There was also the risk that, ifC^f^^nvernment contributed to the Bradford fund, tt could in due conrs^fer^ drawn into disputes about how the fund should be distribute^^^pX the other hand, it would look flinty-faced for the C^dymMiment not to contribute and, if there were to be a contributbmrv^t should be made sooner rather than Ut  -
