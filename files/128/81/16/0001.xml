PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Committee Stage of the T^w\Government Bill was now not going well. The Government had lost C .//Tv?ions and were likely to lose more, because a significant majwfip^Sjf crossbench peers were not persuaded of the merits of the G  ve&amp;rfnejyp s proposals. Although it would probably be possible to win some ctfrg^a^N votes by marshalling all the Government&apos;s supporters, this could nSr^^done often. It might well be necessary to reverse a c  nsideraW^/number of amendments in the House of Commons.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Mr Denis Healey, who was representing the Labour Party at the celebrations in Moscow to mark the 40th anniversary of the end of the war in Europe, had said that the ^United Kingdom Government should have been represented at a higher level /^han had been the case and that a member of the Royal Family should have ^Jrticipated. This view was not justified. It was true that Admiral of ^^JAFleet Earl Mountbatten had attended the 30th Anniversary &lt;^^%rations in Moscow in 1975, but since then the Soviet Union had

Shanistan. Because of this, senior British representatives

had not attended the annual military parades in Moscow. The w among our European partners and our allies about the nts had been that attendance by Ambassadors at a wreath J^he military parade and at a reception would be appropriate.

0f fhg United States and the Federal Republic of Germany would notMpr^hd the parade, since there were special reasons in their cases.

3- THE FOREIGN AND COM^W$eXlTH SECRETARY said that it was probable that the European Parliafv^V^which was discussing the Community&apos;s draft budget for 1985, would pron^^Xo transfer the United Kingdom&apos;s 1,000 million ecu (about   580 mi	abatement for 1984 from the revenue to

the expenditure side. If so&gt;T^^Council would restore the correct method and the European Parlia^n^iv^Nbis likely to give way on a later reading 0f the budget. The timmg^fff the presentation to the United Kingdom Parliament of the reviseajJuw^^Kesources Decision and of the intergovernmental agreement on finSYnc^yr 1985 was under discussion with colleagues.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY reported that he had held a meeting on the agricultural price fixing with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries^and Food and other colleagues^ They had congratulated the Ministei^^f (Agriculture, isheries and Food on his tenacity and skill in	icult

negotiations so far. These negotiations would be n^jsyimsd in the Council Ministers (Agriculture) on 13 May with a view to^s^4uiclusion. They ad agreed that the United Kingdom&apos;s approach should

a. In general, the United Kingdom should continue tp/  &amp;pport the Commission which had been holding to a firm line. TK^^Kfytsd Kingdom&apos;s tactics had been successful so far in streng^ti^w^vg the Commission&apos;s resolve. There would now be some small chao^^yj.n the Commission&apos;s proposals in order to make a settlement Pos*wW^


   b.	On cereal prices, if the Commission continued to propose some reduction and the Federal Republic of Germany opposed this, the preferred option would be to get a price reduction by voting the Germans down. If a vote were resisted, the Government would wish to leave no doubt that the Germans had invoked the Luxembourg compromise, as this action could be helpful to the United Kingdom in discussions on the future of the Community.

0   the beef variable premium the Minister of Agriculture, yFisheries and Food had now succeeded in including in the

idency&apos;s document the continuation of the scheme for a further

milk the United Kingdom opposed the suggested small incre^fe^in the quota for the Republic of Ireland. If this could not t^^^topped, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food might&apos;^ish to register his opposition by a vote, provided that this did not imperil other British objectives, including the continuation of the beef variable premium.

e* On budg^ta^y cost, if the proposed settlement were to involve an increase tt?y   lTev\ceiling set in the intergovernmental agreement for 1985, thenl^^^jvj-nt Council with Finance Ministers would be required. In ret^^cm to 1986 the present estimates of the budgetary conseque/^^*did not make it necessary to invoke a joint Council. Clearlyfinancial guideline were likely to be breached, the United Ku^Slom would want to demand such a joint Council. If there we^^6we further increase in estimated cost in 1986 above the level no^ijn/sseen but the figure was still within the guideline, there wouCtO^J^: inue to be close contact between the Chancellor of the Exchequ^A^*$e Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and himself.

la discussion it was pointed out tha^/lTraare were also some problems of importance to the United Kingdom on sb^pmeat which needed to be

resolved.

Benefit

housiSECRETARY   F STATE F0R	SERVICES said that the review of

beenln   benefit, unlike other partskof the social security review, had pro Carried out by an independent inquiry under Mr Jeremy Rowe. He should6 h t&apos;lat many&gt; although not^3p|^&gt;f the inquiry&apos;s recommendations ground&apos; 6 accePte&lt;^* The present schenp had been criticised on several 0   WOrk&apos; t^at those in work were t^R^^^ess favourably than those out     that help with rates went fuWrLAup the income scale than help admin&apos;rentS    that the	scheme was difliql^t to	understand and	to

l979_gQter    anc* bhat expenditure had ri^^J^^^ply from   1.2 billion in hous h t0	billion in the current ^arj||fe0 that one-third of all

would h n  W rece-tveh benefit. He proposer that in future entitlement that t-v.6 Eafec* on the same income test as the income support scheme so tucome   Se ^ and   Ut worh would be treated consistently. Above the Sl-	SuPPort level benefit would be reduced, as income rose, by a

tapers	rai8htforward	formula	instead	of, as at	present, by separate

same S	rents and rates and for different typex^k claimant. The

SchemeU ^	^  r caP^tal disregard would apply as fo\ the^ncome support

both    	Powers would be taken	to fix	percentages	reimbursement	for

being rat6S 3nd rents&gt; with the maximum level of ass^^^ for rents was t Set at 100 per cent, but that for rates at only 80 p   raent. This complet asta.bllsh the important principle that no houseMift^^^ould be improve*2 Y lnsulated from the effect of rate increases, arfP^jfi^ld thus aPProach *k16, accountability of local government, in line^^&amp;fl|h the resgrvg	e^n8 adopted	in the	review	of local government finance,	A

power would also be taken to impose a cap on rents eli^pbla^or


   housing benefit on any	individual	local	authority	in	whose	area	rents

were being raised unreasonably because the bill was being met by housing benefit. The direct subsidy to local authorities by specific grant would be	limited to 80	per cent	of benefit cost	so	as to	give	local

A^uthorities a greater incentive to control costs. These changes would Pj^eld savings of	  560	million	in the first year, by	far the largest

, s&lt;^le contribution to	the	short-term savings arising	from the social

^^^jrity review. The number of recipients of housing benefit would be          reduced by some 1.8 million, about a quarter of the present total. Most recipients would lose because of the move to less than 100 per cent reimbursement of	rates	but	the	average loss from that	change would be

about 85 pence per week. 800,000 recipients would gain but some    9 millioii would lose more than   2 per week.

la disc^gp^^he following main points were made -

a* ^ajayting the reimbursement of rates to 80 per cent would be unpopular a^l the Government would be more likely to take the blame for	rate^lncreases.	The sums	which	households	would be	required to

pay	would! however	be so	small	that there	would	be	little

significant	on	the	accountability of local	government. An

alternative ^H^fkch would be to require a standard minimum contribution, &amp;ixe  aU.n absolute lump sum terms, towards the cost of local services,	inital	impact of such a proposal would,

however, be severe because of the wide variation in rate levels and ln the scale and nature of local services in different areas. A minimum percentage contribution seemed therefore to provide the most workable approach. Although a 20 per cent contribution was small and might not do muc|l|immediately to improve accountability, it would be valuable to tufee established the principle.	The

application of the princi  F^&gt; any new form of local revenue to replace or supplement rat^^ap^d need to be considered in due course.

b* Although expenditure on ho^i^w^kbenefit had increased rapidly, this was the result partly of move to more realistic council house rents which the Government lljjK^couraged and partly of high levels of unemployment. There woul^^be concern about the effect of the housing benefit changes on the poore^members of the community and the pressure this might create for assistance under the new cash limited social aid scheme. Transitional cash protection of the kind which had been agreed in respect of the supplementary benefit changes would however be expensive if extended to the changes in housing benefit, and ought not to il^^anceded, at least at the Green Paper stage. Moreover, many of \ the&apos;^TSPorer members of the community would benefit from other cha^RprW&apos; the overall package of social security&apos; reforms. The changes in housing benefit, which at present went too far up the inco  ema le, were a major element in redirecting assistance to thos^gpSj^ in need. Cash losses were in general unlikely to arise if ^^^^mtructural changes coincided with a benefit uprating. This a^|  Lof the proposals would require particularly careful present a


   c&gt; The proposals would not be welcome to local authorities. They would be faced with the administrative burden of collecting small amounts of rates from households at present fully rebated. In certain areas	a rates strike with the connivance of local

authorities could not be ruled out, although the existing hM, disciplines on local	authority finance	and on the	conduct of

  	individual councillors	ought	to prevent	that. Local	authorities

v would also be concerned about	the effect	on the rate support grant

arrangement of the proposal for limiting specific grant to 80 per cent of housing benefit costs. It would be necessary to insert a passage in the Green	Paper	promising	consultation	with local

authority associations on these matters.

^Vv1 would	be important to ensure that	the	housing benefit

proposal|k were not inconsistent either in principle or in detail w^th &apos;^|^E^,:oPosaIs recently approved for deregulating lettings in the plivatfK rented sector. Consideration	had	been given	to

applying (^Tii&amp;ts	for rent reimbursement to avoid	exploitation	by

landlords^^^ftkthe wide variation rents throughout the country made this impracticable.	It would be sufficient to rely on reserve

powers to 1 i  |l&apos;5jj^rit reimbursement in particular areas.

Prime MINISTER^hsuJpjing up this part of the discussion, said that g e Cabinet approved sjUfle^proposals made by the Secretary of State for   cial Services on	housing benefit summarised	in	C(85)	9.	In

Particular, the income test should be aligned with that under the new C  me suPport scheme and the same rules of capital disregard should 5^ y   . tllere should be a singl^^aper, applying to both rent and rates, withdrawing benefit as nat  ficome rose; maximum help should be 100 Per cent for rents but only 80 plgLcent for rates, with a power to fix ne   er Percentages; a reserve po^j^^Skpuld be taken to impose rent cap if cessary in individual local authorityi areas; and the direct subsidy to th  a^ au*-Eorities by specific granW^hould be limited to 80 per cent of e benefit cost. Great care ^^ta^khe needed in presenting the proposal3 both to avoid the charge ^^^^every household now receiving e it would, however poor, be oblige^p^S^eet extra costs and to avoid nnecessary conflict with local authori   Hfc%yer the working of the new

system.	m

The Cabinet -

Approved the proposals on housing benefit in C(85) 9s subject to the points made in the Prime lister&apos;s summing up of their discussion. 4ft

Pensions

esse S^CRET^RY 0F STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said t^^Jtoange was peng.	ln the arrangements for pension provision:	thl^^imber of

in 2rS W3S ^Rely to rise from 10.1 million in 2005 to Jjffifcmillion w  uld f* OVer the same period the ratio of contributors to^r  ^oners fall from 2.2:1 to 1.8:1; and the cost of state pens^fs^^uld


   riSe from   15i billion in the current year to   45 billion (if basic pensions were uprated by prices) or   66 billion (if uprated on earnings) ln 2033-34. These costs would be a great burden and decisions were needed now if they were to be avoided. In addition there was a strong | case for reducing State involvement and giving all those in work the AFrght to an occupational or personal pension. There were, however, ^^oblems in making the transition from pay-as-you-go to funded ^ ^J^ngements and as regards the expectations of those nearing ^   P&gt;%rement. Following discussions in the Ministerial Group on Social ecurity further consideration had been given to the issues by a smaller group of Ministers under the Prime Minister&apos;s chairmanship. His Proposals were set out in C(85) 12. They were to make no change in the asic state pension but to phase out the State Earnings Related Pension c eme	for men aged under 50 and women aged under 45 between

o/-88 and 1989-90 and to replace it with compulsory private Provisio^^jipiQugh occupational, industry or personal schemes with a minimum cl^tr i bution of 2 per cent each by employers and employees by k e end   f    ^^W^^nsitional period. All rights earned under SERPS would    preserved5, anjL for men aged 50 or over and women aged 45 or over PS would d&apos;o^p||^e until their retirement. These proposals would   ubtedly be ^ext reme ly controversial, but they would be more soundly ased than preside arrangements and offer the individual much greater rnvolvement and	ter choice in his pension arrangements.

In discussion the foll^d^g main points were made -

a* Whether or not the burden of SERPS would be supportable in the next century depended crucially on the country&apos;s economic performance in the meantime. It would be unwise to say that the necessary growth would not happen. The case for change was very strong but rested rath^fc(ra^jk:he imprudence of assuming that the growth would happen and tWfiKtt^r benefits of the change to private provision.

k*	The proposals for deal^^^^Lth the short-term transitional

problems and with the position &apos;bf those nearing retirement would go a long way to meet major c r i^fi c i sms. It would, however, be important to ensure that the new a^^Si^ments would be able to meet the needs of people such as t h o s e^Whtptmov e d jobs frequently for whom occupational schemes would n$Jr Be satisfactory or were unlikely to be available. The proposals for early leavers in the Present Session&apos;s Social Security Bill, and for personal pensions should meet these needs.

c*	Broadly those who did not contribute tpjfiERPS would not be

covered by the new compulsory requirementparticular the Position of the self-employed would be unchangeSifHfce low paid and unemployed would not contribute.

^    There would necessarily be a very great incr^BJ^jjjL the funds   f the pension industry and it would be important t$by||flpure that ully adequate arrangements for investor protection were in place.


   It was also necessary that occupational schemes established by companies should be on a fully-funded basis to protect contributors fet	against such eventualities as company insolvency.

e&apos; Very careful attention would need to be paid to effective Kl&apos;, Presentation of the case for the proposals. The danger was that V v the long-term advantages would be overshadowed by immediate disadvantages. Contributions would rise for those at present contracted-out of SERPS and the changes would be blamed even though this would have happened anyway. Combined National Insurance and private contributions for those at present in SERPS would also rise for lower benefits. Employers would be faced with more complex arraiMeinents.	Furthermore the Opposition were very likely to

threaterirepeal which would be likely to create great uncertainty

| jib * RIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, said that g e Cabinet ^^&gt;r^gd the proposals made by the Secretary of State for ^  cial Service?^on pensions set out in C(85) 12. In particular, for men th6&apos;   r   Ve^2l^iii?nien a8ec* 45 or over, SERPS should continue until eir retirement ,^hile for all other employees SERPS should be replaced over the three ye^^P*11^87-88 to 1989-90 by a minimum private pension equirement. This \roui^|ipvolve preservation of all SERPS rights earned &apos;fq tQ *987; reduced&apos;Wates of accrual of additional SERPS rights in 7-88 and 1988-89 and no new SERPS rights thereafter; and a minimum Priyate Pension contribution by employers and employees of 1 per cent the ^ *987-88, of l   per cent in 1988-89, and of 2 per cent each ereafter. National Insuranctf^ontribution rates would be changed to t^eC .*	1   presenting the prfcpos^ls it would be important to emphasise

6 lmPrudence of continuing ^Jc^IbERPS and the advantages of private

Provision.

The Cabinet -	^

Death Or

brant

rem ?ECRETARY of STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that the death grant had der^lneC* 3t t*ie same cash level -   30 - for many years. This was now admiS  ry w*len compared with the cost of a reasonable funeral, and the mistration cost was fast approaching the cost o^^Lhe benefit. He Wo  P  Sa&lt;* therefore that the grant should be aboli$h#3k Those in need e provided with help through the social aid scheme.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that the maternity grant a also remained at the same cash level -   25 - for many years. He proposed to replace this universal grant with a grant of   75 to mothers      low-income families, ie. those on supplementary benefit or in receipt &amp; family credit. He also proposed to make the qualification period for |%  ernity allowance more relevant to working women and the period of ^Jfent more flexible.

The Cabinet -

THE SECRETAR^QI^taTE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that he proposed to ace the shW^HSepn widows&apos; allowance (currently paid for six months) a lump sum gffihfg^gf   750. Thereafter, continuing benefits would be en rated morem|widows aged 45 or over and those with children.

In discussion it was^   n^oli that a lump sum grant of   1,000 would be more y equivalent to We short-term allowance that was being replaced. rathe&gt;U^&lt;1 ketter to set the grant at this level from the beginning a^sler than to have to concede it later in response to pressure. It was would n  ted t*aat   as with the present arrangements, the new proposals the F n0t extenc* to widowers, ^here might be some risk of challenge in 0   uropean Court, but the ntfewaof widowers were not the same as those widows and the cost of emending arrangements to them could not be

Justifled.

The Cabinet -

p* Agreed the proposals of the^^J^ary of State or Social Services on widows&apos; ben^E.t, ,and that the amount of the lump sum grant should&apos;^^^^^ at   1,000.

Students

Gove SECRETf&apos;RY   F STATE F0R SOCIAL SERVICES said that in line with the s  ci^ment s general stance that young people should not depend on intent   SeCUr^tF benefits, he proposed to announce knflfeks Green Paper an hous     10n	Principle to exclude students frcMA^Wplementary and

Secret   benefits. This would be carried forward	light of the

He and3ry   E   tate f  r Education and Science&apos;s review W%toJent grants. certa&apos; t*le ^ecretary   f State for Education and ScienceJsacMalso agreed which10 S^ort~t:erin measures affecting students&apos; entitlenw^^fk benefits adeq WOuT^ need to be announced the following week in o^P^^pto allow impleate fi  6	for	consultation with those concerq^SyAbe fore

EePtembntat^  n From the beginning of the next academis||W^Pjr in


   THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion of these proposals, said that the Cabinet agreed with the way in which the Secretary of ate for Social Services proposed to deal with student support in his bGreen Paper. They considered, however, that the short-term proposals ilkould not be announced in advance of the Green Paper. They accepted this might mean that the measures could not be implemented from the    sJknniug of the next academic year. The Secretary of State for Social should discuss the implications of this decision with the ancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Education and

Science.

The Cabinet -

6. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of this part of the discussion and invited the Sacretlhry of State for Social Services, the Secretary of|  tate for Education and Science and the Chancellor o^The Exchequer to be guided accordingly.



THE SECRETARY of S  E FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that in C(85) 9 he had dur^  ^e&lt;^ t0 increase ^ffie rate of unemployment benefit and reduce its ration from 12 to 6 months. The effect would have been to reduce the the^3^ between unemployment and supplementary benefit thereby making arrangements in this area easier to understand and simpler to There would, however, be a consequential increase of &gt; GO in the numbers receiving Supplementary benefit after six months ^employment while 85,000 peo^  yi!j$^d no longer receive any benefit at ben fend   f this Period* 0n ^P^Sfetion, he did not think that the ne its of these changes woulc^be Worthwhile and he therefore now Posed to make no change in the aftanyajnents for unemployment benefit.
