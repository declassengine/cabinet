THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that there was a report in that day&apos;s Guardian that the Government was considering legislation following the court&apos;s decision in favour of the Greater London Council, ^bout which he had informed colleagues the previous week. He had been ^yivised that the Government was unlikely to win an appeal against the t&apos; s decision. He would be bringing proposals to colleagues ^W^tly.

HE HOME S^t^ETARY said that discussions were proceeding with the Pposition explore a basis on which a timetable could be agreed for fhe Committee Stage of the Representation of the People Bill which was ein8 taken on the floor of the House. There was no question of Altering the provi^Sijcte relating to overseas or holiday votes, but the overnment had mar-Vpqr that its proposals on the electoral deposit w&amp;re subject to conijl^r^ion, and there was considerable controversy on thls matter.

G2; THE FOREIGN AND COMMON^H	^ &apos;   

ernment had now announced their decision to withdraw from the Lebanon jg three phases, of which the first was due to be completed by &gt; February. The process of withdrawal would involve the risk of chaos disorder in south Lebanon. The Prime Minister and he had discussed situation on the previous day with the Secretary General of the Nations, Mr Perez de Cuellar. The most satisfactory solution an adjustment to the role of the United Nations International j^^An Lebanon (UNIFIL) towards playing a part in preserving peace in without such measures as manning check-points. This would ^otMn\j^]^e any increase in the size of UNIFIL and there would be no |nv  lv&lt;^m^^ of United Kingdom troops, although the United Kingdom&apos;s g ^lst V&gt;mort for the force would be maintained. Any such P^elopn^wrwciuld, however, depend on a formal request by the Lebanese Gov^^^	Fres^ent of the Security Council, and the British

^ rnment N^ould be urging the Lebanese Prime Minister to formulate one. ,re could be no guarantee that peace in south Lebanon would be ained and it was difficult to be optimistic about the outcome.

bet F^^TGN AND COMMUWJ#a$-H SECRETARY said that the meeting in New York q w  en President Kypr ra^rc^aT Cyprus and Mr Denktash, the Turkish tii ri  !&apos; ^eader, which haa^^im^ about through the tenacious efforts of liil^n^teC* ^at^ons Secre tary&apos;O^&amp;eral, had ended in disagreement. Its nit- UrS aPPeared to have bew^^Kfes. partly to misunderstandings over the re the meeting and parv^iV^A the fact that President Kyprianou . overplayecj his hand. In tTjjE^Jmh^diate aftermath of the breakdown,

   t a seemed unlikely that contsAcna^t this level could be resumed; but now seemed possible that both ^i^^Vere beginning to realise the Gov S t0 t^ear own interests of a p^lna^vhnt break and the British fUr^rnment, at Mr Perez de Cuellar&apos; s	, would be urging the

ls^ Government to exert its influen^^on Mr Denktash to restrain him v&lt;r p any steps to consolidate the Turki^^firesence in north Cyprus. ro^e rez de Cuellar&apos;s evident intention tXAx  ?severe in his mediating

was encouraging and the United KingdcJm(would give him full support n this.

HE SECRETARY^,OF S^TE FOR ENERGY said that the number of miners ^turning to w  fk yas greater than in the previous week and would exceed .000 for the wf^  fc a whole. Some 42 per cent of those employees of . National Coal Board, (NCB) who were members of the National Union of lnew  rkers (NUM) &apos;here ngw at work. The number of pits producing coal ad increased to 74^W^W.as expected that coal movements for the week would be at least 90^3Q|j ,k)nnes:	the amount moved by rail would be the

18hest for several moftl   ns:	There was every indication that, with the

eturn to work continuing and even accelerating, the NUM was now asPerate to achieve a negotiated settlement. A meeting was taking p ace that morning of the NUM&apos;s National Executive, which might well esult in a request to the NCB t^ceopen negotiations. Although there ad been some informal contact batmen NUM and NCB officials, there was gS.yet no clear evidence that a\satisfactory basis for a settlement fisted. The NCB Chairman, Mr Ma&lt;jj|  ^r, was putting out a statement r ab if, following the meeting of^^a|0^i|l National Executive, the NCB eceived written indication that theWNUl^were prepared to help resolve e problem of dealing with uneconom^^&amp;j||ta:ity the NCB would be repared to re-enter negotiations; andt^al; the proposals must establish u ab the NUM recognised that management ^fcgfc,|iea 1 with the problems of ^economic capacity and that the NUM woul% co-operate in this essential ma^k&gt; recognising the other commitments th* the .Board were prepared to e on the future of their employees and tht^ffnoustry.

^NE HOME SECRETARY said that picketing had recently been light and that ad been possible to reduce considerably the level of police effort the mining areas.

2iATT0RNEY GENERAL said that the Receiver appointed to take over the CQri S funds in Luxembourg had reached an agreement with the bankv.

Cerned, but that the Luxembourg Government had intervened threatening


   T,Wltbdrawai   f the bank&apos;s li cence if the agreement was implemented.

e matter was being pursued through diplomatic channels. The Receiver Was however likely to succeed in taking over the NUM&apos;s funds in Dublin.

Prime MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet orsed the line taken by the NCB Chairman in insisting, as a condition 1	  f reopening talks and of a settlement, that management should be

to deal with uneconomic capacity in accordance with the revised rocedures. Any suggestion that there might be a period after the urn to work when the closures procedures did not apply should be jected. The Government should continue to resist proposals from church ers and others for an independent inquiry into energy policy: it rev|rtL no new information and would not help to deal with the   mwec  nomic pits. The NCB should now urgently develop its rng&apos;i^*&gt;he composition and methods of working of the colliery As advW%^&gt;body agreed in the negotiations with the National Sec  Clatl0nColliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers and the

retary of    tatsl .for Energy should report on the NCB&apos;s views not later tha&quot; 31 Ja[,ua^kjV

The Cabinet

Took note wi^Myiproval of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of th^di scussion.

Invited the Secretary of State for Energy to reP  rt on the National Coal Board&apos;s thinking about tbe composition and methodMaf working of the new uolliery review advisory ^aB^not later than 31 January.
