THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT drew attention to press 0 eP  rts of the discussion among members of the Cabinet at the informal /feting at Chequers on public expenditure on 23 June. The reports could Yo\e been based only on information derived from somebody who was Vnt at t*le meetin8* Observations had been attributed to him which not made. Not only was this unfair to other members of the bIs5VaS weH as to himself; reports of the kind that had i ^^*v*-^shed, especially if constantly reiterated, gave the public the P	of a Cabinet that was divided and uncertain about the

THE

^ K-xi^i^fjifjjsTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that the reports ,t&apos;le d^Cussion at Chequers served to emphasise the importance of    a^nta^i   S strict confidentiality on proceedings in Cabinet and in ^ er Ministerial discussions, so as to protect the frankness in Fo CUSS10n which w^s an indispensable feature of Cabinet government.

r t^at reason/vSivWell as in the interests of the Government&apos;s giv lnS in the\^  W, it; was important that journalists should not be the^ kr^e^in8s or//?ncm\cations of what was said by various Ministers in r contr ibutionUuxvprivate discussions among colleagues, in Cabinet or elsewhere.	&lt;yj]s&gt;

But it had been clear from the Prime Mini/l&apos;ef&apos;Qy


   talks on 3 July with the United States Vice-President, Mr George Bush, that the United States felt a strong desire to bring those responsible ^for the hijacking to justice. The United Kingdom would keep in close ^ouch with the United States on this.

statement following the Prime Minister&apos;s meeting with Vice/l^Kdent Bush, the United Kingdom and the United States had announr^k^hat they would seek the agreement of all states which shared   heir cTcma^n for the security of civil aviation to suspend all services between &lt;^^j^countries and Beirut International Airport. It appeared at Presen7y^faJ^Italy had not decided whether to follow this lead.

France was M^iJ^ikely to do so. Senior officials of the countries Participating^in the seven power Economic Summits were due to meet in Bonn in the following week, as a result of British, American and Canadian pressure on the Federal Republic of Germany. A major British Purpose at that meekJSx would be to secure the revitalisation of the B  nn declaration oEM9^B. In parallel, the United Kingdom was working for joint decisions^-ejjrfw^Xthe 10 countries of the European Community on the proposals for comraj^n/pg terrorism which had been circulated by the United Kingdom during qj^/oeeting of the European Council in Milan on 28 and 29 June.

discussion, the following p^fots were made -

a.	French reluctance tbXD^^Joint action against aviation terrorism was a serious imn/?^fm^wit to progress. A contributory factor in the present situaWyOn^X^as that Middle Eastern Airlines, which operated from Beirut, w^^^fc^tly owned by Air France.

h- The unique characteristic o	?rans World Airlines

hijacking had been that Beirut Airnrf^C, where much of the drama had taken place, had itself been contrO^^^y no government. While the long-term aim should be that Bei^^A^rport, one of the most important in the Middle East, should afofin become secure for use, there was no alternative in the near fuvure to the policy being pursued by the United States and the United Kingdom of seeking to persuade responsible countries to refuse to receive flights which had started or stopped over at Beirut.	(t~)\

c    There was a risk that the intended blockacTe&apos;^fFjBeirut Airport would not be totally effective. Airlines from nxja^y^Sticipating countries might transfer passengers to flights con^rfpwrj^g with Participating countries. But energetic pursuit of	of a

blockade was nevertheless the best available policy.

h. Other countries were likely to join the United StaM^^aml the United Kingdom in this policy. Even if this were not thev^  w  \it would still be preferable for the United States and the Kingdom to be pursuing the policy together than for the Unic^s&amp;kw States to be doing so alone.


   e* The Chairman of British Airways (BA), Lord King, had privately expressed concern that, if BA participated in a formal blockade of Beirut Airport, there could be retaliation against the airline by terrorists in some other country. It would be up to BA to take ) precautions against this risk. The more countries participating in ^he blockade, the less would be the risk of retaliation against any % ticular country&apos;s airlines.

The Greek Government were taking seriously the recommendations International Air Transport Association for improving at Athens Airport.

JHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECF^TA^Xsaid that, following the South g rican raid into Gabarone in Botsw^np^^i 14 June, there had been a pur \^Er*can military incursion int^^A  ^&amp;La on 29-30 June, allegedly in rj,^eSult   f members of the South West	People&apos;s Organisation.

   SovieV^U

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the appointment of r Andrei Gromyko, the veteran Soviet Foreign Minister, to the State presidency of the Soviet Union, while occasionally rumoured in the past, come as a surprise. It was very unusual for a Foreign Minister to ^u  me President, although it was not unusual for the positions of Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and of ^5oy^President to be separated. The appointment of Mr Eduard ^o^^Wnadze, hitherto First Secretary of the Communist Party of the

public of Georgia, as Foreign Minister had come as a complete Mr Shevardnadze was relatively young. He had a reputation 0r tou^hfl^ss and effectiveness in Georgia. The speed of the major changes^j^^^he Soviet leadership, including the departure of r Tg^l^^J^ianov, demonstrated the rapidity with which Mr Mikhail   rbachev*^//rt)nsoiidating his position as leader. While Mr Gromyko would retaitf^nfluence on foreign policy, that influence would probably ecline graa^jlly and Mr Gorbachev&apos;s was likely to increase.

Tt had now been announced that President Reagan of the United States and r Gorbachev would/  S^t at a Summit in Geneva in November 1985. The nited States was cfoncvrned that public expectations about the results this meeting shoOTV^tm&apos;t be excessively high.

Tn a brief discussion, i^4was noted that the early announcement of the ^nmmit meeting would mako^^^/Harder to dampen expectations. President 1tterrand of France wouTt^AjC^ikely to exploit commercially and Politically the visit of Mr Cfo^^chev to France in October 1985, which    as lively to be the latter &apos;^rmt visit to the West since he became eneral Secretary of the Commimi^V^Carty of the Soviet Union.

    the prime MINISTER said that the meetirafof the European Council in 1 an on 28-29 June had been the worst chaired international meeting she a attended. The United Kingdom&apos;s own position had been very well ^epare(l. She had met the Federal German Chance 11 or^ Rerr Kohl, at equers on 18 May, had let him have the United Ki^gSato&apos; s proposals for agreement on political co-operation, improved aA^^ian-making and the ^  nipletion of the internal market, and had sought hi!//^/T*ys in ah&apos;1 1C*ence* These proposals had then been given to OQe^Jr&apos;&amp;nch and,

0ut two weeks before the European Council, had been o&lt;  t^aJpsited to all mem ?r states by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary ^j  ^&gt;^informal   f Foreign Ministers. They had been generally we Q^&apos;^eeteived. nQe ^rench President, Monsieur Mitterrand, had said to her tb  0vjve was Qne ln favour of deferring decisions to an intergovernmentar^fnrHrence. Ger before the European Council, however, the Federal Re pcsiJ^e^Xf manyj with French support, had announced their proposal for ^&lt;T^  ty ur  pean Union. Apart from the new title this was almost vert^J^/ e United Kingdom&apos;s text on political co-operation, except that rz


   slightly weaker on one or two points and that a proposal for a \ ecretary-General for political co-operation had been added. Nonetheless, the discussions on the first day of the European Council been satisfactory. France had taken almost the same line as the ^yv^ted Kingdom on decision-making and on the European Parliament,

the wish of some member states, including the Federal Republic /^vnmany, to give more powers to the European Parliament. At a

meeting of Foreign Ministers, eight member states had been T	support of the United Kingdom&apos;s approach, with only two -

al  ^nff\Belgium - strongly opposed. Luxembourg, as the next residej*  y^ had been particularly keen to avoid an illusion at Milan lowed brjPa collapse at Luxembourg. On the internal market there was support	United Kingdom&apos;s view that the European Council should

Set PriorlK^j^nb that other questions, including tax harmonisation, should be r  f^tted for further study. On technology there was a wide k asure of agreement that the emphasis should be on collaboration etween companies themselves, and there was a favourable reception for e United Kingdom&apos;s idea that the products of such collaboration should ve a guarantee ofi^S^hal access to public purchasing within the ommunity. On the Bfecoqjd day the secretariat had circulated a reasonable residency text of ciA^t&apos;staonclusions. Discussion in the European ^ Uncil, however, hadU^gWa^ntrated on a new Franco-German text and ater, in cons iderab le&apos;&quot;fim  fi&apos;us ion, on a compromise text on ClSl  n-making. The ItsnuhrtW   residency, having concentrated all the f ter&gt;tion on to the questxmi^H^ther there was to be an mtergovernmen tal conference i^^Lled a vote of Heads of Government ^ et-her there should be suchC^^Oyference under Article 236 of the eaty. Seven members statesfavour and three - the United ^rngdom, Denmark and Greece - waij  ^wj&gt;osed. Article 236 dealt with conferences for the purpose of	the Treaty. There was no formal

Proposal before the Council but tn&amp;^DpHjyission had indicated that it considered that Articles 57(2) and ]^$rsj  tauld be amended to provide for ecisions by qualified majority. The&gt;^UM^l German Chancellor had immediately rejected an earlier suggestLefjKTrv the Commission that tb lCl&apos;e ^9, which dealt with tax harmoni^f  &lt;mi, might be amended. In . e difficult and confused situation, deciVirj*^ on immediate action to improve the working of the Community were amtfpped from the conclusions. te&amp; COnc^usi  ns on the internal market and rv most respects on ^achnologys however, were satisfactory, as was the continued support for ited Kingdom views on political co-operation.

^^Scussi  n it was said that the new Luxembourg (^Ces^dency would be to take a more realistic approach. The Unit?o^(TnWdom had put rward practical proposals for decision there and ttr^aojrtVi in the end reed decisions would only be possible broadly on the ^TjAwe had ^uSgested. it Was, however, a matter of concern that Frrf^J^nd the eral Republic of Germany seemed determined to exclude t^0^D  .ted n8 om from their close relationship. While the substance	nch

oposals was very similar to those of the United Kingdom, Fl^(jrce)\tfas ^ ays ready to present itself as being ready to move more qul\i3  &gt;y^\ Fed3rdS   uroPean Union and this was an attractive element for

eral Republic of Germany. In reality, the United Kingdom wisn&amp;d/bo e faster than many other member states on the completion of th


   \ rg eraal market, and those member states were ready to retain

A&apos;     rictlons on, for example, lorry traffic, shipping, air fares and

ranee. When there was talk of a two-speed Europe, it was important (   v/v xt should be seen that on such substantive matters the United m was in the fast lane-
