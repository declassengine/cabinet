^^\SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the Government

be tabling major amendments to the Local Government Bill for the *%f^V^\Stage in the House of Commons the following week. They would anti-avoidance measures recently approved by colleagues and the d&amp;^c\Xed operation of the guillotine would need to take full account of	was also highly desirable that there should be a discussion

and vo^Zrp^ng the Report State on a &quot;Voice for London&quot; so that subsequenyVpp^ceedings in the House of Lords could be against the backgrounded: a clear Commons rejection of any such proposition. An amendment the subject had been defeated in Committee by 23 votes but this might not be regarded as decisive by opponents in the House of Lords. The position was that no relevant amendment had yet been put down for Report; i^hhis remained the position, it would be possible to argue that the a been cue of any amendment was itself an indication of the lack of strong feef^f&apos;^p the topic, but a decisive vote would be

Preferable.

2- the FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTl^^^^TARY said that the trial in Lagos two employees of Bristow Helicop  ^rV\Limited had been adjourned, Probably for as much as a month, foa successful request by their defence counsel for an interim order ^   pa.ining proceedings and a plea   f autrefois acquit. Counsel for the S5^&amp;ce were adamant that this move was in the best interests of the de$^p&lt;J  nts; but the conditions of &apos;-heir detention were at least as bad as hw^ been feared and consular access to them continued to be denied. ItMiad not yet been possible for the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s personal message to the Nigerian Foreign Minister, Dr Gambari, to be delijte^ed and it might Prove necessary to summon the Nigerian Acting HVfffT~^mmissioner in London instead. There was clearly a possibility\^a*r*he Nigerian G  vernment were establishing a political connection(between the case of the two helicopter engineers and the future status	exiled former

Nigerian Minister for Transport, Mr Umaru Dikko. Th^   Mw^ies of the two British detainees were justifiably concerned over (h^frv^ituation. it would be essential to maintain pressure on the NigerHnva^horities   n behalf of the detainees. Discussions between Foreign Commonwealth Office and Home Office officials on Mr Dikko&apos;	were

making good progress but the Home Secretary considered that	give

Nr Dikko an opportunity to present further evidence in suppor b\(rk}  xs Application for asylum in the United Kingdom. These affairs weR^/^  J|w.ng i  r some tension in relations with Nigeria, but did not so far


   be affecting trade:	Nigeria continued to be an important market for

British exports, which for the month of January 1985 amounted to nearly   100 million on fully secured terms.

still no news of the two British kidnap victims, Mr Geoffrey Na&amp;rap  \Mr Brian Levick. The Lebanese Government, and the United Naticj^^^^retary-General had issued appeals for their release, and an approa^    o-vthe Iranian Government was under consideration. Those members^	British community who were still in West Beirut had been

advised t&amp;O^ve immediately, and advice against continued residence in other part^Tof the Lebanon still stood. There was, however, no immediate prospect of a requirement for assisted evacuation. Steps had been taken further to reduce the staff of the British Embassy in Beirut, from its present complement of 19 to the minimum of 6 which was considered essen^aTnio carry out its political and consular role.

TliE LO^p/C$siDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he had just returned from a ^isit td^mrazil where he had represented Her Majesty&apos;s Government at the inauguration of the new democratically elected Administration headed by President Tancredo Neves. He had been struck by the huge size of the country, comparable in area to the United States, and by the size and relative youth	rapidly increasing population. Brazil&apos;s financial

situation, and((n ^Articular the rate of inflation, was very worrying; i*ut the economic-^^te^vtial of the country was vast. Those United Kingdom firms whifc^y^pe seeking to establish themselves in the Brazilian market r^aJM^ed that they could expect no quick returns but that in the longer feV^rae commercial rewards could be considerable, -here was widespread	towards the new President who was regarded

as the only politiciancap&lt;j  2e of establishing the new democratic regime successfully. The opera  ^*Which had prevented him, at the last minute, from attending th^Q^jAgural ceremonies had been a serious blow, and the prospects for his	were unclear: but the complex

ceremonial arrangements had w^e^Njarried out with impressive skill and efficiency. The Vice PresidenJt/^enor Jose Sarney, who was temporarily ln charge of the Government, wds7jfr  &amp;generally trusted in view of his earlier defection from the militx^^gime. Despite these uncertainties   ver the new leadership, however, ^km^fjsial circles in Brazil took an   Ptimistic view of the country&apos;s ec^W^A future, which, given the c  nsiderable goodwill which the Unit   3^higdom enjoyed there and the genuine Brazilian desire to improve AnMp^razilian relations, held out Very significant opportunities for Brit^h industry and commerce.

3* THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY reported that the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) was now into its fifth day of discussion and negotiation on the enlargement of the Community by the accession of ^Spain and Portugal. There was reasonable optimism that all the main ^Points remaining in dispute with Spain and Portugal would be settled and no negotiating issues     apart from the Greek link with integrated ^^iterranean programmes - would need to be submitted to the European &gt;.&lt;  yjjHfcil. The results of the latest rounds of the negotiations with and Portugal looked good for the United Kingdom. British   *7o  %es seemed likely to be almost entirely achieved. In the fi^S^Ksector Spanish fishing vessels would be completely excluded from&lt;roe^orth Sea for a long period. Fishing restrictions in the Irish Box wo  k  j*&amp; maintained, probably for ten years. On agriculture there remaine&apos;  -\i|2ostantial differences between Spain and the Community on fruit andC^gitables, particularly because of the French interest, but both on tt&amp;ee products and on potential agricultural exports to Spain the United Kingdom&apos;s position was met. He had again made quite clear the need to retain the term &quot;British sherry&quot;, while making it clear that this was not a prodttct for which there was expected to be significant demand outside ttfpUM-ted Kingdom. On social affairs the United Kingdom and Spain had agrV2d^5H\a text which satisfied British conditions in relation to Gibraltar^ )yDiscussion was continuing on how this text should be handled, s^    $^he Spanish did not want it to be included in the Treaty of Access	the public record. On the transitional

financing arrangements 4^r^toain and Portugal the President of the Commission, Monsieur DelorsS^tpad so far held firm on the view that this must be handled in line wi#    f  k Greek model, which would ensure that the Fontainebleau mechanism\^&gt;j&gt;i/L  d.

A sa tisfactory settlement of theseN^ssues now seemed likely. It   ight be reached at the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) which was m progress, but the reaction of all member states was not yet known. f-n discussion it was pointed out that the United^-nicdom would need to remain firmly on the position that the United Kixsdogiwould not complete fhe ratification of the revised own resources decxstetimYintil the Community budget providing for the 1,000 million els^-^rjement had been ad  pted.	lip

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that in the Council of Ministers (Environment) on 20-21 March agreement had been reached on all the important principles of a Community position on stricter emission standards for cars. The United Kingdom&apos;s objectives, in particular that &gt;the standards for medium cars should be capable of being achieved ^^ithout three-way catalytic converters, had been achieved. The dates of

*tion and the precise definition of the standards remained to be d in a high-level group. The German fiscal incentives would be to a level which was substantially below the cost of equipping a h a catalytic converter. In view of the agreement, the issue go to the European Council. The Foreign and Commonwealth J&lt;:cr  Wvs contacts with the President of the Commission, Monsieur Delonf^Jrti with the French Foreign Minister, Monsieur Dumas, had borne ^ruit   &apos;^PtiSyCommissioner responsible for the environment, Mr Clinton Uavis, haxlvb^n more helpful than at the last Council. There had, however,	a need for very hard bargaining in order to achieve this

result, whr^i reflected much credit on the Parliamentary Under Secretary State, Department of the Environment (Mr Waldegrave). In discussion xt Was said that the agreement was certainly a good deal less bad than had been feared. /Jtsyas regrettable, however, that the attitude and actions of tn^Faoeral German Government had made it necessary to handle this issue	Community by these means: it was not the best

concern in the UnitedAnfcbni about the effect of vehicle emissions and, n  w that an agreement ha  xj!&amp;en reached, it should be presented Positively.

In these circumstances the Government could ardly aVi  id making use of the powers of the 1984 Act, under which they should have a very strong case. Further consideration would need to be given to the possiblity of parallel action in Scotland, given the ifferences bettfjJeh. the English and Scottish legal systems.

j?    The Cabinet considered a memorali2xtjJ^&apos;&gt;y the Secretary of State for ence on the choice of a new Basic Tr/yr&amp;c for the Royal Air Force (RAF) (C(85 ) 7). .

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that there had been intense ompetition for the replacement of the Jet Provost. The Ministry of c,   nc  &apos;s original estimate of the cost of 130/^rt~Rlsraft had been over roillion; the price quoted by the lowest qandewer was in the event Jl)st over   120 million on the same basis. At tra^cTsking date of the ^ompetition the Short&apos;s Tucano had a price advant^ag^/oji 10 per cent on a inf? R5&apos;*&apos;Ce basis (ie with the supplier taking all T^Wisks of ation) over the British Aerospace (BAe) PC9. In jlK&amp;Axon the th^ni^ costs of the Tucano were estimated to be   9	lower over

   life of the aircraft than those of the PC9, in terms&apos;xj^Oiet present for 6*   Ae ^ad   ffereH a further price reduction after &lt;  k*^&lt;skosing date w  r the competition, but the Short&apos;s tender remained the	The RAF

the  1 ^Cati  nI but they accepted that the Tucano&apos;s performam^xf^KLy met sPecification, and had no doubts about the use in the airra^^t/of.


   the new Garrett engine, which although as yet untried in the Tucano should improve its performance. Leaving aside price and running cost considerations, the choice between the Short&apos;s and BAe aircraft was .fairly finely balanced: both aircraft would provide broadly comparable ^mounts of additional employment in areas of high unemployment; the ^nVospect of a rather larger number of export sales of the PC9 was ^A^anced by the relatively higher United Kingdom content in exports of ^W^Njucano. Whichever aircraft was chosen, there was a risk of some NW^f^e impact on trade and foreign relations with the country a^s^%^ted with the losing contender - Switzerland in the case of the pC9(jffTd&gt;kxazil in the case of the Tucano. The contract was relatively much ^OT^important to Short&apos;s than to BAe; annual expenditure during the	contract would correspond to about 20 per cent of the

Ministr	fence&apos;s current annual spend with Short&apos;s, as against

about 2 pVAXe^it of the Ministry of Defence&apos;s current annual spend with BAe. The t^yernment was determined to pursue better value for money by increasing competition for defence contracts, and there would now need to be very strong grounds for rejecting the lowest tender in this competition: he thgififore recommended that the RAF should purchase the Short&apos;s Tucano. (fl)

THE SECRETARY OF S^A/EjW SCOTLAND said that there were important arguments in favour	choice of the BAe PC9. It was the better

aircraft; it promised ^arojfo^pin the way of additional United Kingdom employment, in areas wh^j^^y^employment was at a level comparable with, or even higher than, tha^i^^tarthem Ireland; if the PC9 were chosen there was a real prospect o  ^  ktt and Whitney installing a facility in Scotland to service their 1 i^nt^)angines used all over Western Europe; the PC9 and the Hawk togetheK^a^aOan attractive package for export Sales to foreign air forces; aw5f&gt;^!*^&gt;tzerland was a far better and financially stronger industrialvb^HM^nr than Brazil. There was very Sreat interest in Scotland in the heptfaxation of the RAF contract, and there would be great disappointment^fpi^ if the Tucano were chosen.

in the ensuing discussion, the importi^^^f preserving the integrity of the competition process for defence contwU was generally acknowledged. The following further poiv^/were made -

a.	Whichever aircraft was chosen, there were likely to be some Central Government payments of regional assistance towards the establishment of industrial facilities, with^5&gt;  he total programmes already agreed. These payments should not u^f^yt the decision.

b.	There was a real risk of losing sales to^h^^iss armed

forces of Land Rovers and the Hawk Trainer. TRtr  ^Were, however, signs that the Swiss might not go ahead with the   *$^  vers purchase, whatever the decision on the RAF Basic	and it

would not be possible to allow considerations of thisj^ffld to determine the decision in the RAF Trainer case consi^^tTk with the operation of genuine competition for United Kingdota^d^^wce contracts. Nevertheless it would be important to give tbfe^fc^ss


   Government the earliest possible notice of a decision in favour of the Tucano, in order to minimise the damage to prospects for future defence sales and industrial collaboration.

c.	Although there were prospects of defence sales to Brazil over J) the next ten years at least as great as those to Switzerland, the

limit on Export Credits Guarantee Department cover for exports to .--Brazil was already exhausted, and Brazil&apos;s ability to repay W^mained    *-n seri  us doubt. If substantial export orders were

/^ifcured for the Tucano, the possibility should be explored that the &lt;^&gt;i^generated in the United Kingdom for Brazil should be applied Jttrk purchase by Brazil of other United Kingdom military e6&gt;gj^nt (eg the Westland Lynx).

d.	decision needed to be taken into account in the preliminary prospectus for the forthcoming sale of BAe shares, which was to be published at the beginning of April. This being so, there would be advantage in making the announcement as far as possible in ^  3&amp;nce of the publication of BAe&apos;s financial results on 26 March ((T^s pointed to an immediate statement, preferably on 21 March.

e.	if the decTs^rfy were in favour of the Tucano, the Government should neverthelesj/Z^^vtinue efforts to make sales of defence equipment to Switze^^o^ whose decisions were likely in the end to be guided by strictly &apos;egwtomic and financial considerations. Similarly every effor^^0rov&apos;ld be made to attract the Pratt and Whitney engine servicin^J^^adity to Scotland.

THE Prime MINISTER, summing up&apos;wj&amp;^fDLscussion, said that the Cabinet recognised the merits of the BAe&lt;^$C^  nd the advantages its purchase would bring. But the competition	fairly won by the Short&apos;s

Tucano, and it would not be possibl^^ro^tet aside the results of that competition without severe damage to tdJ^Government&apos; s policy of seeking through competition to achieve better&apos;^rar for money in defence Purchasing. The Cabinet therefore endor^^&amp;he Secretary of State for Defence&apos;s recommendation that the Short&apos; s^ffucano should be chosen as the Basic Trainer, and agreed that the decVsion to this effect should be ann  unced as soon as possible.

The Cabinet -

1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Mufisnsr&apos;s summing up of their discussion.


   2. Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to announce the decision to purchase the Short&apos;s Tucano without delay.
