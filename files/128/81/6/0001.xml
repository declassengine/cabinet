vy&gt;/THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, in recent

Is with the Indian Prime Minister, Mr Rajiv Gandhi, and with the C^^S^fficial in the Ministry of External Affairs, the British High 0m^^s^ier in New Delhi had been given renewed assurances that there WaS	on visits to India by British Ministers or on commercial

between the two countries. It was nevertheless clear that, Particul^^^^in the Ministry of External Affairs, resentment against the nited Km  dom lingered on and that Indian feelings still ran high over e activities of Sikh extremists in the United Kingdom. Mr Gandhi&apos;s invitation to the Prime Minister to visit India briefly during her ^orthcoming tour of South East Asia was, however, encouraging. The mted Kingdom MjRi&apos;tot, so far, been implicated in the spy scandal in n  W Delhi- AlttVWlVjssues affecting Anglo-Indian relations would still n^d t0 carefnT7irS^Viitored in both countries, there had been a 6st improvementsituation.

It was clear that Anglo-l^g^^van

^   UJj&amp;EIGN and COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that during his visit to &apos;w^oi^J^on 8-10 February he had been subjected to a predictably ^Cc^^iC-vexposition of President Ceaucescu&apos;s views on foreign policy sUt ^K^oneluded that, in view of Romania&apos;s catastrophic economic tuatw^^^hese were unlikely to carry weight within the Warsaw Pact, co BUlg^a&gt; which he had visited from 10-11 February, he had by b  ntrastN^ound an orthodox pro-Soviet foreign policy stance accompanied y afEiciency in economic management as well as in maintenance of the sUthoritarian regime. President Zhivkov had exhibited a relatively ophisticated a  pis&gt;  ach to Bulgaria&apos;s internal and external economic c   lcies&gt; inclG^in   recognition of the need to keep borrowing under ^ntrol and to&apos;M^ts\a rudimentary venture capital market.

Turkey

Turk   REIGN and COMMONWEALTH S^G^^RY said that during his visit to Turkey on 11-13 February he had Vfic^Atered a significant degree of Br- *sh goodwill towards the Uni t&lt;^K^gdom, partly as a result of riRh1Sh    eff  rtS to argue the Turkis^r^aSA against criticism on human *   s issues in the European Assemt^^O^id the Council of Europe. He concneVert&apos;le^ess expressed firmly and ^j^p&lt;  ?tly the British Government s undeSrn   Ver human rights problems in Turkey despite British BlScrS*&quot;?oling of the background against which they arose. In wishU  Slons on Cyprus, it had been clear that the Turkish Government Turk^ ht0 See a settlement; but that, although they would hold the alre h CyPriot leader, Mr Rauf Denktash, to tK^^oncessions he had Cypru 7 made in the recent high level talks wUh Wesident Kyprianou of prevUS 1 tAey would be unwilling to push Mr Denkt^&apos;^P&apos;Kirther or to pbac6r|f hfni from holding elections before a furts^x^^wnd of talks took had	would now be important to encourage Pre!pra4Wt Kyprianou, who

Althod^C\^n vfew of gr^t?y s economic difficulties, he had not pressed the i^e^ests of TrimeS .exP  rters, his discussion of the economic situatraj^^ith the e Minister, Mr Turgut Ozal, had produced some evident^^oF/jaositive


   achievements, including a substantial expansion of output and exports, 1gher energy prices and lower subsidies; but there were also grounds /&apos;c  ncern that Turkey might be over-trading and doing too little to uce its balance of payments deficit.

(*. THE ^MCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Council of Ministers lnanceA^on 11 February had discussed the financing of the proposed ^gricultural structure measures but had not reached agreement on a financial ceiling or on the amount. This matter was important because ls was the fipCCXtime that the Finance Ministers had addressed a ^aestion of agHcimural expenditure since the agreement on budget ThSClPline. Tnte^LtpnSLan Presidency had not facilitated an agreement, a h ^nance Minisc^r^Hiad agreed, however, that they would try to reach theecision at the	of the Council on 11 March. This implied that

In discussion it was pointed out that would might be difficulti^^K the Council on 25-26 February. This be clearer, however/   f&apos;oUlowing a meeting arranged between the Cha^Ster   f Agriculture, Fi^feMlHs and Food and Signor Pandolfi, the airman of the Council of M^&apos;p^rers (Agriculture).

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the return to work in the current week was||ess than the previous week&apos;s high levels, largely as a result of the^kj^d^ weather. It was nevertheless expected that by the end of the week^l^^vumber of miners at work would be at least 85,000,   0re than 45 percent m   the total. The number of pits working normally had increased by four, fca 54. Coal movements in the previous week had amounted to 930,000%onnes but would probably be only about 800,000 tonnes in the current^ffeT owing to the weather. Power station coal stocks, which had fallen by only 230,000 tonnes in the previous week, amounted to some 12i million tonnes. It was a welcome development that   th the South Wales and Yorkshire areas of the National Union of tneworkers (NUM) had ordered th^r members to comply with the court    t&quot;junctions limiting the numberl|fj| pickets at certain specified pits to o more than six. His discuss ionlWhe previous evening with leaders of e National Association of Collier^ Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers ad gone well. They were unlikely to^nitiate any industrial action in   uPport of the NUM; their main condePnjwas to press for a negotiated sttlement. The General Secretary ^kUiewTrades Union Congress, illis, had been having private tal^^J^-th the Chairman of the ationai Coal Board (NCB), Mr MacGregor^! jd^would be meeting the   i  nal Executive of the NUM the following %ay. At present it seemed niikely that a basis would be found for%suJ|^ssful resumption of

egotist ions. The NCB was mindful of the d$f  s of conceding an nesty for NUM members found guilty of disciplinary or criminal t, ences. The figures recently leaked to the press about the costs of e coal strike for the Central Electricity Generating Board were accurate. The line should be that the estimates already published by 6 Goverhment still stood and that accurate figures	the overall

st   f the strike could not be available until the^^w^ ended.
