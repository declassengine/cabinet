Wk SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that, following tlW^ciAklusion on the previous day of the debates on the Anglo-Irish Agr&lt;efnejyp in the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the Members of Parli^H^j-^vfor the Unionist Parties apparently intended to resign from the HotfaJ^oy^l January 1986 in the hope of having 15 by-elections on a single d&amp;y^in February 1986, as a substitute for a referendum on the Agreement^. There would be unionist pressure on the Government to take &apos; no action to implement the Anglo-Irish Agreement until the by-elections had taken place. It would be argued that this would be a suitable response by the Gp^ernment to the choice by Unionist politicians of constitutional and democratic methods of opposing the Agreement. The situation in pulxOp^SShier in Northern Ireland was for the time being quiet.	(CxV/s

In discussion it was^gjr^A that the Government could not accept that by-elect ions would be t^^SS^punt to referendum. The Agreement had been decisively approved in botvftmses of Parliament, and any apparent delay in implementation would b&lt;  ^p  gTh as weakness in the face of Unionist intransigence. ArrangemenlsA^hg^been made for the United Kingdom and Irish notifications of accept^ro&lt;  e\pf the Agreement, which would bring the Agreement into force, to eaxi^ace on 29 November. The way would then be clear for the first meew^V^f the Intergovernmental Conference, which might take place around mid^0ec)KAber. That might mean that the second and perhaps the third meet itufjaropy the Conference would take place before the by-elections. The Governme^rc^hould try in these early meetings of the Conference to make a	in securing enhancement of

oross-border co-operation on security xak/y&amp;rs,, as a means of convincing unionist opinion that the Agreement coulw^bring benefits.

In the course of discussion the following points were also made -

a. Mr Ian Paisley and Mr Peter Robinson i  ttne Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had written to the Cha^e&lt;r    r of the Exchequer to apply for the Stewardships of the Chi 1tern/Vfiunareds and of the Manor of Northstead with effedt from 1 JanuaryUM&amp;(y. It was clear that Unionist Members of Parliament applying inv^WAa^terms for offices of profit under the Crown could remain iny^n^wjuse of Commons until the date on which they were appointeocV^ich offices. It was also clear that a number of Members&lt;rax  WL resign in this way on a single day. Whatever their view of ^KeVjfly Unionist Members of Parliament were acting, the Governmtrj3^&lt;S^ould allow the established procedures to take their course. NVv/s


   b. The claim of Unionist leaders that the by-elections would amount to a referendum on the Anglo-Irish Agreement might most effectively be shown to be spurious if no candidates other than Unionists were to stand. But it would be hard for the Government to seek to bring about such a situation. Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, would apparently be ^ leaving to local branches of his party the question whether to put ^Xup candidates. Mr Peter Robinson of the DUP had said that, if ^cVindidates of other parties did not stand, the Unionist Parties ^&apos;mckht put up dummy opponents. The best approach for the Government &gt;^  fened to be to allow events to take their course.

was desirable to devise a method for consulting Unionist leVc&amp;rs about the work of the Intergovernmental Conference. The chosen method should take account of the fact that some of the matters to be discussed in the Conference would have to be kept confidential. Unionists could not be given a real or apparent right of v&gt;?p  \on decisions which the Government might wish to take followingMiscission in the Conference. It would be necessary to inform theilto^&amp;v Government before any announcement, of the method favoured by rahe^Government for consulting Unionists. Reports by Ministers toNl^&amp;Qmient about the work of the Conference might be made periodicaW^L^ather than after every meeting. Consultation with Unionist le^j^v*VVon selected matters discussed in the Conference might	place after meetings of the Conference

and before dec is iona/^^te taken by the Government. This would appropriately emphasar^fjye provision in the Agreement that decisions were the pA^tta^  ive of the United Kingdom Government.

d.	The Government shou^dLe^ltinue to make in public the case in

favour of the Anglo-Irish&lt;A^j^  &gt;nent. There should be a major effort to reassure unionist^^eS^vecially moderate unionists. Ministers concerned with NorLk^fivlreland affairs would of course continue to visit the Provincevisits by other Ministers to address public audiences there	rob ably inadvisable at

present. Other Ministers should^y^ow^yer, broadcast to Northern Ireland on radio and television, a^tfell as making speeches in Great Britain.

e.	The point made by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the debate in the House of Commons on 2^-November that the Government actively wanted Northern Irela/Gltra remain part of the United Kingdom was one that was likely toparticularly to moderate unionist opinion. It could be repe/atedjin speeches by Ministers.

f.	One of the major criticisms of the Agreemei(t%fi^the part of moderate unionists was that it had been concluded^d&gt;^M.crecy. The Government had already made clear that international/f  &amp;*otiations of this kind were bound to be confidential. The Gov^ralmeVit could add that it had been widely known in Northern Irelana^f^V^k. year before conclusion of the Agreement that one possibilitv^^^fhe establishment of machinery through which the Irish Repuh&amp;r^/^Duld


   advance views. The previous Secretary of State for Northern Ireland had on a number of occasions commented publicly on this point during that period. It was also true, although this could not be said publicly, that Mr James Molyneaux and Mr Enoch Powell v	of the Ulster Unionist Party had been offered briefing about the

\\ negotiations on Privy Counsellor terms and had declined the offer.

g.	It would be helpful if Ministers would consider whether there /O were things that their Departments could do which would be welcome L/P&amp; the community in Northern Ireland. The Secretary of State for N^r\thern Ireland could count on the co-operation of the Lord &lt;^jCnawellor in connection with any discussion in the L^rejAovernmental Conference of judicial and legal matters. It

helpful if Roman Catholic leaders in the Province could be per^^  ^ed that Roman Catholics who were offered positions as Just\  es of the Peace should at least reply to such offers rather -than nrerely ignore them, as had often happened in the past.

THE PRIME MINISTERj-vSumming up the discussion, said that the exchange of notifications, v/frlcmwould bring the Anglo-Irish Agreement into force, should proceed a^^Wmjed on 29 November. The Government should also proceed, without pr^cieltate haste, with the first meeting of the Intergovernmental Cbttre  ance. The date and location of the first meeting of the Conferefy^^hould be kept confidential as long as possible. Further cons^jK&amp;Vtion should be given to methods of consulting leading Unioinsvfe^bout aspects of the work of the Conference end the Irish Government s$  jj^C^\be informed in advance of the chosen methods. The Government slwdj^rAmdertake a major continuing effort to reassure unionist opinion abbrJJr^Vfc Agreement. A brief for this purpose should be provided to MinisteraTaV/&apos;fche Northern Ireland Office. The Government should not seek to ir^  Me in the process whereby Unionist Members of Parliament would res ig^Mi^kr seats and seek re-election.

3	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said(^a^Utiolence was continuing in South Africa at a level at least asfyfgfinas in recent months. The establishment of the Eminent Persons G^e^p^bf the Commonwealth had passed off better than might have b^f^4xjpected. The members in addition to Mr Malcolm Fraser of Australia,^G^fakal Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria and Lord Barber of the United Kingd^m^wpuld be Dame Ni-ta Barrow of Barbados, Mr John Malecela of Tanzania, Mr	Singh

  f India and Archbishop Edward W Scott, the Primate of the&lt;^gj)^can Church of Canada. Fol lowing representations by the Governmen^-^^ Commonwealth Secretariats announcement of the membership of tf^&quot;\^rpup had been cast in uncontentious terms. The fact that the reactM^i.the South Af rican Government had not been entirely dismissive of the


   Persons Group was to be attributed to the Prime Minister&apos;s stand against mandatory sanctions at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in October. The work of the Eminent Persons Group would be very difficult, and the Government would keep in close touch with Lord \Barber. The Commonwealth Accord gave the Group six months from its factual establishment to do its work. Pressure for sanctions should be JXWVtainable during that period.

the TORMjSn AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that no Britons had been on board &lt;6j!e^ffbyptair aircraft which had been hijacked to Malta on 23 NoveinlrtVV/&apos;\Egypt had blamed dissident Palestinians backed by Libya. There va&amp;C^ime evidence of Libyan complicity but it was not conclusive. The Government had commended the decision of the Maltese and Egyptian Governments to stand firm against terrorism. Hostages held on the aircraft had said since the event that the situation had been deteriorating rapd2H\! just before the assault on the aircraft, which resulted in 60 deathv, had been made. As always in such cases, the choice of the timW/^faY the assault must have been very difficult. It could not be as sume^LtKaX the weapons used by the hijackers had been loaded on to the airc^W at Athens airport, where security had improved recently. Weapons couLorw&apos;\i.ntroduced at airports where aircraft were serviced but pass eng ers&apos;^^Crbot board the flight. This aircraft had started at Cairo. The Gove^ment had, however, kept in close touch with the Maltese Government durcrisis.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECR^^RV^aid that the protracted talks involving the Government of Uganda	y? National Resistance Army

appeared to be close to a conelusion.^?^a had played an effective leading role in the negotiations. The^G^ernment had made clear that the United Kingdom would not become invo^^Jr in monitoring the implementation of an agreement. But a sroaor army officer had been sent to the area to advise on further steps which the United Kingdom could take, for instance in the field of aid.

extend the definition of persons beyond what was already in the X^W^SM&apos;opean Community Treaty and did not adversely affect the United \ii*27gdom s own position on third country nationals. These points had

/^jOclearly registered in the discussions so far. It was also pointed it was essential that the United Kingdom should maintain

^  r *ts re8imes on human, animal and plant health. It would isl4r  aZ^^nt not to forfeit the advantage that accrued from being an   n^ in maintaining a high standard of health within the nited\Wng^otn but also in making possible animal and plant exports nfPendafop*on health status. The need to protect these measures was part    v}date for the Intergovernmental Conference.

Dedsions.	  

SECRETARY OF^^pjfcj^FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that the Green Paper mo^e  rm   E Social Security&quot; (Cmnd 9517) published in June had elicited Qree tban 7,000 resl^^. He had devised certain modifications to the been0 ^&gt;aE&gt;er ProP  sals j  ^e light of this consultation, and these had seek&apos;3^66^ ^ E*16 Ministerial Group on Social Security. He was now Ehe agreement of Cabinet to these changes, and to the puj,Ration of the revised proposals in a White Paper, which should be circul^eC* be^ore Christmas. The draft of the White Paper had been puk^? at  d to Cabinet members tl^iMarevious day: in order to meet the c lcation timetable it wouldAbm^cessary for him to receive any be t!*ents on it no later than 3*December. The Social Security Bill would impontrOC*UCeC* ^ tbe ^ouse Commons yearly in the New Year, and it was &apos;lanuatant t&apos;lat    &apos;t sh  uld receive r  s Second Reading by the end of

Tils

Panemain cban  e Eo the earlier proposaTsmJk on pensions. The Green gc^r ProPosal for the aboli tion of thei^ijjSkEarnings Related Pension the p6 ^EIRPS) had run into considerable \&gt;ppo&amp;tion from quarters that opposTrnment wou^ prefer to have on its^^Jk Among those who NatiSS aE,  lition were the Confederation of ^^n^ish Industry, the ma  n  na^ Association of Pension Funds, major insurance companies and the that   nsumer bodies. There was, however, a large measure of agreement this v,6 emer  :*&apos;nS cost of SERPS had to be reduced. He now proposed that SERPS   U . *3e d  ne by modifications that would, in particular, put (rath P&lt;2nsions on a basis of 20 per cent of average ^Atime earnings 6arn.er than the present provision of 25 per cent of^^^^Mist 20 years&apos; C0U1^S)| would limit to 50 per cent the amount of asERPS pension that Cont e lnberited by a surviving spouse; and would tra^^e^y:o contraCteC*~OUt: sc^emes the responsibility for inflation-prcfflPirtg pro acted-out pensions up to 3 per cent a year. As previ^gSlk year Sa &gt; nobody retiring this century would be affected: af^l^^mie about f ^ there would be a transitional phase. The savings wqmlty^ asPect f b^llion :      n 2033 (at November 1985 prices). The complementary 0 his proposals would be to encourage contracted-out an&lt; V&gt;


   Personal pensions by enabling &quot;money purchase&quot; schemes to contract out; y providing a new right for all employees to opt for a contracted-out .personal pension; by providing a special 2 per cent bonus to the ^^ontracted-out rebate for new occupational schemes and personal pension jWj  lders during a five-year period; and by requiring occupational schemes employees to make additional voluntary contributions.

* ov&apos;d not propose any significant changes to the structure of the Proposed reforms of income-related benefits. The main elements set out t&apos;le Green Paper were the replacement of supplementary benefit by a simpier scheme of income support with special payments dealt with rough a discretionary social fund; the replacement of family income j^Pplemem^^a scheme of family credit paid through the wage packet;

e simpJJ f&amp;t%  ion of housing benefit; and the recognition that eVerybodj^%hould make a c ontribution to their rates. Whilst the 0 ordinatl^^^||l presentation of the last of these points with the Proposals fon local government finance reform would still need careful a tention, he ^^lL&amp;oposing only minor changes to the Green Paper Proposals, and nothing that touched any points of principle. The tables nt he had circdlate^should that assistance would be focused as intended on the di^bjlsfe and on poor families with children, and the

illustrating^** ^ash position at the point of change showed that 1 impact on indivicmals, measured in that way, would be sustainable.

^ changes to housing benefit, pensions and family credit would put a avY a&lt;^ministrative burden on local authorities and employers, and it now clear that the main reforms could not be implemented by Pril 1987 as the Green Paper hadjsMuggested. The implementation date earl-^6 ^  W ProPosec^ for the m^^ffiroposals was April 1988, subject to ier implementation of some measures as agreed in the Ministerial ExpU^d  n	Security and the^Mini^terial Group on Public

n discussion the following main poi^^rfJk^e made -

a   	The main implementation date	beyond the likely life of

the present Parliament. Public percw^J^taof the measures by the and of the Parliament would not thereBWr&lt;y|t|e conditioned by actual experience of the measures in operation^^mrl it was essential that the White Paper, and especially the promised figures contained in lt:&gt; were presented in a way that favourably conditioned the debate.

h- The pensioners who stood to lose most under the proposals were piobably those who were affected by the propose^^n^jroduction of a   6,000 capital test for housing benefit.

d* The requirement that every ratepayer should pay at least V V Per cent of his rates raised some difficult problems of

^tiCQ-ordinatign and presentation with the proposed reform of local government finance. The social security reforms, including the minimum 20 per cent payment of rates and the simplification of housing benefit, would be implemented in April 1988, whilst, under the proposals currently under consideration in the Ministerial Group^M Local Authority Finance, a new domestic local charge    *-evjfem]Pn individuals would probably not begin to be phased in to replace r^es, at any rate in England and Wales, before 1990. A power	ate the new charge (which would apply to many more

There were clearly manVJIjrflnsitional issues to be resolved, and these might present themselves in a different way as between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom if Scottish legislation on local government firlapfce^feeform was implemented on a faster timetable.
