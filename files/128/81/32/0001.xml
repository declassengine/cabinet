^^MJIINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE (MR RIFKIND), hat the debate on the United Nations Educational Scientific and Organisation (UNESCO) on Friday 22 November was on a motion for th^^H_j^irnment of the House. It presented an opportunity for the

to hear the views of Members of Parliament about the possible Wlthcfe^^lr of the United Kingdom from UNESCO. The Foreign and Commom^/]^   Secretary had not yet taken a decision on the recommertaation he would wish to make in this respect.

THE Prime MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that the United ^ngdom withdrawal from UNESCO could release   5 million which could be 3 ^0cated to thi^Sbd budget, and might be more advantageously used in ^at way. Thefaeciyion on whether to withdraw would need to be c  nsidered by MrSi^e^ shortly.

20^	Privy SEAL said tha^^b^abate was to be held on Wednesday

November, on the basis of a^ayifavon in the name of Miss Janet th   es TIP and other ConservativVy^^benchers, to approve in principle e holding of an experiment in ty*e t^Revising of the proceedings of the t USe   T Commons and to recommend ^e^pjpointment of a Select Committee consider the implementation of suol^mi^exper iment. This was the (_  Ute which the House of Lords had ta^^^^i reaching their own decision be te^  V:*-se their proceedings. It was Vim^rjjteed that the motion should ecided on a free vote. He would inaj^vene early in the debate to ,.e a Tactual account of the issues and^i indication of the matters xch would need to be considered by the Select Committee. The debate . ke only the first stage, and the appointment of the Select te^ra:LTtee would not necessarily signal a final dk^Ebeion by the House to tjiee^lsa its proceedings. The House would haveuto (|)ake a final view on asis of the recommendations of the Select Oo2wd^5bee.

r ^fScussion, some members of the Cabinet made it&gt;ejp^a^ that they pr lnef opposed to the introduction of television bVcwkjSsting of the bus^66^0^8 t^e House of Commons. They thought th^fr^ljrf\conduct of br Xj6Ss To the House had gained nothing from the intr&lt;xfuw;u  p of sound 0   . Casting:	if anything it had been adversely affeeted^^/Tjfe effects

certln-r  ducin8 television was likely to be worse. The teraMatu)n to w^eain Members to take advantage of Parliamentary pr ivilegs^p^ive grp- CUrrency to wild and often scandalous allegations would

er than at present. There would be acute and constantly&apos;&apos;^e^Jw^&apos;ing


   problems of ensuring balance; the selection of speakers already tended to give disproportionate time and weight (as compared with voting ^ results) to those who spoke against the Government (including those from /its own back benches who were critical of the Government. Television   ^buld accentuate that tendency still further, if extracts from the ^feedings were selected for transmission by the broadcasting

tions. The period of the run up to a General Election was not a   ^?^&lt;ime to embark on such an experiment.

1)1 members of the Cabinet said that they favoured the introduction of broadcasting of the proceedings of the House of Commons. lvenC^^/importance of television as a mass medium, it was not logical to silo^j/^Jjthd broadcasting but deny television broadcasting. Failure 0 mtrcrnce television could bring about further decline of the standing said regard in which Parliament was held by the public at large.

e problems of securing balance would be no more difficult for televised extracts from proceedings in the House of Commons than for radio-broadcast/^x?Vacts and for current affairs programmes. Though ere was a darwer qmat some Members would abuse the presence of television camer^^osVive currency to allegations which could not be rePeated outside !MrJ&gt;&lt;zAment, it could not be taken for granted that the general effect on rh^X&amp;crnduct of Parliamentary proceedings would be

verse. Television^w^^ere to stay; it had already had a considerable impact on the conduct	tics, it could not be kept out of the House

to ^?mmons indef initel^fafcm^Jlinisters and Members would have to learn 0 live with the consequegp^&lt;^\ These would not necessarily be without e^e^lt: to the Government tnk day, which was the main source of news an announcements.

The following points were alsc^ma^v -

a* One solution to the prcNyfemXW editorial balance would be to follow the example of Canada,	dedicate a television channel

solely to the proceedings of the^lmi^e of Commons, and broadcast them in full, with the cameras r^s^rf/cted to the Member addressing the House or the House as a whole.X^h^re would, however, remain some problems in relation to the sefo&apos;ction of extracts for news and current affairs programmes.	v

h- Parliament would need to keep a firm control over the broadcasters.

c* If the House voted on 20 November for&apos;^^Swtoointment of a Select Committee, great care would need to beUtaWn in the choice   f people to serve as Chairman and Members. &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&quot;   &gt;//

hE Prime MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said	Cabinet

Qn ed that there should be a free vote upon the mot ion^tcvhe&gt; discussed Gov November, and in accordance with precedent, members^M/j&amp;e conv^nm^nt	he free to vote according to their perso

(-0 lction. If the vote went in favour of setting up a Selec^^Catamittee Wo   nsic*er how an experiment could be implemented, a final d&lt;e^\^iXn

not formally be taken until the Select Committee had repOTj^yM but


   ^ it seemed unlikely that the trend established by the vote on 20 November &gt;&gt;would be reversed. It was recognised that the problems and dangers in introduction of television into the House of Commons were different \v_Jytom those which had faced the House of Lords. If the recommendations /4\J,he Select Committee led to the setting up of an experiment, there be a need for firm control of the broadcasting media and for a    ^y/^understanding on the part of the broadcasting organisations that anY*  &gt;tp&amp;r iment, and subsequently any permanent system that might be estabJ/g^|jJ would have to be funded from within their existing

2* THE MINISTER OkQjWK, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE (MR RIFKIND) said that further appo^^/i^ots had been made to the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group to be cont/cvygd with South Africa, which was being established following a&apos;^OAsipn at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in October. In addi^&amp;a to Lord Barber for the United Kingdom and Mr Malcolm Fraser for i^rfalia, the former Indian Foreign Minister, Mr Swaran Singh, had been ap&gt;^ra  d. Contrary to earlier expectation,

Dr Julius Nyerere, the former J^svWent of Tanzania, appeared to be unwiliing to join the Group. A^fpJ^nkr Tanzanian Foreign Minister,

Mr John Malecela, who appeared tJr^p^onan of moderate views, would be a member. Dame Nita Barrow from BarSy^p^Nhad also been appointed to the Group. Two places had still to be	Mr Pierre Trudeau, the

  rmer Prime Minister of Canada, was   MjJr  vunder consideration but aPpeared to be reluctant; and the Comm^n^iedlth Secretariat wanted the former Head of State of Nigeria, GeneraKAtfpSeguv Obasanjo, to be the Second African member of the Group	&apos;X

^HE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH J^SKS^aid that the 0vernment of Israel was in crisis There was a se^ojxs^sp 1 it between Prime Minister, Mr Shimon Peres pf the Labour pVrt^y&amp;nd the inister for Trade and Industry, Mr Ariel Sharon of tf^M&amp;kd Party.

^ e reason was that Mr Sharon had been publicly critica&apos;l^S&amp;S^ Peres. Sharon had not so far been dismissed, partly because, unu&amp;&amp;the terms the coalition agreement, a Minister could be dismissed	the

aenior Government member from the same party. Mr Yitzhak Sh^ij^the 0reign Minister and leader of the Likud group on the coalition^tfrajl not een willing to dismiss Mr Sharon. The Government crisis was OAnY^miing arid it was possible that the coalition would break down in the ciSamfcx Mays. There could be no certainty about what would then happen, bfair r Peres might seek to form a coalition of a different composition.

3. /^  N4INISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE (MR RIFKIND) Sai  	there had been another meeting of the Intergovernmental

ConfeYen^^ at which the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had rePres  afc  jCYhe United Kingdom, on 11 November. All the proposals for Treaty amtfWlpjAnt should now be on the table. It was encouraging that there had^fe^n no proposal to delete or amend the national veto (&quot;the Luxembourg\pmpromise&quot;). It was also important that the Presidency had also drawn the conclusion that the member states did not wish to change the balance of power between the Council of Ministers, the Commission and the European P^r^iament. The Sub-Committee on European Questions of the Defence and OxerAea Pol icy Committee would be meeting on 20 November in orcteV/C^NWepare the United Kingdom position for the discussion at the Euba&amp;bha Council on 2-3 December.

THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOR^^TAyD COMMONWEALTH OFFICE said that the European Parliament was votn$g^J*&amp;t day on amendments to the draft Community budget for 1986. It/v^wmost certain that the European Parliament would approve amendm^jH^ylfhich would substantially increase the draft budget. There was litMV/^dfobt that there would then be a Various disagreement between the	of Ministers and the European

Parliament. It was possible that a (JwQeJ would not be agreed by the beginning of 1986. If so, there wouli^^  Strictions on expenditure under the provisional twelfths regime CWj^Kdespite the extension of Che Community to Spain and Portugal on l(Azyoaxy 1986, would relate to expenditure by the Community of ten membexxstates in 1985. The European Democratic Group in the European Parliament was opposing some of the more exaggerated claims for budget increases but did support higher expenditure than the United Kingdom Government had^greed in the Council   f Ministers (Budget).

lu discussion it was pointed out that there would tm^^/ficulties when Che Council of Ministers (Budget) discussed the Eurfrp^rfryfrarliament&apos; s amendments. It might not be possible to block some or u^/a^cxeases Proposed.
