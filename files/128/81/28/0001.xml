l&apos; THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that rumours that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office had been destroyed by fire were greatly )exaggerated. A fire had broken out early that morning in part of the which was under reconstruction. The fire had quickly been V^P\pught under control, and disruption to the work of the office was &gt;5^y-gn i f ic an t.

THE	COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there was considerable

activityC^f East-West relations. The Soviet Foreign Minister,

Mr Eduara^hevardnadze, had held meetings in the previous week with the nited States Secretary of State, Mr George Shultz, and then with resident Reagan. At his own meeting with Mr Shevardnadze on

September, the^poreign and Commonwealth Secretary, referring to the rj&quot;Cent expuls ic/ns on Soviet intelligence officers, had underlined that e United Kings^/^tHhed for good bilateral relations with the Soviet nion but not at /We ^xpense of its national security. Mr Shevardnadze a sought to justvG^^ftfe Russian response. The meeting had therefore ^?en cool at the outw^^^t he and Mr Shevardnadze had gone on to rscuss broader East-^g^fcO^esues. It was noteworthy that the Soviet ^aion was still showin^/I^Vtest in improving relations with the United *ngdom on trade and otheii^rarfNters. Mr Shevardnadze had again shown mself to be fluent, int^O&apos;igMit and charming; but there was no sign at he made a personal convfcr&gt;t&gt;dVion to Soviet foreign policy comparable 0 that of the Party leader, ^f^M^khail Gorbachev.

The arms control proposal put tfyl|^3hevardnadze to President Reagan semed from first reports to be v*d/Lpui.ly designed both to safeguard ^ lsting Soviet positions and inte^^^^and to put new pressure on estern positions on arms control and^&gt;o divide the Western alliance.

^orhachev was now visiting France/&apos;/Kn^/prench Government seemed Bu t0 w^-t-hstand Soviet attempts to &lt;  ^ide the West on arms control. pr ^ would not be easy, as time went by^ to maintain Western cohesion.

resident Reagan&apos;s invitation to a meeting on 24 October of the Heads of ^ ate or Government of the seven countries participating in the Economic mmits, as a means of consultation before PresijJShst Reagan&apos;s meeting ^1 th Mr Gorbachev on 19-20 November, seemed to H(  av^) been ill-considered: had not been well received by the French GoveSn^aK or by some of the Sntaller member states of the North Atlantic Treat yMD^umisation who were   t represented at Economic Summits.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Prime Minister&apos;s \Un^ltat^  n t0 3 j  ^nt Jordanian/Palestinian delegation to visit the /      d Kin8dom had been a necessary step in the efforts to maintain &lt;A^Ward movement on the peace initiative of King Hussein of Jordan. He had talks in the previous week with King Hussein and with the United Secretary of State, Mr George Shultz. The King had welcomed the v^yW^Minister     s invitation to the delegation. Mr Shultz had also done ^   ^V^his private meeting.

It was impos^^Uj to say did 6r tbese talks would succeed. President Moi had said vr^^Nf they f  rmiUCCeedj-he would like the United Kingdom to help in the ^rfh^e^s of said th 3 United army in Uganda. The Foreign and Commonwealthvte^j^!tary at he would be willing to look sympathetically at such a^y^dj^it,


   Provided that it was clear that the British role would involve neither the establishment of peace nor the keeping of peace. The United Kingdom had &apos;&apos;Jv lnterest in preventing the collapse of Uganda into civil war.

THE ^ SECRETARY OF ST2*^^^)R DEFENCE said that there had been a stisfactory conelusicm/&apos;^-.negotiations with Saudi Arabia on the sale of mi rtary aircraft, noMMVwie Tornado aircraft. This was the biggest Export deal ever conelutfecPJ&gt;^ the United Kingdom in the defence field. c Personal role of the g^WjeAMinis ter in the negotiations had been rucial. As a result of t^iflle, the United Kingdom would play a ---1 role in Saudi Arabia^^^fences for 20 years ahead. Saudi Un^ 13	t^lus departed in ^OMjWrtant way from its reliance on the

nited States for the supply ov^wms. The revenue to the United Kingdom m the sale of spares for theva^p^aft and for support services would 8reatly increase the value of the^de^LNabove the   3-4 billion which had appeared in the media.

^HE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY s^d that the recent minor

anges in the policies of the South African Government, regarding such m311 p r g	* &apos;	   	.

        as citizenship, had come too late and we^e having only a very

&apos;-muted effect in opening the way to a dialoguayfrvyDlving the black

Cq^ ation. The decline in the international fi^naij&amp;ial community&apos;s

se	in South Africa had forced the Governm  Yl^jtiere to think more

    ^  usiy about peaceful reform, and discussion was-a^jef/fioubt continuing

ln the Government

Q0^s^ent Reagan had moved to pre-empt pressures in th &lt;/N^i&gt;ed States gtaEress by taking limited steps concerning South Africa.	United

Co SS Secretary of State, Mr George Shultz, had assured ^K^Wsreign and ^&quot;wealth Secretary that the United States would mainta^^^a&apos;.

Wo 1Sltlon to mandatory economic sanctions against South Afrj-^K&apos;s^d qQu veto any resolution to this effect in the United NatioiVk^pd^rity m jC1^*	   *-*- was important to the United Kingdom that the case&lt;a  arprpst

atory economic sanctions should be as widely understood as p^iSle.


   It had been interesting that, when he had visited Canada on 27 and

September, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had found greater understanding than before of the case for stopping short of mandatory (Sanctions against South Africa.

\$jjiackage of measures concerning South Africa had been drawn up by the states of the European Community, and the United Kingdom after ^^consideration had gone along with them. Half the measures on the positive ones, such as support for black trades unions or eX?^  EW^nt of the Code of Conduct for firms from the European Community ^ic^^kated in South Africa. Some of the other measures, such as a an	sales and on new collaboration in the civil nuclear field,

Were	part of British policy. One of the additional measures -

the cess^ion of oil exports to South Africa - would not in practice a tect th&amp;&gt;United Kingdom, since the Government&apos;s guidelines for companies operating in the North Sea already precluded the export of Crude oil to South Africa. Another measure - the termination of the exchange of mili^r^y attaches with South Africa - was one which the lted Kingdom (wouBa not of its own accord have taken at the present ime. it might Ti^  ~^teen taken later as a mark of disapproval, for lr&gt;stance of anothen^JJoAih African military raid into a neighbouring   ^ate. But Min is teT^Woid decided that this was a step which the United ingdom could take toa^K^c with other members of the European ommunity, since the m^jK^v^nce of solidarity with the Community was 1mportant to our internat^ron^L position regarding South Africa, and in Particular to our res is	mandatory economic sanctions. Pressure

r fflandatory economic sarMQ^WsLwould persist but it should be possible resist it at the Commonw&amp;&apos;rf&apos;tfcweads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) on Go ^ October on the basis o&amp;Xo   w^ent British policies and the ThVernment&apos;S rePeatedly state^fiUM to see the early end of apartheid.    ere might also be discussion ajrA2k*X^M of some positive initiative by ommonwealth countries, perhaps cone^vving a contact role in relation to S  uth Africa.



^ CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that there had been a meeting in p6W ^  rk on 22 September of the &quot;Group of Five&quot;, consisting of the p^ance Ministers of the United States, United Kingdom, France, the

Republic of Germany and Japan. This hj^T^Sayn presented in the it h3 3S 3T1 eraergency meeting called at very sfv^tjWtice, but in fact had 33 ^een in preparation for six weeks, and for/onc^ no information ove ^ea^e&lt;^ beforehand. The Group had agreed that	1 lar was

   valued and that they would, if necessary take amovin the foreign mee	markets to bring down its value. In the ten^M^s\since the

Ce^lnS. the dollar had fallen by 3 per cent against t&lt;  ^^o  nd, 7 per Wag against the Deutschmark and over 10 per cent against/^e\yen. This CQn a satisfactory outcome. The United States Administr^i^nVyad been co ,erned that some of the many protectionist Bills before\g&lt;wg&apos;f&apos;ess to secure a two-thirds majority in Congress and thus not	ject

. a . Pras ident ial veto. The Administration had wanted to rative to show that it was seriously trying to tackle the


   problems of the United States, in order to stem the tide of Protectionism. There were some signs that the action to bring down the a ue of the dollar had reduced the chances that protectionist Bills I Oulo gain a two-thirds majority.

3- THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT said that the recent isturbances in Brixton (South London) and Toxteth (Liverpool) had been   n a much smaller scale than in 1981. The lessons learnt then in terms I 0 police equipment and tactics had proved their worth. There would    ^iways be criticism of police methods, from both directions, but the new ^Pjjpcedures to investigate allegations against the police had helped.

results of the inquiries now in hand, such as that of the Assistant

Sble of West Yorkshire into the shooting of a black woman in ht, however, produce their own problems. He was keeping in thnic minority community leaders, some of whom were finding to operate in the face of hostility from Labour controlled

Y OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the position in ovided a good example of what happened when political ^xtremists secured control of a local council with inner city problems. g.e militants in Liverpool were becoming increasingly isolated (the ishops in LiveittJSbd had made forthright criticisms of them in a recent article in The/Tim^), but there could be no guarantee that they would   ?Se Power at tnSVrfjG&amp;v Election.

The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chief Secretary,

Treasury (C(85) 23) reporting progress in the Public Expenditure ^ Survey 1985 (PES).

PIPE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that in accordance with the Cabinet&apos;s ^^j?clusions at their meeting on 11 July he had engaged in bilateral

i  ns expenditure programmes with the Ministers responsible.

23 reported the position that he had reached. Although progress ad been made, and settlements reached on a number of programmes, the overall picture was still one of very substantial overshoots of the Planning totals previously agreed by the Cabinet. Moreover the picture shown in Annex A to his paper understated the difficulty of the Position^ in that he was still some way from achievement of the objectiv(|  f_.the totality of nationalised industries&apos; External Einaneing^flSgji^s agreed in July by the Ministerial Sub-Committee on Economic Alwg&apos;||fV whereas success in this objective had been assumed in the presentation of the figures to Cabinet. It had been clear from the outset that ejKesisLs over baseline would have to be accommodated on some Programmes, in &apos;TJePjLght of developments on inflation, interest rates and agricultura 1	; the inevitable consequence of this was that

reductions below baseline would be needed on other major programmes. It might be helpful to ,set to a small group of Ministers to consider the   utstanding issues	to the Cabinet.

uere were also difficulties in the establishment of running cost limits 0r the Civil Service in 1986-87. Cabinet had previously agreed that e objective should be to keep the aggregate overall increase i per Cent below the projected rate ojpfcof lation, which would imply an increase of 4 per cent betweenSt*^current financial year and the next.

e sum of Departments&apos; bids stnl^pbi overall increase of 7 per cent, and although part of this could be attributed to special factors it was essential that every effort be mac^ Jjjpj^duce it. He looked to those of ls colleagues with whom he had not ^et#gached agreement on running Cost limits to do all they could to	in this. Although there

  uld be some awkwardness in departmen^^fcjhnisters resisting demands r information about assumptions, partl^jBIMy about pay, made in ^etermining the running cost limits, the\ll:erj|ative would be to revert a 3 per cent pay assumption and give up^th^pyvantages of the more exible control of Departments&apos; housekeepin^j^xpenditures which the new arrangements would provide.

^bE Prime MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that it was s  lutely essential for the Government to live within the public expenditure totals the Cabinet had already agreed.	expenditure

   9 Per cent higher in real terms now than when th^p^^nment entered ice in 1979} and 3 per cent Higher as a percentage	Gross

mestic Product (GDP). Tax revenue was over 5 per cenl^^^r as a Percentage of GDP. Provided the Government could stick to ^p^Jjflanning   tals already agreed, there was now a prospect that these^|j^ik6e ends could be reversed. Hard decisions would need to be t^^ykn the , . ext   f the current PES in order to avoid excesses over thq^^pJine Ch&apos;Ch WOu*&lt;* otherwise increase year by year. On running costs^pfl^e ief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s proposals for the establishment of


   limits covering both pay and non-pay elements in Departments&apos; domestic expenditures were on balance endorsed. So far as the departmental k programmes were concerned, she would invite the Lord President of the | Council to be the Chairman of a small Group of Ministers to consider and dteake recommendations to the Cabinet on outstanding issues arising from Vp3 1985 PES. The Group would need to take a very firm line in pressing restraint on expenditure, and Ministers should be ready to take hard taj^^pions on their future programmes in order to avoid continuing disagreements having to be brought before Cabinet. The greatest care should be taken to avoid stimulating discussion in the press of the rssues to be considered by the Group; attempts by Departments (including the Treasury) to pursue these issues in the columns of the press could only damaj^yihe public reputation of the Government. It could, however, he made known, in response to inquiries from the media, that the Cabinet had considered a report from the Chief Secretary, Treasury about Pr  gress witfftfte 1985 PES, and that a small Group of Ministers had been established^^qg;-iifc previous years, to make recommendations to the Cabinet aboutfj^t  anding issues.

The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord President of the   uncil (C(85) 22) to which were attached drafts of The Queen&apos;s Speeches on the Prorogation and Opening of Parliament.

LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the draft Speeches attached &lt;w&apos;(^C(85) 22 had been prepared by The Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future ^v^^-slation Committee (QL) on the basis of suggestions put forward by &apos;&apos;7W&gt;^&gt;agues.
