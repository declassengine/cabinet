2- THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE (BARONESS YOUNG) said that, in the Greek general election on 2 June, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) had been returned with a reduced majority of 22 in the Greek Parliament. The New Democracy party had ^increased its vote a little. The Communist vote had swung slightly to &quot;WsOK. A further four years of government led by Mr Andreas Papandreou    ^  6 therefore to be expected, unless deterioration of the already weak should cause earlier change.

^tj/^^Aief discussion, it was noted that the switch of some Communist VO,^WAS0K might have been tactical. The Soviet Union would, in any case &gt;^^^*wleased with the result of this election. In a campaign speech 0ri 31	Mr Papandreou had said that the United Kingdom was autocratic

anc*	and a police state, with fake trades union leadership

under theSim^^uence of the Government. The Minister of State, Foreign and Commofto^alth Office would shortly be speaking firmly to the Greek Ambassador N^bout this. Greece would no doubt continue to create difficulties in the European Community; there had been a tendency for France and the Commission to be too indulgent towards Greek demands. There was also liK^-i^Kto be a row between the United Kingdom and Greece ai&gt;out a problem tmatvAad arisen in the context of the North Atlantic Treaty Organ is tion^^^^k). Greece was denying the United Kingdom access to British stocks	fuel stored at a NATO facility in Greece.

The United Kingdom h^c^^mZ^/ished to play up this matter publicly before the Greek elections, siWt^^r Papandreou might have exploited it in the campaign. it was now tiijls^Co^redouble our insistence on access to the

in a brief discussion, it was noted that a small demonstration was faking place outside the Indian High Commission in London. The police Y\ad the situation in hand. The demonstrators were being kept behind x^triers on the far side of the street from the High Commission. Two &lt;*|w^bs had been arrested on 5 June for burning the Indian flag.

,  ^ained within the Public Expenditure White Paper provision for &gt;1985-86, were -

   ^///\ a&quot; tBat the report of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB)

recommending increases adding 7.3 per cent to the 1985-86 pay bill \\x^hould be implemented in full from 1 April 1985;

that the report of the Doctors and Dentists Review Body (DDRB) ^^%imending increases adding 6.3 per cent to the 1985-86 pay bill &apos;hw^a be implemented in full from 1 June 1985;

C*	the rePorts of the Nurses Review Body (NRB) on the pay of

nursMVgnd midwives and the professions allied to medicine, recommending increases adding 9 per cent to the total 1985-86 pay ill for these professions, should be implemented in two stages, W1th an increase of 5 per cent (or the full amount of the increase where this wa^^bess) on 1 April 1985, and the remainder of the recommended ({ncilases in full as from 1 February 1986.

discussion the followingjtj^n points were made -

a    The increases recoH^aemted by the AFPRB were greater than the provision allowed in the $^eV^pe Budget, but it would be possible to absorb the additional	the award and implement it from

April by making offsettin^^v^gs in other areas including equipment procurement. The rfcfommbridations were structured so as 0 give higher increases to quaty&amp;ped technical staff, who were showing increasing signs of leavMj^JJae Armed Forces prematurely or jobs in the private sector. C

k* The recommendations for nurses ,^(nidwives and PAMs represented a major restructuring, and recommendations in future years might be e*pected to be lower. The largest increases were going to 9ualifiecj nurses engaged in direct patient cpjie, and less to students and higher grade administrative stjyfT&gt;\ For staff nurses a?d sisters the award would bring the total\^op-n    se in their pay since 1979 to about 25 per cent in real terms //thmigh they were   till not highly paid. There had also been anv  j&gt;$x^ase of 55,000 tn the number of nurses employed in the NationaF^ftaa-Cfeh Service (NHS) since 1979.

c* The proposals in response to the NRB and DDRB rq&lt;J#fimi^ndations ?  u d Preempt much of the 5i per cent increase in casK^ojpy 1985-86 some   800 million for the United Kingdom as a whole) wh-rfjfi/^ad een provided for the NHS, leaving few resources availab^A&apos;xttp&apos;x


   improvements to services and new equipment. But efficiency savings were expected to yield   150 million during the current year w^lch would be available to meet rising demands for services.

\The proposals to stage the awards in the NHS while that for

he Armed Forces would be implemented from 1 April could give rise crit^c^sm* But the situation had been the reverse in 1984 when the recommendations of the NRB had been exempted from staging, C&apos;&apos;   U^/^there would be considerable resentment in the Armed Forces if

were imposed again, especially as members of the Rhine Army u  KpW:ready seen significant cuts in their allowances. The pay sc^J^j/?ecommended for NHS staff would all be fully implemented by the &lt;add of that financial year, and for some staff represented an increase of more than 14 per cent, as compared with the maximum increase of 8.5 per cent for the Armed Forces.

e- It was/Jmhortant for the current dispute with teachers to stress thacfaiy the awards were being financed from within existing resources. &apos;   ^J^w^jfcild not be appropriate to offer the teachers the enefit of a Uevraw body arrangement:	the nurses and PAMs had

earned the rigtrt^vy special treatment through eschewing industrial action for many^W^#* and in any case the teachers had been offered arbitratixyf^rfl^k had refused it.

In previous yea % lad been the practice to implement staging without negot^ft^jam with the groups concerned about its Pattern. The GovernmeVt--^l  aXement should avoid any implication that the implementation	recommendations for nurses and

roidwives and for PAMs on &apos;^h/ils/yoccasion could be the subject of negotiation.	^ K?&lt;\

^^^p^binet considered a memorandum by the Lord President of the 0unciabout revised proposals for the 1985-86 legislative P r 0 g r am  J//A

LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that when Cabinet had discussed e 1985-86 legislative programme on 28 February they had not reached lr&gt;al conclusions on the inclusion of Bills on Housing, Royal Dockyards   r deregulation of&lt;2Ihsiness. The Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future   8islation Comm^te^) (QL) had subsequently discussed these potential !* ditions. They we^^^ary concerned about the likely weight of the egislative programM^rt^,. the 1985-86 Session. It would be the third ession of the Paril^w^^Vand Members of Parliament would not welcome too heavy a load of leg^M^Won. Moreover, overloading the legislative Programme resulted in dM  c  \^e legislation which required extensive amendment as it passed tnroogJ^Par1iament: this was an inefficient use resources and produced ^^^^tystresses in Parliament towards the end the Session. There was	need to take account of the

nexpected but necessary Bills^^tfe^jeed for which was bound to arise or mg the course of the SessidA^V^aring all these factors in mind,

- had concluded that it wouldXw^Ctoe possible to find a place in the 86 Session&apos;s programme either^f^yr^t^he Bill to introduce commercial management into the Royal Dockyards	to reduce the amount of

regulation applicable to businesses.	, however, recognise that

   claims for a Bill to deregulate pr&lt;   w rented housing were strong Bi ha&lt;1 accordingly recommended the addi^pj  &gt;to the programme of a Rents *:o provide for these measures alone.^^They did not consider that ch re	De any further housing legislation, for example to implement

anges in Home Improvement Grants. They accepted that there should be de t*^3^ Government and Planning Bill which would be restricted to

a ing with expenditure on political advert is in^^yS local authorities,

^ ll:fcal discrimination in the letting of local\v^tjuarity contracts, ^nt_erim maasures on control of local authority capftciTnsxpendi ture, the pro^?c*lJct:*&apos;on   i simplified planning zones and certa^g^rher planning ke lsi  ns. xf these recommendations were accepted, ^hjar^would need to had	deletions from the programme to match the i^^e^kes. They

of s 1Scussed these with the Ministers concerned (excepi/t^e^ecretary case*&quot;?*&quot;6 ^  r EmPloyment) and had concluded that, while thar^^Xs a good Bill   r reta^nin8 all the remaining Bills, the Education ^dji^ges s were the most suitable candidates to be deferred. Thes^wjrfnkr


   would be a good pre-Election measure for 1986-87; the latter would be controversial within the Party and policy had not yet been finally agreed.

discussion the following points were made -

a. On the Dockyards Bill, the policy had been agreed and a consultation document had been issued. The introduction of private NX^^nanagement into the Dockyards was seen as the only way of removing inefficiencies which currently existed. An announcement of the policy choice had been promised before the Summer Adjournment ^^N^reliminary discussions were taking place with companies who mi^Kt be interested in bidding for management contracts. It would to involve such companies in the work of preparing bids if therV^^id be no chance of legislation the following Session. The Bill ^mild be relatively small (13 clauses) and had the full supporo of the Royal Navy. It would not be possible to legislate in 1986-87 and the opportunity would have been lost not only to introduce more efficiency into the Dockyards, but also to experiment y  tft\&apos;an important development in competition policy which could (loriVlaTi alternative to full privatisation for other public service^^^^

B. On educatiog^$l!m^provisions in the proposed Bill which related to changes in schopj^s^rernment could possibly be deferred until 1986-87, but those ^^Mrig to in-service training grants for teachers and teachers VJmptraisal should be enacted as soon as possible if the Goverrrare-tftpolicies for the development of education were to be cai^j^a^forward.

o* On deregulation of pry^ajyy rented housing it was essential to legislate in 1985-86 if any^AH^H was to be taken before the next General Election. The GovertrorenJ^had been under pressure to make changes in this area since it tCaa\j^rst been elected, and failure to do so in its second term of o^^p^\would be difficult to justify to its supporters. On the other	was clear that the major

beneficial effects of deregulation	not begin to show

themselves before a General ElectioirXwhereas the Government&apos;s opponents would be able to use some of the immediate consequences to put about scare stories about the final results. It might be better to legislate in the next Parliament cwnr^khe basis of a manifesto commitment.

^   	On abolition or reform of the wages coun ((S). the Government

bad committed itself to urgent action. ThTs   hbKp#aeen made a central feature of employment: policy and had fi^fy^^  n the Budget speech. Although the policy choice had not yet bA^^X^e between abolition and reform, it was now clear that primary lVg^lation would be required in either case. The change was tooc^^rvroversial f  r a Bill in 1986-87.

e* On scientific procedures on living animals, it was pAidrp^l out that a coalition of moderate animal rights campaigners had


   established which generally supported the Government&apos;s proposals.

A commitment to amend the existing legislation had been contained in two successive manifestos and two White Papers had now been issued setting out the proposals in some detail. The moderate coalition would not understand further delay and there was a ,/yi real danger that the coalition would break up or the measure of^ general support which they were prepared to give would be lost in these circumstances. There was, in addition, some evidence that xO^/&apos;Vhenever the Bill was put before Parliament, political extremists &lt;!^/Juld seize the opportunity to use it to embarrass the Government.

would be much more dangerous in 1986-87 than 1985-86. On the j&amp;yMbc hand, it was pointed out that when difficult choices had to Degrade, there were more important aspects of Government policy tn^ttt^Sanges in animal legislation, which had been in place since be worth risking the problems which would arise in 1986-^^in order to press forward with some of the more important of theOGovernment1s policies now.

f* On consumer protection, it was pointed out that this Bill too was the refl^e-tshpn of a commitment to a reform of existing legis lation U^i ST was thought to be long overdue. It would replace local enforceri^prr^by national controls over imports of unsafe goods and would clar\W^lre law in such a way that retailers and manufacturers wouw/uve a much clearer idea of their responsibilities. /jfe^Kon its drafting was already advanced and it would be dif f icult^e^exfclain why further delay had occurred. On the other hand, this	be a suitable Bill for inclusion in the

1986-87 programme.

IHE PRIME MINISTER, summing uR^ttt^discussion, said that Cabinet agreed with the general proposal put f^i&gt;wd by QL that the legislative Programme for 1985-86 should notM}M^J.owed to become too heavy. They also agreed that no room was avai!Mr6w\n the programme for a Bill to remove the regulation from business^K^?  hey considered on balance that the Bill to introduce private manageiqg^^lwato the Royal Dockyards should e included in the programme. The	agreed that legislation for

eregulation in private sector rents sh&lt;^|^^/not be included in the programme, but that it would be importanl^Lo to give a further impetus t   the right to buy and to measures to enaule local councils to dispose of estates and blocks of flats. Limited housing legislation on these patters should be included, limited to fewer tharp-LD clauses. It might Possible to combine this in a single Bill wi^p&quot;?)ju2 provisions on Planning which QL had recommended and which theagreed. Cabinet also agreed that the proposals made by QL for legiwlayyon on local authority political advertising, discrimination on&apos;^lS&amp;O^tting of local authority contracts and interim controls on local auwiyw^capital expenditure should be included. The additions to the te^S  ^nme required ur ther reductions. The Cabinet agreed that the AnimalsC^C^entific rocedures) Bill and the Consumer Goods and Services Bill^&amp;wjw^l be withdrawn from the 1985-86 programme; but they should have\tfr^t^ential treatment when consideration of the 1986   87 programme took pdr^  ^^ No   ther changes to the agreed programme should be made.


   The Cabinet -

1* Agreed that the Royal Dockyards Bill should he added to the 1985-86 legislative programme.

2. Agreed that the 1985-86 programme should v contain measures to promote the right to buy, x^help privatisation of local authority housing and /^improve local authority housing management; and &apos;^O&apos;JVyited the Lord President of the Council to (/^^niss with the Secretary of State for the

(^^vt^cmment the minimum scope of such measures in t&lt;  &apos;*kht of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.

           

J    &gt;Xgj^ed that there should be legislation in the I&lt;fif#5-86 Session to deal with local government political advertising, discrimination on the letting   f contracts by local authorities, interim controls on local government capital expenditure, introduction of simplifie^^Nonning zones, planning controls on hazardous silastyirps and miscellaneous planning changes to impVa^^&apos;jefficiency; and invited the Lord President of th  -^  rl)cil to discuss with the Secretary of State for the ^  *maronment whether and if so how best such measures/m^^t be combined with those relating to housing^^^V.

Agreed that the Mma\\ (Scientific Procedures) bill and the Consumer G^SMX^od Services Bill should be withdrawn from the agr^h^F^ogramme f  r 1985-86, and should have preferentl^L^iyreatment when consideration of the 1986-8rApd^amme took place.
