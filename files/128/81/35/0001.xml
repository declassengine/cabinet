the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that during the debate on the Channel Fixed Link^5  \9 December he expected that some members representing const^tu^hcies in Kent would indicate their dissatisfaction with the proposals^e^TL\Channe 1 Fixed Link. Interests in the county opposed to any of thlQ^p^pppsals were being mobilised and it was now necessary for the Gov^tSjpMOTt to present the case for the Link more positively. The FrencrPfiej^sjiment were allocating much money to the Pas Calais area, includin^^^n)^ for compensation, and the question of compensation needed to becoua  &amp;ered in respect of certain parts of Kent. Those.in the eastern&lt;^pSk of Kent likely to be most affected by ^ decline in the ferry servf&amp;^s1d draw a contrast between the prospects for their area and tK^^o^thcoming establishment of an Enterprise Zone at Chatham.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a b^rt^Kis cuss ion, said that the Channel Eixed Link would bring great economi^^^^ntages to Kent, and the rest the country would certainly not unda^^tand rurther economic assistance being given to that area. ^W^^se for the Enterprise Zone in Chatham (a declining area) was of a	nature, but the timing

  f an announcement should be considered lV^elation to the position of the Channel Fixed Link.	V

The Cabinet -	__

1     Invited the Secretary of State for TrajjfepoK^^to discuss with the Secretaries of State for TraTravStrcV Industry, Employment and the Environment what he able to say about the prospects for those are^mA Kent likely to suffer adverse economic efiects from^w\ operation of a Channel Fixed Link, and in that cont^jrt^V^ the timing of an announcement of the establishment of an Enterprise Zone in the Chatham area.	&lt;\xj)

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the Opposition Day debate on a motion on inner cities and housing on Wednesday 11 December ^would give him the opportunity to respond in Parliament to the report of y\*e Archbishop of Canterbury&apos;s Commission on Urban Priority Areas. He /Wuld in particular stress the fact that the report gave a collectivist ^7Aer to the problems faced in the inner cities and did not emphasise ^Jjvv^ole of the individual or the family. Its recommendations were exclusively addressed to the Church of England and to the

. it also contained important factual inaccuracies which wou     ^d^\worth bringing out.

THE PRI^g/MiNISTER said that it would be appropriate to emphasise those Parts ^^E^report which were critical of local government as well as the pointAy^J^h the Secretary of State for the Environment had already mentioned.economic analysis in the report could be answered in economic teS^jis. While the Government should make the report&apos;s defects Plain, this should be done without exciting unnecessary controversy, and there was no need to be critical about every minor fault in it.

2    the FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECfO^Sg^said that both the peace talks in Nairobi and the fighting in Ugaaoa/pfcself were continuing. The outcome remained uncertain. Major GeneraiV^ollard of the British Army Was in Nairobi, and had informed those concerned that the United Kingdom would be willing to give technical help to a united Ugandan Army, if ere was a peace settlement. Contingency plans for a full-scale eyacuation of the British community from Uganda, /^f&quot;yhe security ltuation there deteriorated further, had been r^vjewEtU


   

the FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there were signs that President Babangida of Nigeria was thinking of trying to improve &gt; relations with the United Kingdom. He might be willing to consider the ^repatriation to the United Kingdom in due course of the two engineers /vfom Bristow Helicopters Limited who had been sentenced by the High JTfrt in Nigeria on 7 October. The rejection in the British courts of       /fj^Xappeal against the sentence of Major Mohammed Yusufu for the kidnap WvW Nigerian former Minister for Transport had not so far attracted ion in Nigeria. On the economic front, it appeared that the Government, in the face of domestic opposition to economic m  a77^5^vmposec^ By the International Monetary Fund, might be thinking 0 1IftTojJ&lt;  ing similar measures on their own initiative, with a view to 0 tain&lt;&amp;  pfrfN;erwards a loan from the Fund.

It would be important for Lord Barei^Xihe British member of the Group, to be in t0uch with General Obasaa^o^\.&apos;The South African reaction to the establishment of the Groi^pNWjso far been not unhelpful. Lord Barber ad met President Botha pri^xro^y on 2 December. The South African overnment were concerned tKa(j yne Group&apos;s terms of reference should not e seen to allow it to in ter	South Africa&apos;s internal affairs. In

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY swf&gt;jiat the meeting of the ^no-British Joint Liaison Group from 25^*^&apos;29 November had been J-fficult, but a reasonably satisfactory exclusion had been reached. e Chinese side had expressed anxiety about British intentions in moving towards more representative government in Hong Kong. The British s-|-de had made clear that the United Kingdom had n^^&gt;reconceived ideas a   ut the review of political developments in Hong l^ng which was to take place in 1987. It would be necessary to coo work hard to Persuade the Chinese Government of the realities iiUHcdijCong; they ^ound the political system there very difficult to uhwBsrtand and were tghly suspicious of any moves by the United Kingdom.ting of e Joint Liaison Group had resolved a number of difficrfH^^^ues concerning nationality and passports.

lo	a brief discussion, it was pointed out that China had de\\3jwj\a Policy with regard to Hong Kong of &quot;one country, two systems&quot;T^&lt;^\that atention of democratic practices in Hong Kong would be fully&gt;^onk*^tent with this.	^&lt;yJU&gt;

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he would depart later that day for Spain where he would see the Prime Minister and the King as |	as the Foreign Minister. A number of topics would be discussed.

^Pibraltar would be high on the list. The central fact was the great 0\Pprovement at the border: since its opening in February 1985 three VjJ^lion people had crossed each way between Gibraltar and Spain. The ^lytted Kingdom would have to undertake a long-term exercise to persuade T^^Kthat her expectations regarding Gibraltar were too high and that   ^jja\ted Kingdom&apos;s undertakings to the Gibraltarians meant what they Sav&lt;d^^t would also be necessary, in dealing with Gibraltar, to make ^ur^^3^Ts  r:*-tish public expenditure there did not grow unnecessarily;

THE FOREIGN AND COMMM^ALTH SECRETARY said that the report of the h^Stra^^an Royal Comfy&amp;^m on British Nuclear Tests in Australia, which _a been published trai^prewdous day, was very long and would require t 1 anH careful s tudyV\  l}  ^ Government would need to counter any public endency to jump to the e^^Ksion that the report was right in calling upon the United Kingdom t&lt;    jpr^)y ide   100 million for the cleansing of the ree former test sites. &apos;&apos;SE^relbort seemed to be greatly coloured by e benefit of hindsight enj^MT^y those who had written it. Senator e Hon Gareth Evans, the Aus^r^yyan Minister for Resources and Energy, visiting the United KmaW^on 23 January 1986 and British tcials would visit Australia	then. The Government&apos;s public

Position on the report should for ^Irejpime being be that the report was eing very carefully studied.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he had that morning circulated to colleagues a note about the position reached in negotiations with the United States Defense Secretary, Mr Casper einberger, about British participation in the United States research ^programme under the Strategic Defence Initiative (SDl). Mr Weinberger visiting London on 5 and 6 December and was anxious to sign, with 5}e Secretary Qf gt-ate for Defence, the draft Memorandum of 2g**er s tanding which had been negotiated between the two Governments. &apos;Vr^*oMemorandum would break new ground, notably in its provision for the of information between the United Kingdom and the United A	should work greatly to the benefit of the United Kingdom.

might be argued that signature of the Memorandum should not tahe ^Kc^until a team of British officials now visiting Washington had conelu^ji^jj^pir talks on detailed matters concerning subsidiary g cumenC  &gt;^fie balance of advantage was in favour of the Secretary of tate for^p^^iCe agreeing to sign the Memorandum on the following day with Mr Wel^Lerger.

In discussion, it was agreed that the Secretary of State for Defence ouid S1gn the dra     Memorandum of Understanding. But it was argued a there would fje&apos;&apos;   Mvantage in reaching agreement with the United tates AdministraX^j-on^before signature on certain important matters concerning the relatf&lt;pf&quot;&quot;&quot;2wcuments. The outstanding matters would s ignif icant ly af fee t\^4la&gt;&lt;ftegree to which the United Kingdom could make use of technology gene^fli^Kby British participation in SDI research.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summivjJg^^^the discussion, said that the Secretary    State f  r Defence had beajj^rary firm in working for the right conditions for British parti^^panion in SDI research and it would be a Plty to conclude the MemorancKlifl&gt;^Xhout fully clarifying those conditions to the satisfaction^tff^we Ministers most closely concerned.

The Cabinet -

3. Invited the Secretary of S^fte^or Defence, in consultation with the Secretary	for Trade and

Industry and the Foreign and CommcS   $&amp;lth Secretary, to consider the timing of signature of vy^&apos;Memorandum of understanding, in relation to the discussions between United Kingdom and United States officials taking place in Washington.

^ THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said	results of the

30 e,r    vernmentai Conference had been discussed by Fo^^H^inisters on November-1 December and in a very long session of th4^^^pean Un^DC1^   n	December. The conclusions were very satisTaw^ajry. The

1 Ced Kingdom had secured all its main objectives. The ag   ySgfi&amp;nt included changes which were desirable for the completion of^tfje/) ommunity&apos;s internal market. A target date, 31 December 1992&apos;j-^^s\set. ere would be amendment of the Treaty articles to provide foi^wa^OTU.ty


   voting on goods and services. Unanimity would be retained, however, for taxation, the free movement of persons and matters relating to the \ *&quot;18hts and interests of employees. In addition, if decisions were taken y majority voting, there would be a right to take national action in fields of public, animal and plant health. National competence on ^Uhontier controls against terrorism, crime, drugs and immigration from ^&apos;-Jv^iXide the Community was not affected. Furthermore, the arrangements Luxembourg compromise&quot;) by which a member state could invoke a ^sW^rimportant national interest had not been challenged or changed.

other elements in the package - for example, on technology, envvr&apos;otjjiijNit and the Regional Fund - would consolidate into the Treaty ^hat wls^&amp;jjoadly the present practice. The monetary provisions also escnt^^^p arrangements which had been under way in the Community for some tiiSe\^Z/Thpre would be changes in the procedures by which the European ^W^ament would make its views known to the Council on some ommunity legislation, but the last word on this legislation rested with the Council. There would be difficulties with the European Parliament, w !ch considered that the agreement did not go far enough. The European Council had also ae*&lt;ed on a Treaty on co-operation in foreign policy; this formalised tl  ee  isting procedures among the 10 member states for Political co-opera^ott-n&amp;n the lines proposed by the United Kingdom and ooked towards some /ympndvements. The results of the Intergovernmental Conference, now agre&amp;JE^y^he European Council, were subject to one sPecific reserve by th^imj^ed Kingdom on voting arrangements in          elation to the working ^rfS^^cnment, because of the need to avoid ordens on small and medmm\fc&gt;uplinesses. Denmark had entered a general reserve, which might be lifi^^f the Danish Government were able to    tain sufficient support fr^   Parliamentary and political opinion.

aly had also completely resteJiv^f&amp;its position, because it considered the package to be too modest, ^ff^jjejcegulation the European Council had een informed that the Commissioo^Wld now be assessing all new Proposals for their effect on bus inig  ^?^and on job creation, would be re-examining the more important exre^j^g^regulations for the same purpose and..would be ensuring that a^dent^al unit regularly monitored the progress of deregulation. The Unitf^sWtingdom&apos;s initiative had thus been accepted.

in discussion it was pointed out that, despite their rhetoric at the uropean Council in Milan, most member states had recognised reality and a shown themselves to be in favour of a modest package. The

Emission&apos;s atterapt to get more power had also ba^jKresis ted. On

Regulation the undertakings by the Commission /Kouyi be helpful. On uman, animal and plant health it had been necesffCC^GKfight long and ar to reach a satisfactory solution. It was clear^ttjat national measures could be continued without prior authorisart-ejKiy the Emission and that it would be for the European Courtice, not 0r the Commission, to decide in cases where there was w^d^&apos;oute whether Particular action was a disguised restriction on trade&apos;   ra&apos;rj&gt;&lt;pr than a real requirement for the protection of health. The texts ^j&amp;^wang the results of the Intergovernmental Conference would now be pu  Vir^tA-f inal orm. Until it was known whether the general reserves by ItaW^aftOv enmark would be withdrawn the agreement would not be submittecKro^rtie aited Kingdom Parliament.


   

the FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that progress towards a new round of trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was now being made through a single preparatory committee.

^^f^CRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY recalled that an agreement ^^/iife^kre ached ad referendum between the Community and the United StaWkA^steel exports to the United States&apos; market. This was broadly accept^bj^r&gt;but the United Kingdom had not then received sufficient assuranj^j^mj exports by the British Steel Corporation (BSC) of seni-fiinwOT/^teelS. Agreement had now been reached, however, with the United St A^e^which would enable the BSC to carry out the contract on supplies ofvAsemi-finished steel to the plant at Tuscaloosa, Alabama. He had therefore lifted the United Kingdom&apos;s reserve on the wider agreement.

Environment

THE SECRETARY OF STArfe^J  fiD THE ENVIRONMENT said that at the Council of Ministers (EnvironmentNovember there had been satisfactory Progress on vehicle em i ^  #ra\an d on cHe date for the introduction of unleaded petrol. On the prdWgd directive on emissions from large Plants, however, the United^&amp;wlom had been further isolated when the Presidency had proposed draf^j&gt;wyhciples for an agreement. This could still be an issue when the Urrbfc^a^ingdom assumed the Presidency in the second half of 1986.

4    THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that the Northern reland Assembly was meeting that day. It would consider a proposal by unionist members that the work of the Scrutiny ComJiuXtees of the ssembly should be suspended and that a &quot;grand cfcmmi^Jbee&quot; of the members 0 the Assembly should be established to review	ications of the

Anglo-Irish Agreement for the government and the fuc^r^/^f Northern reland and the operation of the Northern Ireland Cotrsj^^ut ion Act 1973 and the Northern Ireland Act 1982.

Some of the matters proposed for consideration by the so-caiJ^2L &quot;grand committee&quot; were within the remit of the Assembly, but othe&lt;^^  re not. he Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern imself were likely to be among the people invited to give evTct^rfc^ urmg the review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The unionist c early hoped that this review would provide a major platform foX/m/?^r


   views, although it was not a foregone conclusion that the review would engage public attention continuously for very long. The unionist leaders intended that the proceedings should be broadcast on radio and &gt; television. They intended to display a banner inscribed &quot;Northern ^^reland says no&quot; on the Assembly building; this was likely to cause the &apos;^Alliance Party to walk out of the Assembly later that morning. The ament would need to consider whether to allow the Assembly to in activities which clearly extended beyond its remit. One for consideration would be the suspension at an appropriate time 0 /^5^ssembly* Meanwhile, plans were going ahead for the first me  (t*ng)&gt;\f the Intergovernmental Conference in the following week. The anioqd^rOj^mbers of the House of Commons, who had begun resigning their seats,	that the resulting by-elections would take place on

23 Januts  5M86.

, Vs?

in dlscussH^n, the following points were made -

a.	The proceedings of the &quot;grand committee&quot; would constitute a one-sided barrage of propaganda against the Anglo-Irish Agreement. It was unlik^yyihat supporters of the Anglo-Irish Agreement would choose to gi^ta. evidence, although some members of the Presbyterian Church, who didVfioYj agree with their leaders&apos; criticism of the Agreement, migJx^taa&apos;ftibly do so.

b.	There were arfor the Government waiting to see how the proceedings develop  #7v^&gt;^ore deciding what action to take. On the other hand, it might wpd^he harder for the Government to stop the proceedings once they Tyktrmgt going.

c   It would be worth th^G^)vrnment trying to persuade the Alliance Party not to witmftpdy^ompletely from the work of the Assembly.

There had been indications^!n^^ the Social Democratic and Labour Party might be willing toipate in the work of the Assembly after new elections. OnS^^s ibility for consideration might therefore be to bring forward^^^Tissembly elections to the early part of 1986.

THE Prime MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the question 0w the Government should react to the intended pj^teedings in the Northern Ireland Assembly would require further raSnsmderation by the Ministers most closely concerned.

5.	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the unemployment iigures, published that morning, showed a small reduction in both the headline&quot; (unadjusted) and the seasonally adjusted figures for \pnemployment between October and November. This was the third month in Jj row in which the underlying level of unemployment had dropped, and the jP^Xformance for the previous six months had been better than in any r^Ponth period in the previous six years. Vacancies at Job Centres &apos;^rf//mar  inaHy down on the month. Impressionistic evidence from 1 P^rx\ suggested that more companies were taking people on, but this coiUrfl IWt be relied upon as an indication of a future trend in the

8u,*p&gt;

^rsdC^^n^the following points arose -

a.	were remained concern about the artificiality of the figures for registered unemployment, particularly in regions like the South East which displayed all the symptoms of continuing labour shortage. Matures were being taken by the Department of Employment,/rlT^fensultat ion with the Department of Health and Social Secur^v^-wi th a view to discovering and reducing fraudulent claims for unem^lownent benefit. Nine pilot schemes would shortly be started witrx~2^M^w to closer analysis of the unemployment figures. The effirar^^f such schemes might be not only to improve the state of infor^a^^w. about the realism of the figures but also to discourage fraudvf^r^laimants from continuing to sign on.

b.	The state of litt^rj^jHlution in British streets and motorways was a national disgraceN-^  \hould be possible to do more to encourage the use of unenrofa^ejL people to make and keep Britain tidier. Experience sugges^fed^tAat determined efforts by public authorities to promote tidinea  ^^\lped to diminish the public propensity to drop litter, raen^vas a case for considering whether legislation should be mbrpjffaced to make everybody responsible for the cleanliness c^rfC-rixiiness of the pavements in front of their own front doors,
