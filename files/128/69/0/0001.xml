ml9SECRETMOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORDCC(80) 40th Conclusions, Item 76SOCIAL THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he had agreedSECURITY with the Secretary of State for Social Services on savings from theEXPENDITURE       proposed move to monthly payments of child benefit, following the studyunder Sir Derek Rayner, and to a 2 per cent cut on cash controlledexpenditure, mainly affecting administration expenses*   The outstand-ing issue for consideration was whether all benefits, includingretirement pensions* should be up-rated in November 1981 by threepercentage points less than wbuld be necessary to give full priceprotection - that is, on present estimates, by 8 per cent rather thanll per cent*   Allowing for exceptions for war pensions and formobility and attendance allowances this would lead to net savings of 159 million in 1981-82 and of about  470 million in each of the twofollowing years.    If the real value of benefits were to be reduced in thisway, the Government would undoubtedly be accused of attacking the poorand mi breaking pledges.    Nevertheless, the social securityprogramme represented 25 per cent of total public expenditure and, ifthe necessary overall savings were to be achieved, it could not beexempted.   A down-rating of 3 per cent could be justified in three ways.Up to 1 per cent could be justified by reference to the expectation matearnings would fall behind prices over the next year or so*   A further1 per cent would offset the amount by which the 16-| per cent up-ratinggiven in November 1980 was likely to be over-generous in relation tothe actual rate of inflation for the year to November 1980. Theremaining 1 per cent wbuld prevent the Retail Price Index (RPI) effectof normal revalorisation of alcohol and tobacco duties in the nextBudget working through into social security and other benefits. Moregenerally the reduction could be defended as not being unfair, at atime when most sections of the community would be having to acceptreduced living standards, against the background that the real value ofretirement pensions had increased by 31 per cent since 1971 and that;&apos;; &apos;. the elderly were also entitled to a range of other valuable benefits*In parallel with these proposals he recommended that index-linkedpublic sector pensions should also be held back at the next up-ratingby three percentage points.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that, whilehe understood the economic arguments in favour of the proposedabatement, it would be very difficult to secure the passing of thenecessary legislation.    The Government would be charged with breakingits commitment to maintain the value of retirement pensions* ThePrime Minister, in a television broadcast on 6 January, had confirmedthat the Government was pledged to the indexation of old age pensionsfor the lifetime of this Parliament.   He had frequently confirmed thiscommitment himself.    The exemption of retirement pensioners would1SECRET
SECRETreduce the prospective savings by about  75 million in 1981-82 and by 210 million in 1982-83.    There would also be considerable politicaldifficulties in applying the reduction to the other benefits most of whichhelped either the old, the disadvantaged or the unemployed, althoughthere was not the same commitment in respect of those benefits.hi discussion it was the general view that the Government could not goback on its firm pledge to continue with indexation of retirementpensions.    To do so would mean that this Government, and theConservative Party, would be charged both now and for many yearsin the future with breaking faith with old people.    It would moreoverrisk provoking social unrest at a time of deep disquiet, particularlyoutside the South East region, over rising unemployment.    It couldbe argued that a 1 per cent abatement to offset the over-provision inthe present increase of ldj per cent would not be inconsistent withthe pledge.    There was however no case for controversial legislationto secure this reduction alone.In further discussion the following points were made:-a. Although indexation of retirement benefits wouldcontinue, the Government were not similarly committedto the indexation of other social security benefits. Thepossibility of abating the November 1981 increase in someof these other benefits should therefore be examinedfurther.    It should however be recognised that there wouldbe considerable difficulties in securing savings withoutpenalising the old, the unemployed and the disadvantaged.b. The Cabinet had previously decided that the healthprogrammes should be exempted from the general 2 per centcut applying to cash controlled programmes.    If it were notpossible to make any significant savings on social securityprogrammes this decision should be re-opened.    It mightbe possible to make savings to increase efficiencyequivalent to, say, 1 per cent of the programme. Therewas alsc a case for considering suspension of the Christmasbonus payments to pensioners in 1981.c. There was a case for taking alcohol, tobacco and energycosts out of the price index by reference to which the levelsof benefits were determined.    It had to be recognised,however, that all these items were prominent in the budgetsof many old age pensioners.d. As soon as the Government had reduced inflationto lower levels there would be a case for introducinglegislation to remove the obligation to automatic indexation.Until this was done, the Government&apos;s hands were tied overa major area of expenditure and the benefits of North Sea2SECRET
SECREToil would continue to be channelled into consumptionrather than investment.    This matter should be consideredfurther in the light of the Scott report en pensions. Areview of the commitment to index public sector pensionscould best be included in this more general considerationof indexation.e.      Rather than make cuts on social security programmesit would be preferable to accept tax increases, and inparticular to raise more from income tax by providingless than full indexation of thresholds; by raising morerevenue from the North Sea; and perhaps by taxing thehigh profits which accrued to the banks from the presenthigh level of interest rates.    None of these courses waswithout difficulty.    Raising income tax thresholds by lessthan full indexation would be to risk reaching the point oftaxing benefits and of exacerbating the &apos;why work1 problem.The present levels of tax on oil companies operations in theNorth Sea already involved very high marginal rates of taxand further increases risked deterring exploration anddevelopment*  And additional taxation of bank profitswould limit their ability to finance their current capitalleasing activities which were an important source of financefor industry.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed that the Government should not go back on itspledge to maintain full indexation of retirement pensions. Theywere not similarly pledged to indexation of other social securitybenefits* and the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for Social Services should consider urgently the possibilitiesfor* and arguments for and against, reductions of these benefits.They should also consider further the possibility of a reduction oftile cash controlled health programme; even if it was not possibleto achieve the 2 per cent which was being applied to programmesgenerally, it might be possible to achieve a reduction of, say,1 per cent.    When the Government had received the report ofSir Bernard Scott&apos;s enquiry into public sector pensions, the Cabinetwould consider further the case for legislation to reduce or removethe elements of indexation built in to present financial arrangements,including the indexation of public sector pensions.Cabinet Office14 November 19803SECRET
