257cm. 54 (45)&quot;.Man-Power.Eelease of doctors fromthe armed forces.(previous reference:CM. (45) 51stConclusions,Minute 5.)1 The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (45) 285) covering a minute by the Secretary ofState for War asking for guidance on the method of giving effectto the Cabinefs decision of the 8th November about the release of doctors from the Army.The Lord President recalled that the Cabinet had decided thatthere should be a net release of 5,600 doctors from the Army in theperiod from the 18th June to the 31st December, 1945. In the minute annexed to CP. (45) 285, the Secretary of State for war had set out three alternative methods of carrying out this decision and had indicated his preference for release in Class B. It was clear, however, that the required number of releases could not beachieved in time by this means and the right course seemed, there-fore, to be to release the necessary numbers in Class A. although this would involve discriminating between doctors and other officersin the Army, it should not in practice upset the working of the age and length of service principle, since doctors were separatelyrecruited as a professional class and served in a separate Corps,and within that class the principle of release by age and length ofservice would be preserved.The Lord President said that up to the end of October only ,554 doctors had been released against a total of 7,745 to be released by the end of the year. There must, therefore, be an immediate and substantial increase in the rate of release of doctors if the Cabinet&apos;decision was to be carried out.The Secretary of State for War said that he was anxious tocarry out the decision of the Cabinet, but was faced with a real difficulty. If he released doctors ahead of other officers, he wouldprovide the opponents of the age and service principle with an argument in favour of departing from that principle in other classesof case. Moreover, the release of doctors in Class A on the lines suggested by the Lord President would destroy the balanced distri-bution of the available doctors in the various theatres.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Navy were doing everything possible to give effect to the Cabinet&apos;s decision and there was no question of retaining doctors in the Navy inorder to preserve the principle of release by age and length ofservice. It must be recognised, however, that it would be extremelydifficult for the Admiralty to release a sufficient number of doctorsin the short period up to the end of the year to bring the totalreleases up to 1,265. It was clear that the standard of medical service in the Navy would be drastically reduced, while considerablehardship would be imposed on those doctors who were retained.It had to be borne in mind that the Royal Navy were responsiblefor providing treatment for merchant seamen in foreign ports. Hewould circulate to the Cabinet a memorandum setting out in detailwhat the Cabinefs decision implied for the Navy.The Secretary of State for Air said that the R.A.F. wouldrelease by the end of the year the 880 doctors for whom they hadbeen asked. This meant, however, that no more doctors could be released from the R.A.F. in Class B except on replacement.Further discussion showed that it was the general view of theCabinet that there could be no modification of the decision of the8th November that a total of 7,745 doctors should be released fromthe Services by the end of 1945. The means of giving effect to thisdecision might vary from one Service to another, and each ServiceMinister should consider how the prescribed numbers could be released with the least detriment to the Service for which he was responsible. The Cabinet were, however, prepared to defend therelease of doctors from the Army in Class A, on the basis indicatedin the Lord Presidents memorandum, even though this involvedapplying the age and service principle to doctors separately fromother officers in the Army.[30932] b 2
The Cabinet-(1) Reaffirmed their decision of the 8th November regardingthe release of doctors from the Armed Forces.(2) Invited the Service Ministers to see that effect was givento that decision by the means which would involve leastdetriment to the efficiency of the Services.Man-Power. 2.   At their meeting on the 1st November the Cabinet hadLabour agreed that for the time being no change should be made in the controls. existing system of labour controls and had invited the Lord(Previous President to arrange for the problem to be further examined in reference: the light of the points raised in the discussion.CM. (45)48th The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by theConclusions, Minister of Labour (CP. (45) 288) submitting revised proposals.minute 6.) The Mjnjster 0j Labour said that the modifications which he now proposed fell under three headings : &apos;(i) There should be a review of the industries and firms coveredby Essential Work Orders and other similar Orders; and sympathetic-thetic consideration should be given to applications from workersover 30 years of age subject to such Orders who desired to leave their war-time work and return to their former employment, if itwas of value to the community.(ii) The power of direction should be used in respect of workersunder 30 years of age without hesitation, but workers over the ageof 30 should be subject to direction only for the purpose of meetingthe special needs of a limited number of industries, such as building and coalmining.(iii) Subject to special safeguards for one or two industries such as building, the Control of Engagement Order should apply only to men and women below the age of 30, on the understandingthat the requirement that all labour should be engaged only through an employment exchange or other approved agency should beretained.If these modifications were made, it would be possible to enforce the controls. It was also proposed that special action should betaken, through the Factory Inspectorate, to improve conditions ina limited number of industries for which it was particularly difficultto recruit labour; and that the Production Departments shouldtake up with some of those industries the question of improving thelevel of wages and earnings.The Lord President said that at their previous discussion onthe 1st November the Cabinet had not felt that it would be possibleto adopt a policy of strict enforcement of all the existing labour controls. It was unfortunate that the Government had not made it clear to the public at an earlier date that the arguments in favourof maintaining economic controls throughout the transition periodapplied also to the controls over labour. The existing state ofaffairs, in which the conviction that labour controls would not been forced was spreading daily, could not be allowed to continue forlong; and it would, in his view, be better to take the positive linerecommended by the Minister of Labour of restricting control to alimited field within which it could be strictly enforced. At the sametime, energetic action should be taken to improve conditions in the difficult industries, and a publicity campaign should be organised tobring home to the public the need for retaining those labour controls which were to remain.In discussion, some Ministers urged that it would be unwise atthe present stage to make the proposed modifications in the systemof labour controls. This system bad now been in operation for over five years and, although in particular cases the powers might notbe enforceable, there was a large body of labour which complied withthe controls; and many industries badly in need of labour were likely on balance to lose more than they would gain by any overtrelaxation.   It would be claimed in respect of a large number of
259cm. 54 (45) Tindustries that the power of direction should be retained for workersover 30; and if these claims were admitted a large part of theworking population over 30 would still remain subject to control.On the other hand, the singling out of particular industries withinwhich the power of direction of workers over 30 was to be retainedwould tend to accentuate the unpopularity of these essential industries and thus add to their difficulties in recruiting labour.Other points in discussion were : &apos;(a) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he was appre-hensive of the effect of offering to consider sympatheticallyapplications from workers over 30 years of age to be allowed to leave their war-time employment. It was already proving difficult toretain those volunteers who had entered the coalmining industry during the war, and any indication that the provisions of theEssential Work Orders were to be relaxed in the way suggested would lead to a flood of applications for release from the coalmining-industry.The First Lord of the A dmiralty expressed similar fears withregard to the loss of workers from the ship-building industry.The Minister of Labour said that there would be no questionof releasing a worker from his present employment unless he proposed to undertake some other employment which would be of greater value to the community.(b) The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries pointed out thatthat there was no Essential Work Order applicable to agriculture,and it would be difficult to secure any improvement in the conditionsof agricultural workers without provoking a demand for increases in agricultural prices. He attached great importance to theretention of skilled labour in agriculture and of the power to directworkers of over 30 years of age back into agriculture if necessary.(c) The Home Secretary said that some means must be retainedof maintaining the numbers of persons over 30 years of age in the prison service.(d) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was essentialto continue in force the Control of Employment (Civil Servants)Order, 1945. It would also be desirable that the Treasury should bekept in touch with any proposals for changes in the level of wagesand earnings in particular industries.The Foreign Secretary said that the problem of securing a proper distribution of labour would not be solved by acceleratingdemobilisation from the Armed Forces. The country would be unable in future to afford to maintain in non-productive trades and services as large a proportion of the available man-power as theyhad before the war, and it was therefore essential for the Govern-ment to assume the responsibility of guiding labour to those industries and services which had to be fully manned in the national interest. In his view, the Government should work out a programmeof essential production including, for example, in the case of housing, not merely the actual erection of the houses but also theproduction of building materials and components. It should thenbe made clear to the country that, in order to achieve the necessarylevel of essential production, the Government proposed to designatecertain essential industries just as industries whose products hadbeen needed for the invasion of Europe had been designated duringthe war. If a scheme on these lines were worked out and properlyexplained, he believed that the public would accept the maintenanceof the controls necessary to ensure that the scheme was carried out.The Lord President said that it appeared that the cabinet were not at present prepared to accept the proposals made in cp. (45) 288. He suggested that it would be advantageous if theForeign Secretary would confer with the Minister of Labour witha view to formulating revised proposals for submission to theCabinet.
The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of labour to review the proposals set out in CP. (45) 288 in the lightof the points raised in discussion and to submit revised proposals for consideration by the Cabinet at a meeting inthe following week.Housing.progress report.(previous reference:CM. (45) 41stConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Health (CP. (45) 274) embodying the first of a series of periodical reports on the progress of the housing programme.Points in discussion were : (a) The Minister of Health said that the total programme forthe period ending the 30th June, 1947, was 565,000 houses, as statedin paragraph 2 of his memorandum. There was at present no intention of varying . the programme of 165,000 temporaryprefabricated houses; but the division of the 400,000 permanent houses, as between traditional and prefabricated types, should notbe regarded as finally fixed. The ultimate decision regarding thenumber of prefabricated houses to be included in the programme would turn on the progress made in the development of these non-traditional types.(b) The Minister of Health said that the number of tendersaccepted for permanent traditional houses had now risen above thefigure of 12,595 given in paragraph 4 of his memorandum. For thepresent, however, he was less concerned to see an increase in thetotal number of accepted tenders than to secure the even distributionof the total throughout all areas.(c) The Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forScotland said that his concern was also to secure an even spread ofnew building. One of the greatest difficulties in Scotland at thepresent time was to secure adequate progress with the programmeof temporary prefabricated houses. Up to date only 228 of these had been completed.(d) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that, inthe light of his experience of housing after the last war, he would strongly deprecate the publication of any programme or target forthe number of houses to be provided within a stated time. Therewere too many unforeseeable contingencies which could falsify eventhe most careful estimates. Thus, in the years immediately after thelast war the proportion of the building labour force employed in house building had not risen above 18 per cent. On his past experience, he would expect that cost would prove to be one of thegreatest difficulties; and he doubted whether Ministers hadsufficiently drastic powers of controlling building costs.The Cabinet Took note of the progress report embodied in CP. (45) 274.Poland.repatriation of Membersof PolishArmedForces.(previous reference:W.M.(45)37thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (45) 290) asking that shipping should be madeavailable to repatriate from this country about 23,000 members ofthe Polish Armed Forces who had expressed the wish to return to poland.The Cabinet agreed that, for the reasons given in this memo-randum, it was desirable that an early start should be made withthe repatriation of these members of the Polish Armed Forces; andthat, if shipping could be made available, they should be sent by searather than overland through the Russian zone of Germany.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of War Transport, saidthat, owing to an unforeseen reduction in the demands on shipping for troop movements, it would be possible to make available in the
course of December shipping which could complete the movement of rthese 23,000 Poles within a period of two of three months by direct,.sailings between this country and Gdynia. This shipping couldbe made available without delaying the existing programmes for themovement of troops. The Admiralty had been asked whether the approaches to Gdynia had been sufficiently cleared of mines to makeit possible to use this route.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, subject to satisfactory assurances from theAdmiralty about the safety of this route, the foreign secretary should inform, the Polish Provisional Govern-menfc that transport could be made available to repatriateby sea the 23,000 members of the Polish Armed forces who had expressed a wish to return to Poland.(2) Asked the Secretary of State for War and the Minister ofWar Transport, when invited by the Foreign Secretaryto do so, to proceed with the arrangements forrepatriating these Poles by this route.tourist traffic fromthe UnitedStates.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (45) 284) suggesting that the Secretary of theDepartment of Overseas Trade should be authorised to organise ascheme for encouraging American visitors to come to this country during the summer of 1946. It was explained in the memorandum that the main difficulty would lie in the provision of accommodation;and it was contemplated that special arrangements might be madeto use for this purpose spare accommodation in Universities, schools and hostels. The scheme should cater for students and persons inthe middle and lower income groups.The President of the Board of Trade and the Chancellor of theExchequer supported the proposal.The Minister of Health said that he could not agree that anyhostels should be used for this scheme which might be made avail-able to ease the housing shortage. The Minister of Educationsimilarly deprecated the use of any accommodation in Universitiesor schools which might be made available for vacation courses,particularly for the training of school-teachers. The parliamentary secretary, Ministry of War Transport, said that shipping difficulties should also be considered; for some time to come there would becongestion on the. westward run across the Atlantic.The Foreign Secretary explained that he had no intention ofclaiming for this purpose accommodation which had already beenearmarked, or was needed, for the purposes of any of the Govern-ment&apos;s domestic programmes. It had been his intention that theSecretary of the Department of Overseas Trade should explore, inconsultation with the Departments concerned, all the practicaldifficulties involved, including those to which reference had beenmade; and any differences between Departments which could notbe reconciled by this means could be brought up again to the Cabinet.All that he asked at this stage was that the Cabinet should indicate their agreement that it would be advantageous to promote a scheme-on these lines to encourage American tourists to visit this countrynext summer, if it proved practicable to provide the necessary facilities without prejudice to other important Governmentprogrammes.The Cabinet *(1) Expressed general agreement with the Foreign Secretary&apos;proposal, as stated at &quot; X &quot; above.(2) Invited the Secretary of the Department of Overseas Tradeto consider, with the assistance of a Committee composedof junior Ministers from the Departments primarily
concerned, whether a practicable scheme could be devised to achieve the objectives indicated in CP. (45) 284 and,if so, to supervise the- organisation of the necessary arrangements.Spain. 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theDisposal of Secretary of State for War (CP. (45) 283) regarding the disposalSpanish of some 220 Spaniards who had been taken into custody by AlliedRefugees troops during the advance across Trance in 1944 and were now taken detained in a prisoner-of-war camp in this country.    It wasprisoner in explained in the memorandum that these men were refugees from France. Franco&apos;s Spain, but had been taken into custody because, when foundin France, they were either wearing German uniform or were inGerman organisations. They had been treated as prisoners of war,but could not be detained in this country indefinitely. It was recommended that they should be released and allowed to remainhere until the Foreign Secretary succeeded in his efforts to find themasylum elsewhere.In discussion, the Home Secretary said that he was reluctant to have these men added to the resident alien population in thiscountry. Many of them had dependents in France and, if they were set at liberty here, he would be pressed to admit their dependents.Was it not possible to find them asylum in some other country ?The Foreign Secretary said that there were in Gibraltar otherrefugees from Franco&apos;s Spain whom he had been trying to placein Mexico or Venezuela. These Spanish refugees now on Britishsoil should be treated as a single problem, and he was not in favourof trying to deal separately with those who happened to be detained in this country. He asked that a decision should be postponed for two weeks, so that he might make a further attempt to persuade the French to take back at least some of those now detained here.Meanwhile, the Home Office might consider whether any who hadultimately to be set at liberty in this country could be released onsuitable conditions which would prevent their being absorbed intothe resident alien population.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Home Secretary to consider whether means could not be found of securing that, if any of these men had to be set at liberty in this country, their releaseshould be subject to such conditions as would preventtheir being absorbed into the resident alien population.(2) Agreed to postpone for two weeks further consideration ofthe proposal put forward in CP. (45) 283.7. The Lord President said that there had been some dispo-sition, particularly on the part of new Members of Parliament, tocall in question the existing plans for the rebuilding of the Houseof Commons. There had been some talk of the advantages of analternative site; and, even among those who favoured rebuildingon the same site, there had been support for the view that the newChamber should be larger than the old. He believed that new members were now beginning to appreciate the reasons underlying the Select Committee&apos;s recommendation that the Chamber shouldbe rebuilt on substantially the same plan as the old. He would like,however, to be assured that the present Government were satisfiedthat it was right to go forward with the existing plans for the rebuilding.The Cabinet-Agreed that there were no grounds for modifying theexisting plans for the rebuilding of the House of Commons.Cabinet Offices, S.W. 1,20th November, 1945.House ofCommons.Plans for rebuilding.(previous reference:W.M.(45)7thConclusions,Minute 9.)
HO CIRCULATION RECORD5U-TH CONCLUSIONS.  MINUTE 7 - 2QTH NOVEMBER,  191^5*THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said.that keeninterest was &quot;being shown in the question of providingMembers of Parliament with better accommodation in which,to conduct their correspondence, receive visitors, etc.An attempt might he made to get this question raised onthe Select Committee which was considering the remuneration and conditions of work of Members.     He hoped that theSelect Committee could be persuaded not to deal with thesematters.     He v/as however considering,  independently of theCommittee&apos;s enquiry, whether premises in Bridge Street,Westminster, could be acquired and converted for such use by Members.     He invited the views of his colleagues onthis suggestion.It was the general view of the Cabinet that it wouldbe advantageous if premises in Bridge Streetcould be acquired and converted for use asoffices, etc. by Members of Parliament.
