1. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the Report on broadcasting policy (CP. (45) 293). They also had before them amemorandum by the Lord President (CP. (45) 344) drawing-attention to the more important recommendations of the report which had not been disposed of in the earlier discussion, and amemorandum by the Postmaster-General (CP. (45) 343) on wirebroadcasting.The Lord President said that the conclusions reached by theCabinet in their earlier discussion of the Report implied approvalof the recommendations that no public enquiry need be held beforethe charter of the B.B.C. was renewed, that the B.B.C. should retainits monopoly of the right to originate broadcasts in this country,and that the charter should be renewed for a further period of tenyears from the 1st January, 1947. The more important of theremaining recommendations were set out in paragraph 3 of cp. (45) 344.Discussion turned first on the&apos;recommendation that the B.B.C.should be required to broadcast an adequate and impartial dailyaccount of the proceedings in both Houses of Parliament. It waspointed out that the B.B.C. had already arranged for daily broad-casts of Parliamentary proceedings by a professional reporter, inaddition to the Saturday broadcasts in the &apos;&apos; Week in Westminster &apos;&apos;series. Some criticism was expressed of the daily broadcasts. Thus,in the account of the proceedings in the House of Lords debate onthe Financial Agreement with the United States the government speakers had not been reported. Reference was also made to theawkward situation which arose when a Member of Parliament,chosen to give a broadcast in the &quot; Week in Westminster &quot; series,had taken a prominent part in the proceedings during the week under review. On the other hand, it was urged that on the whole the daily broadcasts gave a fair account of the proceedings inParliament and that, so far as concerned broadcasts in the &quot; week in Westminster &apos;&apos; series, the arrangements were made a considerable time in advance and it would sometimes be embarrassing to change the speaker at the last moment.The Prime Minister said that these difficulties illustrated theneed for a strong Board of Governors. The attention of the B.B.Cshould, however, be drawn to particular broadcasts which gave an inadequate account of the proceedings in Parliament. The Secre-tary of State for Dominion Affairs should see the reporter aboutthe broadcast on the Financial Agreement with the United States.The Cabinet next discussed the proposal that the cost of allB.B.C. services should be borne out of a single broadcasting vote and that the cost of overseas broadcasting should be borne by theExchequer independently of any licence fee revenue. TheChancellor of the Exchequer said that he accepted this proposal.Ministerial responsibility for the vote could not be finally deter-mined until the Cabinet had settled the general question of ministerial responsibility for broadcasting as a whole.Discussion then turned on the recommendation that every effort should be made to eliminate commercial broadcasting directed tothis country from overseas. The Cabinet were informed that negotiations for the lease of Radio Luxembourg (see paragraph 51 of cp. (45) 293) were proceeding and that the attitude of the FrenchGovernment was satisfactory. There was general support for theview that all commercial broadcasting directed to this country from overseas should be eliminated; and that, if necessary, international agreement to eliminate broadcasting of this type should be soughtthrough the United Nations Organisation.Other points made in discussion were : (a) The Lord President suggested that the salaries of theChairman and members of the Board of Governors should bediscussed as part of the wider question of salaries for chairmen and[312571 b 2
members of public Boards, on which a committee of officials was to &apos;;submit   recommendations   to  the   Lord   Presidents   Committee(L.P. (45) 47th Meeting, Minute 2),(b) The Postmaster-General reported that he had examined theadministrative implications of the proposal that the increasedlicence fee should be payable in two half-yearly instalments of 10*.On the assumption that about 75 per cent, of the holders of licenceswould elect to pay by instalments, this proposal would involve an addition of 500 to the staff of the Post Office and an increase of 250,000 in the annual cost of collection.(c) The Secretary of State for India and for Burma said thatthe. recommendations in paragraph 32 of the Report for theextension of broadcasting in the Colonies and India should beapplied also to Burma.(d) The Lord President said that it might be necessary at alater stage to present a White Paper setting out the government&apos;s policy on broadcasting, but this must await the Cabinets decisionon the question of Ministerial responsibility for the B.B.C.The Cabinets conclusions were as follows :  (1) The B.B.C. should retain its monopoly of the right tooriginate broadcasts in the United Kingdom; the charter of the B.B.C. should be renewed for a further period of ten years from the 1st January, 1947; and no public enquiry need be held before the Charter wasrenewed.(2) The B.B.C. should be under an obligation to broadcast anadequate and impartial daily account of proceedings in both Houses of Parliament.(3) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should take up with the B.B.C. reporter concerned the failure to give anadequate account of the House of Lords debate on theFinancial Agreement with the United States.(4/ The cost of all B.B.C. services should be borne on a singleBroadcasting Vote, and the cost of overseas broadcastingshould be borne by the Exchequer independently of anylicence fee revenue.(5) In view of the estimated cost of arranging for the paymentof the increased licence fee by instalments, the fee should in the first instance be payable as a single sum, on theunderstanding that if this were found to involve hard-ship on classes such as old age pensioners the matter would be reviewed.(6) Decision on the question whether the Government should bring the relay exchange system under public ownershipshould be deferred, and the situation should be reviewed again nearer the date of the expiry of the licences held bythe Relay Companies.(7) The Lord President should arrange for the salaries of theChairman and members of the Board of Governors of theB.B.C. to be reviewed as part of the general question ofthe salaries of chairman and members of public Boards.(8) The remaining recommendations in CP. (45) 293 were approved.Political 2.   At their meeting on the 16th October the Cabinet hadBroadcasting, mvited the Lord Privy Seal to reconsider, in the light of the(Previous discussion, the original proposals of the B.B.C regarding politicalReference: broadcasts, and to discuss the matter further with representativesC.M.(45)42nd of the B.B.C. before approaching the Opposition Leaders.    TheConclusions, Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by the Lord PrivyMinute 3.) Seal (CP. (45) 335) to which was annexed a revised statementprepared after further discussions with the B.B.C
The Cabinet considered the text of this revised statement&quot;paragraph by paragraph.Paragraph 1 proposed that, if a Minister desired to broadcast,the Department charged by the Prime Minister with responsibilityfor dealing with such matters should &quot; ascertain the views of theB.B.C before conveying approval to the broadcaster.&quot; Thislanguage was criticised as implying that the B.B.C had a right to challenge the Government view that a Ministerial broadcast shouldbe made on a particular subject. It was felt that the B.B.C. shouldnot be put in a position to override the Government on such a point,though they should be brought into consultation and given anopportunity of expressing their views on timing and technical matters.The Cabinet agreed that the second sentence of thisparagraph should be amended so as to read : &quot;If theinitiative for a Ministerial broadcast comes from theGovernment side, the Government Department prescribedwill make the necessary arrangements with the B.B.C.&quot;P paragraph 2 proposed that, when a Minister had made a broadcast which the B.B.C. regarded as falling within the region of party politics rather than as being a statement of national policy, theB.B.C. should be free to arrange for a broadcast in reply to be givenby a spokesman of the official Opposition.In discussion of this paragraph, it was argued that it would be wrong to put the B.B.C. in the position of determining after theevent whether a Minister&apos;s broadcast had been of such a characterthat the Opposition should be given an opportunity to reply. Underthis procedure the Government spokesman might be put at a serious disadvantage. He might have designed his broadcast as an objectivestatement and refrained from Party advocacy, yet if the B.B.C.chose after the event to regard his broadcast as &quot; within the region of Party jDolitics &quot; an Opposition speaker would be given anopportunity to broadcast a debating reply.It was also pointed out that under Party Government most ofthe important statements made by Ministers could be regarded as&quot; falling within the region of Party politics.&quot; The real question was whether such a statement would be so controversial as to warrantgiving the Opposition an opportunity to reply; and that question was one which was better decided, not by officials of the B.B.C, butby consultations between the Parties through the usual channels.Moreover, the question should normally be settled before the ministerial broadcast was made.The Cabinet agreed that this paragraph should be re-castso as to provide that when a Minister proposed to broad-cast a statement which, in the opinion of the B.B.C orof the Department charged by the Prime Minister with responsibility for dealing with these matters, might beregarded as controversial, the Department should arrangefor consultations to be held between the political Partiesthrough the usual channels with a view to deciding whetherthe Opposition should be given an opportunity to broad-cast a.reply; and, where it was agreed as a result of such,consultations that the Opposition should have an oppor-tunity to reply, the B.B..C should be required to afford the necessary facilities.Paragraphs 3 and 4. It was agreed that if paragraph 2 were re-cast as outlined above, paragraphs 3 and 4 could be omitted.Paragraph 5 proposed that if the Opposition desired to initiatea political broadcast the B.B.C would be approached on theauthority of the Leader of the Opposition : if the B.B.C. acceptedthe proposal they would inform the Government without delay and,if asked, would arrange for a Government reply.In discussion it was pointed out that this was a new proposal which would appear to confer on the Opposition a right to initiate[31257] b 3
political broadcasts, which they had not hitherto enjoyed. Such aright might be so used to throw the Government on to the defensive.The Cabinet agreed that this paragraph should be deleted;but that a sentence should be added to the revised draftof paragraph 2 providing merely that the Governmentshould be informed without delay if the B.B.C.proposed to afford facilities for a broadcast to bemade on behalf of any other political Party. The pro-posal could then be taken up, if desired, in consultation between the Parties through the usual channels.Paragraph 6. It was agreed that this paragraph should be omitted.Paragraph 7. This paragraph was approved.Paragraph 8 proposed that the B.B.C. should not as a ruleallow Ministerial or other ex parte statements to be broadcast on matters under discussion in Parliament until the Bill had receivedits Third Reading in the House of Commons, or the business hadbeen completed.It was generally felt that this rule was unduly restrictive.There would be occasions on which it would be proper that matters should be discussed on the wireless before the Parliamentary pro-ceedings had been completed.The Cabinet agreed that paragraph 8 should be omitted.Paragraph 9 provided that arrangements privately reached between the political Parties in regard to broadcasting on political matters should not &apos;&apos; override or affect&apos;&apos; the agreement.The Cabinet agreed that this paragraph should be omitted.In general discussion of the document as a whole, the view was expressed that a formal agreement on the lines proposed in cp. (45) 335 would confer on the B.B.C. rights of denying to theGovernment of the day the use of the wireless as a medium forexplaining Government policy and would bring the B.B.C. into theposition of passing final judgment on issues which were more appropriate for discussion through the usual channels between representatives of the political Parties. Some Ministers felt thatin these matters the power of decision should rest with the Govern-ment, and that the B.B.C. should afford such facilities as theGovernment desired. On the other side, it was pointed out thatthe Governors of the B.B.C. had a responsibility to the public andthe Government should not interfere unduly in their exercise ofthat responsibility. It was, of course, essential that the B.B.C.should behave reasonably in these matters, and this emphasised theneed for great care in making appointments to the Board of governors. If, however, a capable and responsible Board were appointed, they should be allowed to retain a substantial measureof independence in their day-to-day administration of the B.B.C.The general conclusion of the Cabinet was that it would be inexpedient to seek to define the detailed procedure for political broadcasts in a formal document, and that it would be preferable that these matters should continue to be governed by understandingsas to the normal practice. The Lord Privy Seal should convey the cabinets views to the B.B.C., and, if any document was drawnup as a result of his further discussions, this should take the formof an informal aide-memoire or a minute of the meeting. Such a document would embody the substance of paragraphs 1, 2 and 7 ofthe statement annexed to CP. (45) 335, revised to take account ofthe points noted above.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with theMinister of Information, to resume his discussions withrepresentatives of the B.B.C. on the lines indicated at&quot;X&quot; above.
German 3.   The Cabinet had before  them a memorandum  by the &apos;Prisoners Minister of Labour and National Service (CP. (45) 341) regarding--of War. the employment of German prisoners of war in this country.   SinceEmployment the matter had previously been considered by the Cabinet there hadin this been further developments.   First, the Minister had explored theCountry. possibility of bringing prisoners of war from the United States.(Previous        Secondly, it had been impossible, in the face of representations made reference:       by the Russians, to adhere to the arrangement whereby 225,000C.M.(45)60th   prisoners of war were retained in Germany under German officersConclusions,     and staffs until they could be moved to this country for employment.Minute 5.y      The men in these units were now in process of being either disbandedor, to the limited extent that it was possible, transferred to prisoner-of-war camps.   As a result, there would now be only 165,000 men available from Germany after the end of March, instead of 225,000.The Minister of Labour said that in these circumstances he made the following proposals : (i) The German prisoners in Canada should be brought to,thiscountry as quickly as possible, the aim being to have them all heronot later than the end of March.(ii) Every effort should be made to reach agreement with theUnited States authorities to enable us to begin bringing here as soonas possible as many of the German prisoners in the United states as we could transport and accommodate.(iii) The Minister of Works, in collaboration with the Secre-taries of State for War and Air, should do everything possible toincrease the accommodation available for extra prisoners before theend of March above the present estimate of 45,000.(iv) The Secretary of State for War and the Minister of war transport should do everything possible to expedite the programme for repatriating Italians in order to increase the accommodation available up to the end of March for incoming Germans.(v) The Minister of Labour, in collaboration with the other ministers concerned, should explore further the possibility of arranging for the maximum number of German prisoners to be heldin Norway for transfer to this country when transport and accom-modation were available.(vi) The Minister of Labour, in collaboration with the Secretaryof State for War and the Ministers of War Transport and Works,should ensure that the necessary preparations were put in handnow to enable us to bring and accommodate here as quickly aspossible after the end of March such German prisoners as we should then be holding in Germany and Norway.The Minister of Labour explained that if these proposals were approved there would be a total of 422,000 German prisoners of waravailable for work in this country in the summer of 1046, pluspossibly a further 30-40,000 to be brought from Norway. Thiscompared with 334,000 German and Italian prisoners in employmentduring 1945. There would, therefore, be an increase of 90-130,000.Accordingly, there would be no need to reduce allocations to departments.Points in discussion were : (a) The Secretary of State for Air, commenting on (iii) of theproposals set out above, said that if a number of prisoners of warcould be allocated soon to the Air Ministry they would be able to accelerate demobilisation and to make available before the end oflVfarch accommodation for an additional number of perhaps 39,000prisoners. This would make possible a corresponding increase inthe number that could be brought from America,(b) Various Departments were concerned with the movement,accommodation and allocation of prisoners of war. There was already an official Committee to maintain contact between theDepartments on certain aspects of this question, but it might be thatthis Committee did not cover all aspects of it. It might be desirablethat additional Departments should be represented on theCommittee.
(c) The Minister of Food feared that there would be somereluctance among men working on food distribution to work along-side German prisoners of war.The Minister of Labour suggested that Trade Union assistance might be invoked to overcome any difficulty of this kind, and hepromised to give his help in the matter if the Minister of Food so desired.(d) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that theappropriate channel for any approach to the Canadian Governmenton this matter would be through the Canadian High commissioner in London.(e) It was believed that among the German prisoners of warin the United States there were many strong sympathisers with the nazi regime. It was desirable that they should be segregated whenthey arrived in this country.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals made by the Minister of Labouras set out at (i)-(vi) above.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour to consider whether any alteration in the composition of the existing inter-departmental Committee was desirable in order to ensureclose working between all the Departments concernedwith the movement, accommodation and allocation ofprisoners of war.International 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of trusteeship.     State for the Colonies (CP. (45) 342) regarding the future of territories       United  Kingdom territories now held under  mandate.     Thisheld under       proposed that an announcement should be made before the firstMandate.        session of the General Assembly of the United Nations : (a) stating(Previous        that it was the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to placeEeferenoe:       Tanganyika, the Cameroons and  Togoland under  Trusteeship,W.M.(45)61st   subject to the conclusion of satisfactory Trusteeship Agreements;Conclusions,     and (b) inviting reference as regards Palestine to the statementMinute 3.)      made by the Foreign Secretary on the 13th November.  No referencewould be made at this stage to Trans Jordan or Nauru.   The Govern-ments of the Mandated Territories and Dominion governments would be notified before the statement was made.- The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the colonies said that since the memorandum was prepared a telegram had beenreceived from the Governor of Tanganyika from which it was clearthat there would be strong opposition in the Territory, at leastamong the European community, to its being placed under Trustee-ship. He felt, however, that in spite of this it would be necessaryto do so; and there was general agreement with this view.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he was anxious that no decision should be taken to make the proposed statement until there had been consultation with the Dominions.Australia and New Zealand were very much concerned on accountof the mandates for New Guinea, Nauru and Western Samoa.South Africa was also concerned; and he thought there would bea sharp reaction from Field-Marshal Smuts if the Soviet Govern-ment showed signs of demanding a share in the Trusteeship of tanganyika.There was general agreement that Dominion governments should be consulted before it was decided to make the announcementproposed in CP. (45) 342.Other points in the discussion were : -(a) The Minister of Fuel and Power expressed anxiety aboutthe economic consequences of placing these territories under trusteeship. He referred particularly to the value of associatingTanganyika with Kenya and Uganda in economic matters.
The Parliamentary Undersecretary of State for the Coloniesexplained that the proposals for co-operation between Kenya,Uganda and Tanganyika, which had recently been published in a white Paper, had been worked out so as to fit in with the Trustee-ship proposals. There was already a Customs Union between thethree territories and it could, he thought, be assumed that therewould be nothing in the Trusteeship Agreement for Tanganyika toprevent the continuance of this. Under the United Nations Charterthere was an additional safeguard which had not existed under theMandate system. Under Trusteeship the equal treatment to othermembers of the United Nations must not prejudice the paramountinterests of the inhabitants of the territory. Under the mandate system there was an entirely &quot;open door &quot; to all members of theLeague of Nations.(b) The Cabinet were informed that the Chiefs of Staff hadbeen invited to consider whether all, or any parts of, the existingmandated territories should be regarded as strategic areas, and toexpress their views on the military provisions to be included in the trusteeship Agreements.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the views of the Chiefs of Staff were being obtained on the point noted at (b) above.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toarrange for Dominion Governments to be consulted about the announcement proposed in CP. (45) 342.(3) Agreed that the question should be re-submitted to theCabinet early in the New Year in the light of the views expressed by the Chiefs of Staff and DominionGovernments.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,20th December, 1945.
