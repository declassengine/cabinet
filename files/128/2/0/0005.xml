Nationalise- 1.   The Uabinet had before them a memorandum by the Lordtion. President (CP. (45) 277) covering the draft of a public announce-Announce- ment indicating in general terms the industries which theinent of Government intended to socialise during the course of the presentGovernments   Parliament.Intentions.

The  Lord  presidents committee had considered at their meeting on the 9th November(L.P. (45) 42nd Meeting, Minute 4) a draft public announcementcovering, not only the gas and electricity industries, but alsotransport services and shipping and the iron and steel industry;and the draft statement now before the Cabinet embodied the con-clusions  reached  by  the   Committee  and  certain   adjustmentssubsequently made in consultation with the Ministers primarily concerned.    Subject to the Cabinet&apos;s approval, he proposed tomake the announcement at an early date in the House of Commons.It should be possible to resist any pressure for a debate, on theground that the object of the announcement was merely to enablethe Ministers concerned to enter  into negotiations  with theindustries affected and to formulate detailed proposals.The Minister of Health asked whether an announcement on these lines would preclude the Government from extendingpublic control to other industries during the present Parliamentif circumstances arose which made such action desirable in thepublic interest. For example, it might be found desirable to bringone or other of the building materials industries under publiccontrol in order to secure the production necessary for the housing programme. The Lord, President said that the announcement would not preclude such action if circumstances arose which clearlywarranted it.In discussion, the following points were raised on the draft announcement:- (a) Paragraph 2. It was agreed that the words &quot; will intro-duce a Bill&quot; should be substituted for the words &quot;intend tointroduce a Bill&apos;&apos;; and that the words &apos;&apos; the Government intend tointroduce measures &quot; should be substituted for the words&quot;measures will be introduced.&quot;(b) Paragraph 3. It was explained that the proposals for bringing under public ownership long-distance haulage services would not affect the operations of carriers in country districts orof industrial firms which desired to run long-distance transport for the conveyance of their own goods, and that broadly the onlyservices which would be nationalised were those covered byClass &quot;A&quot; licences. The Minister of War Transport wouldmake it clear at a Press conference, which he proposed to holdimmediately after the announcement had been made, and he wouldgive the Lord President a note showing more precisely what services would be brought under national ownership.(c) ^Paragraph 5. The Foreign Secretary said that he hopedthat there would be a national plan for the orderly developmentof docks and harbours, in order to avoid the inefficiency caused inthe past by under-employment of costly installations and equip-ment. He also suggested that any scheme for nationalising dock and harbour undertakings should include such ancillary service as pilotage, lighterage and the provision, of warehouses, in orderthat within a given port area all the various services might become-ordinated. To meet this point, it was agreed that paragraph 5should be amended to read : &apos;&apos; Dock and harbour undertakings and appropriate ancillary undertakings will be brought within thescope of the national scheme, and the most suitable form of public ownership is under examination.&quot;
(d) Paragraph 6. The Minister of War Transport suggestedthat, in view of the difficult conditions with which the shipping industry would have to contend in the post-war years, it would be preferable to omit from this paragraph the statement that theGovernment would expect the shipping industry to &apos;&apos; comply withthe necessary standard of efficiency.&quot;   This was agreed.It was also agreed that it would not be expedient at this stage to bring coastwise shipping under public ownership, and that inthese circumstances the last sentence of paragraph 6 should be omitted.(e) Paragraph 7. It was agreed that the word &quot;final&quot;should be inserted before the word &quot; decisions &quot; in order to avoidapparent inconsistency with the Governments election pro-gramme, which had included proposals for bringing the iron andsteel industry under public ownership.(f) Paragraphs 8 and 9. It was explained that these para-graphs were designed to make it clear that the Government would pay no compensation for transactions carried out with the soleobject of inflating the amount of compensation payable, while atthe same time encouraging undertakings to carry out adequatedevelopment and maintenance in the interim period by promisingthat any compensation payable would make full allowance for anysuch work. In order to bring out this meaning more clearly, itwas agreed that the two paragraphs should be amalgamated into one; that words should be inserted to make it clear that the com-bined paragraph applied to all the industries mentioned in thestatement (in which event the special mention of the iron andsteel industry in the second sentence of paragraph 8 would nolonger be required); that the last sentence but one of paragraph 9should be omitted; and that in the preceding sentence the words&quot; progressive undertakings &quot; should be substituted for the word&quot; industries.&quot;The Cabinet Approved the draft announcement annexed to CP. (45)277, subject to the amendments noted in (a) to (f) above,and authorised the Lord President to make the announce-ment at an early date in the House of Commons.agricultural policy.(previous reference:W.M.(44)59thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Secretary of State forScotland and the Home Secretary (CP. (45) 273) submitting forapproval a draft announcement on agricultural policy.The Minister of A griculture and Fisheries said that the first draft of the announcement had been considered by the Lord Presi-dents Committee on the 1st November (L.P. (45) 40th Meeting,Minute 4) and that the draft now before the Cabinet embodiedcertain adjustments made by the Ministers concerned in the lightof the views expressed by the Committee. The announcement didnot purport to be a comprehensive statement of all the measureswhich the Government had in contemplation, but gave an outline of the principles on which the Governments agricultural policy would be based. The announcement interlocked closely with thestatement on Government controls and food policy made by theMinister of Food with the approval of the Cabinet on the7th November. Subject to the Cabinets approval he proposed tomake the announcement in the House of Commons on the15th November. A corresponding statement would be made in theHouse of Lords on the same clay.The Minister of Food said that he agreed with the terms of thedraft announcement. He asked that the Ministry of Food shouldbe associated with the discussions with representative organisations which it was proposed to open when the announcement had beenmade.   This was agreed to.
239cm. 52 (*5).In discussion the following points were raised :- (a) The Minister of Education asked whether more could notbe done to stimulate the production of green vegetables and fruit.She feared that there was a tendency to concentrate unduly on wheat production.The Minister of A griculture and Fisheries said that there wasno desire to stimulate wheat production beyond what was necessaryfor a healthy rotation of crops. There had, in fact, already beena reduction of  2 per acre in the wheat subsidy for 1946. So faras fruit was concerned, it must be realised that for much of theyear we were inevitably dependent on imports. He was in favourof promoting the consumption of more green vegetables, but he felt that for this purpose what was required was a satisfactorysystem of marketing rather than any form of subsidy or guaranteed price.(b) The Minister of Health said that he was seriously con-cerned about the extent to which tuberculous milk was still beingconsumed in this country. The incidence of bovine tuberculosishad increased during the war and it was estimated that 16 percent, of the milk consumed was infected. The only satisfactoryshort-term remedy was to pasteurize all milk, but proposals for compulsory pasteurization had always been resisted by the producer-retailers. He proposed to circulate a memorandum on this matter to the Lord Presidents Committee.(c) The Lord Chancellor asked whether it would not bedesirable to take power to transfer portions of land from one agri-cultural holding to another in order to secure holdings which couldbe worked with the maximum efficiency.The Minister of A griculture and Fisheries said that the county agricultural Committees did what they could to persuade farmers to make adjustments of this kind and that in practice a good dealof adjustment was being made by voluntary sales. Strong objectionwould, however, be raised to any proposal for empowering theMinister to exercise compulsion in this matter.(d) The Lord President suggested that it might be desirableto insert at the end of paragraph 11 a statement that appropriatecompensation would be paid where a farmer or landowner wasdispossessed.It was explained that provision for such compensation would beinserted in any legislation, but it had been thought preferable notto go into this in the statement, which was designed to deal only with general principles.(e) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs hoped thatin working out the policy steps would be taken to ensure that land-owners could be required to provide adequate equipment for the farms which they owned.(/) The Lord President said, with reference to paragraph 7of CP. (45) 273, that, while every effort would be made to include in the legislative programme for the 1946-47 Session the legis-lation necessary to implement this policy, no public promise shouldbe made that this legislation would be introduced in that Session.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the draft announcement of the Governmentsagricultural policy annexed to CP. (45) 273 and agreedthat the announcement should be made in Parliament onthe 15th November.(2) Invited the Minister of Food, in consultation with theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretaryof State for Scotland, to submit proposals to the lord presidents Committee for the improved marketing of fruit and vegetables.
Future of the 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignDepartment Secretary and the President of the Board of Trade (CP. (45) 271)of Overseas regarding the place of the Department of Overseas Trade in theTrade. machinery of Government.The proposals put forward in this memorandum were summarised as follows : (i) All overseas commercial staff, except the Trade Commis-sioners in Colonies and Dominions, should become an integral partof the Foreign Service.(ii) The Secretary of the Department of Overseas Trade should cease to be a Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office,and should become a &quot; Secretary for Overseas Trade &quot; responsiblesolely to the President of the Board of Trade.(iii) There should be an Inter-Departmental Committee on external Economic Policy and Overseas Trade, which should meet,regularly under the Chairmanship of the Secretary for OverseasTrade. This should be composed of Junior Ministers or senior officials representing the Foreign Office, Treasury, Dominions Office,India Office, Burma Office and Colonial Office.The Cabinet were informed that the Prime Minister was ingeneral agreement with these proposals.Points in discussion were : (a) With regard to the composition of the proposed Inter-Departmental Committee, the view was expressed that this was a.subject which could appropriately be handled by Junior Ministers;and it was agreed that the Committee should be composed of junior ministers.(b) The Minister of Labour asked that his Department shouldbe represented on the Committee.  This was agreed.Arrangements would be made to ensure that other interested departments were kept informed of the proceedings of theCommittee, and were given an opportunity of being represented at.discussions affecting their interests.(c) The question was raised whether the new Committee would report, on matters affecting the development of the export trade, tothe Industrial Sub-Committee of the Lord Presidents Committee.It was agreed that it would be more appropriate that the new,Committee should report, through the President of the Board ofTrade, to the Cabinet.(d) It was noted that, when this new Committee had beenappointed, it would be possible to discontinue the existingMinisterial Committee on Overseas Economic Policy.(e) It was suggested in the memorandum that responsibilityfor the Imperial Institute might be transferred to the Secretary ofState for the Colonies. It was pointed out that Burma, and to a lesser extent India, had contributed to the work of the imperial institute; and that there would be disadvantages in an arnange-ment implying that the Institute was concerned only with Colonialmatters. After discussion it was agreed that, as the imperial institute was primarily ia research institute, it would be more appropriate that the Lord President should be responsible for it,as for other research establishments.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals put forward in CP. (45) 271,subject to the points noted at (ia) to (e) above.(2) Asked the Lord President to arrange for the Prime Ministerto announce, soon after his return to this country, the changes summarised at (i) and (ii) above.
241CM. 52 (45),4. At their meeting on the 3rd September the Cabinet had invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to consider whetherit would be possible to bring to an end the rule of the Rajah of sarawak. The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (CP. (45) 268) reporting further developments in this matter.The Secretary of State for the Colonies explained that RajahBrooke had now intimated his intention to provide for the cession of the State of Sarawak to His Majesty. It was, however, neces-sary that he should first approach the Asiatic members of theSupreme Council of the State in order to secure their consent tohis proceeding with this policy and concluding the necessary agree-ment. It was proposed that his Private Secretary, accompaniedby a senior official of the Colonial Service, should proceed at anearly date to Sarawak for the purpose of obtaining this consent.Rajah Brooke also desired that, at a later stage, he should himselfpay a last visit to Sarawak. The Secretary of State recommendedthat these proposals should be approved.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked that the treasury should be consulted at an early stage of any negotiations for the cession of Sarawak. The financial arrangements should be suchas to ensure that Rajah Brooke was not left in possession of monieswhich ought to be applied towards the reconstruction of Sarawak.The Secretary of the State for the Colonies said that the ColonialOffice would not enter into any firm commitments on this aspect of the matter without first consulting the Treasury.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that Sarawak was within the area of operational command of the Australian Forces;and suggested that the Australian military authorities should beinformed in advance of the impending visit of the Rajah&apos;s emissary.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Secretary of State for the Colonies tofacilitate Rajah Brooke&apos;s intention to cede Sarawak toHis Majesty; and invited him to proceed with the con-clusion of a fresh agreement for this purpose as soon asthe Rajah had obtained the consent of his Councillorsin the territory.(2) Agreed that meanwhile Rajah Brooke should continue tobe recognised as the Rajah of Sarawak.&apos;3) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to consult with the Chancellor of the Exchequer regarding thefinancial aspects of any new agreement.5. The Lord President recalled that at their meeting on the9th October the Cabinet had decided, after considering represen-tations made by the Trades Union Congress and the Miners&apos; Union,that on the Committee Stage of the National Insurance (industrial injuries) Bill an amendment should be moved to increase to 45s. aweek the basic rate of injury benefit and 100 per cent, disablementpension. The group of Government supporters interested in this bill had been suggesting that this basic rate should be raised to55s. or 60s.; but, as a result of discussions which they had had with ministers, they had agreed that they would not press this suggestion.Further representations had now been made, however, on behalf ofthe miners by Mr. Arthur Horner and Mr. William Lawther, whomaintained that it would be impossible to raise coal production tothe desired level if further concessions were not made on this bill. They had asked for an opportunity to put their representa-tions to the Prime Minister.
Two questions thus arose. First, should any further conces-sion be made ? Secondly, should the Government, having previouslydiscussed the position with the Trades Union Congress, afford anopportunity for separate representations to be made on behalf ofthe Miners&apos; Union ?On the first question the Cabinet agreed that no further con-cession should be made. Discussion turned on the question whetherit would be expedient to give the representatives of the Miners&apos;Union an opportunity of putting their case to Ministers. On theone hand, it was pointed out that the Governments discussions withorganised labour in respect of this Bill had been conducted throughthe Trades Union Congress; and that the Congress would take exception to attempts by sectional interests subsequently to conductseparate negotiations. It would be specially unfortunate if theGovernment made any concession after receiving a deputation froma sectional interest. On the other hand, it was represented that thefeeling in the coal-mining industry was not good; and that, althoughthe failure to secure increased production was not connected withdisappointment at the provisions of this Bill, it might be inexpe-dient as a matter of tactics to decline to give the representatives ofthe Miners&apos; Union an opportunity of putting their case. TheMinister of National Insurance recalled that at an earlier stagehe had received deputations on this Bill on behalf of the miners; and said that he would welcome the opportunity which a further depu-tation might afford of explaining the supplementary benefits to be conferred by the Bill, over and above the basic rate of 45s.After discussion it was agreed that the proper course would beto invite the Trades Union Congress to send a deputation to put before Ministers the suggestions which were now being made onbehalf of the Miners&apos; Union. This would give the miners an oppor-tunity to put their case, while maintaining the principle that discussions between the Government and organised workers about this Bill were conducted through the Trades Union Congress.In further discussion reference was made to the need for more active steps to disseminate information among workers regardingthe actual proposals in this Bill. It was suggested that the TradesUnion Congress might be asked to consider the circulation of aleaflet setting out in detail the benefits which would be conferred by the Bill. It was also suggested that, as soon as the Bill had been passed, the Minister of National Insurance should give a broadcasttalk about its provisions.In this connection the Foreign Secretary suggested that moreuse should be made of Trade Union journals as a medium for communicating information about Government proposals. It alsoseemed desirable that there should now be a Trade Union journal forthe miners, who had in the past been less well-informed than other workers on matters of general public interest. Now that the Miners&apos;Federation had been replaced by a single Miners&apos; Union, there seemed no reason why such a journal should not be started.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no further concession should be made in response to demands for an increase in the basic rate of injury benefit and 100 per cent, disablement pension under the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Bill.(2) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the PrimeMinister, on his return to this country, to receive adeputation from the Trades Union Congress to hear the representations made on behalf of the Miners&apos; Union.(3) Asked the Minister of Labour to consider, in consultationwith the other Ministers concerned, whether more usecould be made of Trade Union journals as a mediumfor disseminating information regarding government policy and proposals.
Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.(previous reference:CM. (45) 51stConclusions,Minute 1.)Palestine.(previous reference:C.M.(45)40thConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The Cabinet were informed that it had now been decidedto postpone, until the week beginning the 26th November, the debate on foreign affairs previously planned for the 21st and22nd November. This postponement should avoid the need for afurther separate debate in relation to the Prime Ministers visit tothe United States.7. The Foreign Secretary said that the United StatesGovernment had now accepted the invitation to join with HisMajesty&apos;s Government in setting up a Committee of Enquiry toexamine the question of European Jewry and, in the light of thatexamination, to make a further review of the Palestine problem.While accepting that invitation, however, the United StatesGovernment had made it clear that they were not in full accord with the views expressed to them by His Majesty&apos;s Government onthe subject of short-term immigration into Palestine : and president truman had intimated that he still adhered to the views expressed on this aspect of the matter in the letter which he had addressedto the Prime Minister on the 31st August.The Foreign Secretary said that, in these circumstances, hecould not expect the United States Government to endorse the wholeof the statement which he proposed to make in the House ofCommons that afternoon on the Jewish question and Palestine.The text of this statement was then read to the Cabinet.The Cabinet were informed that immediately after this statement the Home Secretary would announce the scheme approved by the Cabinet at their meeting on the 6th November(CM. (45) 49th Conclusions, Minute 3), for the admission to thiscountry of a limited number of refugees from Nazi oppression. Itwas thought that the simultaneous announcement of this scheme might assist the reception, both in the United States and in theHouse of Commons, of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement on palestine.The Lord President said that the Government would no doubt be asked to find time for a debate on the Foreign Secretary&apos;sstatement. This demand would have to be met, though it was worth considering whether these matters could not be brought within thescope of the debate on foreign affairs which was to take place inthe week beginning the 26th November.The Cabinet Approved the terms of the statement on European Jewryand Palestine which the Foreign Secretary proposed tomake in the House of Commons that afternoon.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,Vitth November, 1945.
