1.   The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda :--CP. (45) 300 : by the Lord Privy Seal, submitting therecommendations of the Social Services Committee on proposalsfor changes in war pensions made by the Minister ofPensions; and cp. (45) 326: by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,dissenting from the recommendation that dependants5allowances should be paid in respect of the post-injury wife andchildren of a pensioner during periods when he was able towork.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Social Services Committeehad accepted the view of the Minister of Pensions that, if he wasto resist successfully the appointment of a Select Committee on warpensions, he must be able to announce substantial improvements inthe Royal Warrant. In examining the Ministers proposals, theCommittee had sought to reduce to a minimum the disparitiesbetween the rates payable under the war pensions scheme and ratesunder other schemes.Points in discussion were : &apos;(a) The Minister of Pensions said that he would have favoured an increase in the lowest rate of disablement pension from 40s. aweek to 50s. The ex-Servieemen&apos;s organisations were pressing for as much as  3 to  4 a week, and it should be remembered that the40s. rate had remained unchanged throughout the war. While thecost of living had risen by about 30 per cent, since 1939, the proposed increase in the rate of disablement pension would represent a rise of only 12-J Per cent. This would be compared with the much greaterincreases made in Service pay and allowances and in workmen :compensation rates. He believed that the conditions under which men served in the Forces justified a higher rate of pension for awar injury than for an industrial injury, and that there would beno more difficulty in justifying a disparity between the war pension rates and the industrial pension rates than between the industrialpension rates and the general rates under the National InsuranceScheme.The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of national insurance said that they could not agree to an increase in the lowestrate of disablement pension beyond 45s. The Government had had great difficulty in resisting the pressure in Parliament for a higher rate under the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Bill, andif a rate of 50s. were fixed under the war pensions scheme it wouldbe impossible to defend a rate of 45s. for the industrial pensioner.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he could not accept the proposal that allowances should be paid for the post-injury wife and children while the pensioner was able to work. Ifthis proposal were adopted it would be difficult to resist a similarconcession for the post-injury dependants of industrial pensioners.The Minister of Pensions said that, if a completely fresh starthad been possible, there might well have been a case for giving noallowances in respect of dependants while the pensioner was working. In fact, however, allowances were given for pre-injurydependants, whether the pensioner was working or not, and he found it impossible to justify different treatment for post-injurydependants.In further discussion there was general agreement that, whilethe exclusion from eligibility for allowances of all post-injurydependants would bear hardly on pensioners who, for good reasons,had postponed marriage until after their discharge from the Forces,it would be desirable to limit any concession to cases in whichmarriage had taken place within a period of ten years after the endof the war.War Pensions.(previous reference:W.M.(44)80thConclusions,Minute 9.)[31050]
Shipping.(Previous&apos;Bef erence:CM. (45) 29thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof War Transport (CP. (45) 299 and 324) and the First Lord of theAdmiralty (CP. (45) 325) regarding the control of British shippingafter February 1946 and the disposal of Government-owned shipping.The Minister of War Transport said that his proposals hadbeen fully discussed by the Lord Presidents Committee (L.P. (45)45th Meeting, Minute 3, and 46th Meeting, Minute 2). In the lightof those discussions, he had reconsidered the question of giving ship-owners another opportunity to acquire Government vessels on thebasis of their war losses before these vessels were sold to the highestbidder. While he felt that ship-owners had already had ample opportunity to acquire vessels on the basis of their war losses and while it must be understood that, if all the ship-owners concernedaccepted such an offer there would not be enough tonnage to goround, he was prepared to make a further offer on the lines suggested.He had also examined the possibility of selling Government-owned vessels to Indian ship-owners, and was willing to give Indian and dominion ship-owners an opportunity of acquiring Government-owned tonnage, provided that they would conform to the same conditions as were being imposed on British ship-owners, includingthe retention of Government control over the ships for some considerable period. He would settle the detailed arrangements withthe Secretaries of State for Dominion Affairs and for India.In discussion attention was drawn to the importance of avoiding the damage to British interests caused after the 1914-18war by the sale of British ships to foreign owners or by their transfer to foreign flags. It was thought essential that owners should be prevented from transferring ships to foreign flags in order to escape from the obligations imposed by this country with regard to wagesand conditions of service of crews, or to profit by the shippingsubsidies offered by other countries.The Minister of War Transport said that he was fully alive tothese dangers and thought he had adequate powers to prevent them.He would, however, look further into the question whether anythingneed be done to secure the continuance of his powers in peace-time.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals made in CP. (45) 299, subject tothe modifications which the Minister of War Transport had agreed to make as a result of the discussions in the lord presidents Committee and on the understanding that hewould satisfy himself that he had adequate powers toprevent the transfer of British ships to foreign flags.(c) The Minister of Pensions said that, subject to the approvalof the Cabinet, he proposed to present to Parliament before christmas a White Paper setting out the new rates. There was noquestion of this being debated before the Christmas Recess.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Pensions, after consulting theChancellor of the Exchequer, to submit to the social services Committee proposals for limiting the paymentof allowances in respect of post-injury wives andchildren to cases in which marriage had taken place within ten years from the end of the war.(2) Subject to (1), approved the proposals in CP. (45) 300 and authorised the Minister of Pensions to present a white paper to Parliament setting out the new rates.
3. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster recalled that attheir meeting on the 3rd December the Cabinet had approved inprinciple, subject to agreement by the Chancellor of the exchequer on the use of dollar tonnage, a proposal to divert to Germany up to200,000 tons of wheat now being loaded for the United kingdom on the east coast of the United States to the extent to which suppliesof wheat in replacement could be loaded on the west coast. Treasuryconsent had been obtained for the use of the dollar tonnage involved;but it now appeared that delay in procuring wheat for loading atwest coast ports would prevent shipments from the east coastreaching Germany in time to relieve immediate needs. The presentposition was that only 60,000 tons of wheat were to be shipped for germany during December from east coast ports in the UnitedStates; and, taking account of stocks, wheat supplies in the british zone of Germany at the 1st January, 1946, could not be higher than85,000 tons, which represented only ten days&apos; consumption. Theother measures discussed by the Cabinet at their meeting on the3rd December could not be expected to produce results during thenext few weeks; and there was urgent need of supplementary actionto meet the immediate requirements of the British Zone.The Minister of Food said that the position had been reviewedthat morning, in consultation with the Departments primarily concerned. To meet immediate requirements he was prepared tomake available 50,000 tons of national flour from the United Kingdom.25,000 tons of barley from the United Kingdom.16,000 tons of United States white flour, now afloat, to be diverted to Germany.If the shipping could be provided, these supplies should begin toreach Germany before the end of December and delivery would be complete before the end.of January.He was also prepared to ship a further 25,000 tons of barleyfrom the United Kingdom during January, and to divert to Germany30,000 tons of United States white flour which was now being boughtfor shipment in January.By these means he would be able to provide 96,000 tons of flourand 50,000 tons of barley, equivalent to nearly 150,000 tons of wheatat the German rate of extraction.The Minister of War Transport said that this offer wouldinvolve his finding shipping for an additional 100,000 tons of flourand barley. He would do his utmost to provide the shipping-required.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the supplies which the Minister of Food had now offered to make available should meet the requirements of the British zone of Germany until towardsthe end of February 1946. It was, however, desirable that theCabinet should hold a further review of the supply position for germany up to the end of June 1946.The Prime Minister said that he proposed to arrange for afurther appreciation of the wheat position to be submitted to theCabinet, taking into account, not only supplies to Germany, but thepossibility that wheat might have to be supplied to India to meetdeficiencies of rice there and in South-East Asia.The Cabinet-(1) Took note .of the statement by the Minister of Foodregarding the additional supplies of flour and barleywhich he proposed to make available for shipment toGermany before the end of January 1946.(2) Invited the Minister of War Transport to do his utmost toprovide the shipping required to convey these additional supplies to Germany.(3) Took&quot; note that the Prime Minister would arrange for afurther appreciation to be submitted to the Cabinetregarding the supply of wheat for Germany during thefirst half of 1946.&quot;
UnitedNationsEducational,scientific and cultural organisation.DraftConstitutionof theOrganisation.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Education (CP. (45) 307) containing the text of theconstitution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and cultural Organisation, which had been drawn up at the Conferencerecently held in London. The entry into force of the draft constitution was dependent on its formal acceptance by twentyGovernments.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should proceedwith formal acceptance of the draft constitution.(2) Took note that the Minister of Education would present a white Paper giving, with a short introduction, the text of the constitution, the Final Act of the Conference andthe instrument establishing a Preparatory Commission.5. The Foreign Secretary recalled the Cabinefs discussion onthe 20th November regarding the disposal of some 220 Spaniardswho had been taken into custody by Allied troops during the advanceacross France in 1944 and were now detained in a prisoner of warcamp in this country. He reported that the French Governmenthad now agreed to the return of these men to France at the rate of10 a week, which they hoped to raise later to 20 a week.The Secretary of State for War asked that, meanwhile, heshould be authorised to arrange for those remaining in this countryto be treated in all respects in the same way as the ItalianCo-operators.The Home Secretary said that it would be necessary for him toretain sufficient control over these men to enable him to compel themto leave the country when their turn came.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Foreign Secretary.(2) Agreed that while they remained in this country these men should be treated in the same way as ItalianCo-operators, subject to the retention of such measureof control as was necessary to secure that they could be compelled to leave the country when their turn came.Cabinet Office, S.
