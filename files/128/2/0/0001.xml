United States 1.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the bases in Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. (45) 261) reportingIceland. that the United States Government had been unwilling to adopt our(Previous suggestion that the bases which they required in Iceland should reference: be secured on a short lease as a temporary measure pending the cm. (45)36th coming into force of the security provisions of the United NationsConclusions, Charter. They were pressing their demand for a long-term lease,Minute 2.) and the Icelandic Government had asked for an expression of our views. His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Reykjavik had been instructedto inform them that we welcomed the proposal that United states forces should continue to occupy bases in Iceland; that we assumed that such occupation would, in due course, be brought under theinternational security system provided in the United nations charter; but that meanwhile it seemed natural that an arrangement should be made by bi-lateral agreement between the Icelandic and united States Governments. It would, however, be difficult for usto maintain this line if the Soviet Government adopted a hostileattitude towards this American initiative in Iceland or demanded,as a counter move, a long-term lease of bases in Denmark or Norway.The Foreign Secretary proposed that, in that event, we should advise the Governments of Denmark and Norway to invoke the procedureprovided in the United Nations Charter and to refuse to negotiatebi-laterally with the Soviet Government. We should then modifyour attitude towards the American demand in respect of Iceland,and should renew the proposal that the United States Governmentshould be content for the time being with a short-term lease of thesebases.In discussion, there was agreement with the view that fresharrangements for bases should, as a general rule, be made withinthe framework of the security provisions of the United nations charter. This procedure should certainly be advocated in respectof any Russian demand for bases in Denmark and Norway, whichwere already members of the United Nations Organisation. Theviews which we had already expressed to the Icelandic Governmentwere not inconsistent with such a policy, as Iceland was not yet amember of the United Nations; but, if the Soviet Governmentopposed the American initiative in Iceland, this would give us anopportunity to repeat our suggestion that long-term arrangementsfor bases in Iceland should be made as part of the internationalsecurity system under the United Nations Organisation, and thatthe Americans should accept as an interim arrangement a short-term lease of these bases.The Cabinet Endorsed the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposals,paragraph 4 of CP. (45) 261.is outlined inPrisonersof War.Billeting ofGermanPrisoners ofWar on Farms.(previous reference:C.M.(45)33rdConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour and National Service (CP. (45) 209) asking that, pending the submission of the further proposals which he hadbeen asked on the 18th September to put forward on the general question of the employment of prisoners of war, immediateauthority should be given to billet a small number of german prisoners of war on farms, on an experimental basis.The Cabinet were informed that the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries was in favour of this proposal.The Cabinet-Agreed that arrangements should be made forthwith tobillet a limited number of German prisoners on farms, asproposed in paragraphs 1 (5) and 13 of CP. (45) 172, onthe understanding that there should be the same security precautions as had been applied to the billeting of italian prisoners on farms.
Civil Defence. 3.   At their meeting on the 23rd August the Cabinet had(Previous       invited the Home Secretary to review the question of maintaining aEeference:      nucleus of the local organisation for Civil Defence.   The CabinetCM. (45) 25th   now had before them a memorandum by the Home SecretaryConclusions,    (CP. (45) 246) reporting that, after consultation with the LordMinute 2.)      President, he proposed to defer submitting detailed proposals forthe future organisation of Civil Defence until further study hadbeen given to the effects of the atomic bomb and of intensive air-raids on enemy territory.  Meanwhile, it was necessary that, on theSecond Reading of the Bill suspending certain provisions of theCivil Defence Acts, some statement should be made to encourage the retention of some of the local experience and organisation whichhad been built up in Civil Defence during the war.The Cabinet-Authorised the Home Secretary to make a statement on thegeneral lines indicated in paragraph 5 of CP. (45) 246.Victory 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeCelebrations. Secretary (CP. (45) 243) proposing the appointment of a small committee of Ministers to supervise the organisation of officialVictory celebrations.In discussion, reference was made to the loss of productioninvolved by such celebrations. During 1945 there had already beenfour days&apos; holiday to celebrate the end of hostilities in Europe andthe Far East. Was it necessary that further celebrations shouldbe held, at any rate during the coming winter, when the loss of evenone day&apos;s coal production would have serious consequences?It was the general view of the Cabinet that official Victorycelebrations should be held, though they could be postponed untilthe spring of 1946, and the possibility of holding them on a Sundaymight be considered.Arrangements should be made for representative contingentsof Dominion and Colonial troops to take part in the militaryprocessions. The possibility should also be considered of arranging for the Allied Forces to be represented.It was agreed that the Dominions Office, Colonial Office and ministry of Works should be among the Departments to be broughtinto consideration in the planning of the Victory celebrations.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would appoint a small committee of Ministers to formulate plans for officialVictory celebrations, and to supervise the detailed arrange-ments which would subsequently be worked out by one ormore committees of officials.Newfoundland. 5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary(Previous 0f State for Dominion Affairs (CP. (45) 234) outlining his proposalsEeference: for enabling the people of Newfoundland to decide their futureW.M. (44) 161st form of government.Minute lin&apos; TAe Secretary of State for Dominian Affairs said that he had it in mind that &quot;in the spring of 1946 there should be elected aNational Convention of Newfoundlanders, whose duty it would beto review the alternative courses open to the Island, and to make recommendations to His Majesty&apos;s Government as a basis for anational referendum. The first step would be to send out from thiscountry an expert adviser, who could give adequate guidance on constitutional forms and procedure. It was desirable that he shouldbe accompanied by a Treasury representative, so that there could bemade available to the Convention a full and objective statement on the financial and economic situation.  Newfoundland was at
present in a favourable financial position, but this resulted largely;from war-time circumstances and it was doubtful how well the island would fare under normal conditions. There was little prospect of our being able to find the. dollars required for recon-structiori and development in Newfoundland, and in presentcircumstances Canada would not be willing to finance recon-struction in the Island. There were, however, indications that public opinion in Newfoundland was moving towards the idea of union with Canada; and, although the initiative must be leftentirely with Newfoundland, the Secretary of State thought it important that nothing should be said to discourage this movementof opinion. In his view, union with Canada was the natural destinyof Newfoundland.In discussion the following points were raised :  (a) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said thatbusiness and financial interests had in the past obtained undueinfluence in the management of the Island&apos;s affairs, and special care should be taken to ensure that the proposed National convention was so constituted as to reflect the true interests of the Islanders.It might be advisable to provide that candidates for election to theConvention should be persons resident in the area which they wereto represent.The Prime Minister said that, even if such a requirement were imposed, he feared that the business and financial interests mightsecure an unduly large representation in the Convention. Havingregard to the special conditions obtaining in Newfoundland, hewondered whether it would not be preferable to discard the geographical basis of election, and to devise an alternative methodof election by various groups of workers and other interests in the island. Alternatively, the two methods might be combined, some members of the Convention being elected on a geographical basis,and others as representing particular sections of the Islandcommunity. He believed that, unless some such measures were adopted, the interests of the Islanders themselves would not beproperty represented in the Convention.(b) The Minister of Health raised the question whether it was appropriate that a change in the status of Newfoundland shouldbe considered by the Parliament at Westminster alone. Would it not be more appropriate that the report of the proposed convention should be considered in the first instance by some Imperialconference including representatives of the other Dominions 1The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs undertook toconsider this suggestion, though he thought it unlikely that dominion Governments would wish to be associated with thediscussion of a problem which was of special concern to one particular Dominion.(c) The view was expressed that it ought not to be assumed atthis stage, without further discussion, that Newfoundlands ultimatedestiny lay in union with Canada. Canada was subject to strongeconomic influence from the United States, and her future develop--ment could not be predicted with certainty. - Nor should it beassumed, without further enquiry, that there was no possibility of new foundland^ being so developed as to become economicallyindependent. For these reasons some Ministers wished to reservejudgment on the question whether Canada should be encouraged to absorb Newfoundland.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that thisquestion would not arise in the immediate future, and would not inany event arise in the form of a compulsory change of status. Therewas no question of Canada&apos;s assuming any responsibility forNewfoundland unless the initiative came from the Newfoundlanders^themselves.
(d) In paragraph (7) of CP. (45) 234, the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs had stated that he wished to reserve for thepresent the question of remitting Newfoundland^ guaranteedsterling debt of about  17 million, but suggested that it might befound desirable for the United Kingdom Government to remit thisdebt as their contribution to any settlement of the constitutionalissue which might be achieved.The Chancellor of the Exchequer reserved his opinion on thispoint. If Newfoundland sought union with Canada, it might be reasonable that Canada should take over this sterling debt as partof the settlement.(e) In Appendix A of CP. (45) 234, the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs had submitted the draft of a statement which hewould propose to make in Parliament about the procedure suggested for enabling Newfoundlanders to choose their future form ofgovernment.In discussion, it was pointed out that a statement of this lengthwas certain to provoke a demand for a debate; and it would be convenient if the draft statement could be substantially shortened.The Cabinet (1) Expressed general approval of the proposals outlined in cp. (45) 234.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to give further consideration to the points noted at (a) and (b)above, and to consider means of shortening the draft statement contained in Appendix A of CP. (45) 234.(3) Agreed to defer a final decision on this matter until theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs had submitted afurther memorandum embodying the results of Conclu-sion (2) above.Man-Power. 6.   The  Cabinet  considered a memorandum by the LordLabour President of the Council (CP. (45) 260) on the future of labour controls.        controls.The Lord President of the Council said that this question had been considered by the Industrial Sub-Committee of the lord presidents Committee (L.P. (I) (45) 2nd Meeting, Minute 1) on thebasis of a report by officials, a copy of which was annexed to cp. (45) 260. The Sub-Committee were satisfied that a long-term policy for a planned distribution of man-power could be applied only by means of a rational and effective wages policy. Theimmediate problem was, however, to secure the labour needed for essential industries during the next six to nine months. The Sub-Committee, while they were agreed that the Essential Work orders should remain substantially unaltered, had not been able to reachagreemeent on the future of the other two main forms of labourcontrol, namely, direction of labour and the Control of EngagementOrder. He had accordingly set out in paragraph 3 of CP. (45) 260five alternative courses which might be adopted.There were very serious difficulties in maintaining and effec-tively enforcing the whole of the existing system of labour control,since no real attempt had been made to educate the public on theneed for their retention and the mass of the workers not unnaturallybelieved that with the end of the war there would be substantialrelaxations. But if such relaxations were made, it Avould beimpossible to control the distribution of the labour force and itmight, for example, be found in a few months&apos; time that owing to labour shortages in the building materials industries, the housing programme was being held up, while at the same time building workers were unemployed. He doubted whether it would be wise to adopt the compromise of releasing from controls all workersover the age of 30 except those in certain essential industries(alternatives (iii) and (iv) in his memorandum), and he felt that
the choice must lie between the enforcement of the whole system ofcontrol, coupled with a campaign to educate the public as to theneed for this (alternative (v)), and the relaxation of control overworkers over the age of 30 without exceptions (alternative (ii)).The Minister of Labour and National Service pointed out that,even though other labour controls were relaxed, some nine million workers would remain subject to the Essential Work Orders. Duringthe war, when the Government could appeal to the patriotism ofthe workers and when workers were in the main being directed intoindustries where the wages and conditions of work were favourable,it had not been possible to enforce labour controls with the fullrigour of the law. In present circumstances the controls were becoming increasingly ineffective. He was, therefore, in favour of releasing from control all workers over the age of 30, subject to oneor two exceptions, and supplementing this limited control by improv-ing conditions in those industries to which it was desirable to attractlabour in the national interest.In further discussion the following points were raised : (a) The problem of securing a proper distribution of labour would become progressively easier with the release of large numbersof men from the Forces. What the Government had to consider,therefore, was a short-term policy designed to meet the difficultiesof the immediate future.(&amp;) It was represented that the release from control of all workers over 30 would make it impossible to secure the necessaryoutput of coal or to carry out the housing programme. In manuf ac-turing industry, also, it was important that power should be retainedto direct workers to essential industries and to prevent their beingattracted into luxury trades.(c) Although it might be impossible to enforce the controls on all workers, there was in fact a very large majority of. workers who would accept labour controls without question. It wassuggested that for this reason it would be worth retaining the controls even though they could not be enforced in all cases.id) Workers would be more easily attracted to essential indus-tries if they could be given an assurance that the firms in which theywere being offered employment had orders covering a relatively long period. It was, therefore, desirable that long-term orders covering,say, a period of 18 months to two years should be placed for housing components.(e) A solution of the wages problem in the building industry should be sought by developing the system of payment by resultsand exploring the possibility of working longer hours during thewinter by the use of artificial light.(/) A vigorous policy of improving the conditions (e,.g., by theextension of the use of canteens) in less attractive industries, shouldbe pursued.(g) Consideration should be given to the possibility of increas-ing the mobility of labour by improving the rates of lodgingallowances.(h) The Essential Work Orders should be retained, since they provided an effective sanction against unreasonable conduct by employers, and their withdrawal would lead to industrial disputes.(*) While the problem of making wages and conditions of workmore attractive in the essential industries must be tackled, therewould be grave objection from the point of view of the preventionof inflation to any policy which stimulated a series of wage increases in these industries. There were also grave dangers in adopting any policy which would involve the Governments taking an active partin determining wage rates. On the other hand, it might be that theexisting machinery for settling wages questions was working tooslowly in some industries and the Minister of Labour should look into the question of expediting the application of the provisions ofthe Wages Councils Act, 1945, to those industries where there wasno adequate machinery for the effective regulation of wages.
(;&apos;) If the Minister of Labour and National Service were enabled to keep in close touch with his colleagues when wages claims werebeing discussed, he might often be able, without direct intervention,to promote reasonable settlements and so to avoid the more extremeclaims which were apt to be put forward when there was a break-down of negotiations.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that it seemed to be generally agreed that it would be politically imprac-ticable to announce at the present time a policy of maintaining andenforcing the whole of the existing system of labour controls,. Atthe same time, it appeared to be the general view of the Cabinetthat it would be expedient to defer a decision to relax these controls.A substantial increase in the flow of man-power from the forces might go a long way towards meeting the labour requirements ofthe essential industries, without full enforcement of the existing system of control. Alternatively, before a policy of rigorouslyenforcing the controls was adopted, there should be an intervalduring which an intensive effort should be made to bring home tothe public the need for full control of labour in order to secure a proper distribution of man-power. Advantage should also be taken of this interval to study other means of attracting labour into theindustries in which it was most urgently required.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that for the time being no change should be madein the existing system of labour controls.(2) Invited the Lord President to arrange for this problem tobe further examined, in the light of the points which hadbeen raised in the course of the discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,1st November, 1945.
