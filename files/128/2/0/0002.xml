Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet discussed the arrangements for the Debate in debate on the House of Commons on foreign affairs on the 7th November.Foreign Affairs. It was agreed that on this occasion there should be an oppor-tunity, after the opening speech by the Leader of the Opposition,for the House to express their views before a Government spokes-man intervened in the Debate. There would, therefore, be no needfor any Government spokesman other than the Foreign Secretary,who would speak at what he considered to be the most appropriate moment during the course of the afternoon.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (45) 265).The Foreign Secretary said that he had informed the ItalianGovernment in September, with the authority of the Cabinet,that the repatriation of Italian prisoners from this country would begin as soon after the end of this year&apos;s harvest as transport was available. It was important, from the point of view of british policy towards Italy, that arrangements should be made for theearly repatriation of substantial numbers of Italian prisoners. ITeasked that instructions should-now be given to ensure that at least3-4,000 were repatriated during November or before the middleof December 1945, and that repatriation should proceed thereafterat a regular rate.The Minister of A grictdture and Fisheries said that he couldnot agree that this movement should begin until the end of the potato harvest; but he was willing that 3,000 Italian prisonersshould be made available for repatriation at the beginning ofDecember and a further 2,000 in the middle of that month. Arrange-ments for the withdrawal of these numbers from agriculture were already in hand.The Minister of War Transport confirmed that these numberscould be transported to Italy; and the Secretary of State for Warsaid that there was no military objection to their removal from thiscountry.The Foreign Secretary said that his point would be met if thearrangements mentioned by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries were carried out.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for War to ensure, in consul-tation with the other Ministers concerned, that arrange-ments were made for not less than 5,000 Italian prisonersof war to be repatriated before the end of the year,beginning in December; and that repatriation should thereafter proceed at a regular rate.The Foreign Secretary asked that further consideration shouldbe given to the possibility of retaining some Italian prisoners ofwar, who would otherwise be repatriated, for continued employmentin this country on a contract for wages. He had reason to believethat substantial numbers might be willing to remain here on this basis. He had it in mind that, if such a scheme could he worked out, it might be announced at the time when the Terms of Surrenderfor Italy were modified.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service toarrange for a Committee of officials representing theDepartments primarily concerned to examine thepossibility of arranging for the continued employmentin this country, on a contract of service, of italian prisoners of war who would otherwise be repatriated.Prisonersof War.repatriation of ItalianPrisonersof War.(previous reference:C.M.(45)33rdConclusions,Minute 2.)Employmentof Italianex-Prisonersof War onContract ofService.
Refugees. 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Home Secre-Admission of tary (CP. (45) 263) outlining a scheme for the admission to the distressed United Kingdom of a limited number of refugees from NaziPersons to oppression  \e.g.,  survivors from German  concentration  camps,the United persons who had been hiding from the Gestapo, and other distressedKingdom. persons in need of special care) who had relatives in this countryable and willing to look after them.The Home Secretary said that the Home Office was beingflooded with applications on behalf of these refugees it was estimated that the applications received represented somewherebetween 1,500 and 2,000 cases a week and that it would beimpossible for this country to meet all the claims which were beingmade on its hospitality, tie had thought, however, that it would-be right to grant asylum in this country to some of these people ifit were possible to differentiate in favour of limited classes withspecial claims. He had therefore devised the special categoriesset out in paragraph 2 of his memorandum; and he proposed thatthere should be a public announcement making it clear at the outset that all applications falling outside these special categories wouldbe refused.Points in discussion were : -(a) The proposal (paragraph 2 (c) of CP. (45) 263) to admit the parents or grandparents of persons in this country would leadto the admission of a number of elderly people who would be non-productive and might become a burden on the community.It was explained that none of these applications would begranted unless the Home Office was satisfied that the applicant inthis country was able and willing to maintain his relatives.(b) The proposal (paragraph 2 (d) of CP. (45) 263) to admitmale children up to the age of 18 and female children up to the ageof 21 would involve a permanent addition to the foreign populationcompeting in the employment market with British subjects.As against this, it was said that the British people had inthe past derived more benefit than harm from a liberal policy towards the admission of foreign refugees.(c) More generally, it was suggested that the admission of afurther batch of refugees, many of whom would be Jews, might provoke strong reactions from certain sections of public opinion.There was a real risk of a wave of anti-Semitic feeling in thiscountry. There was evidence of this in the recent protest of rate-payers against the foreign colony in Hampstead.On the other hand, it was pointed out that this protest hadprovoked an effective counter-protest. Public opinion was dividedon this question, and it was not to be assumed that the extremeattitude taken by certain newspapers represented a majority view.It was unfortunate that more prominence was not given to the contribution which had been made by foreigners in this country in industry and in other walks of life.(d) Public feeling was more easily aroused because of thetendency of foreigners to congregate in colonies.The Foreign Secretary said that, if the scheme proposed in cp. (45) 283 were adopted, there would be advantage in making it a condition of admitting some of the younger people that theyshould work for a period in agriculture. The system by whichearlier ^ refugees had been required to work on the land beforemigrating to Palestine had been successful; and the Departmentsconcerned might examine the possibility of devising a similar schemefor some of those admitted for permanent residence in this country under the present proposals. Such an arrangement would have theeffect of spreading- the immigrants more widely throughout thecountry, and would also secure that too many of them did not seekopenings in commerce.(e) The President of the Board of Trade said that he presumed that this scheme would not prejudice the proposals which he had put forward for bringing over to this country individuals with
221cm. 49 (my.special technical and scientific qualifications whose presence herewould be of advantage to British industry. The Home Secretaryconfirmed that the scheme would not prejudice those proposals.(/) The Secretary of State for Air asked whether it wouldbe open to any of the 18,000 foreigners in the Royal Air Force tosubmit applications on behalf of their relatives under this scheme.The Home Secretary said that there was nothing in the scheme toprevent such applications being made.(g) In paragraph 7 of CP. (45) 263 it was suggested that, ifthis scheme was approved, the United States Government should beinformed and invited to consider the introduction of a correspondingscheme in the United States.The Foreign Secretary said that, while he did not suggestthat the adoption of this scheme should be made conditional uponcorresponding action by the United States Government, there wouldbe a better prospect of securing such action if the proposal were put to the United States Government before we announced our intentionto bring such a scheme into operation in this country.The Home Secretary said that, in view of the Parliamentarypressure to which he was subject, he could not defer making anannouncement beyond the 15th November. The Foreign secretary said that he would make an immediate approach to the UnitedStates Government and might be able to ascertain their views before that date.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that,while approval could be given to the general principles of the scheme outlined in CP. (45) 263, it appeared to be the general view of theCabinet that great discretion should be exercised in its adminis-tration. Public opinion was apprehensive of substantial additions to the foreign population, and great care should be taken to avoidarousing any wave of anti-Semitic feeling in this country.The Cabinet -(1) Approved the proposals put forward in CP. (45) 263,subject to examination of the suggestion recorded in(d) above.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to make an immediate com-munication to the United States Government, explaining the proposals which we had in mind and asking whetherthey would be prepared to introduce a correspondingscheme in the United States.(3) Took note that, in order to give the Foreign Secretary anopportunity of ascertaining the views of the UnitedStates Government, the Home Secretary would defermaking a public announcement of the scheme until the15th November.Naturalisation 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum on this subjectPolicy. (CP. (45) 255) by the Home Secretary.The Home Secretary explained that during the last five years the grant of British nationality by naturalisation had been generally suspended. There ought, in his view, to be no longinterval between the end of hostilities and the restoration of thenormal practice of dealing with applications of naturalisationwithin such limits as were practicable. He therefore proposedto announce that as soon as the necessary staff was available thegrant of certificates of naturalisation would be resumed; that consideration would be given first to those applications which hadbeen submitted before the policy of suspension was announced inNovember 1940; that it would take no less than two years to dealwith those applications and that, when they had been disposed of,
applications received after November 1940 would be dealt with,not in the order of their submission, but according to the lengthof time for which the applicants had resided in this country.In discussion doubts were expressed about the wisdom of deferring applications received after November 1940 until the,500 applications received before that date had been dealt with,especially if there was no possibility of disposing of these earliercases in under two years. The rigid application of such a rule would involve postponing for a long time a number of very deservingapplications which both on their own merits and in the national interest ought to be granted.The following particular points were also raised : (a) Would it not be possible to give special facilities to some ofthose who had served in the Armed Forces during thewar? The same facilities need not necessarily be givento all persons with any record of service in the Forces.It might, for example, be possible to exclude those whohad served in the Pioneer Corps (many of whom hadenrolled only to escape internment) and those who hadenlisted and done all their service abroad. The possi-bility of relying on some form of recommendation fromthe Service authorities might also be considered.(b) There was was general agreement that early consideration should be given to applications by persons who had established valuable businesses in this country, particu-larly in the development areas. Reference was made to cases in which business men were precluded fromtravelling abroad to develop our export markets becausethey had not been naturalised.The Home Secretary said that even now applications were taken up if a Government Department certified thatit was in the national interest that the applicant shouldbe naturalised. It was the general view of the Cabinetthat this practice should now be extended to cases wherea Government Department certified that the applicantsbusiness was of substantial value to the country.(c) Would it not be possible to reduce the period of two years which would be required to dispose of the 6,500 applica-tions received before November 1940 ? Would it assistthe Home Office in dealing with these applications moreexpeditiously if one or more Advisory Committees were established similar to those which had assisted in theadministration of Defence Regulation 18B ?(d) Some regard should be paid to the nature of the work whichthe applicant intended to take up. There was no advan-tage in naturalising people who were likely to followoccupations of little value to the community.It was suggested that, when an application was granted, the Home Office should inform the Ministry ofLabour and National Service in order that the applicantshould be subjected to the various labour controls which applied to British subjects.The Home Secretary said that, while he would do all in his power to expedite the work on the applications received before november 1940, he could hold out little hope of any substantial reduction in the period required to clear off these cases if the very necessary work of enquiry was to be done properly. He did not thinkit would be fair to deal with applications received after November1940 without giving those persons an opportunity to apply who hadbeen considerate enough not to submit their applications during thewar, and he was afraid that if any general invitation to submitapplications were given now the machine would become hopelesslyclogged. He would, however, consider what might be done to meetthe points raised in the Cabinets discussion in such a way as to
ensure that consideration would be given during the next two years to really deserving cases, both among those who had applied in theperiod after November, 1940, and those who might apply hereafter.The Cabinet Agreed that the grant of certificates of naturalisationshould be resumed, and invited the Home Secretary toconsider, in the light of the points made in discussion, how the specific proposals outlined in CP. (45) 255 should be modified so as to secure greater flexibility in administration.5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs (CP. (45) 266) outlining a policy forgiving further assistance to the new Greek Government in thereconstruction of Greece.The Foreign Secretary proposed that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should be sent at once to athens in order to put to the new Greek Government theprogramme outlined in CP. (45) 266. The principal features ofthat scheme were as follows : (i) An offer would be made to attachBritish advisers to the Greek Ministries concerned with the recon-struction of the Army, finance, railways, roads, distribution and supplies, (ii) We should offer assistance in regard to the import programme, concentrating on imports likely to get the Greekeconomy working, rather than on consumption goods. (iii) Weshould do what we could to strengthen U.N.R.R.A. in Greece,(iv) We should advise the issue of a lottery loan, with a view toabsorbing surplus purchasing power and providing the GreekGovernment with the drachmae which they required. In return forthis assistance, we should expect the Greek Government to under-take the programme set out in paragraph 9 of CP. (45) 266.The Foreign Secretary said that the basis of this policy was toassist the Greek Government in economic, rather than political,matters. We must measure the amount of assistance we could afford to give to Greece; but it would pay us to spend rather more over thenext six months in re-establishing the Greek economy if thatenabled us to spend less on the maintenance of British troops in greece during the ensuing period.Points in discussion were : (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer supported the proposals made by the Foreign Secretary. Substantial assistance could begiven to the Greek import programme, on the lines suggested : asum of  5 million, out of our total contribution of  80 million for relief purposes, had been earmarked for supplies to Greece and similar countries. There was no case for a financial loan, as Greeceheld nearly  40 million in gold, dollars and sterling, which repre-sented large reserves for a country of her size. The real difficulty was her inflationary condition : the amount of money in circulationfar exceeded the supply of goods : and it was for this reason thathe supported the proposal for a lottery loan in order to absorb someof the surplus purchasing power.(b) The Minister of State said that hitherto two factors hadlimited the effectiveness of U.N.R.R.A.&apos;s work in Greece. First, thestaff there had not been fully up to the job. Some improvements hadalready been made in the British staff; and it was desirable that changes should also be made in the United States staff. Secondly,transport facilities were inadequate. Assistance with transport would produce very substantial improvements in the situation.(c) The Foreign Secretary asked that the President of the Boardof Trade should give sympathetic consideration to requests for theexport of steel rails from this country to Greece if they could notbe obtained from the United States.Greece.(previous reference:CM. (45)21stConclusions,Minute 4.)
(d) The Secretary of State for War asked whether paragraph 4of CP. (45) 266 implied that further military advisers should besent to Greece in addition to the Military Mission already there.The Foreign Secretary explained that he was not suggesting any increase in the number of the British military advisers : what he desired was to secure that the development of the Greek Army was brought into line with the general economic approach which he nowwished to make towards the problem of Greek reconstruction.(e) Was there any assurance that, if this further assistance wasgiven, the position in Greece could be restored ? The foreign secretary said that, while he could not guarantee that this policy would succeed, we could not at this stage withdraw and must makea further effort to get Greece on to her feet. This was the best policywhich he could devise for this purpose.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals outlined in CP. (45) 266.international labour conference:26th Session.(previous reference:W.M.(44)50thConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour and National Service (CP. (45) 238) to whichwas annexed a draft White Paper indicating the action which HisMajesty&apos;s Government proposed to take in respect of the sevenrecommendations adopted by the International Labour Conferenceat its 26th Session held at Philadelphia in April-May 1944.The Minister of Labour said that the recommendations fell into three groups, viz. : (i) social security; (ii) social policy independent territories; and (iii) employment. So far as social security was concerned, the White Paper suggested that decisions on the recommendations should be deferred for the time beingpending the establishment of the national health service and social insurance schemes which were now under consideration in thiscountry. With regard to social policy in dependent territories, thegeneral principles set forth in Part I of the Annex to theRecommendation could be accepted as being in conformity with thepresent policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government; and Colonial Govern-ments and the Government of Burma had generally agreed that itshould be the aim of policy to introduce the minimum standards setforth in Part II of the Annex as quickly as circumstances permitted.On the subject of employment, he proposed that the Govern-ment should accept the recommendations with the reservation that since a Royal Commission was inquiring into the problem of equal pay for both sexes, the Government could not subscribe to that partrelating to the encouragement of &quot; the establishment of wage rates on the basis of job content without regard to sex/&apos; The recom-mendations concerning the employment services and the national planning of public works were in accordance with our employment policy.In discussion, the following points were raised : (a) Might not the acceptance of recommendation 73, whichrelated to a national plan for public works, be inconvenient if itimposed on His Majesty&apos;s Government an obligation to report ontheir long-term development programmes ?It was suggested that this obligation would be met by a generalreport relating to public works. Valuable statistics on thissubject had been collected in the past by the International LabourOrganisation.(&amp;) Attention was drawn to the danger that the InternationalLabour Organisation, in dealing with employment policy, might betrespassing on matters more appropriate to other international organisations. In particular, it would be one of the primary dutiesof the Economic and Social Council to take action in the promotion of full employment. There was need for some consultation betweenthe Departments concerned on this question of duplication betweenvarious international organisations, established or proposed.
The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Labour and National service to issue a White Paper in the form of the draft annexed to CP. (45) 238 indicating the proposals of the Govern-ment with regard to the recommendations adopted by theInternational Labour Conference at its 26th Session.(2) Invited the Minister of State to arrange for the Depart-ments primarily concerned to consider means of prevent-ing duplication between the various international bodies which were already in existence or were to be established under the United Nations Organisation.7.   The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (subse-quently circulated as CP. (45) 270) setting out theinstructions which it was proposed to give to the repre-sentatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the financial negotiations in Washington; and(ii) a memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade(subsequently circulated as CP. (45) 269) showing the stage which had been reached in the discussions on commercial policy.After the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of theBoard of Trade had supplemented the information given in thesememoranda, the Cabinet agreed to adjourn discussion of the issues raised to a special meeting to be held later in the day.Cabinet Office, S.
