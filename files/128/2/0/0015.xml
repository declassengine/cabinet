Parliament.SelectCommitteeon offices of profit under theCrown.(previous reference:CM. (45)30thConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Lord.President (CP. (45) 336) proposing the appointment of a SelectCommittee to deal with a number of cases in which Members ofParliament appeared to have exposed themselves to the risk ofdisqualification by retaining offices or places of profit.The Lord President said that the Lord Chancellor and the LawOfficers had considered these cases and, while they inclined to theview that the Members were not disqualified, they had felt that theproper course was to appoint a Select Committee to investigate the position.    The Committee should be appointed as soon . aspossible, as the Members concerned had been advised to abstain fromattending Parliament until the Committee had reported.   Afterconsultation with the Clerk of the House, he suggested that theterms of reference of the Select Committee should be as follows : &quot; That a Select Committee be appointed to consider anycases which may be brought to their notice of Members of this house who may have been incapable of election to this Houseby reason of the fact that at the time of their election they heldoffices or places of profit under the Crown within the meaning of Section 24 of the Succession to the Crown Act, 1707, and toreport whether any such Member was on that account incapable of election to this House;  and if so what course should beadopted in any such case.&quot;In discussion there was general support for the proposal thata Select Committee should be appointed to consider these cases andany others which might subsequently come to light. It was, however,suggested that further consideration should be given to the possi-bility of amending the law so as to bring it into line with modern conditions. Recommendations to this end have been made by theSelect Committee on Offices or Places of Profit under the Crown,which had reported in 1941. Was it not desirable that legislation should now be introduced to give effect to those recommendations?The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Lord President to make arrangements forthe appointment of a Select Committee to investigateparticular cases of possible disqualification for election to Parliament by reason of the holding of an office or place of profit under the Crown(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to consider and report to theLord Presidents Committee on the possibility of intro-ducing legislation to implement the recommendations ofthe Select Committee of 1941 on Offices or Places of profit under the Crown.National 2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordInsurance Privy Seal (CP. (45) 331) reporting the results of the furtherScheme. consideration which had been given, in the light of the Cabinets(Previous discussion on the 6th December, to the problems relating to the reference: payment of unemployment benefit and the rate of retirement pension.CM. (45)60th j&apos;]le i,oT(i Privy Seal said that the Ministers to whom these conclusions, problems had been referred had not been able to reach completeMmute 4.) agreement on the question whether there should be a time-limit onthe duration of unemployment benefit, and he had, therefore, set outthe opposing arguments in paragraph 2 of CP. (45) 331. As regardsretirement pensions, they had agreed to recommend a rate of 26s. aweek for a single person, on the understanding that any pressure to increase this rate when the Bill was before Parliament wouldbe resolutely resisted, and that the Bill would specifically provide that after a period of five years the rates of contribution would beincreased in order to meet some part of the increasing burden of retirement pensions. As a consequence of the higher rate of retire-ment pension proposed, it had been agreed that the inducementfor deferred retirement should be an increase of Is. a week for a
single person and 2s. a week for a couple for each six months bywhich retirement was postponed.Discussion turned primarily on the question whether unemploy-ment benefit should be continuous or subject to a time-limit.It was urged, on the one hand, that the imposition of an automatic time-limit on the duration of benefit would mean that,after an unemployed man had exhausted his right to insurance benefit, he would receive further payments only after some form ofenquiry into his needs. The imposition of such a condition on menwho were unemployed for long periods through no fault of their owncould not be justified. While, therefore, there might be a good case for transferring the burden of maintaining these men from theInsurance Fund to the Exchequer, this transference should not involve the imposition of a greater disability. The problem of married women, seasonal workers and other classes who could not properly be regarded as within the employment field, could be dealtwith separately by regulations, and it was right that it should beso dealt with rather than by the application of an automatic time-limit to all cases.On the other hand, it was argued that the principle should bemaintained that insurance benefit was paid automatically to anyclaimant who satisfied the necessary conditions, and that if no time-limit were imposed it would be impossible to maintain this principle.Moreover, while there was possibly room for some amendment of theconditions on which assistance would be given after the right to benefit was exhausted (for example, it might be possible to provide that assistance should be payable at the insurance rate so long asthe claimant could prove that he needed any assistance at all), theCabinet should not accept without further examination the proposi-tion that after the right to benefit had been exhausted assistance should be payable without any regard whatever to need.After a full discussion, The Prime Minister said that the pre-ponderant view in the Cabinet was that the National Insurance Billshould provide for a time-limit on the duration of unemploymentbenefit. At the same time, however, the Social Services Committeeshould examine further the question of the conditions on whichclaimants would be entitled to assistance after the exhaustion oftheir right to benefit, with a view to the submission to the cabinet of a statement which the Minister of National Insurance might make on this point when the Bill was before Parliament.Other points in discussion were : (a) It was suggested that when the Bill was before parliament the Minister, of National Insurance should be authorised to statethat the Government would look with favour on the provision ofspecial pension schemes in certain industries where the workersnormally found it necessary to retire at an earlier age than thatwhich was general throughout other industries. It was not suggested that any promise should be given of a financial contri-bution to such schemes from the Exchequer; but it would be helpful if an assurance were given that those responsible for such schemes would be able to make use of the administrative machinery of theNational Insurance Scheme.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he saw no difficultyin putting this administrative machinery at the disposal of existingspecial schemes, but he was doubtful about extending this offer tofresh schemes, since he was most anxious to avoid giving any encouragement to premature retirement. Other Ministers pointedout, however, that it might, prove desirable to initiate new schemesof this kind in some of the heavy industries, e.g., in coal-mining,and there was no logical basis for discriminating between existing and new schemes.It was the general view of the Cabinet that this assurance could not be limited to existing schemes. The Minister of national insurance was invited to consult with the Chancellor of the
Exchequer regarding the terms in which the assurance should &quot;begiven.(b) The Secretary of State for India expressed apprehensionabout the effect of the proposal to award substantial increases ofpension to persons who deferred their retirement. Under the present proposals a man who had been able to remain at work until theage of 70 would be entitled to a very much higher rate of pensionthan his neighbour who, because his health had been less good or his occupation more exacting, had been obliged to retire at theage of 65. The resulting inequalities would in the end give riseto pressure, which it would be difficult to resist, to raise the generalrate of old-age pensions to the higher level.(c) The Lord President drew attention to the recommendation in paragraph 68 of the White Paper on Employment Policy(Cmd. 6527 of 1944) that the rates of contribution under theNational Insurance Scheme might be varied in sympathy with thestate of employment. He had hoped that the necessary powers for this purpose would have been included in this bill the Minister of National Insurance said that this proposalraised considerable difficulties, since, if the actuarial basis was tobe maintained, any reductions made would have to be offset by corresponding increases. The matter had not been examined by theSocial Services Committee and it might be desirable that the Com-mittee should examine it before any final decision Avere taken.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the National Insurance Bill should provide fora limit of 30 weeks on the payment of unemploymentbenefit, with extensions for contributors with goodemployment records.(2) Invited the Social Services Committee to consider what changes might be made in the conditions for the receiptof assistance by unemployed persons who had exhaustedtheir title to benefit, with a view to the submission to theCabinet of a draft statement which, the Minister ofNational Insurance might make when the national insurance Bill was before Parliament.(3) Approved the payment of retirement pensions to singlepersons at the rate of 26s. a week on the understandingthat any pressure for an increase in this rate when theBill was before Parliament would be firmly resisted.(4) Agreed that the inducement to postpone retirement shouldbe an increase of Is. a week for a single person and 2s.a week for a couple, both of pensionable age, for eachsix months by which retirement was postponed.(5) Agreed that the initial rates of contribution for Class Ishould be 4s. lOd. from the employed man and 4s. 2d.from the employer, and that the Bill should specificallyprovide that after a period of five years these rates would rise to 5s. and 4s. id., corresponding rates being fixed for women and persons in Classes II and IV.(6) Invited the Social Services Committee to consider the pro-posal that provision should be made in the national insurance Bill for varying the rates of contribution in sympathy with the state of employment.(7) Subject to (1) to (6) above, authorised the Minister ofNational Insurance to proceed with the preparation ofthe National Insurance Bill on the lines proposed in cp. (45)315.
3. The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons during thefollowing week.4. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that agree-ment had now been reached with the French Government on thequestion of withdrawing British and French troops from the LevantStates, and on a Statement of British and French aims in the middle east.British and French military experts were to meet on the21st December to draw up a detailed programme for the evacuation of British and French troops by stages, beginning at a very earlydate. This programme would provide for maintaining in the levant sufficient forces to guarantee security until such time asthe United Nations Organisation had decided on the organisationof collective security in this zone. For the time being the FrenchGovernment would retain forces re-grouped in the Lebanon. Thetwo Governments would invite the Governments of Syria and the lebanon to appoint representatives to discuss the dispositions tobe jointly agreed upon as a result of this decision and the measuresto be taken to enable the Governments of the Levant States to dis-charge their duty of maintaining order.The agreement on British and French aims in the Middle east would declare that the two Governments were animated by the sameintention to ensure the independence of the Levant States and were agreed that it was in their mutual interest to promote, in collabora-tion with other Governments, the economic well-being of the peoples of this region in conditions of peace and security. Each Govern-ment would disavow any intention of doing anything to supplantthe interests or responsibilities of the other in the Middle East, andthe two Governments would undertake to examine in this spiritany proposals submitted to the United Nations Organisation on thesubject of collective security.The Foreign Secretary said that he proposed, subject to theviews of the Cabinet, to sign the two agreements at noon that day,and to make ah announcement to Parliament and the press at 3 p.m.regarding the successful conclusion of these discussions. He read to the Cabinet the text of the two agreements and of the communiquewhich he proposed to issue to the press.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the agreement which had beenreached with the French Government on these questions.5. The Prime Minister said that he had seen the Leader of theOpposition and Mr. Eden and had explained to them the reasons why the Cabinet had thought it would be a mistake to invite Parlia-ment to pass Motions of Gratitude thanking by name the principalleaders of the British and United States Forces during the war.Mr. Churchill and Mr. Eden were still, however, very anxious that parliament should pass some Motions expressing gratitude to namedwar leaders. In order to meet the objections taken by the Cabinetto the draft Motions which they had previously proposed (Annex of CP. (45) 328) it was now suggested that the Motions of gratitude to British Commanders might be so phrased as to express Parlia-ment&apos;s gratitude to &quot;all the principal Commanders of HisMajesty&apos;s Navies, Armies and Air Forces represented by &quot; a list of nine principal leaders, three from each Service. Under this formulathe names would be included merely as representative names, andthe Motion would be so worded as to cover all the principal Com-manders, including those from the Dominions. There would be aseparate Motion of Gratitude to American Commanders.
In discussion the view was expressed that, if the Governmentbrought forward or supported a Motion on these lines, there would-be difficulty with some of the Dominions, because of the omission of specific reference to Dominion Commanders. It was also thoughtthat there would be criticism of the omission of any reference to aCommander concerned with the operations in Burma. Finally, some government supporters would be opposed in principle to accordingto named Commanders a special mark of appreciation in additionto the thanks which Parliament had already expressed to membersof the Forces       whole.It was the view of the Cabinet that the Prime Minister should send a reasoned reply to Mr. Churchill conveying the Cabinets viewthat it was not in the public interest for him to pursue this proposal.for Motions of Gratitude thanking individuals by name. If, inspite of this, the Opposition tabled Motions on these lines, theGovernment should not afford facilities for them to be debated.The Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to send a letter to the leader of the Opposition urging him not to proceed further withhis proposal for Motions of Gratitude thanking by nameprincipal Commanders of the British and United states forces during the wai&apos;.coal . 6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofCoal Industry Fuel and Power (CP. (45) 329) covering a draft of the Coal Industry(Nationalisa- (Nationalisation) Bill and a supplementary memorandum (CP. (45)tion) Bill.       337) on the same subject.(Previous The Minister of Fuel and Power explained that the mainReference:       features of this scheme for nationalising the coal-mining industryCM. (45) 18th   had already been considered by the Lord Presidents Committee, by conclusions,     the group of Ministers directly concerned with the socialisation of minute 5.)      industries and also by another special committee of Ministers.   Inaddition, he had discussed the financial provisions with the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer.   As a result of all these discussions, he believed there was general agreement with the Bill now presented tothe Cabinet.The Bill provided for the setting up of a National Coal board with clearly defined functions, operating under the general directionof the Minister of Fuel and Power. It was his intention that theBoard should consist of a full-time Chairman and eight full-time members, each with special competence in particular aspects of theindustry for instance, the commercial, technical and welfare sides and labour matters.The assets to be transferred to the Board included both the undertakings themselves and also ancillary undertakings. Theterms of compensation for the undertakings themselves would besettled by a tribunal which was to consist of Lord Greene,Mr. Justice Cohen and an accountant chosen by agreement betweenthe Government and the Mining Association. The terms of refer-ence of this tribunal had now been agreed with the Association,and the tribunal would be able to get to work at once.The ancillary undertakings would be taken over in some casesautomatically and in some cases at the option either of the board or of the owners. Compensation would be assessed on the basis of value in an ordinary commercial transaction between a willingbuyer and a willing seller.The Bill provided for safeguarding the public interest by theestablishment of two Consumers&apos; Councils, one for industrial con-sumers and the other for domestic consumers. Two separate councilswere proposed, as a single Consumers&apos; Council would not have beenable to develop the same corporate spirit which he hoped the two separate bodies would acquire. Both Councils would be able tonegotiate with the Board and also to make representations direct
to the Minister. The utility of the Industrial Consumers&apos; council was obvious, and he hoped that the Domestic Consumers&apos; council would also act as a check on the Board both as to the price and thequality of coal.It was proposed to transfer the Coal Commission to the coal board, and certain adjustments would be made in the independent status of the Miners&apos; Welfare Commission.The Bill did not in terms deal with reorganisation within theindustry. This process would be lengthy and would involve con,siderable expenditure, estimated by the Reid Committee at  150millions, spread over a period of years. The Board were givenpowers to borrow up to this total from the Treasury.The Bill provided for payments to undertakings during the interim period between the vesting date and the completion of valuation for compensation. During this period the undertakingsmust have funds&apos; to meet their commitments to creditors and share-holders. It had, therefore, been agreed with the owners that for two years after the vesting date they should receive an annual pay-ment equivalent to half the profits earned during a previous period.This would be in substitution for the interest which they would havebeen entitled to receive on the amounts of compensation when finally determined.The Bill was based on the assumption that the industry mustpay its own way. In order to do so it must meet its current expenses and interest and amortisation on the compensation payments or, inthe initial years, the interim payments to undertakings. TheMinister estimated that the outgoings of the industry would amountto some  7 millions a year, including amortisation charges, and thatthe interim payments would amount to about  2 millions. Thesefigures compared with present profits of about  14 millions. Thus,at existing prices and wages and without any of the advantagesexpected from reorganisation, it should be possible for the industryto pay its way and even to make some small price reductions.The Bill would not cover retail distribution. This wouldrequire further consideration after the production side had beennationalised.Points made in discussion were : (a) It was essential to get the services of the best possible men for the National Coal Board, as upon them would largely dependthe success of this most important measure.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer was not sure that the Bill,as drafted, made sufficiently positive provision that the Board&apos;programme of capital expenditure on development must receive the specific approval of the Government. This was important fromthe point of view of Government planning of capital expenditure;and he would like to discuss this matter further with the Ministerof Fuel and Power.(c) The Minister of ITeaUh drew attention to the proposal thatthere should be an obligation on the Board to pay over to the Govern-ment funds to meet interest and amortisation on stock issued to owners as compensation. One of the problems of the industry wasto remove the feeling among the workers that they were working tomake profits for the owners and, while he did not object to the sub-stance of the proposal, he suggested that, for psychological reasons,it was important to avoid any suggestion that under the new dis-pensation miners would still be working to provide payments to theowners to compensate them for their former profits. After discus-sion, it was suggested that a verbal amendment might be made to clause 20 (1) (a) so as to avoid directly linking the payments to bemade by the Board to the Government with the compensation paidto the owners.(d) The Lord President drew attention to the fact that the Billmade no provision for compensation to displaced employees.    The
Board would have power to pay compensation where they considered it desirable, and he was sure that it was right not to impose a statu-tory obligation on them. There might, however, be criticism onthis point.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals submitted in CP. (45) 329 and 337for legislation for the nationalisation of the coal-miningindustry, subject to further consideration of the points noted at (b) and (c) above.(2) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to submit a revised draft of the Bill for detailed examination by the Legisla-tion Committee.(3) Agreed that the terms of reference of the compensationtribunal, as set out in C P. (45) 337, should be announced in a White Paper to be presented at the same time asthe Bill.7. The Cabinet considered a suggestion that some additionalleave should be given to the Civil Service at Christmas.It was recognised that any general closing of government offices for the whole of the Christmas week would be impracticablefrom the point of view of public business and would have embarras-sing repercussions in industry. At the same time it was desirablethat senior members of the Civil Service who had been working under great pressure should be encouraged to take a reasonablebreak at Christmas.The Prime Minister said that, unless urgent business arosewhich could not be postponed, there would be no meetings of theCabinet and its Committees during Christmas week.The Cabinet-Agreed that all Ministers in charge of Departments should instruct their Permanent Secretaries to see that, with thefewest possible exceptions, senior officials. took a week&apos;sholiday at Christmas. No general publicity need be givento this decision.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Civil Aviation (CP. (45) 332) covering a draft of a white Paper on the future organisation of British air services, andoutlining the interim arrangements which he proposed to make,pending legislation, for operating air services other than thosewhich could be run by the British Overseas Airways Corporation.The Prime Minister pointed out that this memorandum had notbeen circulated to the Cabinet until the previous day, and ministers had not had much time in which to study the terms of the proposed white Paper. This would be an important pronouncement ofGovernment policy, and it was desirable that the Government should stand firmly to it once it was made. The Cabinet might, therefore,wish to have more time to consider the draft.Several Ministers said that they would welcome an opportunityfor further study of this memorandum.The Cabinet-Agreed to defer consideration of CP. (45) 332 until their meeting on Monday, the 17th December; and asked that ministers desiring to comment on these proposals should inform the Minister of Civil Aviation before the meetingof the points which they intended to raise.
9. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet thata comprehensive review of the pay and allowances of members ofthe Forces below officer rank had now been completed. A new and improved system of remuneration had been worked out by an inter-departmental Committee, whose recommendations had been con-sidered by the Ministers primarily concerned at meetings convenedby the Prime Minister. As a result of these discussions, a white paper had been prepared, setting out the new rates, and this wasto be presented to Parliament during the following week.The new rates were constructed round a basic rate of 42s. aweek for a two-star private. It was estimated that, when accounthad been taken of all that a man in the Forces received in kind, thisbasic rate was equivalent, in the case of a married man, to a civilianwage of 89s. a week. In drawing up the new rates, the opportunityhad been taken of greatly simplifying the structure of service pay and allowances.The Cabinet-Took note that a White Paper setting out the new ratesof pay for members of the Forces below officer rank wouldbe presented to Parliament in the following week.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,13*A December, 1945.service pay and allowances.(previous reference erence:W.M.(45)18thConclusions,Minute 9.)
