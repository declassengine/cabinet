Procedure 1.   The Prime Minister gave the Cabinet an account of the for the course of the discussions at the meeting of Foreign Ministers in preparation     Moscow.of Peace TJp to now these discussions had been concerned mainly withTreaties. the procedure for the preparation of Peace Treaties with the(Previous       ex-enemy States.  The Soviet Government were still maintaining the reference:      thesis, which they had advanced at the London meeting of theC.M.(45)35th   Council of Foreign Ministers, that the preparation of the TreatiesConclusions,     should be entrusted exclusively to the States signatory to the minute 1.)      armistice terms, other Allied Powers being invited subsequently to sign the Treaties.   This procedure would not be acceptable to dominion Governments; and the United Kingdom Government had consistently opposed it as being wrong in principle and likely to prove unworkable in practice.  The Prime Minister said that he had advised the Foreign Secretary not to give way on this point.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the action taken by the Prime Minister in thismatter.The United States Government were putting forward at moscow the proposal that the Peace Treaties should be consideredby a Conference, broader than the Council of Foreign Ministers andrepresenting the Powers which had made a substantial military contribution towards the Allied victory. M. Molotov was urging that the number of States to be represented at such a conference should be reduced and was pressing, in particular, for the exclusion of India on the ground that India was not a sovereign State and hadnot an independent responsibility in matters of foreign policy. Heargued that, if India were invited to such a Conference, he wouldhave to claim that invitations should be extended to the three baltic states. Mr. Byrnes would apparently be prepared to acquiesce inthe exclusion of India, but was opposed to the inclusion of the BalticRepublics. The Foreign Secretary was disposed to insist on theinclusion of India, but had asked whether the Cabinet would beprepared to accept in return the inclusion of the three BalticRepublics. Alternatively, would they agree that India should be excluded from the Conference, provided that the Ukraine andByelo-Russia were also excluded ?In discussion there was general agreement that, in view ofIndia&apos;s contribution to the victory and the extent to which she hadbeen separately recognised in international affairs since 1919, there could be no question of our acquiescing in her exclusion from theproposed Peace Conference. The Cabinet could not accept thealternative solution, favoured by Mr. Byrnes, of excluding India inreturn for the exclusion of the Ukraine and Byelo-Russia.Discussion then turned on the question whether we need objectto the inclusion of the Baltic Republics among the States to beinvited to the proposed Peace Conference. It was the general viewof the Cabinet that there was no serious objection to making this concession, if it proved necessary in order to secure the inclusion ofIndia in the proposed Peace Conference-though it was recognisedthat such a concession might subsequently make it necessary for usto recognise the inclusion of the Baltic Republics within the soviet union.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs recalled, however,that in connection with the recognition of the separate States of theUkraine and Byelo-Russia we had promised Dominion governments that we would not agree to similar treatment of other federal unitsof the Soviet Union without prior consultation with them. Weshould, therefore, explain the position to Dominion governments and should, if possible, give them an opportunity of expressing theirviews before we agreed that the Baltic Republics should be included among those to be invited to the proposed Peace Conference.[31200] b 2
The Cabinet (2) Invited the Prime Minister to inform the Foreign secretary that in the view of the Cabinet it was essential that india should not be excluded from the proposed PeaceConference; but that, subject to prior consultation with dominion Governments, he was free to agree to theinclusion of the three Baltic Republics if he consideredthat such a concession was necessary in order to secure agreement to the inclusion of India.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toexplain the position to Dominion Governments and as certain their views on the question of including thethree Baltic Republics among the States to be invited tothe proposed Peace Conference.Japan. 2.   The Prime Minister said that at the meeting of ForeignBritish Ministers in Moscow agreement was being sought between the threeCommonwealth Powers on the composition of the Allied Council in Tokyo. It hadRepresentation previously been suggested that more than one member of the Britishon Allied Commonwealth might be represented on this Council; and theCouncil in Governments of both Australia and India had been anxious to obtainTokyo. separate representation.   The Foreign Secretary had now reportedthat there was little prospect of securing separate representation for both the United Kingdom and Australia and even less chance ofsecuring separate representation for India. In the circumstances he was proposing to say that he would recommend to his Govern-ment and to the interested Dominion Governments that there shouldbe a single British member on the Council, who would jointlyrepresent those parts of the British Commonwealth (includingIndia) whose forces might participate in the occupation of Japan.In discussion there was general agreement with the line whichthe Foreign Secretary was proposing to take. It would probably be convenient that all the Governments of the Commonwealth(including India) should be represented on this Council by Australia.The Cabinet Agreed that the interests of the British Commonwealthmight be represented on the Allied Council in Tokyo by asingle British member who, in view, of Australia&apos;s closeinterest in this area, might be nominated by the australian government.National 3.   At their meeting on the 18th October the Cabinet hadHealth Service, agreed that the proposals for the future organisation of the hospital service should be considered in detail by the Social Services Com-mittee.   The Cabinet now had before them : (i) a memorandum by the Minister of Health (CP. (45) 339)submitting his general proposals for a National Health Service; and(ii) a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland(CP. (45) 345) explaining the application of these proposals to scotland.(previous reference:CM. (45)43rdConclusions,Minute 1.)The Minister of Health said that he had felt it right that hisscheme for the hospital service should be presented to the social services Committee in the wider framework of his proposals forthe health service as a whole; and the Committee had approvedthese proposals. He drew attention to the provision which he had made for the decentralisation of the hospital service by the creationof regional hospital boards and local hospital management com-mittees; and pointed out that the assignment of the health centresto county and county borough councils would make it easier forthe work of the centres to be correlated with the activities in the
clinics which would remain the responsibility of these localauthorities. The proposals set out in Part IV of the appendix to CP. (45) 339 would, he believed, secure an even distribution of doctors over the country without involving direct control from theMinistry of Health; and the proposed basis of remuneration for doctors should eliminate the worst features of the capitation ratesystem and lead eventually to a full-time salaried service. He had explained to Government supporters in Parliament who were interested in non-orthodox forms of medicine why such forms couldnot at present be made a part of the National Health Service; andhe had been able to persuade the Labour Members of Parliamentwho wei&apos;e doctors to accept his proposals for the remuneration of doctors, although they had originally pressed strongly for a full-time salaried service.The Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotlandsaid that his Secretary of State was in full agreement with thegeneral scheme put forward by the Minister of Health, although in its application to Scotland it would have to be modified in oneor two respects. For example, the ambulance service in scotland would be associated with the hospital service instead of being a function of the major health authorities; and the health centreswould, as proposed in the White Paper (Cmd. 6502), be the direct responsibility of the Secretary of State. During the war theDepartment of Health for Scotland had run a number of hospitalsdirectly, and on the basis of this experience the Secretary of state was confident that a State hospital service was feasible in Scotland.The Lord Privy Seal said that, although the proposals had beenapproved by the Social Services Committee, he doubted whether, inview of the difficult negotiations which - would have to be under-taken, it would be possible to pass the necessary legislation in thecurrent Session. The Government had already found it impossibleto adhere to their original programme for the National insurance bill, and it would be unfortunate if the time of parliamentary counsel and of Parliament were wasted on legislation which, inthe event, had to be postponed until the following Session. he also pointed out that no guarantee could be given that the supple-mentary legislation referred to in paragraph 7 of CP. (45) 339 couldbe passed in the 1946-47 Session.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he wasin general agreement with the proposals of the Minister of Health.He hoped that the Minister would give special attention to theimprovement of the general practitioner service through the pro-vision of greater facilities for post-graduate training, and wouldtake steps to reduce to a minimum the inducements to general prac-practitioners to engage in practice outside the public service. He also attached importance to the proposal, made in paragraph 51(e) ofthe Appendix to CP. (45) 339, that specialists should be enabled to see their private patients in hospitals and to admit them topay-bed accommodation, and thought that if a scheme on theselines could be developed it would be right to prohibit specialistsemployed in the public service from carrying on private work innursing homes.Further discussion turned mainly on the question whether, inview of the amount of opposition which the proposals were likelyto excite, the time which would necessarily be consumed in nego-tiations with the various interests, and the further consideration which would have to be given to the financial implications of theproposals, there was a reasonable prospect of passing legislation to give effect to this scheme in the current Session.The Lord President said that, while he did not seek to re-open the Cabinets decision to approve in principle the proposals regarding the hospital service, he must reaffirm the misgivingswhich he had expressed when that decision had been taken. Therewas bound to be very strong opposition, not only from the voluntary hospitals but also from the local authorities, and when this was
added to the opposition which would be provoked by other elements in the scheme \e.cj., the transfer of certain health services frommetropolitan borough councils to the L.C.C, or from district councils to county councils), the difficulties which would face the Minister ofHealth would be very formidable indeed. He was also concerned about the financial aspects of the proposals. Neither the chairmen of the regional hospital boards nor their prinicipal officers would beappointed directly by the Minister of Health, and they would be tempted to press for more and more lavish expenditure at the expenseof the Exchequer, particularly since there would be no contribution from the rates to provide an incentive to local economy. The figures given in Part VII of the Appendix to CP. (45) 339&quot; showed a verylarge transfer of liability from the ratepayer to the taxpayer and.judging by what had happened after the transfer of hospitals fromboards of guardians to county and county borough councils, therewas likely to be a sharp rise in expenditure once the hospitals hadbeen taken over by the State. In view of the weight of oppositionto be expected, the Minister would, in his view, be well advised to spend some time in negotiating with the interests concerned before embarking on the actual preparation of the Bill.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he was generally in favour of the proposals, he must reserve his position on their financial aspect. Although the total expenditure was not greatly in excess of the total given in the White Paper presented by the Coalition Government, the new proposals involved a verylarge transfer of liability from the ratepayer to the taxpayer, andhe could not agree to them without first examining them as part ofthe whole question of the financial relations between the Exchequerand local authorities. He was not satisfied with the existingformula for distributing the block grant and had intended to reviewit with the object of increasing the amounts allotted to the poorerauthorities. It might, however, be difficult to make a re-allocation of this kind if, at the same time, he had to rechrce the block grant to anything like the extent required to compensate the exchequer for such a large shifting of the burden from local rates as was involved in these proposals. He could not, therefore, be committed to the proposals until he had obtained a more accurate estimate ofthe amounts involved and had been able to consider the distributionof the burden betAveen the taxpayer and the ratepayer in connectionwith the whole financial relationship between the Exchequer andlocal authorities. In any event, it seemed to him essential that thereshould be very close financial control by the Health Departments andthe Treasury over the regional hospitals boards and that an efficientsystem of comparative costing should be set up.The Home Secretary supported the views expressed by the lord president. He was convinced that the proposals would excite very strong opposition, not merely from voluntary hospitals, but also from local authorities. With regard to finance, he pointed out thatthe hospitals element in the existing block grant was relatively small, and that there would be the greatest possible difficulty in getting the local authorities to agree that the block grant shouldbe. ad justed on account of the transfer of this service by more than this existing amount.The Minister of Health said that, in his view, it was important that the National Health Service Bill should be passed during thecurrent Session, so as to enable him to bring the new service intooperation concurrently with the new scheme of national, insurance.He had been led to believe that if his proposals were submitted tothe Cabinet in December it would be possible for him to give instruc-tions to Parliamentary Counsel immediately, with a view to havingthe Bill ready for introduction in February; and he must press for authority to give instructions forthwith for the drafting of the Bdl.If the Cabinet approved his proposals, his intention was to enterinto negotiations with the interests concerned on the basis that allthe main features of the proposals must stand and that any
concessions made should be such as could be put into effect in b a-administration.   He could not go forward on these lines, howeverjunless he were assured of firm support from the Cabinet.So far as finance was concerned, he was prepared to enter into negotiations on the understanding that he would not hold out any hope to local authorities of a net reduction in their rate burden as aresult of the transfer of hospital services to the State. although his scheme would undoubtedly meet with considerable opposition,he believed that the hospital service proposals would be favourablyreceived by many members of the medical profession and would tendto diminish their general antagonism. He also believed that some,at least, of the local authorities would favour them; and that,although they would be strongly opposed by the voluntary hospitals,the great majority of Government supporters, both in the countryand in Parliament, would welcome them with enthusiasm.The Joint Parliamentary JJnder-Secretary of State for Scot-land supported the Minister of Health. In Scotland, those localauthorities in which there was a Labour majority would not oppose the hospital service proposals and the only serious opposition was likely to come from the voluntary hospitals.The Prime Minister said that, while the Cabinet appreciated the difficulties of the Minister of Health, it was reasonable that theyshould have an opportunity of considering the legislative content ofhis proposals in the light of possible opposition, and it was desirablethat the Minister should submit to them the heads of the proposed legislation before Parliamentary Counsel began the preparation ofthe Bill. This would not involve any loss of time since he couldconcurrently embark on his negotiations with the local authoritiesand other interests.The Cabinet &apos;(1) Gave general approval to the proposals for a national health Service set out in CP. (45) 339 and 345 and authorised the Health Ministers to initiate negotiationswith the interests concerned.(2) Agreed that concurrently with these negotiations theMinister of Health should prepare the heads of theproposed National Health Service Bill and submit themto the Cabinet. A report should also be made to theCabinet, at the same time or subsequently, on the degreeof opposition disclosed by the negotiations.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the health ministers to report on the financial implications of these proposals, in the general framework of thefinancial relations between the Exchequer and the localauthorities, and agreed that pending consideration ofthis report the Health Ministers should not hold out any hope to local authorities that the proposed transfer ofthe hospitals service would lead to any net reductionin the rate burden.Review of 4.   In connection with the discussion recorded in the precedingBudgetary minute the First Lord of the A dmiralty said that he was concernedPosition. at the extent to which the Cabinet were discussing and approvingon their individual merits particular schemes involving substantialexpenditure, without having the advantage of relating thesefinancial commitments to any general picture of the budgetaryposition as a whole. He doubted whether the yield from a givenrate of taxation could be maintained at the high levels reachedduring the war years; and he asked whether the Treasury couldnot submit to the Cabinet an estimate of the total financial commit-ments involved in the projects which the Government proposed tobring forward during the present Parliament together with anestimate of revenue during that period.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Treasury had this point very much in mind, and he gave the Cabinet a broadindication of the probable course of revenue and expenditure on theassumption that the main projects involving heavy expenditure werebeing put forward during the early part of the lifetime of thepresent Parliament.The Prime Minister said that it would be desirable that theCabinet should review the general financial position in greater detailbefore the time came for the Chancellor to introduce his next Budget.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.20th December, 1945.
