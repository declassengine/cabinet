Parliament.(previous reference:CM. (45) 52ndConclusions,Minute 6.)Business inthe House ofCommons.general eisenhower.1. The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons duringthe following week.It was hoped that the Second Reading of the Building materials and Housing Bill would be taken on the 21st November. It wasagreed that the Minister of Works should open and that the Ministerof Health should reply to the debate.Owing to the prospective congestion of legislative business later in the month, it had now been decided that the debate on foreignaffairs should be held on the 22nd and 23rd November. It wasagreed that the Foreign Secretary should open, and the Minister ofState reply to, the debate on the first day, leaving the second dayfree for discussion of matters arising from the Prime Ministersvisit to Washington. The Prime Minister would speak during thecourse of the second day.The Ljord President informed the Cabinet that opposition leaders were considering whether they should table a Motion of grattitude to General Eisenhower and other Commanders. Hethought it right in this connection to inform the Cabinet that thesuggestion had been put to him by Sir Ralph Glyn, M.P., thatGeneral Eisenhower should be received by Parliament while he wasin this country at the end of November. The Lord President had thought it might be invidious to single out General Eisenhower forsuch an honour which had not been conferred on any other supreme commander; and the Prime Minister, whom he had consulted,shared this view.It was generally agreed that it would not be expedient thatGeneral Eisenhower should be formally received by Parliament. Itmight, however, be possible to arrange for him to be invited to adinner in the House of Commons attended by the Speaker and leading Members of both Parties. There were precedents foraccording such hospitality to distinguished foreigners, and an invitation of this kind would not, therefore, be open to the objection that it involved singling out General Eisenhower in preference toBritish Commanders. The Lord President undertook to discuss thissuggestion with the Prime Minister.2. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Lord President(CP. (45) 275) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (45) 278)regarding the proposals which had been worked out by a ministerial sub-committee of the Lord Presidents Committee for legislation on compensation and betterment.The Lord President said that the general principles of thescheme annexed to CP. (45) 275 had been laid down by a group ofMinisters appointed by the Lord Presidents Committee :  detailedW.M. (44) 136th proposals based on those principles had then been worked out by conclusions,     officials of the Departments concerned :  these proposals had been minute 2.)      further examined by the Ministerial group, and the final scheme was now submitted on their behalf to the Cabinet.   Full agreement had been  reached on all the proposed heads of legislation, except for thetwo following points : (i) The majority of the Ministerial sub-committee recommendedthat the basic rate of compensation for loss of development valueshould be 40 per cent, of the development value inherent in theland on the 31st March, 1939. The Chancellor of the Exchequerdissented from this recommendation. He urged that a decision onthe amount of compensation should be deferred. Valuation over,say, the next five years would provide further data on which itmight be possible to make a more exact assessment of the element of floating value and to judge what the true measure of compensa-tion should be.(ii) The majority of the sub-committee recommended that payment of all compensation for loss of development value shouldbe made, as a single operation, on a date to be fixed by the Treasury,Town and country planning.Compensa-tion andBetterment,(previous reference:
being a date not later than three years after the Bill had passed into law. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, on the other hand,recommended that compensation should be paid only as and whendevelopment was frustrated by refusal of permission to develop.The Lord President said that on both the disputed points he supported the majority view. It was the speculative element in development which had hitherto stultified planning. &quot;The object ofthe scheme recommended by the majority was to socialise develop-ment values by a single operation, so that thereafter the decisionsof planning authorities could be taken by reference to considerations of planning, rather than finance, and public acquisition of landcould be carried through on reasonable terms. He was satisfied thatthe difficulties which had made earlier planning legislation so largelyinoperative could not be overcome unless the problem of compensa-tion was dealt with boldly on the lines recommended in CP. (45) 275.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he favoured boldplanning and wished planning authorities to have full powers. Hewas, however, gravely concerned about the two points on which hedissented from the recommendations of the Ministerial Sub-Committee. The Governments programme for the present parliament included a number of important projects involving verylarge financial operations; but during this period the Governmentwould be confronted with a grave risk of inflation and economicinstability, and they would be able to make a practical success oftheir programme only if they showed proper prudence in finance.Yet, on these proposals for compensation, one of the biggestmeasures now in prospect, the Government would have to admit toParliament that they did not know, within a margin of error ofsome hundreds of millions of pounds, what the cost to the country would be. And these sums, the magnitude of which could not beestimated, were to be paid to landowners in respect of developmentvalues which in many cases would never have been realised. the basic rate of compensation proposed was 40 per cent.; but he doubted whether even 25 per cent, of the land in respect of which compensation was to be paid would, in fact, be developed.On the question of timing, it was proposed that thiscompensation should be paid in a single operation three years afterthe legislation had passed into law. There were grave inflationarydangers in translating into easily negotiable securities, at a singlestroke, development values which in the ordinary course would be converted gradually over a period of years and in some cases notat all. And it was difficult to imagine a worse moment for such an operation (which might cause a slump in gilt-edged securities andraise interest rates) than three years from the passage of theproposed Bill, when the present Parliament would be coming to anend and a General Election would be impending. He therefore recommended the alternative course of paying compensation as andwhen permission to develop was refused.The Minister of Town and Country Planning said that, whileit had not been possible to make a precise estimate of the cost of thepresent proposals, it was not the case that there was no limit to theamount of money which might be involved. It had been estimated in the Barlow Report that the value of development rights inundeveloped land in 1938 was about  400 million. In developedareas there was much less scope for changes from existing use; but,even if there was as much redevelopment value in developed areas as development value in undeveloped areas, the total for all develop-ment rights on the basis taken in the Barlow Report would be only 800 million. Even if a total figure of  1,000 million were assumed,the total limit of cost on a basic compensation rate of 40 per cent,would be about  500 million. He himself believed that the costof compensation under the present proposals would be somewherebetween  250 million and  500 million. Whether payment wasmade in a single operation, or as and when permission to developwas refused, that amount would in any event have to be found.  The
Chancellor of the Exchequer hoped that, if his method were adopted,the payment might be spread over a number of years. But would it be so spread in practice ? He believed that a very large majorityof those whose land had development value would apply at once for permission to develop in order to secure their right to compensa-tion. And under the existing law an application to develop whichwas not granted within two months was deemed to have been refusedand a claim to compensation would lie. If this forecast were correct,the method preferred by the Chancellor of the Exchequer would not prevent the simultaneous payment of large sums in compensation.And it would bring the whole planning machine to a standstill byreason of the large numbers of applications which would be made simultaneously for permission to develop land.The Minister of Town and Country Planning endorsed the argument that the object of the present proposals was to socialisedevelopment values. It was necessary that these values should betransferred to the community by a single operation so that thedecisions of planning authorities in particular cases might no longer be frustrated by financial considerations. He did not suggest thatplanning could proceed wholly without regard to cost. The Govern-ment might well be justified in encouraging a more rapid rate ofdevelopment if it were found that the revenue from betterment waslagging too far behind the outlay on compensation. That, however,was a factor to be taken into account in determining generalplanning policy : planning would be distorted if that balance hadto be struck on each individual application to develop.The Minister of Town and Country Planning therefore urgedthat the amount of compensation should be fixed at once and paid at a specified date in a single operation. He recognised, however,that the percentage proposed was not based on any precisecalculation. And, in order to meet the views of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, he would be prepared to accept a lower percentage.In the Uthwatt Report it-had been estimated that if the Statepurchased development rights at market value, the aggregate sumpaid would be two or three times too high, owing to the element offloating value. On this estimate the basic rate for compensation should be somewhere between 33^ per cent, and 50 per cent. Hewould be prepared, therefore, to justify to Parliament a basic rateof 33  per cent. He would also be ready to agree that paymentshould be made five years after the passage of the Bill. This wasthe period suggested in the White Paper on the control of land use(Cmd. 6537) presented by the Coalition Government in June 1944.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that from thepoint of view of agriculture, it was important that the compensation should be paid in a single operation, so that planning could proceedthereafter without reference to compensation. It was the cost ofcompensation which had in the past deterred planning authorities from preventing the development of valuable agricultural land. Ifthe Government now adopted the alternative of paying compensation as and when permission to develop was refused, he feared thatplanning authorities would continue to find it too expensive toprevent the development of land which ought in the national interestto be left to agriculture.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that if the basic rate ofcompensation wrere reduced to 33  per cent, and payment was notto be made until five years after the passage of the Bill, he would find it easier to accept the scheme annexed to CP. (45) 275. He was,however, still concerned about the uncertainty of the financial commitment which this scheme involved, and he&apos;would like to havea further opportunity of discussing with the Minister of Town and country Planning whether it was not possible to make some closerestimate of the total cost involved. In the light of that examinationof the financial implications of the scheme, a further report couldbe made to the Cabinet.
In further discussion it was suggested that consideration might also be given to methods of reducing the number of claims to com-pensation, postponing payment on some classes of claim until theland was about to be developed, and introducing a graduated scale of payment for different categories of land. Thus, it might beprovided that any person claiming compensation should be required at the same time to give an option to purchase to the planning authority or the land commission : if such an option had to be given,some people might hesitate to claim. As regards graduated com-pensation, it was pointed out that any single rate was bound to lead to hardship : for some people would receive less, and othersmore, than the true value to which they were entitled.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the basic rate of compensation under thescheme annexed to CP. (45) 275 should be reduced to33^ per cent.; and that payment of compensation shouldbe made, in a single operation, at a date to be fixed bythe Treasury, being a date not later than five years afterthe relevant legislation had been passed.(2) Subject to these amendments, approved in principle theproposed, heads of legislation annexed to CP. (45)275;and authorised the Minister of Town and country planning to proceed with the preparation of such legislation.(3) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would consult with the Minister of Town and country planning regarding the possibility of arriving at somecloser estimate of the total financial commitmentinvolved by this scheme, and would arrange for a further report on this aspect of the matter to be submitted toto the Cabinet in due course. In these consultationsaccount would be taken of other suggestions made in thediscussion for limiting the total amount of compensation payable under the scheme.(4) Agreed that final authority to introduce legislation on thelines recommended in CP. (45) 275 should not be givenuntil after the Cabinet had considered the report to bemade under (3) above.atomic energy.international control.(previous reference:CM. (45) 51stConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet considered a telegram containing the text of a statement (reproduced in the Appendix to these Minutes)which was to be issued in Washington later that day by president truman, the Prime Minister and Mr. Mackenzie King, announcing the agreement reached in their discussions on the international control of atomic energy.In discussion of this statement the following points were raised : (a) (The Foreign Secretary pointed out that the draft of any international agreement for the control of atomic energy should beso framed as to avoid attracting those provisions of the Unitedwhich reserved a right of veto to the permanentSecurity Council.   The Commission proposed inthe draft statement should be directed to payIt was not perhaps essential thatin the public announcement: thatNations Chartermembers of the paragraph 7 ofparticular attention to this point,this point should be mentionedquestion might be left for decision by the Prime Minister.(b) The President of the Board of Trade pointed out that,while in paragraph 3 of the statement it was said that no systemof safeguards would of itself provide an effective guarantee against the production of atomic weapons by a nation bent onaggression, paragraph 6 promised that detailed information con-cerning the practical industrial application of atomic energy wouldbe shared with other nations &quot; as soon as effective enforceable
safeguards against its use for destructive purposes can be devised.&quot; In order to avoid the apparent inconsistency between these two statements, he suggested that the concluding words ofparagraph 6 might be amended so as to promise the communication of detailed information to other nations &quot; as soon as the procedure suggested in paragraph 7 can be carried through.&quot;(c) The United States Government were apparently resolvednot to disclose detailed information about the practical industrialapplication of atomic energy until satisfactory safeguards against it use for destructive purposes had been devised. Did this mean that, in the meantime, this country would be denied the means ofexploiting the industrial potentialities of this discovery? If so,we should be put at a great comparative disadvantage in thedevelopment of this new source of industrial power.It was explained that the present statement was confined tothe disclosure to other countries of information possessed by theUnited States, Great Britain and Canada. The exchange ofinformation between those three countries was governed by aseparate agreement, concluded at Quebec in August 1943. this had contained clauses regarding the industrial exploitation of atomic energy which we now regarded as unduly restrictive from our point of view; and the Prime Minister had intended tonegotiate with President Truman during his present visit to washington a revision of these clauses. On this aspect of thematter the Prime Minister would no doubt report to the Cabineton his return.(d) Some Ministers feared that this statement would not bewell received by the Soviet Government, and might tend to increasethe difficulties of securing full co-operation between Russia and theWestern Powers in the establishment of an effective world organisation.The Foreign Secretary said that in his view the essence ofthe statement lay in the terms of reference of the Commissionproposed in paragraph 7. The appointment of such a commission should go far to remove the prevailing impression that the UnitedStates Avere intent on keeping this secret to themselves; and theterms of reference were sufficiently wide to show that the three countries envisaged a new approach to the whole problem of controlling the development and use of all major weapons designed for mass destruction.The Lord President said that arrangements had been madefor him to communicate to the Prime Minister by telephone, at p.m. that day, any comments &quot;&quot;which the Cabinet might wish tooffer on the terms of the proposed statement. He would put to thePrime Minister the points noted at (a) and (b) above. He wouldalso suggest that the final text of the statement should be read in both Houses of Parliament immediately after it had been issued in washington.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord President to put to the Prime minister the two points noted at (a) and (&amp;) above, and to ask him to consider whether it would be possible to secure an amendment of the statement to meet the second ofthese two points;(2) Took note that, subject to the Prime Minister&apos;s views, theLord President would arrange for the final text of thestatement to be announced in both Houses of Parlia-ment immediately after its issue in Washington that afternoon.
Ceylon.(previous reference:CM. (45) 46thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (CP. (45) 280) reporting thatthe State Council in Ceylon had carried, by a majority of 51votes to 3, a Motion accepting, for the interim period pending the attainment of full Dominion status, the constitution offered in thestatement of policy on constitutional reform embodied in the white paper (Cmd. 6690) presented on the 31st October, 1945.The Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to informthe Ceylon Board of Ministers that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had learned with satisfaction of the accept-ance of this Motion and had decided that the necessary steps should now be taken to give effect to their under-taking to grant a new constitution to Ceylon on the basisset out in the White Paper.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,15th November, 1945.APPENDIX.Communique on Atomic Energy.THE President of the United States, the Prime Minister of the UnitedKingdom and the Prime Minister of Canada have issued the following state-men t : 1. We recognise that the application of recent scientific discoveries to themethods and practice of war has placed at the disposal of mankind means of destruction hitherto unknown, against which there can be no adequate militarydefence, and in the employment of which no single nation can, in fact, have a monopoly.2. We desire to emphasise that the responsibility for devising means toensure that the new discoveries shall be used for the benefit of mankind, insteadof as a means of destruction, rests not on our nations alone, but upon the wholecivilised world. Nevertheless, the progress that we have made in the development and use of atomic energy demands that we take an initiative in the matter, andwe have accordingly met together to consider the possibility of international action^ -(a) To prevent the use of atomic energy for destructive purposes.(&amp;) To promote the use of recent and future advances in scientific knowledge,particularly in the utilisation of atomic energy, for peaceful andhumanitarian ends.3. We are aware that the only complete protection for the civilised worldfrom the destructive use of scientific knowledge lies in the prevention of war. Nosystem of safeguards that can be devised will of itself provide an effectiveguarantee against production of atomic weapons by a nation bent on aggression[particularly since the military exploitation of atomic energy depends, in large part, upon the same methods and processes as would be required for industrialuses].* Nor can we ignore the possibility of the development of other weaponsor of new methods of warfare, which may constitute as great a threat to civilisa-tion as the military use of atomic energy.4. Representing, as we do, the three countries which possess the knowledgeessential to the use of atomic energy, we declare at the outset our willingness, asa first contribution, to proceed with the exchange of fundamental scientific infor-mation; and the interchange of scientists and scientific literature for peacefulends with any nation that will fully reciprocate.* It was later reported from Washington (Telegram Harvard 21) that these words had been omitted from the statement; by the time that this telegram was received, however, thestatement, including these words, had been issued in London.
253CM. 53 (45)&quot;.5. We believe that the fruits of scientific research should be made availableto all nations, and that freedom of investigation and free interchange of ideas are essential to the progress of knowledge. In pursuance of this policy, the basicscientific information essential to the development of atomic energy for peacefulpurposes has already been made available to the world. It is our intention thatall further information of this character that may become available from time totime shall be similarly treated. We trust that other nations will adopt the samepolicy, thereby creating an atmosphere of reciprocal confidence in which political agreement and co-operation will flourish.6. We have considered the question of the disclosure of detailed information concerning the practical industrial application of atomic energy. The militaryexploitation of atomic energy depends, in large part, upon the same methods andprocesses as would be required for industrial uses. We are not convinced that thespreading of the specialised information regarding the practical application of atomic energy, before it is possible to devise effective reciprocal and enforceablesafeguards acceptable to all nations, would contribute to a constructive solutionof the problem of the atomic bomb. On the contrary, we think it might have the opposite effect. We are, however, prepared to share, on a reciprocal basis withother of the United Nations, detailed information concerning the practicalindustrial application of atomic energy just as soon as effective enforceable safe-guards against its use for destructive purposes can be devised.7. In order to attain the most effective means of entirely eliminating the useof atomic energy for . destructive purposes and promoting its widest use for industrial and humanitarian purposes, we are of the opinion that at the earliest practicable date a Commission should be set up under the United Nations toprepare recommendations for submission to the organisation. The commission should be instructed to proceed with the utmost despatch and should be authorisedto submit recommendations from time to time dealing with separate phases of its work.In particular, the Commission should make specific proposals :  (a) For extending between all nations the exchange of basic scientific infor-mation for peaceful ends.(&amp;) For control of atomic energy to the extent necessary to ensure its use only for peaceful purposes.(c) For the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and ofall other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction.(d) For effective safeguards by way of inspection and other means to protectcomplying States against the hazards of violations and evasions.8. The work of the Commissions should proceed by separate stages, thesuccesssful completion of each of which will develop the necessary confidence ofthe world before the next stage is undertaken. Specifically, it is considered thatthe Commission might well devote its attention first to the wide exchange of scientists and scientific information, and as a second stage to the development of full knowledge concerning natural resources of raw materials.9. Faced with the terrible realities of the application of science to destruc-tion, every nation will realise more urgently than before the overwhelming need tomaintain the rule of law among nations and to banish the scourge of war from the earth. This can only be brought about by giving whole-hearted support to theUnited Nations Organisation, and by consolidating and extending its authority,thus creating conditions of mutual trust in which all peoples will be free to devotethemselves to the arts of peace. It is our firm resolve to work without reservationto achieve these ends.
