1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (45) 319) covering a draft of aBill to ratify the Bretton Woods Agreements.The Cabinet were informed that, as soon as the projectedFinancial Agreement with the United States Government was con-cluded, a Resolution would be tabled inviting Parliament to endorse the Financial Agreement, the proposals on commercial policy andthe proposal&apos; to ratify the Bretton Woods Agreements. It was intended that the substantive discussion on the Bretton WoodsAgreements should take place in the debate on this Resolution, towhich two days would be given. Critics of the Bretton WoodsAgreements would be able to propose amendments to the Resolution,on which, if need be, a Division could take place. The Bill would betaken immediately after the debate on the Resolution, and it was hoped that the proceedings on the Bill would be regarded as formaland would not give rise to much further discussion. The Speakerhad been consulted and had agreed that in the exceptional circum-stances he could waive the rule against anticipation, which would otherwise prevent Members from discussing in the debate on theResolution matters covered by the Bill. If the present discussions in Washington were successfully concluded this week, it was pro-posed that this business should be taken in the House of commons on the 11th and 12th December : if necessary a further half-daycould be provided on the 13th December to conclude the proceedings on the Bill.In discussion of the terms of the draft Bill annexed to cp. (45) 319 the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs pointedout that Clause 3 (2), which was designed to exclude the self-governing Dominions, was so worded that it would not, in fact,exclude Southern Rhodesia and Newfoundland. He thought that southern Rhodesia should be excluded and he would welcome anopportunity of discussing this point with the Chancellor of theExchequer before the Bill was introduced.The Cabinet -(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consult with theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs regarding theapplication of the Bretton Woods Agreements Bill to southern Rhodesia and Newfoundland.(2) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to introduce theBill, in the terms of the draft annexed to CP. (45) 319,subject to any amendment agreed upon as a result of the consultations mentioned in (1) above, at the earliestpossible moment after the successful conclusion of thefinancial and commercial discussions in Washington.(3) Took note, with approval, of the arrangements made fordebating these matters in Parliament.2. The Cabinet discussed the latest developments in theWashington discussions on financial questions and commercial policy.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of Cabinet Conclusions.
national health service.Sale andPurchaseMedicalPractices.of3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Ministerof Health (CP. (45) 298) recommending that the custom of buyingand selling medical practices should be brought to an end onthe introduction of the new National Health Service.The Minister of Health recalled that the Coalition Govern-ment had announced on the 3rd May, 1945, that it was not their intention to abolish this custom immediately, that an enquiry would be held after experience had been obtained of the workingof the National Health Service, and that if as a result of thatenquiry the sale of practices should subsequently be controlledproper compensation would be paid. The medical profession was anxious to know whether the present Government adhered to thispolicy, and it was desirable that an early announcement shouldbe made. For the reasons given in his memorandum, the minister proposed that, on the establishment of the National Health Service,the sale and purchase of medical practices conducted wholly or partly within the public service should stop; that doctors therebydeprived of existing selling values should receive compensationbased on 1939 standards of practice values and payable only on the doctor&apos;s death or retirement from practice; and that all doctorstaking any part in the public service in future should join in a newcontributory superannuation scheme. If these proposals were accepted, he desired to make an early announcement on the lines indicated in paragraph 10 of his memorandum.The Cabinet were informed that the Social Services Committeehad given preliminary consideration to CP. (45) 298 and were infavour of the proposals put forward by the Minister of health in that memorandum.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the total estimatedcost of the compensation payable under the scheme proposed bythe Minister of Health would be about  40 millions, but payment would be spread over a substantial period, as the claimants diedor retired from practice. He agreed in principle with theMinister&apos;s proposals, though there were some points of detail onwhich he desired to hold further consultations with the Minister.Points in discussion were : 1(a) The Lord President said that it was unsatisfactory that theCabinet should be asked to settle particular parts of the schemefor a National Health Service before they had seen the scheme asa whole. If the Chancellor of the Exchequer was satisfied withthe present proposals, he would not withhold his assent. But he hoped that the Cabinet would not again be asked to commit them-selves on particular aspects of the National Health Service schemeuntil they had had an opportunity of considering the scheme as awhole.The Minister of Health said that he himself would have preferred to postpone a decision on this point until the whole schemewas ready for presentation to the Cabinet, but events had compelledhim to present this issue separately. Large numbers of doctorswere to be released from the Forces in the near future; and it wasnecessary that young men setting up in medical practice for thefirst time should know whether the present Government adhered tothe policy announced by the Coalition Government in May regard-ing the sale and purchase of practices.(b) The Minister of Health said that he was meeting a Com-mittee of the British Medical Association on the following day and would inform them in confidence of the Cabinets decisions onthis matter. He would then propose to make a statement in theHouse of Commons after Questions on the 6th December on thelines indicated in paragraph 10 of CP. (45) 298.It was suggested that, as there might be other Governmentstatements after Questions on the 6th December it wouldbe preferable that this announcement should be made in reply to
Supplies for europe.Food supplies for Germany.(previous reference:C.M.(45)47thConclusions,Minute 4.)a Question. The Minister of Health undertook to arrange for aQuestion to be placed on the Order Paper for answer on the6th December.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals set out in CP. (45) 298 for terminat-ing the custom of buying and selling medical practicesconducted wholly or partly within the public service, for compensating doctors thereby deprived of existingselling values, and for providing a contributory super-annuation scheme for all doctors taking part in thepublic service in future.(2) Authorised the Minister of Health to make an announce-ment in Parliament on the 6th December on the lines indicated in paragraph 10 of CP. (45) 298.4. At their meeting on the 30th October the Cabinet had invited the Lord Presidents Committee to consider the problemof food supplies for Germany and to focus the issues for decision.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (45) 302) reporting the conclusions reached by theLord Presidents Committee.The Lord President said that the Committee were satisfiedthat very serious consequences would follow unless shipments ofwheat (or flour equivalent) totalling 1,515,000 tons were made toGermany during the eight months up to the 31st July, 1946.Towards this amount 112,500 tons were already being procured inthe United States, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had authorised dollar expenditure on a further 275,000 tons. It wouldnot, however, be possible to ship more than 60,000 tons in Decemberunless American tonnage could be made available. The Committeehad considered whether the dangerous gap between demand and supply during December and January might be bridged by outrightrelease or temporary loan of wheat from United Kingdom stocks;but, since these stocks were expected to reach, a low level in the summer of 1946 and there could be no certainty of replenishingthem, the Committee did not feel that the risks involved in reducingUnited Kingdom stocks could be accepted. The Committee had also considered a recommendation of the European Economic Committeethat importing countries should raise their extraction rate to85 per cent; but they did not consider that the extraction rate inthis country should be raised above 80 per cent, having regard, inparticular, to the serious consequences which an increase wouldhave on our livestock policy. The Foreign Secretary had asked the United States Government to assist by supplying coal to theArgentine for the transport of cereals to the seaboard; but no firmreliance could be placed on supplies from the Argentine, and it seemed clear that of the total of 1,515,000 tons required a balanceof something over 1 million tons could be found only by the UnitedStates. The Committee accordingly recommended that the foreign secretary should point out to the United States Government thatthe economic and political consequences of famine in the british zone concerned all the United Nations and invite them to help byintensifying their efforts to increase wheat exports, by providingshipping and by bearing the cost of supplying the wheat requiredfor the British Zone over and above the 387,500 tons which wouldbe supplied by His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Minister of Food said that the total exportable supplies ofwheat from Canada, United States, Argentine and Australia forthe year to June 1946 would be 21 million tons. By the end of 1945about 12-2 million tons would have been lifted, leaving approxi-mately 8-8 million tons to meet requirements of 14-4 million tons during the period January to June 1946. The deficit of 5 - 6 million tons could be eliminated only by reviewing the programmes of the importing countries, and this was being done by the Cereals[31016-1]b 3
Committee of the Combined Food Board. The United StatesGovernment were making a real effort to export as much wheat aspossible, but it seemed unlikely that they would be able to increasesupplies substantially above the 8-7 million tons assumed by the cereals Committee as likely to represent total exports from theUnited States in the year up to June 1946. He estimated that united Kingdom stocks, including stocks of home-grown wheat,would have fallen to 848,000 tons by June 1946. Allowing for contingencies, this was dangerously near the minimum level of650,000 tons. Moreover, these figures took no account of possibledemands for wheat in place of rice for India and to meet the criticalfood situation in Malaya and Hong Kong, where it was reportedthat the starvation level would be reached during the present month.In these circumstances, he could not agree to any reduction, whetherpermanent or temporary, in United Kingdom stocks in order toassist in meeting the needs of Germany. Since the Lord presidents committee had considered the matter, however, the Minister of &quot;war transport had informed him that it would probably be possible toobtain United States shipping to carry200,000 tons of wheat or flourfor Germany from the west coast of the United States, and he was prepared to agree that for each vessel loaded on the west coast hewould divert to Germany one of the vessels now loading wheat onthe east coast of the United States for the United Kingdom, onthe understanding that supplies so diverted would be replaced bysupplies from the west coast.The Minister of&apos;State stressed the importance of securing thethe British zone in Germany the 1,515,000 tons of wheat which theFood Mission had recommended. He pointed put that an increasein the extraction rate in this country to 85 per cent, would make available an additional 226,000 tons up to June 1946 and Wouldenable us to press other importing countries represented on theEuropean Economic Committee to make corresponding economies.He also suggested that there should be a reduction in United King-dom stocks, on the ground that the emergency against which stockshad been maintained at a relatively high level had now arrived.The Foreign Secretary said that he would be opposed to anychange in the extraction rate, but in view of the dangerous situationin Germany we should, in his view, be justified in taking some risksin the way of reducing United Kingdom stocks. Would it not be reasonably safe to aim at a stock level of 700,000 tons by June 1946 ?Other points in discussion were : (a) The Minister of Health said that a Medical Mission whichhad recently reported on conditions in Germany had stressed thedanger of epidemics in Germany if the 1,500 calory level were notmaintained.(b) The Minister of Fuel and Power pointed out that, unlessadequate food supplies were made available for coal-miners in the ruhr, we could not expect to get the coal production which hadbeen planned from that area.(c) The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that if the extraction rate were increased to 85 per cent, there would be asubstantial reduction in the feeding-stuffs available for live-stock.Farmers had been encouraged to start breeding stock by a Govern-ment promise of increased feeding-stuffs, and their confidence in theGovernments agricultural policy would be undermined if thispromise were not kept.(d) The Minister of Fuel and Power pointed out that 20,000tons of oil fuel had already been supplied to the Argentine. He alsounderstood that the United States Government were supplying coal to the Argentine.(e) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had had nonotice of the proposal to hire United States shipping in order tocarry wheat from the west coast of the United States, and that hewould wish to consider it before a final decision were reached.
Man-Power.Releases fromthe Forces.(previous reference:CM. (45) 36thConclusions,Minute 1.)5.   The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda(i) A memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (CP. (45) 311)submitting proposals by the Man-Power Committee withregard to the acceleration of demobilisation, an increaseof releases in Class B and the continued call-up of menbetween the ages of 18 and 30.(ii) Memoranda by the Minister of Health (CP. (45) 320), theJoint - Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forScotland (CP. (45) 317) and the Minister of Works(CP. (45) 321) opposing the proposal to call up men fromthe building and the building materials and componentsindustries.The Foreign Secretary said that, thanks to the great efforts which had been made by the Service Departments and the Ministryof War Transport, there was good reason to hope that the very highaggregate release in Class A of close on 100,000 a week attained inNovember and December 1945 could be continued during the first four months of 1946, with the result that the numbers which,according to the plans approved by the Cabinet, were due to be released by the 30th June, 1946, would in fact be released about two months earlier. This would not only save the Exchequer theexpenditure which would have been incurred through the retentionof men in the Forces for an additional two months, but would also make a substantial contribution to the available labour supply in the spring, when the reconversion of industry would have progressed far enough to enable it to absorb large numbers of workers. the acceleration of releases in Class A would reduce the extent to whichClass B releases were necessary; but it was proposed that theprogramme of Class B releases should be planned on the basis of15 per cent, of the 2 million Class A releases which would have been achieved by March 1946 instead of 10 per cent, of the first millionClass A releases. Moreover, release would be offered to a sufficient number of men to ensure that over any given period actual releaseswould, in fact, amount to between 10 per cent, and 15 per cent, ofthe Class A releases. The Man-Power Committee had considered anumber of requests from Departments for the exemption fromcall-up of men under 30 in particular industries. They regarded itas of paramount importance, however, to maintain the principlethat the call-up of young men should continue, and they were satisfied that the acceleration of releases in Class A and increasedClass B releases would more than make good any losses through the call-uo.(f) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would prefer that no approach to the United States should be made until afterthe conclusion of the present discussions in Washington on financial questions. This should not preclude the Foreign Secretary from continuing to press the United States Government to supply coal tothe Argentine.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that there should be no increase in the present wheatextraction rate of 80 per cent, and no reduction in UnitedKingdom wheat stocks.(2) Subject to agreement by the Chancellor of the exchequer on the use of dollar tonnage, approved in principle theproposal to divert to Germany up to 200,000 tons ofwheat now being loaded on the east coast of the UnitedStates for the United Kingdom, to the extent to which supplies of wheat in replacement were loaded on the westcoast.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to approach the UnitedStates Government on the lines proposed in paragraph 11of CP. (45) 302, on the understanding that no approach would be made until after the conclusion of the present discussions in Washington on financial questions.
The Minister of Labour said that he had considered the points made in CP. (45) 317, 320 and 321 with regard to the call-up of menfrom the building and building materials industries. Up to theloth November about 30,000 men had been released in Class B forthe building and civil engineering industries, while Class A releasesof men formerly in these industries amounted to 40,000 up to the31st October from the Army alone. Both Class A and Class b releases would continue to accelerate. There was at present noproposal to call-up from the building industry apprenticed crafts-men or so-called apprentices; and, although he was not preparedto exempt altogether from call-up the men in the building and building materials and components industries whose call-up had been deferred for a period of six weeks under the decision of the Man-Power Committee at their meeting on the 23rd October (M.P. (45)12th Meeting, Minute 1), he would be prepared to postponecalling-up any of these men until the end of February. He was also prepared to consider similar postponement for men between 18 and30 in the mining industry. Before that date there would be anopportunity of reviewing the position in these industries in the lightof the accessions to their labour force from releases over the next three months. Meanwhile, the call-up of men from other industries would be accelerated in order to ensure that this postponement didnot result in any interference with the flow of intakes into theForces.Points in discussion were : (a) The Prime Minister said that it would be convenient if, inthe Debate on the Vote of Censure he could announce the acceleratedreleases in Class A and the proposals for an increase in Class b releases.(b) The Secretary of State for Air explained that, although thehigh aggregate rate of Class A releases attained in November and december would be continued during the first months of 1946 therewould be some falling off in the rate of release from the Royal AirForce. The Royal Air Force would, however, reach by about the endof April the target figure which had been fixed by the Cabinet inOctober for releases from the Royal Air Force.(c) The First Lord of the Admiralty drew attention to the factthat the rate of releases from the Forces in the period after April1946 would depend on the maintenance of intake into the Forces andon the review of our military commitments which was at present being carried out by the Chiefs of Staff.The Cabinet--(1) Took note with approval of the acceleration in the rate of class A releases reported in paragraphs 2 and 3 of cp. (45) 311.(2) Approved the proposal for increasing Class B releases setout in paragraph 4 of CP. (45) 311.(3) Agreed that the call-up of men between the ages of 18 and30 should continue, subject to the postponement until theend of February of the call-up of men from building andfrom industries manufacturing building materials and components.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would announce the acceleration of Class A releases and the proposals forincreased Class B releases in the Debate on the Vote of censure later in the week.
6. At their meeting on the 20th November the Cabinet had invited the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Labour to review the proposals for the relaxation of labour controls set out in cp. (45) 288.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum on this subject by the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Labour (CP. (45) 314).The Foreign Secretary said that, with the Minister of Labour,he had carefully considered the points raised when the Cabinet had discussed CP. (45) 288 and had reached the conclusion that, whilesteps must be taken to preserve the existing labour force in essential industries, it would be in the national interest to relax very substantially the controls relating to the direction and engagementof labour. It was clear that it would be better to enforce controls over a more limited field than to retain over a wide field controls which could not be enforced. It was therefore proposed thatEssential Work Orders should be continued for those industries in which it was necessary to maintain or increase the existing labour force. On the other hand, where man-power considerations nolonger made it necessary to continue the Orders, the industries should be informed that it was proposed to withdraw them in thenear future and given an opportunity to negotiate agreementsembodying some of the features of the Orders, such as the guaranteedweek. The use of the power of direction, except for the purpose of enforcing the Essential Work Orders and ensuring that men andwomen released in Class B entered the employment for which theywere released, should be limited to men up to the age of 30; and theControl of Engagement Order should apply only up to the same age.So far as concerned housing it was proposed, as a special exception,to retain the power of direction in respect of men over the age of 30for the limited purpose of requiring men already in the industry totransfer to house-building work. It was not proposed that thepower of direction and the control of engagement should apply to women of any age.The Minister of Labour said that he was satisfied that if theproposals in CP. (45) 314 were adopted he would be able to enforce the remaining controls. He desired, however, to propose three slightmodifications of the proposals :. (i) In view of the serious shortageof nurses, women up to the age of 30 in the nursing profession should remain subject to control, (ii) While the Civil Service (Control ofEmployment) Order should be retained, no steps should be taken to direct back into the Civil Service persons aged 60 or over,(iii) A ring-fence could be put round the agricultural industry inEngland and Wales, which was not subject to an Essential WorkOrder.If the Cabinet approved the proposals, he proposed that theyshould be announced in Parliament on the 6th December and comeinto operation on the 10th December.In discussion there was general support for the proposals setout in CP. (45) 314. It was pointed out, however, that any announcement would have to be carefully drafted. In particular, itwas important to avoid &quot;giving the impression that the essential work Orders were being retained only in certain industries in whichthe level of wages or the working conditions made it difficult toretain labour. It would be desirable that the Ministers specially concerned with those industries should have an opportunity of seeing the announcement in draft. It was also suggested that it would be preferable to delay any announcement with regard to labour controlsfor a week or two after the debate on the Vote of Censure.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in paragraph 4 of CP. (45) 314,subject to the modifications which had been suggested bythe Minister of Labour in the Cabinets discussion.(2) Authorised the Minister of Labour to inform, his joint consultative Committee that the Government were considering relaxations broadly along these lines; but
asked him to defer for a time making any public announcement of the detailed schemes of relaxation andto consult with the other Ministers affected on the termsof that announcement.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would indicate in his speech on the Vote of Censure that the Government were considering the question of changes in labour controls inthe light of the accelerated release of men and women from the Forces and that they would make an announce-ment on the subject in the near future.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,3rd December, 1945.
NO CIRCULATION RECORDCM. (us)  5STI1 CONCLUSIONS - MINUTE 23rd December, 19U5 - 11 a.m.ISHIHGTONIsCUSSIONSFINANCIALIESTIONS ANDiJMERC IALLICY.lakage offormat ion.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER drew attentionto the attached news agency report which had reachedLondon from Washington early on the morning of 2nd December.He read to the Cabinet the extracts marked in the copyattached;    and said that the author of this report appearedto he- aware, not only that there had. &quot;been differences ofopinion on this matter within the Cabinet, but also which ministers had dissented from the views of the majority.The proceedings at these Cabinet discussions had not been recorded in the open minutes.      In these circumstances it seemed to him that this knowledge could only have been acquired from/those who had been present at the Cabinet&quot;discussions, vis. Ministers and three officials.THE MINISTER OF FUEL AND POWER said that he had discussed the line which he was proposing to take on thismatter in Cabinet with the Permanent Secreta^r of his department, Sir Donald Fergusson, and with nobody else.At the same time, he must point out that his views on theAmerican loan had been publicly stated in the House ofCommons and elsewhere, before the present Government was formed.      Journalists were naturally aware of the views    *which he had expressed on this subject in the past, and itwas possible, therefore, that this news-story was based onconjecture rather than^any leakage of information about thecourse which the Cabinet&apos;s discussions had taken,THE MINISTER OF HEALTH said that lobby correspondentswere also aware of the views which he had. held on thissubject before he took office.      It should not, therefore.

be assumed that this news report was based on any leakage\ of information about Cabinet discussions.      As regardsthe news report&apos;s linking Sir Edward Bridges&apos;  visit to washington with the views expressed in the cabinet discussions, he pointed out that neither he nor theMinister of Fuel and Power was aware that Sir Edward Bridgeshad been sent to Washington until they saw in the eveningpapers on Saturday, 1st December, the news of his arrival in Washington,.     And both he and the Minister of Fuel and power had been away from London during the whole of that week-end.      This time-factor indicated that this news-agency report could not have been due to any indiscretionon the part of the Minister of Fuel and power or himself.He himself believed that the report must be based onconjecture;    and, as the report came from Washington, hesuggested that the American newspapers should be searchedfor earlier references to the views which were known, orbelieved, to be held on this subject, by the Minister of fuel and Power and himself.      He thought it would be foundthat there had been earlier references to these views,which would sufficiently explain the news-agency report fromwhich the Chancellor of the Exchequer had quoted.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was seriously disturbed by this report, which would be regarded as dueto a leakage of information.      He would certainly haveenquiry made in Washington.      This incident illustrated the need for exceptional caution, on occasions whendifferences of view were expressed in Cabinet.      It also suggested that, so far as possible, Ministers should avoidasking that dissenting views- which they had expressed in cabinet should be specially recorded in the minutes of theCabinet&apos;s proceedings.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.

Washington, Sunday:Lord Eeynea, the Chief British loan negotiator, andother members of the British Financial Mission this morning hada me ting with American representatives, including mr.* P. Vinson, Secretary of the Treasury, and Mr. Dean Acheson,Under-Secretary of State.The purpose of the me ting was to enable Sir EdwardBridges, Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, who arrived hereby air on Saturday, to explain the latest British Cabinetinstructions which it is not exaggerated to say came as a&quot;bombshell&quot; to the British delegation here.12.30 a. ...Consequently the &quot;Confident&quot; optimism of Lord Keynesand the Hon, Robert H. Brand, and others last week up toSir Edward Bridges1 arrival is now changed to one of &quot;Veryreserved optimism.&quot;It is believed that the American delegates are equallyanxious as most of them had planned to spend the week-endout-side Washington, and the British delegation had kept in contact with them by telephone up to 11 p,m. Saturday.Up to Sir Edward Bridges&apos; arrival a large measure ofagreement had been reached, constituting virtually a roughdraft for filling out, because the British felt that theyhad got the best terms possible out of the Americans and were apparently satisfied with the recent American concessions which had proved &quot;reasonable&quot; from the British point of view.12.li.3 a.m.A very reliable source says that Mr. Shiuwell,Mr. Aneurin Bevan ana others of the &quot;planned&quot; economistsCabinet had not shaken Mr. Attlee, Mr. Bevin, Sir StaffordGripps and Mr. Dalton as to their point of view on the loanand that the Cabinet had felt it necessary to send Sir EdwardBridges to Washington with instructions which would virtuallydisown the recent conversations between the British and american delegates in regard to the liberalisation of the sterling.It is understood that the planned economists wereadamant against any restraints being put on the liberalisation of the sterling into dollars.

12,1+8 a.m.Angjo-American Financial Delegates meet.Washington dunday:A meeting of the Anglo-American Financial Delegationswhich lasted for four hoars this aftex*noor:   concentrated onthe proposed liberalisation of the sterling, upon which* it isunderstood, that the United States stand was that any further concessions would arouse very strong congressional opposition.1.17 a* in.This was liiiely to dislocate a virtual agreement inprinciple between the British-American representatives to theAmerican request that none of the dollar credit must be devoted to pay off any part of accumulated British debt in sterling area countries of sterling valued at about 1% billiondollars.     But that credit could be partly devoted to convertingsterling balances into dollars of current business by theso-called sterling area countries with Britain which should givea constant flow of dollars to such countries and at the sametime abolish the American dollar pool.It is learned that during the meeting of the WillardHotel of the British delegates with Sir Edward Bridges yesterday,the American position was clearly explained. I;Sir Edward Bridges now knows that if Congress thinks the planned economy element in the British Cabinet is materiallyinfluencing the present negotiatons, there is hardly any hope of Congress approving an agreement.1.32 a.m.     Add:Sir Edward Bridges told the British delegation that apart from the influence of this element, other factors likethe extended length of the negotiations had exacerbated thefeeling of some members of the Cabinet and the British publicwho appear in the mood to scrap the negotiations, but that themore moderate members of the Cabinet as well as the City ofLondon and numerous industrialists view with alarm the effectof a breakdown in the negotiations which would force britain to lighten her belt, and he believed that not even measuresof.Increased financial trade connections with the BritishCommonwealth could help Britain much at present.
