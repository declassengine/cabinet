Foreign 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that he had learned towardsAffairs. the end of November that the United States Secretary of State,Proposed Mr. Byrnes, had suggested to M. Molotov that there should be anMeeting of early meeting in Moscow of the Foreign Ministers of the UnitedForeign States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union.   The subjectsMinisters. for discussion at this meeting had not been stated; but upon enquiryhe had ascertained that Mr. Byrnes had in mind an agenda including(i) procedure of the proposed Commission which was to submit tothe United Nations recommendations for the international controlof atomic energy; (ii) procedure for reconvening the Council ofForeign Ministers and for securing the prompt resumption of work by their Deputies on the preparation of Peace Treaties; (iii) termsoi reference for the proposed Allied Military Committee in Tokyo;and (iv) establishment of an independent Government in Korea.The Foreign Secretary said that he had doubted whether itwould be expedient for the three Foreign Ministers to meet at thisstage having regard, in particular, to the difficulties which had arisen from the attempt to exclude France and China from the workof the Council of Foreign Ministers, and to the suspicions whichmight be aroused if the Foreign Ministers of the Three Powersappeared to be prejudging matters which were to be discussed atthe General Assembly of the United Nations in January. Weshould certainly increase our difficulties with the French Govern-ment if matters of concern to them were discussed at a meetingof Foreign Ministers at which they were not represented.He had put these considerations to Mr. Byrnes. He was,however, in some difficulty, for the suggestion of a meeting hadalready been made to M. Molotov, and it now seemed that Mr. Byrneswas determined to go to Moscow, if necessary alone. In all thecircumstances the Foreign Secretary felt that he now had no alternative but to agree to attend the proposed meeting. he proposed, however, to make it clear to Mr. Byrnes that his agree-ment was conditional upon the understanding that this would be anexploratory meeting, designed to enable the three Foreign ministers to ascertain and examine the difficulties between their governments before the General Assembly of the United Nations in January,and to exchange views on the international control of atomic energy.He would also suggest that both he and Mr. Byrnes should give an assurance to the French Government that matters directlyconcerning France would not be discussed at this meeting: and,whether or not Mr. Byrnes joined him in this, he would himselfgive such an assurance to the French Government before any public announcement was made about the meeting.The Cabinet-Agreed that in the circumstances described the foreign secretary should indicate his willingness to attend theproposed meeting in Moscow on the understanding that thediscussions would be limited in the manner which he had indicated.Parliament.Motions of grattitude toWar Leaders.(previous reference:CM. (45) 47thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (45) 328) regarding the desire of the Oppositionthat Parliament should be invited to pass Motions of Gratitudethanking by name the three American Supreme Commanders andselected British Commanders.The Lord President recalled that the Government had hithertotaken the view that the gratitude of Parliament to the principalleaders of the Armed Forces was sufficiently expressed in the motion of Gratitude to the Forces as a whole which had been passed on the30th October; and that a further Motion naming particular indi-viduals would involve drawing distinctions which might proveinvidious. The Opposition were now disposed to challenge thisview and had asked whether the Government would be prepared toaccept the two Motions reproduced in Annex A of CP. (45) 328.[31036] b 2
Should the Government modify their previous attitude and agreeto bring forward such Motions? If not, should time be found forthe discussion of these Motions, if they were put down by theOpposition ?It was the view of the Cabinet that Motions of Gratitude tonamed individuals were bound to give rise to controversy. Thus,amendments adding other names were certain to be moved.Dominion Governments would expect that the names of someDominion Commanders should be included and it would be neces-sary to consult them about the choice of names. And if DominionCommanders were included, the Service Departments would thinkit necessary to ask for the addition of some British Commandersjunior to those mentioned in the draft Motion annexed to cp. (45) 328. These difficulties illustrated- the wisdom of theiGovernments original decision, in which the Chiefs of Staff hadconcurred, to avoid thanking individual leaders by name.The Cabinet (1) Reaffirmed their earlier decision that Parliament shouldnot be asked to thank particular war leaders by name;(2) Invited the Lord President to inform the Opposition thatthe Government had considered their suggestion, but thought it would be a mistake to invite Parliament toconsider the Motions annexed to CP. (45) 328, for thereasons which had been mentioned in the course of the cabinets discussion;(3) Took note that, if these Motions were tabled by the Opposi-tion, it was likely that so large a number of amendmentswould be placed on the Order Paper that the Govern-ment would be justified in declining to find time for theMotions to be debated.Parliament. 3.   The Lord President said that the Prime Minister expectedBusiness in     to be able to announce in the House of Commons that evening thethe House       conclusion of the Financial Agreement with the United Statesof Commons.    Government.   He proposed, therefore, that the weekly statement on Business should be made at the end of the day&apos;s sitting, andnot after Questions.He outlined the business which it was proposed to take in the&apos;House of Commons during the following week. The general debate on the Financial Agreement, commercial policy and Bretton Woodswould take place on the 12th and 13th December. The debate onthe Resolution would be concluded at 7 p.m. on the 13th December,and thereafter the Second Reading of the Bretton Woods Agree-ments Bill would be taken. The Committee and remaining stages of that Bill were to be completed by 2 p.m. on the 14th December.It was agreed that in the debate on the Resolution the government speakers should be the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade on the first day, and that the foreign secretary should speak on the second day, if his other publioengagements permitted.Christmas The  Cabinet  were  informed   that  Parliament  would  beAdjournment,   adjourned for the Christmas Recess from the 20th December tothe 22nd January.National 4.   The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda : Scheme CP. (45) 315 : by the Lord Privy Seal, reporting the proposalsof the Social Services Committee for modifications of the National(Previous Insurance Scheme outlined in the White Paper (Cmd. 6550) pre-reference:       sented by the Coalition Government;W.M.(44) 137th Cp (45) 323 : by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, proposingConclusions, certain amendments&apos;of the proposals made by the Social ServicesMinute 10.)     Committee.
The Minister of National Insurance said that the rates ofbenefit and pension proposed by the Committee had been calculated on the basis of adding 31 per cent, to the subsistence figures givenin the Beveridge Report. This was broadly in line with theGovernments intention to hold the cost of living at about 31 percent, over the September 1939 level. It was proposed that therates should be reviewed at five-yearly intervals. The Chancellorof the Exchequer in his memorandum dissented from the Com-mittee&apos;s recommendations on three points : (a) the payment of continuous unemployment benefit withouttime limit;(b) the payment of old-age pensions to single pensioners at therate of 26s. a week; and(c) the payment of old-age pensions at the rate of 10s. a week to persons who had not retired.The Minister said that, so. far as concerned unemploymentbenefit, the present time-limit of 30 weeks was unfair to men who,through no fault of their own, could not obtain work; and, after examining all the possible alternatives, he had reached the conclu-sion that no safeguards could be devised, in addition to those already provided, which would not be open to the criticisms which hadbeen levelled against the 1&apos; not genuinely seeking work &apos;&apos; condition.His object in proposing a rate of 26s. for a single pensionerwas to link this rate with that for sickness and. unemployment. Ifthis were done, it would be much easier for the Government to resist pressure from those who advocated a rate of as much as 30s. a week for a single pensioner at the age of 60.He had thought that the payment of an unconditional pension of 10s. on the attainment of pensionable age would be the best wayof inducing persons who reached pensionable age to continue atwork. It would also have the advantage of avoiding the anomalywhich would otherwise arise between persons reaching pensionable age before the scheme came into operation, who would receive 10s.unconditionally, and those (including about 400,000 voluntary con-distributors) who attained pensionable age after the beginning of thescheme and would be ineligible for any pension until they retired.If, however, the Cabinet felt that the object could be betterattained by the Chancellor&apos;s proposal to increase the inducementsfor deferred retirement, he would not press the proposal for thepayment of an unconditional pension of 10s.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he acceptedthe broad framework of the Committee&apos;s proposals, he must draw the attention of the Cabinet to the formidable financial burden which they would impose on the country. The total annual expendi-ture in 1948 would be  562 millions as against  486 millions underthe White Paper proposals. Moreover, since the revenue from contributions would remain constant, the Exchequer would have tocarry the whole of the increasing cost of the scheme, which was estimated at  10 millions a year over the next twenty years, with further increases thereafter. In view of this very heavy burden,he could not accept the proposal to pay continuous unemploymentbenefit unless some satisfactory method could be devised to deal with cases of long-term unemployment. Nor could he agree to thepayment of old age pensions to single pensioners at the rate of 26s-,a week. If, as he proposed, the single pension were 21s., therewould be an initial saving to the scheme of  27 millions a yearand, in addition to this, a continuing reduction of  750,000 a year in the annual increase of  10 millions. He hoped that the cabinet would reject the proposal to pay a pension of 10s. a week wherethe pensioner had not retired, since this was not in accord withthe Labour Party&apos;s policy of supporting the principle of retirement pensions.The Lord President said that he shared the Chancellorsgeneral attitude towards these proposals. There was a danger thatan undue proportion of our resources would be spent on the aged
with the result that the Cabinet would later have to reject otherdesirable projects of social reform on the ground that they couldnot be financed.Subsequent discussion concentrated on the three points to whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer had drawn attention in para-graphs 3 to 5 of CP. (45) 323.(a) Payment of continuous unemployment benefit.In favour of imposing a time-limit of 30 weeks on the paymentof benefit, it was urged that, as experience had shown, the existingsafeguards were not enough to prevent married women and otherclaimants who had no real intention of taking up regular employ-ment from continuing to draw on the funds of the scheme. TheTrade Unions themselves imposed a time-limit on the payment ofbenefit for unemployment. If the Government pursued a policy of full employment, it should be possible to offer claimants work, either in their own district or on transfer to another district, long beforethe 30 weeks had expired. It was unfair to saddle an insurance fund with the payment of benefits for an unlimited period : if theState could not find employment for a claimant within 30 weeks, theExchequer should bear the whole of the cost of continuing tosupport him.On the other hand, it was argued that if there were no time-limit on the payment of unemployment benefit the Governmentwould have a greater incentive to take early and effective steps to counter the development of mass unemployment. It was also suggested that unless the amount payable in the form of assistancewere less than the amount payable by way of unemployment benefit,the transfer of a claimant from benefit to assistance after a certainperiod of time would not, in fact, prove an effective deterrent to thework-shy.(b) Rate of old age pension.Against the payment of old age pension at the rate of 265. aweek, it was pointed out that 21s. represented a very substantial increase on the present rate. Many old age pensioners had meansof their own and did not need so large an allowance A rate of 26s.would involve an increase of Id. in the weekly contribution, dividedequally between workers and employees; and the Social services committee, believing that contributors could not be expected tobear this increase, had proposed that the burden should be borne bythe Exchequer.On the other hand, it was argued that, in view of the fall in the purchasing power of money, an increase of 5s. in the rate of pensiondid not represent a proportionately increased call on the availablegoods and services in the country, and that account should be taken of the expected increase in productivity over the next 20 years.The comprehensive benefits which would be provided for workers bythe full National Insurance Scheme would enable them to reduce their weekly contributions to other funds, and they might reasonably be expected to pay contributions at higher rates than suggested bythe Social Services Committee. If part of the extra burden involvedin paying pensions at the rate of 26s. a week could be met in thisway and if it were accepted that the possibility of raising the ratesof contribution in later years was not excluded, it would not be unreasonable to ask the Exchequer to bear some share of the cost of paying pensions at the rate of 26s. It might, for example, bepossible to fix the share to be borne by the Exchequer by referenceto the estimated savings in supplementation payments which would accrue if the rate were fixed at 26s..(c). Retirement condition.There was general agreement that, apart from persons already in receipt of old-age pensions when the scheme came into operation,who would continue to receive pensions at the rate of 10s. a week,the payment of old-age pensions should be conditional on retire-ment; and that the objective of retaining persons in emplovmentcould best be achieved by offering a substantial increase of pension for deferred retirement.   If the basic pension for a single person
Prisonersof War.Employmentof Germanand ItalianPrisonersof War.(previous reference:CM. (45) 33rdConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour (OP. (45) 305) submitting proposals for regulating the continued employment in this country of prisonersof war.The Minister of Labour said that, since his memorandum was circulated, he had been informed that the number of prisonersavailable for employment in this country could be substantiallysupplemented by bringing here German prisoners now in the UnitedStates. The United States Government would probably be willing that these prisoners should be diverted to this country instead ofbeing returned to Germany. He suggested that this possibility should be explored before the proposals made in his memorandumwere considered.Points in discussion were :  (a) The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of War Transport,said that there should no difficulty in transporting these prisoners from the United States to this country. Even if they could not bebrought in United States ships, their transport across the Atlanticwas likely to cause less disturbance to the release scheme than themovement of prisoners from Germany to this country.(b) The Ministry of Works could provide winter accommoda-tion for 43,000 additional prisoners. In the spring, additionalnumbers could be housed under canvas.(c) Of the additional 5.000 prisoners of war placed at thedisposal of the Ministry of Works for housing work, including thepreparation of housing sites, only 3,000 were actually employedon the preparation of housing sites. 7,000 prisoners could be usedimmediately on this work.(d) 6,150 Italians and 2,400 German prisoners of war were employed in the food trades and there was a demand for a further900. Replacements for these prisoners should be provided if theywere to be withdrawn.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Labour to explore further thepossibility of supplementing the supply of prisoner-of-war labour in this country by bringing prisoners of war from the United States.were to be fixed at 21s. a week, the increased award for deferredretirement could be 2s. Qd. for each year by which retirement was postponed. On the other hand, if the basic rate of pension wereto be 26s., an increase of 2s. should be sufficient. It was also suggested that it would be better to award an increase for eachsix months by which retirement was deferred rather than to makeany increase in pension dependent on the completion of a full year of further employment. If increases at the rate of 2s. or 2s. Qd.a week were to be given, they would be limited to the period between 65 and 70.The Prime Minister said that it was clearly desirable that the difficult questions relating to the payment of unemployment benefit and the rate of old-age pensions for single pensioners should befurther examined in the light of the suggestions made in the courseof the discussion. In view of the urgency of reaching final deci-sions with a view to the drafting of the Bill, he hoped it wouldbe possible for the Cabinet to resume their consideration of thesematters during the following week.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Lord Privy Seal, the Minister of Labour,and the Minister of National Insurance to consider further, in the light of the discussion, the problemsrelating to the payment of unemployment benefit and therate of retirement pension and to submit revised proposalsfor consideration by the Cabinet during the following week.
(2) Took note that, in the meantime, no steps would be taken towithdraw prisoner-of-war labour from the employmentsto which they were now allocated.GovernmentPublicityServices.Future ofMinistry ofInformation.6. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Prime Minister(CP. (45) 316) covering Reports by the Lord President and theForeign Secretary on the future organisation of government publicity.The Lord President said that the urgent question for decision by the Cabinet was whether the Ministry of Information should beretained as a separate Department under its own Minister. Theview of the majority of the Ministers with whom he had discussed the matter was that the Ministry should not continue in its present form.The Minister of Information said that he still favoured theretention of the Ministry, for the reasons which were fully statedin the papers before the Cabinet. It was, he was sure, of greatimportance that there should be a central organisation to providesingle direction for publicity. He could not believe that any alter-native arrangement would be as effective for that purpose as asingle Department with unequivocal responsibility working under its own Minister.In discussion there was general agreement that there must continue to be an effective central organisation to handle Govern-ment publicity both overseas and at home. The question at issue was whether that organisation should be headed by a Minister.The Prime Minister said that it seemed to him politicallydangerous that there should be a Minister with no other responsi-bility but the conduct of publicity.There was general agreement with this view. It was, however,recognised that the alternative arrangements for the centralhandling of Government publicity required further elaboration.For instance, the Reports now before the Cabinet did not deal withthe future of the British Council or future relations with theB.B.C It was agreed that, if the general principle was now accepted that there should no longer be a separate Ministry, thealternative arrangements could be worked out in further detail by officials for subsequent submission to the Cabinet.If a separate Ministry was not to continue, an early announce-ment in Parliament would be desirable. It would also be essentialto make a statement to the staff to reassure them as to their future;for, if the present staff continued to disintegrate, it would bedifficult to recreate an efficient organisation.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Ministry of Information should riot con-tinue as a separate Department under its own Minister.(2) Agreed that it was essential to retain some effective central organisation to handle Government publicity; and invited the Lord President to arrange for a Committeeof officials to work out the details of an alternativeorganisation on the general lines indicated in his report.(3) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofInformation, to draft an announcement to be made inParliament and a statement to be made to the staff ofthe Ministry of Information.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,6th December, 1945.
