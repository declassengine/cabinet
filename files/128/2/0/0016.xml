Civil Aviation.British air services.(previous references:CM. (45)47thConclusions,Minute 3, and cm.(45)62ndConclusions,Minute 8.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Civil Aviation (CP. (45) 332) covering a draft white paper on the future organisation of British air services. In hiscovering memorandum the Minister also submitted his proposals for operating British air services pending the enactment of legislation authorising the formation of the proposed new Corporations.The Minister o.f Civil Aviation explained that the draft white paper had been discussed with the Ministers primarily concerned,and he had incorporated in the draft a number of suggestions whichthey had made. He had not, however, felt able to accept a sugges-tion made by the Minister of Supply and Aircraft Production for amendment of the passage in paragraph 11 of the draft dealingwith the provision for repairs and overhauls. The Minister ofSupply had asked that this paragraph should lay it down as ageneral principle that major overhauls and repairs should be under-taken only by the aircraft industry in order that they might bekept closely in touch with the practical operation of their products.It seemed likely, however, from the pre-war experience of companies operating aircraft, that it would be more economical to reserve tothe operating agencies the right to carry out themselves some ofthese repairs and overhauls. The Minister of Civil Aviation there-fore thought it inexpedient to go further than to say that advan-tage would be taken of suitable facilities for repair, &amp;c, offered by the aircraft and engineering industries.The President of the Board of Trade said that, in his experi-ence, it was of great importance that the manufacturers should undertake repairs. First-hand experience of the faults of existingmachines was invaluable in securing technical advances in design and manufacture.In discussion general agreement was expressed with the viewput forward by the President of the Board of Trade and theMinister of Supply and Aircraft Production. It was agreed that paragraph 11 of the draft should be recast so as to make it clearthat the operating agencies would be required to comply with arrangements made by the Minister of Civil Aviation in consulta-tion with the Minister of Supply and Aircraft Production forassociating the aircraft and engineering industries with the repair and overhaul of aircraft.Various drafting amendments in other paragraphs of the draft white Paper were discussed and approved; and the Minister ofCivil Aviation undertook to incorporate these in the final version of the White Paper.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Minister of Civil Aviation to present theWhite Paper before the Christmas adjournment, in theterms of the draft annexed to CP. (45) 332, subject tothe amendments approved in discussion;(2) Invited the Lord President and the Minister of CivilAviation to arrange for statements to be made, in thetwo Houses of Parliament, if possible on the 19th Decem-ber, announcing the presentation of this White Paper.The Cabinet then considered the interim proposals for operatingBritish air services.Points made in discussion were : (a) The Air Ministry were most anxious to hand over theEuropean services, at present operated by 110 Wing, to a civilorganisation. This would be facilitated by the fact that it hadwithin the last few days become possible to purchase Dakota aircraft for civilian use.(b) No provision was made in the interim proposals for a service across the Pacific. The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs emphasised the importance of starting such a service as[31199]b 2
soon as possible, even on an extemporised basis, in order to assistthe Australian and New Zealand Governments in resisting effortsby American lines to obtain facilities to provide such a service.The Minister of Civil Aviation said that plans for such a service were now being worked out. It would be operated byB.O.A.C., and Lancastrians and flying-boats would be used on it for the present.(c) The Board of B.O.A.C. would be temporarily enlarged by two members specially appointed to concern themselves with theEuropean services. When the European Corporation was eventuallyformed, these two members would leave the Board of B.O.A.C. andjoin that of the European Corporation.(d) The selection of individuals for appointment to the boards and. the terms of their appointment should be discussed with thegroup of Ministers concerned with the socialisation of industries and thereafter with the Prime Minister.The Cabinet-(3) Approved, subject to (d) above, the interim arrangements proposed in CP. (45) 332 for operating British air services pending the enactment of the legislation out-lined in the draft White Paper.Broadcasting.Future Policy.(previous reference:W.M.(44)12thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet considered a report on broadcasting policy by the Lord President, the Minister of Information, the Postmaster-General and the Minister of State (CP. (45) 293).The Lord President said that in January, 1944, the WarCabinet had appointed a Committee, under the Chairmanship ofLord Woolton, to enquire into future broadcasting policy. although this Committee had not completed their work by the time thepresent Government took office, they had prepared a draft report which, subject to certain modifications, formed the basis of therecommendations now before the Cabinet.These recommendations did not deal with the question of ministerial control over the B.B.C., since it seemed desirable thatthis should be considered in connection with the general questionof the future of the Government Information Services; and hesuggested that, in the first instance, it should be examined by theOfficial Committee to whom this question had been referred.He and his colleagues were satisfied that there need not beany enquiry by an independent Committee, on the lines of theUllswater Committee, before the charter of the B.B.C. was renewed,and that the B.B.C should continue to be the sole authority licensedto broadcast in the United Kingdom for the further period often years from the 1st January, 1947, covered by the new charter.They also felt that the Governors, although they should notbe on a full-time functional basis, should take a more active interest in the financial and establishment policy of theCorporation. It was, however, for consideration whether the salaries now paid to the Chairman and members of the board should not be reduced : a salary of  500 or  750 a year seemedadequate for the part-time services to be rendered by a member ofthe Board.A decision was urgently required on the question whether theEuropean service was to be continued on an effective scale. If this were to be done and if the B.B.C. were to provide three home service programmes, it would be necessary to reduce the number of regionalprogrammes from seven to six by amalgamating the Midland and west of England regions. The original Broadcasting Committeehad stressed the importance of increased devolutions to the regionsand his colleagues and he were generally in favour of this. Devo-lution, however, meant additional expenditure, and the cabinet should know that Lord Reith doubted whether increased devolutionwould, in fact, improve the quality of the programmes.
As regards finance, the B.B.C were spending on their home,programmes alone more than the product of the present licence feeof 10s. and there was a strong case for an early increase to  1.Indeed, it was unfortunate that the fee had not been increased during the war. The first practicable date on which suchan increase could take effect was now April 1946, but if this wereto be done an immediate decision was necessary. Other deci-sions required by the Report were not so urgent, as the charter didnot fall to be renewed until the end of 1946; and the question of ageneral statement of the Governments policy on broadcasting couldbe deferred until it could be considered in the light of general policy with regard to the future of the Government Information Services.Discussion turned first on the proposal to raise the licence feefrom 10s. to  1 a year.Against this proposal it was urged that it was wrong in prin-ciple to treat broadcasting on a commercial basis and that the cultural activities of the B.B.C. were eligible for subsidy from theExchequer in the same way as other cultural work. Moreover, it did not seem right to include in the balance-sheet the income taxliability of. the B.B.C. or the cost of television (in so far as it wasnot met from revenue from special television licences), particularly since the cost of television represented mainly capital expenditure.If these items were excluded, the gap between the revenue derivedfrom licence fees and publications and the expenditure on homebroadcasting would be only  2,400,000, and if a real effort weremade to cut down excessive expenditure (e.g.. on fees to particularartists) it should be possible to bring revenue and expenditure nearlyinto balance. It was also suggested that, if the fee were to beincreased to  1, it should be payable in two instalments.On the other hand, it was argued that in principle it was desirable that the services provided by the B.B.C for home audiencesshould be self-supporting, and that a licence fee of  1 a year was by no means an excessive payment for the service provided. Further,it was important that the revenue from licence fees should produce a substantial margin for experiment and development.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the licence fee should be raised from 10?. to 1, on the understanding that the Postmaster-general would examine the possibility of arranging for thepayment of the licence fee in two instalments of 10s.each and that the possibility of exercising a closer controlover expenditure by the B.B.C. should be explored.The Cabinet then considered the continuation of the EuropeanService. There was general support for the proposal that theEuropean Service should continue, and it was pointed out that unless a decision were taken quickly the B.B.C would lose the expert staff who had done so much to build up the reputation of this service. If the Service were continued and if the B.B.C.&apos;s proposalto provide three programmes in the Home Service were adopted, itwould be necessary to reduce the Regional programmes from sevento six. There would, however, be no objection to this provided thatthere was a greater measure of Regional devolution.The Cabinet-(2) Approved the proposal to continue the European service on the scale proposed in the Report, and agreed that thenumber of Regional programmes should be reduced from,seven to six.Other points in discussion were : (ft) Stress was laid on the importance of appointing to theBoard of Governors members who would take an active interest inthe work and of securing a variety of political outlook on the Board.(b) Attention was drawn to the problem of interference withmaritime wireless services from broadcasting stations used for theEuropean service.   It was suggested that everything possible should
be done to improve ships&apos; wireless equipment at an early date. Inthe meantime, the possibility of increasing the frequency of the periods of silence to allow for distress messages might be considered.(c) With reference to paragraph 17 of the report, it wassuggested that the Minister of Supply and Aircraft Production andthe Postmaster-General should consider the possibility of making an immediate statement as to the Governments intention to intro-duce legislation requiring manufacturers of electrical appliances to incorporate in new appliances devices to prevent interference withwireless reception.(d) The President of the Board of Trade said that he doubted whether it was wise, as proposed in paragraph 43 of the report, to defer until 1949 a decision on the question whether the relayexchange should be taken over by the Government, since any post-ponement would increase the amount of compensation payable.(e) Attention was drawn to the importance of ensuring that the news given by the B.B.C. particularly in the European Service was factually accurate. The B.B.C. was widely believed to be under government control and when, as occasionally happened, their newsbroadcasts gave inaccurate information, the Government were putin an embarrassing position.The Cabinet (3) Agreed to resume discussion of the Report at a later meeting and, in the meantime, authorised the lord president to ask the Committee of Officials, who were examining the future of the Government information services, to consider the question of ministerial responsi-bility for the B.B.C.3. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to a meeting heldin London on the 15th December of persons who had been detainedunder Defence Regulation 18B. It was reported that about 600people had been present and that Sir Oswald Mosley had addressedthe meeting.The Home Secretary said that the police were submitting to him a report on this meeting and, when he had received this, he would consider carefully whether there was any action which he could take. He reminded the Cabinet, however, that the special war-timepowers conferred by Defence Regulations 18AA and 18B, underwhich action had been taken against the British Union of Fascists,had been revoked; and that activities of adherents of Fascism,including meetings and the expression of political views, could not now be prohibited or interfered with unless they contravened theordinary law.In discussion it was suggested that serious consideration oughtnow to be given to the question whether special steps should not betaken to prevent the re-emergence of a Fascist movement in thiscountry. A political movement which exploited anti-Semiticfeeling would be likely to provoke serious trouble, and possibly out-breaks of disorder, in this country at the present time. Apart fromthis, the effect on public opinion in Europe should also be considered.Many countries where the Fascist movement had established a much stronger hold thsin it had ever secured in this country were now seeking to establish a democratic system; and public opinion inthose countries would be greatly influenced by the attitude takenhere towards the re-emergence of a Fascist movement.The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for the appoint-ment of a small Committee of Ministers to review theavailable evidence as to the re-emergence of a Fascistmovement in this country, and to consider the case fo?amending the existing law with a view to checking thegrowth of such a movement.
Dutch 4.   The Minister of State said that the-Parliamentary Under-East Indies. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had to answer in the HouseBurning of of Commons that afternoon a Question asking for a further state-Native ment about the situation in the Dutch East Indies; and it was likelyVillages. that supplementary Questions would be put about the burning of native villages by way of reprisal for the murder of individual members of the British Forces.The Minister of State said that in the Debate on the Adjourn-ment on the 11th December he had defended against criticism a specific instance in which a native village had been burned; but other cases had been reported since then and it now appeared that it wasthe settled policy of the Supreme Commander in South-East Asiathat native villages should be burned by way of reprisals. he feared that such a policy would be strongly criticised by some government supporters; and he felt that, if the government proposed to support that policy, it would be necessary to issue a carefully considered statement in justification of it.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for the DefenceCommittee to review the question of policy involved inthe burning of native villages in the Dutch East Indiesas reprisals;(2) Agreed that, if this issue were raised in supplementaryQuestions in the House of Commons that afternoon, theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should avoid saying anything which could beconstrued as a statement of Government policy in this-matter.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,17th December, 1945.
