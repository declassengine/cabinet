Atomic 1.   The Lord President, on behalf of the Cabinet, welcomed the energy. Prime Minister on his return from Washington, expressed thePrime Cabinets appreciation of his speeches to Congress and to the twoMinister^       Houses of Parliament in Ottawa, and congratulated him on theMission to       success of his mission.Washington. prime Minister gave the Cabinet an account of his dis-(Previous        cussions in Washington about the international control of atomicEeferenee:       energy.   He had found little difficulty in securing the agreement-C.M.(45)53rd   0f President Truman and Mr. Mackenzie King to the general linesConclusions,     of his approach to this problem, as approved by the Cabinet at their minute 3.)      meeting on the 8th November, but there had been some delay in securing agreement on the draft of the announcement.  As a result,it had not been possible for him to give the Cabinet much time toconsider that draft; and he had not been able to secure consideration in Washington of the comments communicated to him on the cabinets behalf.   These points had not, however, been concernedwith the substance of the agreement which was, he understood, fullyacceptable to the Cabinet. It was satisfactory that the Three powers should have found themselves in full agreement that this problem could be satisfactorily handled only through the gradual creationof international confidence and that control, not only of atomic weapons, but of all weapons designed for mass destruction, shouldbe sought through the machinery of the United Nations Organisa-tion.   Meanwhile, it was satisfactory that the three Powers had expressed their intention to continue to co-operate in research anddevelopment on atomic energy.In discussion the following points were raised : -(a) Had satisfactory arrangements been made to enable us to share in the information acquired by the Americans regarding theindustrial application of atomic energy?   In particular, had a. written agreement been secured revoking the restrictive clauses ofthe Quebec Agreement of August 1943 ?The Prime Minister said that the new agreement whichPresident Truman had signed was, in his view, satisfactory, thoughit did not in terms revoke the Quebec Agreement. In addition, sir john Anderson had worked out, with the Americans, the basis ofa new detailed agreement with the other two Powers.It was suggested that the Prime Minister might include some reference to this point in his speech in the House of Commons later that day. The Prime Minister agreed that he could use words to theeffect that, following his discussions with President Truman, hewas now able to say that there was no question of any restriction on our liberty to exploit the industrial application of these researchesinto the use of atomic energy.(b) The Minister of Education said that, at the Conference ofthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisa-tion, some concern had been expressed about the proposal to establishunder the United Nations Organisation machinery for the inter-national exchange of basic scientific information. The conference had recognised that special arrangements must be made for controlling the use of scientific information for military purposes;but they had thought it would be unfortunate if ad hoc machinery&apos;were established, independently of the United Nations Educational,Scientific and Cultural Organisation, for the international exchangeof basic scientific information.It was the view of the Cabinet that it would be inappropriateto bring within the scope of the United Nations Educational,Scientific and Cultural Organisation arrangements for the exchange.of scientific information which was of such importance, for indus-trial as well as for military purposes, as that covered by the recentannouncement on atomic energy. These were matters which oughtto be brought directly under the control of the United nations organisation itself.[30933] b 2
The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Ministers statement and of thepoints which had been raised in discussion.Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.general eisenhower.(previous reference:CM. (45) 53rdConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons during thefollowing week.The Opposition were thinking of tabling a Motion of Censurearising out of the statement on the nationalisation of certain industries made on the 19th November. If a Motion were tabledwhich related directly to that statement, facilities must be given to debate it. One day should suffice. There were, however, indications that the Opposition were thinking of extending the Motion to coverdemobilisation, housing and, possibly, the Governments failure toreduce expenditure. The Lord President said that there had beenearlier opportunities to debate these other topics, and furtheropportunities would arise in the near future; and it was, in his view, improper that the Opposition should seek to evade the specificissue raised on the 19th November by asking for a wide-rangingdebate on a more general Motion. If, therefore, this matter were raised in connection with his Statement on Business that day, he proposed to avoid making any promise that time would be found fora debate until he had seen the precise terms of the Motion. .The Cabinet-Endorsed the line which the Lord President proposed totake on this matter.The Lord President recalled that at their meeting on the15th November the Cabinet had agreed that it would be inexpedient to adopt the suggestion that General Eisenhower should be formallyreceived by Parliament while he was in this country at the endof November. The Cabinet had, however, been disposed to favour the alternative suggestion that General Eisenhower should beinvited to a dinner in the House of Commons attended by the speaker and leading members of all Parties.The Prime Minister said that he favoured this alternativesuggestion. Invitations might be issued by the Speaker, and thedinner might be held in the Speaker&apos;s House, if the damage whichit had suffered during the war had been repaired. RepresentativePeers might be invited, as well as leaders of other Parties.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President to pursue this suggestion withthe Speaker, and to settle the detailed arrangements inconsultation with the Prime Minister.Greece. 3.   The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the latest(Previous       developments in the political situation in Greece.Eef erence: The King of the Hellenes had sent him a letter in which, on.(45).49th the basis of newspaper reports, he suggested that His Majesty&apos;conclusions, Government had offered financial assistance to the Greek Govern-Minute 5.)&apos;     ment on condition that the plebiscite was postponed for three years.There was, of course, no truth in this suggestion, and this wouldhave been made clear in the reply. The King had, however,proceeded to issue a statement to the Press without waiting for theForeign Secretary&apos;s reply, and a difficult situation had therebybeen created. The Foreign Secretary said that he thought it would now be necessary for him to publish his reply to the King&apos;s letter,and to deal with this matter fully and frankly in his speech in theParliamentary debate on foreign affairs on the following day.The facts relating to the plebiscite were, briefly, these. It had originally been provided under the Varkiza agreement, that the plebiscite should pi&apos;ecede the elections and should be held before
4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (45) 289) seeking authority forthe early introduction of an Investment (Control and Guarantees)Bill. Annexed to the memorandum were drafts of the Bill and of amemorandum which it was proposed to prefix to the Bill.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that legislation on thissubject had been foreshadowed in The King&apos;s Speech. The Bill hadbeen drafted on broad and simple lines. Clause 1 would give con-tinuing power to guide investment into the right channels.Clause 2, which enabled the Treasury to guarantee loans for thereconstruction or development of any industry or part of an industry in Great Britain, would be used primarily to stimulateindustrial activity at times when there was a threat of a slump. Tomeet points raised by the Lord Presidents Committee, the wording of Clause 1 had been made more positive and the limit on theaggregate capital amount of loans guaranteed under Clause 2 in any financial year had been raised from  25 millions to  50 millions.Provisions relating to the machinery for the control of invest-ment had been excluded from the Bill, but the accompanyingmemorandum would make it clear that it was proposed to continuethe Capital Issues Committee and the Public Works Loans Board,and, in addition, to set up a National Investment Council. ThisCouncil would include the Governor of the Bank of England, theChairman of the Capital Issues Committee and the Public WorksControl of investment.Investment(Control and guarantees)Bill.the end of 1945. In August he had suggested to the Cabinet thatit would be better if this order were reversed, so that the plebiscitewas not held until order had been restored in Greece by a stableGovernment freely elected and resting on the will of the people.He had, however, recommended that the initiative and responsibilityfor departing from the Varkiza agreement in this respect must beassumed by the Greeks themselves. In September the Greeks hadfreely decided that the elections should precede the plebiscite; andit had been generally agreed by interested Allied Governments thatthis was an arrangement most likely to produce stable conditionsin Greece. When the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs had arrived in Athens earlier in the present month the Regent had asked for British support for a proposal to postpone the plebiscite for three years. The Foreign secretary had emphasised that the primary purpose of Mr. McNeiFs mission was to secure a Government willing and able to carry through a comprehensive economic programme for the reconstruction of greece, and he had refused to be involved in further manoeuvringsabout the dates of elections and plebiscite. He had therefore pro-posed a definite time-table under which the elections would be heldin March 1946, and the plebiscite in March 1948, thus allowing the new Government two years in which to produce conditions of stability suitable for the holding of the plebiscite. There was,however, no foundation for suggestions that the initiative in proposing postponement of the plebiscite had come from us or thatany promise of economic assistance had been conditional upon post-ponement of the plebiscite.The public statement which had now been made by the King ofthe Hellenes was not calculated to assist an early settlement of thepolitical difficulties in Greece. If the King were to return to greece, the situation there would become even worse and therewould be danger of civil war. It was most important, therefore,that the King should not leave this country with a view to returning to Greece.The Cabinet-Agreed that their existing policy in respect of Greeceshould be maintained, and that it was important that theKing of the Hellenes should not return to Greece at thiscritical stage.
Loans Board and a number of other persons chosen for their know-ledge and experience of financial, economic and industrial questions.Its functions would be advisory and not executive. In this respectit would differ from the National Investment Board which had forlong formed part of the Labour Party programme; but the position was different now that a Government was in power which was readyitself to take positive action to plan the use of the nation&apos;s economic resources. In present circumstances executive functions with regardto the control of investment should be exercised by the government itself.In discussion it was pointed out that, while the Bill would confer extremely important and far-reaching powers for the controlof investment, it was only a part of the comprehensive scheme whichwas being worked out for planning the use of the country&apos;s economic resources. Since it was not yet possible to present to the public afull picture of this scheme, it was desirable that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer should make it clear, when the Bill and the explana-tory memorandum were published, that they formed only part ofwider proposals for economic planning.It was also suggested that, in view of the probability of organised opposition to the Bill, steps should be taken to bring outclearly the bearing of these proposals on such matters of immediateinterest as the Governments social and industrial programmes witha view to ensuring that the public were not misled by the adversecriticism of a hostile press. It should also be explained that theobject of the Bill was not to restrict development but to stimulatedevelopment in the right directions.Other points in discussion were : (a) The Minister of Health asked whether it was now necessaryto retain the Finance Corporation for Industry and the industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that these two Corpora-tions were doing useful work. For the present he welcomed any contribution to industrial recovery. Later on he would considerwhether the functions of these Corporations could with advantage be absorbed by public agencies.(b) The Lord Chancellor said that he would raise on theLegislation Committee the question whether the provisions forenforcement and penalties were not too severe.(c) Should there not be some indication in Clause 2 that thepower to guarantee loans could be used to maintain a high and stable level of employment? Should not the Clause also apply to service as well as industries? ;The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that any furtherdefinition of the purposes for which this power could be used mighthave the effect of restricting his freedom of action. He would consider whether &apos;&apos; industry&apos;&apos; should be defined as covering&quot; services.&quot;(d) Attention was drawn to the proviso to Clause 1 (1), whichexempted from regulation the borrowing of money from a bank.Would this enable the control provided for in the Bill to be evaded ?The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the powers takenin this Bill must be considered in conjunction with those under clause 4 (3) of the Bank of England Bill, which would enable theGovernment to request information from and to make recom-mendations to bankers. These powers would prevent any abuse ofthe exemption given in the proviso.(e) It should be brought out, in explaining the effect of theBill, that Clause 1 would not only operate to guide investment intothe proper channels but would also serve to prevent the exploitation of the small investor by mushroom companies.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he intended to holda Press conference immediately after the Bill had been published,
and that he would see that both through this conference and in otherways the points which had been made with regard to the presentation of his proposals were adequately brought out.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to introduce the Investment (Control and Guarantees) Bill at an earlydate, after the text of the draft Bill had been examined by the Legislation Committee.(2) Approved the machinery for the control of investmentdescribed in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the memorandumaccompanying the Bill.(3) Took note that, in the light of the discussion, theChancellor of the Exchequer would take special steps tosee that his proposals were adequately presented to thepublic.BritishNationalityLaw.CanadianCitizenshipBill.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (45) 287) suggesting an early conference of expertsfrom the self-governing parts of the British Commonwealth to review the working of the existing principle by which a single code of British nationality was applied throughout the Commonwealth.This suggestion was occasioned by the action of the canadian government in introducing, without prior consultation with otherparts of the Commonwealth, a Nationality Bill which was inconsistent with that principle. This Canadian Bill proceeded onthe alternative principle that all persons possessing the citizenship of any part of the Commonwealth should be recognised as Britishsubjects throughout the Commonwealth. There would be someadvantages in adopting this alternative principle; but it was desirable that, if the change was to be made, it should be made withthe agreement of all the self-governing parts of the commonwealth and not by unilateral action on the part of a single member.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs supported thisproposal. The Dominions Office thought there would be advantages in developing the law of British nationality along the lines of theCanadian Bill. The President of the Board of Trade said thatsuch a development would be convenient from the point of view ofcommercial treaties. The Minister of Education said that such a development would make it easier to meet the demands of women&apos;organisations for amendment of the law governing the nationality of married women.As regards the composition of the proposed Conference, theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that the Governmentof Eire should be invited to send a representative; and he thoughtthat, if the Conference were held in Canada, Eire might be willingto take part in it. He did not think it necessary that Newfoundlandor Southern Rhodesia should be invited to send representatives.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the proposal for an early conference of experts onthe law of British nationality;(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to send a telegram to the United Kingdom High commissioner in Canada in the terms of the draft annexed to cp. (45) 287:(3) Agreed that Burma, Newfoundland and Southern Rhodesianeed not be invited to send representatives to this conference.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,22nd November, 1945.

It was the view ofthe Cabinet that all practicable steps should be taken toensure that the King remained in the United Kingdom Corthe t irne being.THE HOME SECRETARY (after withdrawing in orderto consult his advisers) informed the Cabinet that theHome Office had no legal powers to prevent the King from1e aving t hi s c ount ry.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that instructions had been given that no facilities under thecontrol of the Royel Air Force should be afforded toenable the King to leave this country by air.      He suggestedthat similar instructions should be- given by the Ministryof Civil Aviation.     The Secretary of the Cabinet was directed to inform the Minister of Civil Aviationaccordingly.The Cabinet asked the Foreign Secretary to verify that the Foreign Office were taking all practicable steps,  in consultation with all Departments concerned,  toensure that no facilities were given to the King of theHellenes to enable him to leave this country at the presenttime.Cabinet Office,  S.W.  1.
