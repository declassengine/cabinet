Parliament.business in the Houseof Commons.(previous reference:CM. (45) 55thConclusions,Minute 2.)1.   The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business-which it was proposed to take in the House of Commons duringthe following week.The Opposition had now tabled their Motion of Censure.Although it opened up a wide range of topics, this Motion would clearly be pressed as a Vote of Censure and facilities must, there-fore, be given to debate it. The Opposition desired a two-daydebate; but the Lord President said that, in view of the earlieropportunities which the Opposition might have taken to debatemost of the subjects covered by the Motion, he thought a single day&apos;debate would be sufficient.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that, if two days were allowed for this Motion, there would be a better prospect of passing through all stages in the House of Commons by the 11th Decemberthe Bills which the Government desired to complete before christmas. The Secretary of State for Dominion A ffairs confirmed that there would be difficulty in getting these Bills through theHouse of Lords before Christmas unless they passed the commons by the 11th December. On the other side The Lord Presidentstressed the need for breaking away from the war-time traditionthat two days were normally given to Censure debates.After further discussion the Cabinet agreed that the balanceof advantage lay on the side of offering two days for this debate,but making it clear that this should not be regarded as a precedent for the future.42SecretSessions.(previous reference:CM. (45) 38thConclusions,Minute 4.)ratification of BrettonWoodsAgreements.(previous reference:CM. (45) 50thConclusions.)The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the debate on the Motion of Censure should beheld on the 5th and 6th December; and that the Govern-ment spokesmen, in order of speaking, should be thePrime Minister, the President of the Board of Tradeand the Lord President.The Lord President referred to the Cabinet discussion on the4th October about the disclosure of Parliamentary proceedings heldin secret session.The Lord President said that the revocation of defence regulation 3 (2) had already removed the criminal sanction pro-prohibiting disclosure of proceedings in secret session. The Speakerdesired that the ban imposed by Parliamentary privilege should alsobe lifted. The Opposition had, however, indicated doubts about the expediency of lifting this ban, mainly on the ground that, as therewere no records of the speeches made in secret session, members or ex-Members would be at liberty to give garbled accounts of what had taken place. It thus appeared that the Government wouldhave to take the sole responsibility for proposing the removal of theban, and that their proposal might be challenged by the Opposition.It was the view of the Cabinet that, notwithstanding theattitude of the Opposition, the remaining restrictions on disclosure of procedings in secret session should now be removed&apos;.The Cabinet-(2) Reaffirmed the decisions taken at their meeting on the4th October; and invited the Lord President and theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs to proceed to seek the authority of both Houses of Parliament for theremoval of the remaining restrictions on disclosure of proceedings in secret session.The Lord President reminded the Cabinet that it was a partof the proposed agreement with the United States Government on financial questions and commercial policy that we should recommend to Parliament acceptance of the Bretton Woods Agreements. Statesdesiring to adhere to those Agreements had to do so before the31st December, 1945. If, therefore, the Washington discussionsresulted in an early agreement on financial questions and commercial policy, it would be necessary to pass a Bill ratifying the Bretton
Woods Agreements before Parliament rose for the christmas recess. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had considered whetherResolutions by both Houses of Parliament would be a sufficientratification, but he was satisfied that nothing short of an Act ofParliament would suffice for the purposes of the Agreements.In these circumstances The Lord President proposed that, ifthe Washington discussions reached a successful conclusion in thenear future, he should try to reach agreement with the speaker and the Opposition that the House of Commons should hold a widedebate, for which two days would have to be set aside, on thefinancial agreement, the commercial policy proposals and the bretton Woods Agreements, on the understanding that at the endof that debate the Bill ratifying the Bretton Woods agreements would be introduced and passed through all its stages.The Cabinet-(3) Agreed that, if occasion arose to promote legislationratifying the Bretton Woods Agreements before Par-liament rose for the Christmas Recess, the lord president should seek to secure the agreement of the speaker and the Opposition to the procedure outlined above.cabinet procedure.Times of meeting.2.. The Prime Minister said that it was desirable that the times of the regular meetings of the Cabinet should be adjusted soas to enable Ministers to attend Standing Committees of the Houseof Commons.After discussion of various alternative arrangements, theCabinet (1) Agreed that for the time being the regular weekly meetingsof the Cabinet should be held on Monday at 11 a.m. andThursday at 10 a.m.(2) Took note that, during the Parliamentary Recess, it wouldbe more convenient to revert to the practice of holdingthe regular weekly meetings On Tuesday and Thursdayat 11 a.m.WashingtonDiscussionson financial questions andCommercialPolicy.(previous reference:CM. (45) 50thConclusions.)3.   The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda : CP. (45) 312: by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,covering the draft of a financial agreement;CP. (45) 297: by the President of the Board of Trade,covering the text of the United States proposals on commercial policy and the draft of a statement which the President pro-posed to make in Parliament, subject to a satisfactory conclusion of the financial side of the negotiations;CP.
