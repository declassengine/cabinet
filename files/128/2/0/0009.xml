1.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the First i*Lord of the Admiralty (CP. (45) 291) submitting revised proposalsfor the New Construction Programme, 1945.The First Lord of the A dmiralty explained that his predecessorhad submitted in June a New Construction Programme (CP. (45) 54)based on the needs of the Navy for the war in the Far East. this programme had been drastically revised, in the light of the new situation created by the end of the Japanese war; and a new programme was now submitted which was based on the following principles : (i) to proceed at normal speed with vessels required forthe immediate replacement of outstandingly important deficiencies;and (ii) to proceed slowly with, or to defer, the construction of vessels which, though needed for the post-war Navy, could be used as acushion to absorb the shocks of the fluctuations in the shipbuilding industry. The cost of the revised programme would be only 3 million, as compared with a cost of  10 million for the earlierprogramme.Points in discussion were : (a) Special attention was drawn to the statement summarised at (ii) above. It was most important, from the point of view of theGovernments employment policy, that full weight should be givento the possibility of varying warship building in order to even outthe slumps and booms of merchant shipbuilding.(&amp;) Would it be possible for the Admiralty to submit to theCabinet corresponding information about prospective naval construction by other countries ?The First Lord of the Admiralty undertook to make enquiries on this point.(c) The Prime Minister said that, as part of a review ofproduction programmes for all three Services, the DefenceCommittee were already considering how much naval constructionshould be carried out in the immediate future; and he therefore suggested that the specific points dealt with in paragraphs 5-14of CP. (45) 291 should be remitted to the Defence Committee.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the revised proposals for the New construction programme, 1945, as follows : 1 experimental-type submarine.2 escort vessels.2 surveying ships.6 small floating docks.A number of miscellaneous small craft.(2) Agreed that the points raised in paragraphs 5-14 ofC.P. (45) 291 should be considered by the DefenceCommittee.naval construction programme.(previous reference:W.M.(44)65thConclusions,Minute 4.)Disposal ofthe german fleet.(previous reference:CM. (45) 14thConclusions,Minute 1.)[3097312. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that notice had beengiven of three Parliamentary Questions, for answer the following day, suggesting that captured German submarines should be broken up for scrap instead of being scuttled. It had been agreed at the berlin Conference that Great Britain, Russia and the United states should each retain ten German submarines for experimentalpurposes, and that the remainder of the German submarine fleetshould be sunk. It had been further agreed that no public announce-ment should be made about the disposal of the German Fleet untilall the detailed arrangements for carrying out the transfer of theships had been completed, and that a joint statement should then bepublished simultaneously by the three Governments. The purposeof withholding the public announcement had been to prevent Germancrews from scuttling ships ordered to sail to Allied ports; and onthis account the Russians were now inclined to urge that the issueb 2
of the joint statement should be deferred until the transfer of theships had been actually completed. Some information had, however,reached the Press to the effect that captured German submarines were to be sunk, and it was as a result of this that these questions were to be asked in Parliament. jThe Foreign Secretary said that there had been very greatdifficulty in reaching an agreed decision at the Berlin Conferenceabout the disposal of the German Fleet. The greatest care should therefore be taken to avoid leaving the Soviet Government with theimpression that we might now wish to modify that agreement. Thedecision to sink the balance of the captured German submarines hadbeen taken on political grounds : and it was politically important that we should stand firmly by that decision. He therefore asked that the answer to these Questions should not go beyond theannouncement included in the communique issued at the end of the berlin Conference. It should be on the lines that the BerlinConference had agreed in principle upon arrangements for thedisposal of the German Fleet; had agreed that a Commission of experts should be appointed to work out detailed plans to give effectto the agreed principles; and had further agreed that a joint statement should be published simultaneously by the three Govern-ments when the detailed plans had been completed. parliament should be invited to await that joint statement.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the suggestion made by the Foreign Secretary as summarised above.(2) Took note that the First Lord of the Admiralty would seek to get these Questions withdrawn from the Order Paper.(3) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to reply to theseQuestions, if they were asked, on the lines suggested above, and to settle the detailed terms of the reply inconsultation with the Foreign Secretary.3. The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda bythe Secretary of State for India :  CP. (45) 281 : reporting on the present situation in India;CP. (45) 296: reporting the conclusions reached by the india and Burma Committee as a result of their examination ofthe situation described in CP. (45) 281;CP. (45) 301 : covering the draft of a statement to be madein Parliament restating the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govern,ment towards India and announcing the proposal that a parliamentary Delegation should go to India under the auspices of the Empire Parliamentary Association;CP. (45) 303 : embodying the Viceroy&apos;s comments on thedraft statement appended to CP. (45) 301.The Secretary of State for India handed round copies of a revised draft of the statement designed to meet, in part, the comments made by the Viceroy. -The Cabinet had a full discussion of the probable developments in the political situation in India and the measures which might betaken to meet those developments. The discussion is recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of Cabinet Conclusions.The Cabinet-Invited the India and Burma Committee to review theposition, and to consider the draft of the statement to bemade in Parliament, in the light of the various points raised in the course of the Cabinets discussion.India.(previous reference:CM. (45)30thConclusions,Minute 1.)
Migration. 4.   In discussing, on the 11th Ooctober, a proposed agreement(Previous regarding emigration to Australia the Cabinet had expressed the reference: view that the Australian authorities should not be free to exerciseCM. (45) 40th their discretion to &quot; approve &quot; emigrants in such a way as to selectConclusions, only skilled industrial workers who could ill be spared by industryMinute 3.) in this country.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (CP. (45) 247) reporting that, in order to meet this point, a clause was to be inserted in theagreement requiring the Commonwealth Government to arrange forthe United Kingdom authorities concerned to be associated with theAustralian representatives, to such extent as might be mutually agreed, in the arrangements for examining and selecting applicants for free passages to Australia.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that advantage would be taken of this clause to see that the Ministry ofLabour and National Service were associated with the arrangementsfor the selection of emigrants, and it was hoped by this means tosecure that the Australian authorities would not select too high a proportion of skilled industrial workers.The Cabinet-Took note of CP. (45) 247 and of the statement by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs.Newfoundland. 5 The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (CP. (45) 292) commentingReference: on the points raised in their earlier discussion on the 1st NovemberCM. (45)48th of his proposals for enabling the people of Newfoundland to decideConclusions,     their future form of government.minute 5.) Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs recalled that inthe earlier discussion it had been suggested that the proposed national Convention might be constituted on a vocational, insteadof a geographical, basis of election in order to prevent an undulyhigh representation of business and financial interests. He hadtaken the advice of the Commission of Government on this point and, after full consideration, he was satisfied that the suggestion would be impracticable, for the reasons summarised in paragraph 2of his memorandum. He agreed, however, that it was important toensure that the Convention adequately represented the interests ofthe Islanders themselves; and for this purpose he proposed that itshould be made a requirement that every candidate should haveresided in his constituency for the two years immediately preceding the election.He had also considered the suggestion that the report of theproposed Convention should be considered by an ImperialConference. He was, however, satisfied that a change in newfoundland&apos;s status was a matter for settlement betweenNewfoundland and the Parliament of Westminster. Discussion ofsuch a question at an Imperial Conference would be embarrassing,not only to Newfoundland, but also to the Dominions, particularlyCanada.The third suggestion made in the Cabinets earlier discussion was that the proposed announcement in Parliament might be substantially shorter than he had previously contemplated. Hethought it would be appropriate that he should make a full announce-ment in the House of Lords, on the lines of the draft annexed to hisearlier memorandum (CP. (45) 234); but he now submitted (in the annex to CP. (45) 292) a shorter draft for use in the House ofCommons.The Cabinet endorsed the conclusions reached by the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs on the points which had been raised at their earlier meeting. Discussion turned on the terms of theproposed announcement in Parliament.   Some doubt was expressed
about the expediency of including in this announcement the reference (at the beginning of the penultimate paragraph of thedraft annexed to CP. (45) 292) to the difficulty of providing fromthe United Kingdom further financial assistance for Newfoundland.This passage seemed to be destined to encourage the view thatNewfoundlands ultimate destiny lay in union with Canada. At the cabinets earlier discussion, however, some Ministers had doubted whether it should be assumed at this stage, without further discussion, that the ideal solution of Newfound land&apos;s difficulties layin union with Canada. On this point there had been some difference of view, but it had been agreed that there could be no question ofCanada&apos;s assuming any responsibility for Newfoundland unless theinitiative came from the Newfoundlanders themselves. In thesecircumstances it seemed preferable that the statement of policy tobe made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government should not containany hint of union with Canada.The Secretary of State for Dom/inion Affairs agreed to deletefrom the draft statement annexed to CP. (45) 292 the first threesentences of the penultimate paragraph, and the words &apos;&apos; on this account&apos;&apos; at the end of that paragraph; and to make correspondingchanges in the final paragraph of the longer statement to be madein the House of Lords (Appendix A of CP. (45) 234).The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals set out in CP. (45) 234 and 292 for enabling the people of Newfoundland to choose their future form of government.(2) Agreed that simultaneous announcements of these proposals should be made in the House of Lords and the House ofCommons respectively, in the terms of the draftsannexed to CP. (45) 234 and 292, subject to the textualamendments noted above.Palestine. 6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofTreatment of    State for the Colonies (CP. (45) 294) regarding the treatmentRenegades.      of certain Palestine Arabs who had co-operated with the enemyduring the war.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the palestine government were ready to deal under their own law with fourteenof these renegades, but there were a further twenty-one (includingthe Mufti) whom the Palestine Government did not wish to seebrought back to Palestine. For the reasons summarised inparagraph 8 of his memorandum it was considered inexpedient toput any of these men on trial, either as war criminals or under theDefence Regulations; and it was proposed that they should be sentto the Seychelles and detained there as political prisoners.In discussion it was pointed out that public attention wouldbe drawn to the fact that no proceedings were being taken against these men, and this policy would be contrasted with that adoptedby the Government of India in respect of Indian nationalists whohad co-operated with the Japanese. The Cabinet agreed that, none the less, the balance of advantage was against putting thesePalestine renegades on trial.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Mufti, and the other Palestine renegadeswhose return to Palestine was not desired by thePalestine Government, should be sent to the Seychellesand detained there as political prisoners.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to arrangefor these men to be sent to the Seychelles without coming to the United Kingdom en route.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,27th November, 1945.
