secret parliamentary 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons in the following week.secret oversea 2.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the affairs visit of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Bangla Desh leader, to LondonBangla Desh following his release from imprisonment in West Pakistan had comeas a surprise. President Bhutto of Pakistan had been unwilling for him to be flown by Pakistan aircraft to Dacca or Delhi and had offered a number of alternative destinations in Asia; Sheikh Mujibhad himself preferred London to any of these and had subsequentlyaccepted the offer of transportation to Dacca by RAF aircraft in preference to an Indian aircraft which was also on offer. TheForeign and Commonwealth Secretary judged that President Bhuttowas now reconciled to the loss of East Pakistan, but that this wasnot yet wholly accepted by the public in West Pakistan. SheikhMujib had indicated that there was no prospect of establishing any formal links between Bangla Desh and Pakistan and that he would welcome early British recognition of his State. This presentedproblems for us; in particular it could not be said that our normalcriteria for recognition had been met so long as the Indian Armyremained in Bangla Pesh in force. Nevertheless, the presence ofthe Indian Army was probably essential for the maintenance ofinternal security, while to recognise Bangla Desh soon would usefullystrengthen the moderates there and would be likely to serve oursubstantial commercial interests. He was consulting PresidentBhutto and the United States Government and proposed to give further consideration to the possibility of early recognition when hehad received their views.The Prime Minister said he had been favourably impressed bySheikh Mujibur Rahman. Considering that he had been imprisonedfor months, much of the time in solitary confinement, he appearedwell informed and reasonable. He had made it clear that he intendedto be master within Bangla Desh; that he wanted the Indian army to withdraw just as soon as this could safely be arranged; and thatin international relations he would tend to steer Bangla Desh alonga non-aligned course, although he was anxious to establish close relations with this country and with other members of theCommonwealth. It had been explained to him that while we should do our best to grant early recognition we considered it important thatthis should not be rushed; it would be wise to wait at least until wehad seen more clearly how relations between the three States which now existed in the sub-continent were likely to develop.In a brief discussion it was noted that immediate arrangements to resume the shipment of jute for the Dundee industry had alreadybeen made; in the longer term the dependability of supplies would beaffected by the attitude of the Government of Bangla Desh and bythe arrangements which we were able to make with them.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it wasagreed that there were strong arguments for the early recognition ofBangla Desh and that the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary was authorised to arrange for this when he judged that the141569-1
appropriate time had come; some of our European allies and the older Commonwealth countries might be glad to recognise at aboutthe same time as ourselves. Although it was right that the views ofthe United States Government should be sought we were under no obligation to them in the matter.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.MaltaPreviousReference:CM (71) 58thConclusions,Minute 2The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that followingour decision to begin a withdrawal from Malta rather than accede to the demand of the Prime Minister of Malta, Mr. Mintoff, thatwe should make a further payment of  4-25 million by 31 December,there had been further discussions with our allies in the north atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), some of whose members were showing signs of weakening in their attitude to Mr. Mintoffsdemands. The North Atlantic Council were meeting that day. Itwas to be hoped that they would confirm that NATO&apos;s offer to malta for an annual payment remained at  9-5 million and would accept that any further offers of bilateral assistance they might now wish to put forward should be subject to the signature of asatisfactory defence agreement. The latest message from Mr.Mintoff was unbalanced and intemperately worded, however, and it remained very doubtful whether we had any real hope of doing morethan achieve an orderly withdrawal.The Secretary of State for Defence said that the danger of a splitbetween ourselves and our allies on the handling of Mr. Mintoff now appeared somewhat to have receded but the situation in Malta itself was still dangerous. The withdrawal date which Mr. Mintoff had now stipulated (15 January) might be the occasion for attempts toharass our forces. All dependants would by then have left but itwould take a total of about three months to withdraw our forces andtheir equipment, which totalled some 80,000 tons and was valued at 20-25 million. Even to withdraw the forces without their equipment would take until the end of January. Supplies of CSgas and rubber bullets had been despatched in order to deal with possible riot situations which the Malta Government might seek toengineer.In discussion it was pointed out that, apart from its intrinsicdemerits, a situation in which large quantities of stores were left behind in Malta could create some domestic political difficulty. Itwas also noted that Archbishop Gonzi, during his brief visit toLondon earlier that week&apos;, had expressed great anxiety about the policies of the present Malta Government. His only suggestion,however, had been that NATO&apos;s offer should be increased to  15million a year, on the basis that if Mr. Mintoff refused such an offerpublic opinion would compel him to abandon office. Our position,including our unwillingness to provide any more cash ourselves, hadbeen made clear to him.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that wehad made all the dispositions necessary to complete an orderlywithdrawal. The next move would probably depend on the outcome of the North Atlantic Council&apos;s discussion that day. The foreign and Commonwealth Secretary would no doubt wish to put to hiscolleagues on the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee in thenear future his proposals for dealing with the developing situation.It should at that stage also be possible to take a decision on thepublication of a White Paper, a draft of which had been circulatedto the Cabinet by the Secretary of State under cover of his noteCP (72) 4.The Cabinet (2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion, and invited the Secretary of Statefor Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs to proceed accordingly.confidential industrial 3.   The Secretary of State for Employment gave the CabinetAffairs an account of developments leading to the breakdown of payGoal Miners&apos; negotiations between the National Coal Board (NCB) and theStrike National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and the national miners&apos;Previous        strike which had begun on 9 January. He had invited both sides to reference:      tne Department of Employment on 7 January, in line with practiceCM (71) 63rd    adopted for previous disputes, so that he could be fully informed of conclusions,    their positions; but the NUM had refused the invitation. They had minute 3       also refused, as they were fully entitled to do under their agreements,to invoke the industry&apos;s arbitration machinery.   Although someminers might have been ready to accept the NCB&apos;s last pay offer, all were observing the official strike; in some militant areas the NUM&apos;advice that their members should undertake work necessary tomaintain safety in the mines was being disregarded and this was a cause of some concern. The NUM&apos;s attempt td rally official support from other unions for the strike had met with a poor response, butthey were likely to secure some backing unofficially or at local level,for example in preventing the movement of imported coal from thepotts. The absence of financial help from other unions would notembarras the NUM, since they would not be paying strike benefitto their members, who would, however, be receiving any tax refunds&quot; to which they might be entitled, and Supplementary Benefit inrespect of their families subject to the more stringent rules recently introduced as regards its assessment.It must be expected that the strike would continue for at least a month but, having regard to its importance for the battle against inflation, the Government should resolve not to seek a settlementat a price higher than the cost of the NCB&apos;s last pay offer. it seemed unlikely that this objective could be achieved by resort to arbitration or a court of inquiry. The Government would thus need to be ready, at the appropriate time, to offer themselves to conciliate,despite the risks involved in their becoming identified with theSettlement, He had considered but rejected use of the provision inthe Industrial Relations Act enabling him to apply for a restraint141569-1B*
order to defer the strike, since it would have been difficult to meetthe &quot; emergency effects test&quot; to justify such an application, or to argue that the strike had been called without leaving adequateopportunities for negotiation or that its deferment would beconducive to a settlement. There might at a later stage be a case for seeking from the National Industrial Relations Court a ballotorder to test support of the strike, particularly if a proposalemerged from conciliation which the NUM were disinclined to put totheir membership themselves. His Department were accordinglymaking contingency plans against the possible need to apply for a ballot order at some future date, though he would have preferred that the first use of this power should be made in a less importantdispute than the coal strike.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that a dutyroom had been set up in his Department to monitor developments and to deal with day-to-day problems arising during the strike;officials of all interested Departments would also be meetingregularly. The strike should have no immediate effects on theelectricity or gas industries and stocks generally were good; sporadicshortages would however arise and, in particular, steel production was likely to be affected. He agreed that it would be inappropriateto invoke the Industrial Relations Act at present, but this would need to be reconsidered should it become necessary to takeemergency powers.In discussion, there was general agreement that sure handling of the dispute would be of critical importance to the continuedsuccess of the Government^ policies for reducing cost inflation andthe level of wage settlements. A prolonged strike would however cause growing difficulties with fuel supplies, and possiblyindividual hardship, particularly if the weather were cold. Theminers still commanded a considerable degree of public sympathy,with which the Opposition would seek to identify themselves, andafter Parliament resumed the Government could expect to be undermounting political challenge over their handling of the dispute. TheGovernment should appear neither over anxious about the strikenor indifferent to promoting a settlement. So far as possible theyshould avoid becoming directly involved in a confrontation with theminers and should leave the day-to-day handling of developments tothe NCB. But it must be their firm objective to secure that theultimate resumption of work would be on the basis of concessionsno greater than those on offer to the miners before the strike. Whenthe time came for conciliation or it became necessary to takeemergency powers, parallel consideration should be given to the useof the ballot order provisions of the Industrial Relations Act.Meanwhile the presentational handling of the dispute both by ministers and the NCB would be of great importance, and while itwould normally be desirable to leave the industry itself to play the major part, the NCB&apos;s handling of publicity for their side of thecase had so far been uncertain.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theLord President of the Council and the Secretary of State for Tradeand Industry should urgently give further consideration to public
presentational aspects of the dispute; the Secretary of State for Tradeand Industry should also arrange for a daily progress report of developments during the strike to be supplied to himself, the HomeSecretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Lord President andthe Secretaries of State for Defence, for Social Services, for employment, for Scotland, for the Environment and for Wales. TheHome Secretary should arrange for the Ministerial and OfficialCommittees on Emergencies to make regular assessments of thesituation as the strike proceeded.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Home secretary and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to be guided accordingly.(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, tomake appropriate arrangements for ensuring the public presentation by the Government and the National coal board was handled to best advantage.CONFIDENTIALMetrication 4.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the SecretaryDraft White of State for Trade and Industry (CP (72) 2), to which was appendedPaper a draft White Paper on Metrication.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that inNovember 1970, and subsequently the Government had promised to publish a White Paper setting out their policy on Metrication, andhad also indicated that Statutory Instruments on the subject wouldnot be made in the meantime. Evidence was now appearing in theNational Press of the mounting concern in industry about the delay in publishing the White Paper; and delay would increase the cost ofmetrication. There was also growing public and Parliamentaryinterest in the directive which had been adopted by the european economic Community (e.c.) on units of measurement. A white paper was the best means of explaining Government policy on thesubject, while any further delay would tend to give an impression that the Government had something to hide and would thus playinto the hands of those Members of Parliament who opposedUnited Kingdom entry to the e.c.. The draft White Paperappended to his memorandum took account of recent developments in the e.c. and of the views expressed on earlier drafts by the ministerial Committee on Economic Policy. The passage on the eec directive reflected the agreement reached with the community on 22 December under which all our units would remain lawful untilthe end of 1979 and some might be retained beyond then: the precise text of this passage might, however, need amendment in thelight of the terms in which this agreement was expressed inthe Treaty. A particular problem had arisen over the passage in theWhite Paper dealing with the pricing of groceries sold in standard
size packets. It was important that the Government should beseen to be taking firm action to ensure that food manufacturers and retailers did not take the opportunity of metrication to increase theirprofit margins. In his view, a statement in purely general terms would be inadequate to reassure consumers on this point. Thedraft White Paper therefore suggested the possibility of requiringthese goods to be marked with comparative prices in both metric and imperial quantities, although it also indicated that this proposal would be discussed with the industry and the consumer organisations,and that the Government would be willing to consider any effectivealternative method of ensuring that the consumer would not be exploited. If the Cabinet agreed, and subject to any necessarydrafting amendments to the passage dealing with the e.c. directive,he proposed that the White Paper should be published at theearliest practicable date.The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that he fully agreed with the need to help the housewife to get value for money during the period of metrication. This would however bemuch more difficult than on the occasion of decimalisation. Thesuggestion that the White Paper should mention comparative pricinghad been raised only recently, and such soundings as he had since been able to make in the food industry indicated that even the most efficient members of the retail trade would see serious difficulties inits introduction. If the Government were to commit themselves tothis particular proposal now it would be more difficult to drawback later, and the trade would be led to argue both that metricationwould be harmful to the consumer and that the Government were responsible for additional costs which were being passed on in higher prices. Full discussion was necessary with the trade before anyparticular proposal was endorsed, and in the meantime it would be preferable simply to say in general terms that the Government were determined to protect the consumer and would be discussing withthe interested bodies how best to achieve this objective. He alsodid not agree with the judgment in Annex II of the draft white paper that the food industry would be gravely handicapped if it were obliged to adhere to imperial-sized packets on the home market; andhe would prefer to see this Annex omitted altogether * on the groundthat its inclusion would exaggerate the importance of food problems in the context of metrication.In discussion it was argued that the Confederation of BritishIndustry was pressing for early publication of the White Paper, andit would not seem practicable to defer publication until afterconsultations with the food industry had taken place^. The inclusionof the proposal for comparative pricing had been intended to allay the fears of the housewife about the effect of metrication on food prices, and consumer interests would criticise the White Paper if it only Offered general reassurances on this issue. On the other hand,it was suggested that manufacturing industry was anyway pressingahead with metrication as quickly as it thought desirable. There wasa real risk that metrication would be taken as an occasion by the retail trade to increase prices unduly, and it would be unfortunate if the trade were enabled to argue that this was due to Government
action. Retailers would in any case be concerned about theadditional work falling on them in connection with the value added tax, and given the concern that would be felt by the public generally on metrication, it might be better not to commit the Government atthis stage to particular controversial proposals.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet considered that the draft White Paper should seek to reassure the consumer without committing the Government to any specific method to protect him against unwarranted increases in theprice of foodstuffs. The Secretary of State for Trade and industry should consider, in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Lord President of the Council and the Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food, how the draft White Paper could best be modified accordingly. Subject to this and to any furtherminor drafting amendments which might be necessary, the Secretaryof State should then arrange for publication on a date to be agreed with the Lord President.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion, and invited the Secretary of Statefor Trade and Industry to proceed accordingly.CONFIDENTIALLocal Elections 5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (CP (72) 3)Minimum Age by the Secretary of State for the Home Department on the minimumfor Candidates qualifying age for candidates for local elections.The Home Secretary said that the Opposition had tabled an amendment for the Committee Stage of the Local Government Billto reduce the minimum qualifying age for membership of a localauthority from 21 to 18. The Home and Social Affairs Committeehad considered the possibility of announcing before the amendmentwas debated a decision to make the change for local elections or alternatively of allowing a free vote upon the issue. It was, however,thought that there would be misgivings, particularly among government supporters, and in any event either of those courseswould largely pre-empt a decision on whether a correspondingchange should be made for Parliamentary elections. The Committeehad, therefore, concluded that the best course would be to take theinitiative by announcing immediately that the question of a changefor Parliamentary elections would be referred to a speakers conference later in the year; meanwhile the amendment would be opposed on the ground that a decision in relation to local electionsshould wait the outcome of the Conference.The Secretary of State for the Environment said that theOpposition appeared to be firmly committed to reducing theminimum age for membership of a local authority to 18 and that aproposal to convene a Speakers Conference would not prevent them from pressing amendment on the Committee Stage and possiblyfurther on Report. The Government^ opposition to it at each stage
would involve them in unpopularity which would be needless ifultimately a Speakers Conference were to recommend the change,and it was decided to reduce the age both for Parliamentary andlocal elections. A person who was entitled to vote for local govern-ment elections at the age of 18 should logically be qualified to standin such elections.In discussion serious doubt was expressed over the wisdom ofmaking the change immediately. The fact that the minimum age for voting was 18 did not lead logically to the conclusion that theminimum age for membership of Parliament or a local authority should be correspondingly reduced. Exercising the responsibilities of an elected representative was quite different from casting a vote.A situation of particular concern might arise if a student of 18was elected in a university town on the strength of the votes of his fellow students, who could, under the law as it now stood,be registered in that town. Moreover it would be incongruous if astudent of the age of 18 became a member of the local authority thatemployed his own teachers, who themselves were debarred from membership of that authority. But in any event a decision on localauthority qualifications should not be taken in advance of a decisionon the qualifications for membership of Parliament. There was some danger even in a decision to convene a Speakers Conference, sincethe balance of probability was that such a Conference would recommend a reduction in the age; and there was a case for standingfirmly against the change and taking no further action. It was argued on the other hand that the reduction of the qualifying age for membership did not mean that any substantial numbers of people under 21 would be elected; it was simply a question ofenlarging the choice available to the electorate, and allowing those over 18 to offer themselves for election.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) For general purposes 18 was now the age of majority. Ifthe minimum age for membership of Parliament and of localauthorities was reduced, it would be hard to avoid making 18 theminimum qualifying age also for jury service and this might be amatter for greater concern.(b) If a Speakers Conference were convened, to consider theage qualification, it should be asked to consider also the studenfsresidential qualification for voting.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thegeneral view of the Cabinet was that it would be unwise to make animmediate change for local government purposes. A speakers conference was the proper machinery for considering changes ofthis kind in the qualification for membership of Parliament; and itwas generally agreed that a decision to alter that qualification ought not to be prejudiced by ah earlier change in the qualification for membership of a local authority. The Opposition might be persuaded to recognise this. The Lord President of the Council, inconsultation with the Home Secretary, should sound out theOpposition Parties on their attitude to the proposal that a speakers conference should be convened to consider the Parliamentary agequalification (and also the studenfs residential qualification for
voting) and a decision on the local government qualification deferred.The result of this consultation should be reported to him and hewould consider whether the matter should be further discussed in cabinet.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion, and invited the Lord President ofthe Council to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office,11 January, 1972.
