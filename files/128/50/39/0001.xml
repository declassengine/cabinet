The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said it was too early to assess how far the Soviet military withdrawal from egypt would be taken. It appeared that Soviet personnel manning SAM-3missile sites and instructors engaged in MiG training were still there.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that SenorLopez Bravo, the Spanish Foreign Minister, had brought with himon his recent visit to London a paper proposing a treaty between our two countries. This would involve transferring sovereignty over Gibraltar to Spain, but would at the same time provide for an autonomous regime in Gibraltar preserving all Gibraltar&apos;s existinglegal, administrative and customary forms. Such a proposal wouldnot be acceptable to the Gibraltarians it would, for instance, involvethe appointment of a Spanish Commissioner of Police. SenorLopez Bravo had been persuaded not to deliver the proposals inwritten form and had agreed with reluctance to take the paper awayfor further consideration. It was our aim to keep the dialogue with spain going the next meeting with Senor Lopez Bravo was dueto take place in October and Sir Joshua Hassan, Chief Minister of gibraltar, had expressed satisfaction that the process of &quot; thinkingtogether &quot; was continuing. Unfortunately the Spanish, in the absenceof agreement over Gibraltar, would not commit themselves to placinglarge orders in this country for re-equipping their navy.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.northern ireland previous reference:CM (72) 37thConclusions,Minute 5CONFIDENTIAL3. The Cabinet were informed of the latest developments inNorthern Ireland. Their discussions and the conclusions reachedwere separately recorded and issued only to The Queen, the PrimeMinister and those Ministers who had to take action.The conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file heldby the Secretary of the Cabinet.Parliamentary 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons in the following week. It was proposed thatthe House should rise on Wednesday 9 August and should reassemblein the week beginning 16 October. The House of Lords would notrise until at least Friday 11 August; and it was proposed that theyshould return on Monday 11 September for a period of not more than two weeks before adjourning again until 16 October.
confidential industrial 4.   The Secretary of State for Employment said that the decisionAffairs by the General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) the docks Dispute previous day to call a one-day national strike on the followingPrevious Monday unless the five dockers in prison were by then released had reference: been taken by 18 votes to 7, with 6 abstentions. The TUC wouldCM (72) 37th meet again later that day to review their decision in the light of theConclusions, men&apos;s release; and, although they might be expected to call off the minute 7 strike, there would be strong pressures within the TUC for a strikestill to be held as a demonstration of the strength of feeling againstthe Industrial Relations Act. The outcome was by no means certain.It seemed likly that, even if the TUC called off the official strike anumber of unions, including the National Graphical Association,would hold one-day protest strikes on Monday on this basis.Mr. Jack Jones, the General Secretary of the Transport and general works Union (TGWU), had also called for a one-day proteststrike, but this appeared to be bound up with tactics to secure theacceptance by the dockers&apos; Delegate Conference taking place that dayof the recommendations in the Interim Report of the Joint SpecialCommittee on the future of the dock industry. It would be important,in the context of other expected confrontations with individualunions, later in the year, to render the impact of any strike asinnocuous as possible by seeking to minimise publicly the incon-venience which had been caused. There was also a risk that, despite the release of the five dockers, blacking of container depots wouldbe resumed. If these circumstances arose it would be inevitable that action should be taken against the union concerned, if the industrial relations Act were not to lose credibility. It would be desirable for him to see Mr. Jones to make this clear; it might then be possibleto obtain some co-operation from the TGWU in preventing suchblacking.The Lord Privy Seal said that a review of the situation that morning had shown that there had been a fairly widespread returnto work as a result of the release of the dockers. Some portsemploying non-registered dockers were now operating again, as were coalmines in South Wales. The TUC had agreed that, if thenational strike on the following Monday took place, essential services such as medical supplies ambulances, fire services, telephones,water, gas and electricity should be kept in operation. There would,however, be no public transport and little movement at docks andairports. The Customs and Excise and Immigration services were likely to be severely curtailed and there might be some delay in thepayment of social security benefits. The Milk- Marketing board might have difficulty in distributing milk and in disposing of theunused milk, the cost of which, amounting to about  1 million, might eventually fall on the Exchequer. Departments responsible for the nationalised industries were already discussing with them theproblems which might arise in the maintenance of essential services.Since there would be no newspapers it was important to endeavourto ensure that radio and television news services were still broadcast.Although the absence of public transport would undoubtedly leadto traffic congestion in the major cities, there appeared to be
insufficient justification in the case of a one-day strike for introducingspecial arrangements other than the traffic control and parkingarrangements which the Metropolitan Police were accustomed toimplementing in such circumstances. The need to distribute essential supplies held at the docks was not at present sufficient to justifythe declaration of a State of Emergency, but it should be noted that,if it were desired to do this urgently on political grounds, there wereproblems, such as the printing of the Emergency Regulations in theevent of a national strike, which meant that a decision would bedesirable by that afternoon if the Regulations were to come intoeffect before the following Wednesday.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for employment and the Lord Privy Seal.further provision forHeating in theSupplementaryBenefitsSchemePreviousReference:CM (72) 36thConclusions,Minute 5CONFIDENTIAL5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Social Services (CP (72) 82) about further provision forheating in the Supplementary Benefits Scheme.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that there wasmounting public and Parliamentary criticism that significant numbersof supplementary pensioners were cold in winter and suffered muchmisery because they could not afford to heat themselves adequately.The Opposition would certainly focus attention on this criticism and attribute the blame to a mean and indifferent Government;there were already indications of concern amongst the Governmenfsown supporters; and in the coming winter the criticism would growas disturbing cases were brought to light as a result of campaigns todraw attention to the plight of the old and cold. Even with the increases in supplementary benefits to be made next October, thepresent provision would not be substantial enough to rest on next winter. The next all-round increase in benefits was not due untilNovember 1973; and it would be claimed that price increases afternext October discredited the Governmenfs promise to protect themost vulnerable next year. In preparation for the coming winterhe was arranging for local authorities and voluntary bodies to helpidentify old people with heating needs in order that the Supplemen-tary Benefits Commission could consider helping in cash under theirdiscretionary powers and that local authorities could considerimproving living conditions. The new local authority social service departments were, however, still finding their feet and it was clearthat next winter at least there would still be many people at risk who might be entitled to special help with heating costs under the supplementary benefit scheme but who would not receive it becausethey could not be identified. He proposed, therefore, that the generalsupplementary benefit provision for heating should be increased byan extra provision consisting of a lump sum payment intended as ageneral contribution towards winter heating costs. A lump sumwould be preferable to the alternative of an additional weekly
payment for a defined number of weeks. To meet the need the lump sum could not be much less than  10, but it could not be muchmore without upsetting the relativities within the supplementary benefits scheme. Broadly, it would be made to all recipients ofsupplementary benefit who received the long-term addition, namely,supplementary pensioners (about 1,900,000) and those under pension age who had been in receipt of benefit for at least two years (about300,000). Supplementary pensioners in residential accommodation would be excluded since they did not have to meet heating costs.The cost would be some  22 million. He could offer no savings from the social security programme to offset this extra cost and indeed he believed that the programme already made insufficientprovision for improvement in the level of benefits and in other respects. A short Bill of two clauses would need to be enacted veryspeedily at the beginning of the new Parliamentary Session. Ifpayments were to start towards the end of November it would benecessary to make a decision now, so that the necessary administrativepreparations could be put in hand. In future there would beprogressive improvement in the identification of people at risk butonce there was a power to make lump sum payments it would bedifficult to avoid repeating the payments at least in any year inwhich there was not a general uprating&apos; in relation to pricemovements. Indeed the possibility of making a lump sum supple-mentary benefit payment for heating would be one of the factors tobe taken into account in the uprating policy. The Home and social affairs Committee had considered the proposals and were attracted by the general arguments in favour of them although they consideredthat it would be preferable to present them as an extra winterallowance rather than as provision specifically for heating. Fromthe political point of view he believed that his proposals commandeda high degree of priority. Action must be taken now if it was to betaken at all; it would be too late when the criticisms were made.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that while he recognised the nature of the problem, he must advise the Cabinet not to acceptthe proposals. The extra cost of  22 million could not be met unlesscompensating savings were made in other directions. Moreover,once these payments had been made, it would not be possible toavoid similar payments in future years. Although the increases in benefits already announced might be criticised as inadequate, therehad been two increases in real terms in the past three years; more-over, we had also announced our intention to review the benefitsannually in future. The proposal offended against the principleof providing extra financial assistance on a selective basis. Eventhose already receiving a supplementary allowance&apos; for heating would receive the lump sum payment now proposed.In discussion it was argued that the proposal had merit because ofthe difficulties caused to old people as a result of inflation and becauseof the present inability to identify all those in need. A lump sum payment not only would make more impact than a weekly payment,but also would meet a need at a time when substantial expenditurehad to be incurred. On the other hand concern was expressed thata payment on the basis proposed would have to be repeated in
future years in one form or another. Moreover, if the policy ofproviding selective assistance, to which the Government had in thepast attached importance were breached in this way, there wouldbe severe criticism from those who had supported such a policy. Itwould also become increasingly difficult to resist other claims forassistance on a similar basis.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theconsensus was not in favour of accepting the proposal in CP (72) 82.It would be preferable to deal with the problem by seeking out thosein real need. The most effective publicity should be given to the help which people could obtain from the Supplementary BenefitsCommission towards their heating costs. In addition, a major effort should be made to identify those in need; the number of domiciliaryvisits should be increased so far as practicable, and urgent consideration should be given to ways of recruiting more volunteers for this work. It was for consideration whether in the long-term itmight be possible to recast the supplementary benefit scheme toprovide for lump sum payments at particular times of the year;further thought should be given to this possibility.The Cabinet 1.   Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.2.   Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services (i) to make arrangements, in consultation with theChancellor of Exchequer and the Home secretary and Lord President of the Council, for an effectivecampaign of publicity to be undertaken;(ii) to arrange for efforts to identify those in need to be intensified,as indicated in the Prime Minister^ summing up.
