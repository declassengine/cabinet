ParliamentaryAffairsNorthernIrelandLegislationBusiness in theHouse of LordsSECRET1. The Prime Minister expressed the Cabinefs congratulations to the Leader of the House, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,the Chief Whip and the Solicitor-General on the successfulcompletion of the Committee Stage of the European CommunitiesBill without amendment in the House of Commons on the previous evening.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Lord President of the Council said that, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, he proposed toarrange for a Committee of the House of Commons to be established to examine Northern Ireland legislation. The Committee wouldbe concerned with future Orders in Council on new matters initiated by the Secretary of State; Orders which dealt with currently urgent matters or with the implementation of proposals inherited from thesuspended Government of Northern Ireland at Stormont would haveto be disposed of under the normal Affirmative resolution procedure. He proposed, however, to provide a whole day for debate on the Order on Electoral Law, which would include provisionfor proportional representation. These proposals should meet withthe approval both of the official Opposition and of Government back-benchers generally, except for the Ulster Unionists.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the statement by the lord president of the Council.The Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet of the arrangements proposed for consideration of the European Communities Bill andthe Local Government Bill in the House of Lords. The House ofLords would probably not rise for the Summer Adjournment until11 August at the earliest; and they would probably have to returnfor at least one week in September in order to complete the LocalGovernment Bill. It would be helpful in countering possible criticism of these arrangements if he could give an assurance that more bills would be started in the House of Lords at the beginning of the next session.The Cabinet-Took note of the Lord Privy seal&apos;s statement and agreedthat he should give the assurance which he had proposed.allegations of FinancialCorruption in public LifeSECRET*2. The Cabinet considered the attitude which the Governmentshould adopt towards a Parliamentary Motion on Allegations ofFinancial Corruption in Public Life which had been tabled by theLiberal Party in the following terms:&quot; That this House, gravely concerned at the allegations madeby Mr. John Poulson in bankruptcy court proceedings that he
had paid substantial sums of money to two backbench Membersof Parliament, another substantial payment to a body at therequest of a Privy Counsellor, further payments to a senior civil servant and to two other persons holding prominent positions in public life, and mindful of the deserved reputation of thiscountry for probity in public life, calls on Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to order an immediate inquiry into the matter witha view to reporting to this House on the the truth or otherwise ofthese allegations; and further believes that the fact that suchallegations can be made has shown the lack of wisdom of successive Governments in rejecting the evidence given by theLiberal Parliamentary Party to the Select Committee on members&apos; Interests (Declaration) 1969 and the draft recom-mendations of the Liberal Member on that Committee.&quot;In discussion it was generally agreed that, although the Governmentwould need to give an early indication of their intentions as regardsthe questions which were the subject of this Motion, it was difficultto decide what attitude they should adopt until more information was available and the issues involved had been more fully considered.In particular:(a) The bankruptcy proceedings in question had been interrupted by the illness of Mr. Poulson and might not be resumed until thefollowing month. Since they were directed only to ascertaining the precise disposition of certain sums of money, it could not necessarily be argued that any separate inquiry into the allegations of corruptionto which they had given rise should not be put in hand on the grounds that the issue in question was sub judice. Even so, it might be prudent, before deciding whether any inquiry should be instituted, to wait at least until evidence in the bankruptcy proceedings had beencompleted.(b) It would be important to define carefully the precise scope and purpose of any inquiry which might be authorised. If forexample, it was alleged that a Member of Parliament had committedacts which, if they were substantiated, would constitute criminal offences, that would presumably be a matter for the criminal courts,not for a Parliamentary inquiry. The only allegation into which parliament could properly inquire was a charge that a Member ofParliament had in some way abused his position as a Member; andin this context it would be essential not to compromise the established practice whereby Members of Parliament pursued many different types of activity outside the House of Commons, often in return forremuneration which involved no impropriety of any4cind.(c) In so far as an inquiry into the conduct of certain Membersof Parliament might prove desirable, it would be for consideration whether this should be entrusted to a Select Committee or, perhapspreferably, to the Committee on Privileges. But it would not be easy.to find any form of inquiry, short of a tribunal under the tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 which could appropriatelycomprehend all the different categories of individual whose conductwas called in question by the Motion.   The senior civil servant
involved would best be dealt with by the normal disciplinaryprocedures of the public service; but it would be important to anticipate any criticism that the Government were acting more strictlyor more rapidly in the case of,a civil servant than in the case ofMembers of Parliament and other individuals in public life.(d) At the same time it would be undesirable to allow speculationto develop to a point at which it passed out of control. It would be wiser to act promptly, at least to the extent of indicating forthwiththat the Government had taken careful note of the allegations inquestion and would give urgent consideration to the desirability ofsome form of further inquiry as soon as they were in possession of allthe relevant facts.(e) It might also be desirable to indicate that the Governmentwould be favourably disposed in principle to reconsider the possibilityof requiring Members of Parliament to register their private interests on the lines proposed by the Liberal Party to the Select Committeeon Members&apos; Interests in 1969.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that hewould give further consideration, in consultation with the lord president and the Attorney-General, to the attitude which the lord president should adopt if the issues raised by the Liberal Party&apos;motion were pressed during the discussion on the Business statement in the House of Commons that afternoon.OverseaAffairsFranceSECRET3. The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that the Cabinet would have learnt of the resignation of the PrimeMinister of France, M. Chaban Delmas, and of his replacement byM. Messmer, a former Minister of Defence and a prominent supporterof the policies of the late President de Gaulle. No indications that other Ministerial changes were impending had so far been receivedfrom Paris.India/PakistanPreviousReference:CM (72) 24thConclusions,Minute 3KoreaThe Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that the meeting between President Bhutto of Pakistan and mrs. Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India, at Simla in the previousweek had resulted in a significant measure of progress towards thenormalisation of relations between the two States. But the problemsof agreeing on conditions for the return of Pakistani prisoners of warand of Pakistani recognition of Bangladesh remained intractable.The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that the authorities in South and North Korea had announced the successful outcome of discussions held recently in Pyongyang andSeoul on the improvement of relations between the two governments and the reunification of the country. This development was to be welcomed. .   .Antigua The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that reports received from Antgua indicated that domestic

But frigateswere available in the Caribbean should the need arise; and thesituation would be kept under close review.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statements by the Minister of State forForeign and Commonwealth Affairs:The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that British Ministers would visit Reykjavik in the following week in order to resume the attempt to reach an interim agreement aboutfisheries limits with the Government of Iceland. In view of theintransigent attitude of the Icelandic Fisheries Minister, however, itmight well prove impossible to reach an agreement unless we wereprepared to accept a measure of discrimination in the new Icelandicfishing regulations.The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, recalling theearlier decisions taken by the Cabinet on the posture to be adoptedin the negotiations, said that he had succeeded in persuading the fishing industry that it would be reasonable for us to accept a newformula whereby the catch would be reduced by some 30 per cent of the previous year&apos;s quantity or by 20 per cent of the average overthe past 10 years. But their agreement to this course was subject tothe condition that there would be no explicit discrimination against british trawlers. It would be unfortunate if, as a result of beingexcluded from Icelandic waters, our distant water fleet were pressedinto competition with our inshore boats. But, despite the risk of a breakdown in negotiations, he believed that it would be harmful toour longer-term interests if we were to accept discriminatory measures,since this would encourage other coastal States to discriminate against us on similar lines and would also invalidate our case if we had to pursue the matter at the International Court of Justice.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, while a catch reduction scheme would be acceptable in principle, we ought not to accept without further con-sideration any arrangements which involved discrimination against british trawlers. In the forthcoming negotiations, therefore, our representatives should adhere to the conclusions of the Cabinet attheir meetings on 22 and 27 June, referring back for further guidanceif they judged that no agreement could be made on that basis.The Cabinet-(2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said thatMr. Kakuei Tanaka, the former Minister of Trade and Industry, had become Prime Minister of Japan. He was a realist, with usefulexperience of the conduct of trade relations; and we could look forward confidently to establishing a satisfactory relationship withhim.
The Cabinet- -(3) Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for Tradeand Industry.EuropeanEconomicCommunityPreviousReference:CM (72) 6thConclusions,Minute 4PaperSECRET4. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that itappeared likely that there would be an early meeting of the InterimCommittee of the European Economic Community to finalise themandate for the European Free Trade Area non-candidate negotia-tions. There were serious unresolved difficulties about paper; but itwas hoped to settle these bilaterally with Finland and Sweden withthe prior approval of the Community. No concession could bemade on the common tariff; but it might be possible to offer someeasement on sensitive products. It should not be impossible to reach agreement in a manner which would take due account of our interests; and a prompt settlement might be helpful in the context ofthe referenda on accession to the Community which would shortly be held in Denmark and Norway.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that it would be helpful if agreement on these issuescould now be reached. On the other hand in joining the Communitywe were shouldering new burdens and we looked for correspondingbenefits. We had maintained this position in our own negotiation with the Community; and it was relevant also to any further bilateral negotiations which still remained.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.secret. The Cabinet were informed of the latest developments inNorthern Ireland; the conclusions reached were separately recorded and issued only to The Queen, the Prime Minister and those ministers who had to take action.The conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file heldby the Secretary of the Cabinet.confidential industrial 6.   The Prime Minister said that, at his meeting with the affairs General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) earlier in theMeeting with week, the TUC representatives had elaborated their case for the tuc General repeal or suspension of the Industrial Relations Act, purporting toCouncil base their argument on considerations of the national economyrather than on the interests of the unions.  They had expressedNorthernIrelandPreviousReference:CM (72) 33rdConclusions,Minute 3
considerable concern about the implementation of the Act,emphasising that in their view the use of the provisions for a&quot;cooling-off&quot; period and a ballot had been counter-productive inthe case of the railways dispute and objecting to the manner in whichthe Industrial Court had operated. They had maintained that theobjectionable features of the Act outweighed such benefits as the established trade unions might obtain from its other provisions; and,although they had denied that they refused to discuss industrial relations at all so long as the Act remained in force, they had insisted that useful discussions would be difficult in these circumstances. Inreply he had been concerned to emphasise the seriousness of theeconomic situation and the general public expectation that theGovernment, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and the tuc should together find some solution to the problems of inflation.The TUC representatives had been unable to respond immediately tohis invitation to discuss the possible measures which might be takento reduce wage inflation; and he had therefore proposed that thereshould be further examination of these questions in a smaller group.It would be necessary to ensure that the TUC were kept underpressure to respond to this suggestion. He had subsequently discussed the position with the President of the CBI; and he would shortlymeet the Confederation^ negotiating group in order to rehearse thesame arguments. The CBI would probably be able to persuade their members to agree to an extension of their present initiative on price restraint for a further period of at least three months, subject to some changes; and there were grounds for hoping that the CBI and the tuc would be able to reach agreement on the introduction of some form of independent conciliation machinery.In discussion it was suggested that the prospect of securing theagreement of the TUC to some new voluntary system of wagenegotiation which took account of the national interest would be improved if Ministers intensified their efforts to impress on publicopinion the gravity of the damage caused by inflation, of which the increases in house prices and rents were particular examples.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister.industrial action inthe DocksPreviousReference:CM (72) 31stConclusions,Minute 5The Secretary of State for Employment said that he hoped shortly to receive a report on the progress being made by the Joint Committeereviewing the future of the dock industry. In the meantime a com-complex situation had developed as a result of the picketing by dockersof the East London depot of Midland Cold Storage Ltd. this company had decided to take a firm stand against the dockers&apos; action,even to the extent of closing down the business, if necessary. the firm had instituted proceedings against the men concerned in both theIndustrial Court and the High Court; One of the applications to theIndustrial Court; alleged unfair industrial practice and the othersought a reference by the Court to the Commission on industrial relations, under Section 45 of the Industrial Relations Act, for thepurpose of determining sole bargaining rights at the depot. Thecompany had given him formal notice of their intention to seek such
rights; and he was now statutorily obliged to offer such advice and assistance to the parties as he might consider appropriate. He wouldgive further consideration to the action which he might take for thispurpose. Consideration of the evidence and of the legal issues involved would probably occupy the Industrial Court for some days.It was unlikely that the firm would proceed with their applicationsfor writs and injunctions in the Chancery Division of the High Courtunless their applications to the Industrial Court failed.The Lord Privy Seal said that, when negotiations with theindustrial Civil Service had been resumed on the previous day, theunions had been offered arbitration on their pay claim on the basisapproved by the Ministerial Steering Committee on Pay Negotiations.Since they had been unwilling to abate their claim, the Governmenthad offered no improvement on the existing proposal for an increaseof  1 - 50 a week for all grades. The unions now regarded the normalnegotiating machinery as being exhausted and intended to report backto their Executive Committees in order to seek guidance on theproposal for arbitration, about which they had seemed unenthusiastic.In the meantime a measure of industrial action on a local and sporadicbasis seemed inevitable; but a national strike seemed unlikely at thisstage.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Secretary of State for employment and the Lord Privy Seal.confidential . The Cabinet considered a Note by the Secretary of State for trade and Industry (CP (72) 71) to which was annexed a memoran-dum by the Minister for Aerospace about the meeting of the ministerial European Space Conference on 11 July, 1972, and amemorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury (CP (72) 70), aboutthe United Kingdom&apos;s policy of non-participation in the developmentof European space launchers.: The Minister for Aerospace said that he proposed to attend ameeting of the European Space Conference in Brussels during thefollowing week if recent changes in the French Government did notcause it to be postponed. If the Conference took place, he wouldhave to indicate the United Kingdom Governments decision on thequestion whether to accept the offer of participation in the post-Apollo programme which had been made by the United StatesGovernment. The latter would welcome European participation inprinciple; but the,collaboration which they were currently offeringwas much less attractive than had been originally envisaged. Theonly possibilities remaining were about  40 million of subcontractingwork on the orbiter, under United States direction, on which therewould be no return to the United Kingdom; or the development of aspace module to be carried by the orbiter. Neither project wouldprovide us with significant access to United States technical expertise;
and participation would not confer any preference in access to the space transportation system for the launching of European satellites.We should therefore decline to participate in the development of thepost-Apollo system. A new initiative was needed, however, becauseEuropean space technology, which was only one-tenth of the size ofthe United States effort, was badly fragmented. The European SpaceConference would provide an opportunity to propose a reconstitutionof European space organisations and to explore the possibilities ofintegrating national space programmes with the satellite development programmes of the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO).There would remain the problem of launchers, because the FrenchGovernment would probably refuse to contemplate any wider discus-sion unless the future of the European launcher Europa was included.He had already approached the relevant French and GermanMinisters informally in order to ascertain their initial reactions; and,if the Cabinet agreed, he would seek to carry the discussion a stage further at the European Space Conference.In discussion there was general agreement that the post-apollo programme no longer offered attractive prospects for Europeanparticipation, although there was a likelihood that the system, whenfully developed, would have spare capacity for European applications,which we should be prepared to exploit. The forthcoming european space Conference was an appropriate occasion to promote widerdiscussion of European space policy, although it might be advan-tageous not to go beyond seeking postponement of the Conferencewhile a preliminary exploration of the issues was made. In any free-ranging discussion of space policy, however, it would be important notto enter into any commitment which might imply a reversal of UnitedKingdom policy of non-participation in launcher development. Thepresent estimate of the cost of completing the development of theEuropa II and Europa III launchers was  270 million; and, even ifcompleted successfully, they would be out of date by 1980 when theAmerican space shuttle would be available. Space technology was extremely expensive; and there was a danger that discussion of newprogrammes might be taken to imply a willingness to participate in them at a time when there were other demands on public expenditure which might command higher priority.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that studies of the post-Apollo programme had shown that the incentivespreviously thought to be offered by the United States were no longeravailable and that the benefits of European participation were notcommensurate with the costs involved. The United KingdomGovernment had approached the question without&apos; bias; and other european countries would expect us to give a realistic statement ofour assessment in order that a considered reply might be made to theUnited States. The Minister for Aerospace should thereforeannounce our decision not to take part in the post-Apollo programme at the European Space Conference in the following week. At thesame time he might propose exploratory discussion of a possiblerationalisation of European space programmes, which were currentlyfragmented between national programmes and those of the inter-national organisations European Launcher Development Organisation
and ESRO. But any proposal for reorganisation to make better useof total European space technology resources would inevitablyraise the problem of the development of an independent Europeanlauncher. This was primarily a political question, which the Ministerfor Aerospace should be prepared to discuss with European Ministers,if necessary, but without making any commitment which might imply that the United Kingdom Government were prepared to alter theirpolicy of non-participation in European launcher development.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the United Kindom should not participate inthe post-Apollo programme of the United States.(2) Invited the Minister for Aerospace, in leading the UnitedKingdom delegation to the European Space Conferenceon 11 July, 1972, to propose discussion of rationalisingEuropean space programmes and institutions, subject tothe reservations contained in the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
