The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. It was proposed that,subject to the progress of business, both Houses should rise for the easter Adjournment on Thursday, 30 March and that the House ofCommons should resume on Monday, 10 April, and the House ofLords on Tuesday, 18 April.confidential. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the PrimeMinister of Northern Ireland, Mr. Faulkner, had accepted hisinvitation to visit London on Wednesday, 22 March for a discussionof the political situation in the Province. He had received from the leader of the Opposition some account of his recent visit to the irish republic.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Prime Minister.OverseaAffairsRhodesiaPreviousReference :CM (72) 7thConclusions,Minute 4JordanSECRET3. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that LordPearce and the members of his Commission who had been conductingthe Test of Acceptability of the proposed Rhodesian settlement had now returned to the United Kingdom and hoped to be able topresent their report on the result of the Test in the latter part ofApril. It was a remarkable tribute to Lord Pearce and his colleagues that they had carried out their very difficult task without incurringhostile criticism from any quarter. The report might well conclude that the proposals for a settlement were not acceptable to the peopleof Rhodesia as a whole; but it would also give a full account of thedifferent currents of opinion in Rhodesia which the Commission hadidentified. This could be valuable in so far as it might suggest that,instead of having no alternative to accepting an adverse report, we might find several intermediate courses of action open to us. Themost serious obstacle to a further attempt to resolve our dispute with the Rhodesian regime was likely to be action by Mr. Ian Smith,their leader, to reassert his authority by drastic security measuresimmediately on publication of the Pearce Report. The evidenceproduced by Lord Pearce would need careful examination; and thereafter recommendations would be submitted to the Cabinet.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the cabinet would have learned of the King of Jordan&apos;s proposal to establish a united Arab Kingdom under his sovereignty, composed of a federation of States based on the East and West banks of the Jordan,the local administration of the West Bank, now under Israelioccupation, being based in Jerusalem. King Hussein appeared tohave intended this plan as a statesmanlike contribution to peace and stability in the area; but unfortunately it had already been rejectedboth by the Palestinian leaders and by the Government of Israel.It was not clear why the King had published his project at this juncture. But he was probably anxious not only to assert hisposition as the rightful champion of the Palestinians&apos; cause but also
to persuade the Government of Kuwait, who had recently ceasedpayment of a substantial subsidy, to restore their support. He was probably no less anxious to counter Israeli efforts, which were currently having some success, to enlist the cooperation of the Arabinhabitants of the West Bank.The Cabinet-Took  note  of  the  statements  by  the  Foreign  and commonwealth Secretary.secret. The Secretary of State for Employment said that thedecisions by the National Association of Local Government Officersand the General and Municipal Workers Union not to register underthe Industrial Relations Act were disappointing. But the fact that so many of the major unions had decided either not to register or to de-register would not affect the working of the Act; it would simplydeprive those unions and their members of the advantages, includingtax advantages, which the Act afforded to registered unions and increase the likelihood of breakaway unions being formed. Hewould consider how best to impress these points on trade unionists ingeneral.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for employment.The Minister for Transport Industries said that, at their meetingon the previous day, the Executive of the Associated Society forLocomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) had agreed by amajority of one to participate in the further negotiations with theBritish Railways Board (BRB) which were due to take place on the afternoon of Monday, 20 March. They had also agreed that for thepresent they would not fix any date for official industrial action indefault of a settlement or authorise a series of one-day stoppages.Several union branches, however, were exerting considerable pressure for militant action; and opinion on the Executive was finelybalanced. The BRB intended that the first afternoon of the resumednegotiations should be devoted to a discussion of the fullersubmission which had been tabled by the National Union of railwaymen (NUR); and they considered that no advance in theirpresent pay offer would be needed until Tuesday, 21 March, whenthe extent of the improvement to be made would depend on thecourse which the discussions had taken. The Board would in no circumstances offer more than 11 per cent; and they would raisetheir offer to that level only if they judged that there were reasonableprospects of securing a settlement. The advice which he had so fargiven to the Chairman reflected the conclusions which the cabinet had reached at their meeting on 9 March. He now sought the cabinet&apos;s agreement to his authorising the BRB to increase their offer, if necessary, to 11 per cent, in order to achieve a settlement.It would also be desirable to consider the presentation of such an offer in terms of any distinction which it might be expedient to draw
between the general betterment increase and any special factors.Although it now seemed unlikely that any breakdown in thenegotiations would lead to widespread industrial action before easter, the Cabinet might also wish to consider further what theGovernments attitude should be if a breakdown could not be avoidedand industrial action were threatened.In discussion there was general agreement that a settlement at11 per cent would, on balance, be preferable to a confrontation withthe rail unions, leading to a strike from which, in presentcircumstances, there could be no certainty that the community would emerge without serious damage and without ultimately concedinga still higher settlement. It would be inadvisable for the Governmentto tell the BRB that they should not negotiate up to the 11 per centlimit which the Board themselves had resolved not to exceed and thereby to assume responsibility for any breakdown in negotiationsbelow that level. It was not the Board&apos;s intention to raise their offer to 11 per cent unless there were clear indications that this would achieve a settlement; and it had been firmly impressed on themthat they should aim to settle well within 11 per cent if possible.But, although both ASLEF and the NUR might now be ready toaccept an increase significantly less than the 16 per cent which theyhad originally claimed, there could be no confidence that the board would succeed in negotiating a settlement at or below 11 per cent;and it could be argued that, if the Board offered an 11 per cent increase without securing a settlement, ASLEF might well treat theoffer as a base from which to extract further concessions throughnegotiation or arbitration.   11 per cent should in any event be the outside limit for a negotiated settlement. On the other hand it mightbe a mistake for the Government to prescribe an absolute arithmeticalmaximum, since calculation of the value of any offer in percentage terms was in any case a complex product of a number of separateelements.   To restrict the Board&apos;s negotiating authority within adecimal point would be to purport to invest the calculations and thevalue of the offer with a spurious degree of accuracy.  For the sake of a decimal point the Government should not put themselves in theposition of requiring the BRB to break off negotiations and so to risk the loss of a settlement which might otherwise have been within reach.   Moreover, the Board&apos;s task might already have been made more difficult by the outcome of certain pay negotiations now inprogress in the private sector, where it seemed likely that theprovincial newspaper employers, who had already offered an increaseof 11 per cent, would shortly make further concessions and that thebuilding industry might settle for an increase as high as 12J per cent.The Secretary of State for Employment /had sought, however, to impress on the building trade employers the importance of dealingwith these negotiations as slowly as possible and avoiding precipitateconcessions.   There might similarly be advantage to the BRB inconducting the discussions in the following week more slowly thanthey currently intended; and this should be brought to their notice.In addition, the Board should again be reminded of the governments view that it would be helpful to try to identify particular elements ofa possible settlement which might be presented separately as peculiar to the railways, for example any concession of special allowances
in respect of burdensome conditions and irregular hours of work;and they should be similarly reminded of the Governments hopethat they might find it possible to persuade the unions to settle at a somewhat lower level by offering generous compensation to thoseworkers who became redundant and, perhaps, by agreeing to limit the extent of redundancies.In further discussion it was agreed that the action which theGovernment should take if negotiations broke down and industrial action were threatened would depend on the nature of the threat. Ifthe unions called an official strike, it would probably be right for theSecretary of State for Employment to apply to the Industrial court for a &quot; cooling-off &quot; Order. If ASLEF resorted to industrial action without giving the proper notice, it might be right for the matter tobe brought before the Court as an unfair industrial practice whichwould justify a restraining Order.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, if the BRB found it possible to conclude asettlement with the railway unions within a cost of an 11 per. cent increase on the wage bill, they should have authority to do so. TheSecretary of State for the Environment and the Minister for transport Industries should discuss with the Secretary of State for employment how any such settlement might be presented with leastdamage to the Government^ continuing efforts to restrain thegeneral level of wage increases for example, by distinguishingelements peculiar to the conditions of work on the railways from thegeneral betterment increase, provided that the railway settlement wasnot regarded as another &quot; special case &quot; analogous to the settlement with the miners. While the detailed conduct of the following week&apos;s negotiations must be left to the BRB, the Minister for transport industries should suggest to the Chairman that there might be advantage in not displaying undue haste to concede any significantimprovement in the Board&apos;s present offer and limiting any immediateconcessions to the minimum necessary in order to prevent the break-down of the negotiations. He should also advise the BRB that theyshould seek to avoid committing themselves to an offer of as much as11 per &quot;cent unless they were satisfied that it would achieve asettlement in order that, if a breakdown proved unavoidable, it would occur on the basis of an offer which would still leave some marginwithin the 11 per cent limit which the Board and the Governmenthad set themselves. The Ministerial Committee on Emergenciesshould continue to keep the preparations for dealing with anyindustrial action under close review. In particular, they should ensure that the rebuilding of coal and other essential stocks at power stations was urgently pressed forward and that the risk of an interruption in supplies of lighting-up oil was reduced to the efullest extent practicable.The Cabinet-(2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Ministers concerned to be guided accordingly.
Civil service non-IndustrialManpowerPreviousReference :CM (71) 41stConclusions,Minute 2CONFIDENTIAL5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal (CP (72) 27) about Civil Service non-industrial manpower.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Cabinet had decided againsta policy of controlling the number of non-industrial civil servants bymeans of arbitrary reductions, which tended to be capricious in theirincidence and inimical to flexible management. It had thereforeproved impossible to reduce the number of non-industrial civilservants below 500,000 on 1 April, 1972. He had approved an estimated total of 516,000 on 1 April, 1973; and the forecast for1 April, 1974 was 522,000. There were some possibilities of reductions in numbers by transferring functions from the area ofGovernment; but these would yield an overall saving of only 12,000posts at the maximum. It was therefore clear that, if the Govern-menfs policies were to be carried forward, the pledge in the election manifesto to reduce the number of civil servants, and especiallynon-industrial civil servants, could not be redeemed. The new method of presentation described in CP (71) 105 would go some wayto help to deal with the consequent criticism; and emphasis would continue to be placed both on the need for more staff to providebetter management and more effective services for the community and on the Governmenfs determination to continue to promote theeconomic use of manpower. But it was essential to keep thenecessary increases in staff under taut control; and this could beachieved only if Ministers and senior officials made it their personal responsibility to seek out economies and to check unnecessaryexpansion. Manpower targets should be planned ahead for twoyears; and every opportunity should be seized to transfer&apos; from the sphere of Government those activities which need not remain within it. By these and other methods proposed in CP (72) 27 it should bepossible to reduce the total of non-industrial civil servants at 1 April,1974, to 505,000.In discussion it was recognised that the abandonment ofarbitrary staff reductions made it all the more important to control the numbers of civil servants in other ways. Any increases in Civil&apos;* Service staffs would be heavily criticised and would have to be explained and justified in detail. This would be easier to the extent that increases in staff could be linked directly with the performance of identifiable tasks arising from specific Government policies suchas increased selectivity in the social services and elsewhere. Whileadvance manpower planning was important, attempts to keep staff numbers within an arbitrary maximum often ran counter to goodmanagement. In particular, they could result in the employment ofunsuitable staff on inappropriate terms and in the adoption of measures which could not be justified either on policy or onmanagement grounds. They were also difficult to justify in a situation of high unemployment when the Government were seeking to promote the expansion of the service industries. Transfers ofstaff from the sphere of Government should be made only when thetransfer would enable the task to be carried out more effectively;they should not be regarded as primarily a means of reducing CivilService numbers.   Considerable increases in the efficient use of
Post-ApolloProgrammePreviousReference :CM (72) 14thConclusions,Minute 4manpower might be achieved if Departments were permitted agreater degree of flexibility in the employment and use of staff; inparticular economies might accrue from employing fewer individualsof higher quality.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that it was essential to keep Civil Service numbers to the minimum consistent with the main objectives of goodmanagement and the efficient implementation of government policies. To this end the Cabinet endorsed in principle the proposals in paragraphs 4-6 of CP (72) 27. The Public Expenditure survey committee manpower forecasts should be used as a guide toplanning; but they should not be regarded as a maximum whichcould never be exceeded, even if there were good management orpolicy arguments for doing so, or as a pretext for extravagance wherechanges in policy enabled savings to be made. Transfers of functions from the area of Government should be pursued wherethere were policy or management advantages to be gained. there seemed to be no particular merit regarding five years as a standardinterval for management reviews of Departments; and the lord privy Seal should therefore discuss with Departmental Ministerswhat arrangements in this respect would be best adapted to their individual circumstances. Several Ministers had maintained that departments could be more efficiently organised if they were givengreater management flexibility and independence from central control. The Lord Privy Seal should consider further whether, andunder what conditions, this argument could be tested, perhaps on an experimental basis.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited the lord privy Seal to proceed accordingly.confidential. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary of Statefor Trade and Industry (CP (72) 34) and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, (CP (72) 35) about the post-Appollo space transportationsystem of the United States.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that theUnited Kingdom&apos;s space activities consisted of separate programmesdirected towards different ends and managed by different departments. Many of these programmes would be affected bythe post-Apollo development, which would have a bearing on all future enterprises in space. Our space policy was little more thanthe aggregate of those elements of other policies which involvedspace; and some central purpose was needed in order to ensure thatwe retained an adequate national capability in space technology. Itwas necessary to decide whether we should agree to take part in european studies of the post-Apollo programme, even though theywould not be completed before July when we should have to replyto the United States invitation to participate in the development programme. Our reply, however, need only be conditional, sinceother European countries had accepted our view that final
commitment to participate should depend on the outcome of studies.United Kingdom industry would not secure a share of the workcontracted by the European Space Conference unless a decision onthe studies was taken immediately.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the post-apollo programme was not a worthwhile project on its own merits. Boththe National Space Technology programme and the post-apollo programme were intended to support the United Kingdom spaceindustry; but there was insufficient economic justification for bothof them. Any increase in expenditure on space would benefit theguided weapons sector of the aerospace industry, which was not now in need of extra work; and, if we embarked on the post-apollo programme, a serious imbalance in the industry could develop in afew years&apos; time, leaving inadequate resources for worthwhile new work in the civil aircraft sector.The Secretary of State for Defence said that there was no case for the post-Apollo programme on scientific grounds. In particular,there were no rational arguments for a manned space programmewhen unmanned spacecraft could perform all the relevant functionsmore economically. Nor was there likely to be much of scientificor technological benefit to be gained from the project itself. Butthe United States Government were likely to carry it through to a conclusion; and in that event there would certainly be a great dealof spare capacity in the volume of payload which the system was designed to carry.In discussion it was suggested that participation in the post-Apollo programme had little political significance. The FrenchGovernment, in particular, would appreciate our reasons if wedeclined to take part on grounds of public expenditure or relativepriorities and based our refusal on the risk of a substantial escalationin the cost, which was a common feature of many major technologicaldevelopments. If the main justification for participation was held to be technological, particularly the evolutionary effect which the space transportation system would have on all other developments in the field, there nevertheless appeared to be a serious conflict of- scientific advice, which was far from unanimous in support of thepost-Apollo programme as a whole. It would, admittedly, bepossible to take part in the study project while refusing to participate in the development programme; and this was a possible compromise,which might provide useful training for our scientists and enable usto keep in touch with new space techniques.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, ifwe informed the United States Government that our willingness totake part in the post-Apollo programme depended on the successful outcome of the proposed programme of studies, we should in realityhave surrendered our freedom of choice. Moreover, a share in theprogramme would be of no benefit to Europe if the United Statesinterests reserved the benefits of the new technology to themselves and sub-contracted only those developments which involvedconventional techniques. Neither the economic nor the scientificcase, therefore, had been established convincingly. In particular,the scientific advice was conflicting; and it would seem to follow that,
unless it could be demonstrated that there were good grounds forparticipating in the main post-Apollo programme, we should refuseto take part in any studies. He would arrange for the ministers concerned and their Scientific Advisers to give further considerationto the issues involved and to seek to agree whether the United Statesinvitation to participate in the post-Apollo programme held anytangible advantage for us.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.SupplementaryBenefitsPayments inStrikesPreviousReference :CM (72) 14thConclusions,Minute 3SECRET7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Social Services (CP (72) 37) about the payment ofsupplementary benefit (SB) during strikes.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that his memorandum discussed the effect of the Social Security Act, 1971, onthe payment of SB during strikes, together with a range of possiblefurther measures which were available if the Cabinet concluded thatthe Act had not made a sufficient contribution to the discouragementof irresponsible industrial action. In considering whether any ofthese measures should be adopted, the Cabinet should bear in mind that the general public were increasingly aware of their rights interms of SB and that this growing consciousness of entitlement wasbeing deliberately fostered by the &quot; claimants&apos; unions &quot; which had recently come into being. These now numbered about 90; and someof them pressed the claims of their individual clients with a degree ofmilitancy which involved gross intimidation of the SB office staffs.The question whether any further measures should be taken tomodify entitlement to SB during a strike was essentially one ofindustrial relations. But the 1971 Act had significantly diminishedthe weekly income of families for whose benefit SB was paid instrikes; and it was doubtful whether the availability of SB was infact an important consideration in the minds of workers when theywere debating whether to have recourse to industrial action. If,however, it was judged that it was, the most realistic of the measuresexamined in CP (72) 37 were: first, the abolition of entitlement toSB during a strike; second, an arrangement whereby the amount ofSB would be abated by a notional amount of strike pay, whether itwas in fact paid or not; and thirdly, making SB recoverable after astrike. If the first or second course were adopted, it would benecessary to continue to pay SB in cases of special hardship: andthis situation would lend itself to exploitation by militant elements.Moreover, in order to make the action effective, it would be necessaryto abrogate the discretionary powers of the Supplementary BenefitCommission under Section 13 of the Ministry of Social Security Act,1966; and this would be liable to turn public opinion sharply againstthe Government. In any event measures as radical as these could hardly be adopted without a long period of notice which would enablethe unions to assemble hardship funds; and they could probably not be brought into force, therefore, until the beginning of 1976.It was also doubtful whether the third course, of making SB paid
during a strike recoverable, would be effective in practice, not leastbecause it would merely constitute an additional incentive to strikersto ensure that the final settlement included an additional element toset off against their SB repayment liability no less than the otherdebts which they had incurred during the strike.In discussion it was accepted that the availability of SB probablyhad some influence on individual decisions to strike. But it was theeffect of any change on the unions and their funds which matteredrather than the impact on individual strikers and their families. Itwas generally agreed, however, that the question was essentiallypart of a wider complex of issues arising in connection with theGovernments relations with organised labour and that it would therefore be impolitic to take action on SB in isolation. It would betimely to review the Governments industrial strategy now that themore unpalatable measures which were a necessary part of their programme for the present Parliament had been taken; and this review should include, in addition to SB payments during strikes,such matters as picketing, secondary boycotts, the effect of guaranteed week agreements, possible taxation of short-termsocial service benefits and the conditions for the payment ofunemployment benefit. Further thought should also be given to possible means of countering the growing tendency for industrial disputes, and other occasions of public contention, to be undulyinfluenced by elements which sought to exploit these occasions forsubversive political purposes.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that it would not be right to decide on further measures relating to SB payments during strikes in isolation from a review of the Governments industrial strategy. He would consider how such a review might be most effectively conducted, bearing inmind the points which had been made in discussion.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office,16 March, 1972.
