secret the Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for the Home Department and Lord President of theCouncil (CP (72) 91) on questions which had arisen from the decisionof the President of Uganda, General Amin, to expel from UgandaAsian holders of United Kingdom passports (UKPH) within aperiod of 90 days expiring early in November.The Prime Minister said that, while the Governmenfs ultimateobligation to admit to the United Kingdom UKPH who wereexpelled from their place of residence and had no other place ofrefuge was not in question, the prospect of a large and early influx of Asians posed a number of serious social and political problems.There were strong arguments for diverting as many as possible tothird countries and for seeking to phase the arrival of any consider-able numbers in the United Kingdom. But there was increasingevidence of President Amin&apos;s irrational and unpredictable tempefa-ment; and it was impossible to exclude the possibility that thesituation might develop in such a way as a create a real threat tothe lives not only of Asian UKPH but also of the 7,000 individualswith a close personal or ancestral link with the United Kingdom(&quot; belongers &quot;).The Attorney General informed the Cabinet that the individualswhom the Ugandan Government proposed to expel were citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies. The grant of a passport bythe United Kingdom Government did not in itself confer citizenship;but it was evidence that the Government accepted the holder as one of its citizens. Under international law a State had a duty toother States to accept within its territory those of its nationals whowere expelled from their country of residence and were not admitted to any. other country. This international obligation applied not-withstanding the controls imposed by our domestic immigrationlaws upon the entry of citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonieswho had no direct personal or ancestral link with the UnitedKingdom. The Commonwealth Immigration Act, 1968, had for thefirst time subjected to those controls Asians in East Africa holdingpassports issued by the United Kingdom Government; but theLabour Home Secretary at the time, Mr. James Callaghan, had publicly acknowledged an obligation to receive such individuals ifthey were expelled with no prospect of any alternative refuge.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Attorney General.The Cabinet then considered the memorandum by the HomeSecretary and Lord President of the Council under the following headings:Diplomatic Action (paragraphs 4-14)Resettlement Outside the United Kingdom (paragraphs15-26)Direct Pressure on Uganda (paragraphs 27-31)1a2
The Domestic Problem Air Transport (paragraphs 34-41)Reception and Resettlement (paragraphs 44-51)Local Authorities (paragraphs 52-57)The Employment Voucher Scheme (paragraphs 58-60)The Longer-Term Implications for Immigration Policy(paragraphs 62-69).The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary informed theCabinet that our initial diplomatic efforts had been directed towardspersuading President Amin to moderate his decision. TheChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster had visited Uganda but hadbeen unable to establish rational communication with the President.We had taken early steps to suspend action on a projected loan of 10 million for capital development; but it had not been prudenteither to make this decision public or to take further direct actionagainst Uganda while we still hoped to influence President Amin.In addition, the Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs, Mr. Godber, had discussed the problem with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Dr. Waldheim, who had sent his personal emissary, Mr. Gardiner, to Uganda. Mr. Gardiner had formed the impression that President Amin&apos;s instability might resultin a breakdown in Uganda comparable to the situation which had developed in the Congo in 1960; and it was possible that Dr. Wald-heim would decide to visit Uganda himself. If so, it would bebetter to defer raising the Ugandan situation in the United NationsEconomic and Social Council, which was due to meet on 12 Sep-tember, until we could assess the results of Dr. Waldheim&apos;srepresentations. But thereafter it might well be desirable to promote a debate in the General Assembly on 27 September and to move aResolution calling for an extension of the time limit of 90 daysimposed by President Amin and for proper arrangements to safe-guard their assets. We had also obtained expressions of sympathyfrom many Commonwealth and foreign countries, together withoffers of help from a number, of whom Canada and Malawi werethe chief; but the majority were concerned to avoid any publicity for these efforts. A Commonwealth conference offered little prospect of advantage; and any pressure for such a conference would best be met by pointing out , that bilateral negotiations with individual Commonwealth countries were more in accordance withtheir wishes and were therefore more likely to be effective.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that therewould be advantage in arranging for as many as possible of the asian UKPH to go to India, where many of them had familyconnections and might prefer to settle rather than to move on tothe United Kingdom. Our High Commissioner in New Delhi wouldbe discussing these and associated questions with the Indian ForeignMinister during the following week; but the Indian Government

But thereafter it might well be desirable to promote a debate in the General Assembly on 27 September and to move aResolution calling for an extension of the time limit of 90 daysimposed by President Amin and for proper arrangements to safe-guard their assets. We had also obtained expressions of sympathyjfrom many Commonwealth and foreign countries, together withoffers of help from a number, of whom Canada and Malawi werethe chief; but the majority were concerned to avoid any publicity for these efforts. A Commonwealth conference offered little prospect of advantage; and any pressure for such a conference would best be met by pointing out that bilateral negotiations with individual Commonwealth countries were more in accordance withtheir wishes and were therefore more likely to be effective.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that therewould be advantage in arranging for as many as possible of the asian UKPH to go to India, where many of them had familyconnections and might prefer to settle rather than to move on tothe United Kingdom. Our High Commissioner in New Delhi wouldbe discussing these and associated questions with the Indian ForeignMinister during the following week; but the Indian Government
already faced a considerable problem in absorbing Indian citizensexpelled from Uganda. They were approaching discussions with us with some caution and were anxious to avoid publicity. Neverthe-less, we must hope that their evident sympathy would lead them toprovide practical assistance.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion of thissection of the memorandum, said that the Cabinet agreed that theUnited Kingdom should be prepared, within the limit of  750 perfamily imposed under existing emigration arrangements, to pay the travel expenses from the United Kingdom of UKPH arriving herebut willing to settle in third countries. They did not favour thesuggestion that grants should be paid to individual UKPH inconsideration of their settling in third countries and renouncingUnited Kingdom nationality. We should be ready, however, tomake arrangements with host Governments as appropriate tocontribute towards the cost of programmes of resettlement forUKPH from Uganda. It would be important to include provisionfor the payment of resettlement grants by host Governments tofamilies in need of them; but to suggest that renunciation of UnitedKingdom citizenship and assumption of citizenship of the hostcountry should be a condition for a resettlement grant might not bepalatable to host countries and might frustrate the object of divertingas many UKPH as possible from the United Kingdom. We shouldalso explore further the possibility of using the services of the Inter-governmental Committee for European Migration to devise and operate a programme for resettlement bf UKPH in certain countries of Latin America; and there was no reason why our intention inthis regard should not be disclosed publicly.The Cabinet-(3) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of this part of their discussion and invited the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Home Secretary and Lord Presidentof the Council to be guided accordingly.Direct In a brief discussion of this section of the memorandum it wasPressure suggested that, now that it seemed clear that President Amin wason Uganda impervious to rational persuasion, the sole, though weighty, counter-vailing factor to the domestic political pressures in favour of strongaction against Uganda lay in the risk of provoking him to permitor to initiate violent counter-action by the ill-disciplined UgandanArmy against Asian UKPH or against United Kingdom&quot; belongers&quot;, whom we should find it difficult, for geographicalreasons, to protect adequately.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed to freeze the uncommitted balance ( 300,000) of pastaid loans; to continue not to recruit any new technical assistancepersonnel for service in Uganda; to offer no further places in theUnited Kingdom for civilian or military trainees from Uganda; to stop deliveries of armoured vehicles for the Ugandan Army; and
to advise tourist agencies that British tourists should be discouragedfrom visiting Uganda, provided that this could be arranged with theminimum of damage to Kenya and Tanzania in the case of&quot; package tours &quot; of East Africa. They did not, however, think itwise to stop payment of money committed from earlier loans butnot yet spent. Nor would it be appropriate at the moment to with-draw supplementation of the salaries of technical assistancepersonnel on contract to the Ugandan Government, to freezeUganda&apos;s sterling balances or to withdraw the British Army trainingteam from Uganda. Further consideration might need to be givento the three latter measures in due course; but President Aminshould be given no indication of this. For purposes of public presentation it would be reasonable to recall the recently announcedsuspension of the projected  10 million development loan and topoint to the incongruity in present circumstances of negotiating newaid programmes or encouraging British tourism in Uganda but toindicate, at the same time, the undesirability of taking any steps which might adversely affect British exporters or expose british firms or individuals to liability for breach of contract.The Cabinet (4) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of this part of their discussion and invited the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Secretary of State for Defence, the HomeSecretary and Lord President of the Council and theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry to be guided accordingly.The Cabinet then considered the problems of transport,accommodation, resettlement, etc., which would arise in relation tosuch Asians as we had to admit to the United Kingdom when wehad exhausted all possible means of limiting the numbers.Transport The Cabinet were informed that the discussion of transport arrangements had so far been confined to those families, originallyassumed to number 3,000, whose applications for admission to theUnited Kingdom had been processed by the United Kingdom high commission in Kampala before the present crisis developed. there appeared to be little scope for the use of sea transport. As regardsair services President Amin had initially sought to attach to thearrangements which we had contemplated for the movement of the families the condition that the traffic should be reserved to east african Airways; and the company themselves were unwilling topermit any concessionary fares. More recently, however, thePresident was reported to have modified his attitude to the extent of accepting that the traffic might be shared with the British overseas airways Corporation and British Caledonian Airways; and therewas now a prospect that the fares charged might be reduced belowthe level of those normally prescribed by the International AirTravel Association. There was still no indication, however, that president Amin would be prepared to allow our own airlines to convert into other currencies the proceeds from tickets sold in
Uganda for East African shillings. At an earlier stage we had offered the airlines an informal undertaking that we would help them to secure the repatriation of their profits; and, if the traffic was in fact dealt with on the tripartite basis now envisaged, weshould have to honour this obligation.In these circumstances it was necessary to decide whether weshould now let events take their course, in the sense of confiningourselves to providing such air transport as was required in orderto accommodate the number of individuals whose departure wasmade possible by the dilatory Ugandan administrative formalities;or whether we should positively exert ourselves to ensure that, byone means or another, all those concerned were safely brought to theUnited Kingdom before the time limit of 90 days expired. We must also decide whether the arrangements finally adopted in relation tothe initial 3,000 families should extend also to the balance, estimatedat some 35,000 individuals at the maximum, as regards whom wewere not as yet committed.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion of this sectionof the memorandum, said that it would in fact be possible to ensurethe removal of all the individuals concerned by November if the scheduled services were supplemented by five additional flights aday. This would represent a maximum effort on our part, designedto safeguard the Asians against the consequences which might befallthem if they had not left Uganda by the prescribed time limit. Butit would correspondingly concentrate their arrival in this country,and even though our control over the licensing of aircraft landingswould enable us to regulate to some extent the flow of immigrants,a marked increase in the number of flights would be liable to provoke a considerable degree of public criticism. The only realisticcourse, therefore, would be to proceed on the assumption that, inthe light of the administrative procrastination of the UgandanGovernment, the scheduled services should suffice for the immediatefuture; to let our own airlines understand that they could to someextent relax their efforts to organise additional services; and to keepthe position under close review in order to be ready to modify these arrangements if necessary. We should also try to ensure that thoseAsians whose destinations lay elsewhere than in this country shouldtravel direct from Uganda; and we should emphasise that our own arrangements were necessarily determined to a large extent by the pace at which the Ugandan Government were able to complete theirown administrative formalities. We must recognise, however, thatin the final outcome an unpredictable number of Asians might still remain in Uganda at the terminal date/and, in so far as it waspossible to organise a contingency plan for their rapid evacuationat the final stage, we should do so. The responsibility for thesituation which might then develop would rest clearly with PresidentAmin, not with ourselves.The Cabinet-(5) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of this part of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.
Reception andResettlementLocalAuthoritiesThe Employ-ment VoucherSchemeIn the course of a discussion of the arrangements to be madefor reception and resettlement in this country the Cabinet were informed that the Uganda Resettlement Board had now been corn-missioned and would be ready to receive the immigrants from thebeginning of the following week. It remained to be decided, how-ever, whether those Asians who arrived without property and wereassigned to unfurnished accommodation should look to the supplementary Benefits Commission for assistance or should be helped in some other way. The Commission were concerned thatthe numbers involved might make it impossible for them to main-tain the stringent standards which they normally applied to membersof the indigenous population in the same circumstances; and inview of the danger of provoking critical and invidious comment ifthese standards were relaxed in favour of immigrants, it would be preferable that the Asians concerned should be assisted by charitablefunds, to which the Asian community in the United Kingdom mightbe expected to make a generous contribution. This possibility should be pursued further.It was agreed that it would also be necessary to reassure thelocal authorities about the financial assistance which they might expect from the Government towards the additional expenditure which they would incur as a result of the arrival of the immigrants.The rate support grant could be adjusted as necessary; but it mightbe desirable, in addition, to make specific grants to the localauthorities concerned, on the basis of a limited scheme which couldbe discontinued when the immigrants had been integrated into theeconomic life of the country. The grants might be at the rate of75 per cent of expenditure incurred on special projects such as theprovision of temporary classrooms, school transport, health centres,etc.; and the local authorities would be required to submit these projects for endorsement by the Uganda Resettlement Board. Inthis way the scheme would automatically be terminated as soon asthe Board had completed their task. In accordance with normal practice the Board would themselves be subject Jo a limit in respectof the expenditure which they might approve on any one projectwithout the prior authority of the Secretary of State; but it was notpossible at this stage to estimate the total cost of the scheme. Itwas also for consideration whether the special grants should belimited to 75 per cent of approved expenditure or might, at least in some cases, be at the rate of 100 per cent; and this matter shouldbe further considered by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in con-sultation with the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forthe Environment. It would in any event be desirable to arrange that the Secretary of State for the Environment should be more closely associated with the work of the Board in order to ensurethat the political implications of the Board&apos;s relations with localauthorities were taken fully into account.The Cabinet then considered whether the employment voucherscheme, which currently provided for the issue of 2,250 vouchersa year, should be suspended in order to offset to some extent theadditional influx of Asian immigrants. It was agreed that no action
should be taken in this respect at the present juncture, partly becausesuspension would be offensive to the Old Commonwealth; partly because it might involve a review of policy in regard to aliens aswell as Commonwealth citizens, which might affect our relationswith the other members of the European Economic Community onthe question of freedom of movement for our coloured citizenswithin the Community; but mainly because it would certainly be unwelcome to India and Pakistan and would therefore prejudice our efforts to persuade the Governments of those countries to admit the maximum number of Asians to be expelled from Uganda. Itwould be preferable to avoid any public comment on this subjectif possible.The Cabinet-(6) Invited the Home Secretary to ensure that the points whichhad emerged during their discussion of this part of thememorandum were pursued in consultation with theMinisters concerned.Immigration Finally, the Cabinet considered the longer-term implications ofPolicy in the the present situation for our immigration policy. It was agreedLonger Term that we should now undertake a fresh study, with which the LawOfficers should be closely associated, of the questions which would arise if we decided to deprive certain UKPH of their citizenship orto limit the entry of dependants of Commonwealth citizens. this study should be completed as rapidly as possible; and, in view ofthe political delicacy of the issues involved, it was essential to avoid any premature disclosure of its procedures and conclusions.The Prime Minister^ summing up the discussion as a whole,said that the Home Secretary, in consultation with other ministers as appropriate, should now ensure that the various issues which had arisen during the Cabinefs consideration of CP (72) 91 were further examined as a matter of urgency and that our preparations fordealing with the situation were carried forward on the basis whichthe Cabinet had now agreed, with full regard to the importance ofmaintaining secrecy about any modification of our immigration policy in the longer term. In so far as certain of the Cabinet&apos;s other decisions could now be made public there would be advantage in arranging for this to be done before the week-end by means of a comprehensive statement which would reassure public opinion aboutthe Governmenfs policies for dealing with the situation and their determination to ensure, so far as it lay in their power, that thenecessary arrangements would be made in a firm and orderly manner. The text of this statement should be agreed with theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary and himself.The Cabinet-(7) Took note,v with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Home Secretary,in consultation with other Ministers as appropriate, toproceed accordingly.Cabinet Office8 September, 1972
