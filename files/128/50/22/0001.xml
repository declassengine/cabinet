IndustrialAffairsRailwaymen&apos;sPayNegotiationsPreviousReference :CM (72) 20thConclusions,Minute 4SECRETThe Secretary of State for Employment said that since the cabinets discussion on 13 April he had held a series of meetings with the rail unions and with the British Railways Board (BRB)about their pay dispute. He had sought first to persuade the unions to agree that the dispute should be referred to arbitration under theindustry&apos;s pay procedures. The unions had rejected this proposal.He had then asked them to adopt the suggestion, which had been presented to them as originating from the BRB, that the parties should have further discussions under a chairman appointed jointlyby them, who would consider their respective arguments, seek todetermine the outstanding issues by agreement and, if necessary,make an award on his own responsibility. The unions had eventuallyaccepted this procedure and had agreed with the Board that Mr.A. A. Jarratt, Managing Director of the International PublishingCorporation, should act as Chairman. On Sunday, 16 April, thetwo sides had met under Mr. Jarratfs chairmanship. In the courseof the discussion the BRB had offered to increase the railwaymen&apos;sbasic rate to  20 a week from 1 January, 1973, and to maintain the consequential differentials. The unions had rejected this offer. Atthe end of the discussions Mr. Jarratt had awarded, in addition to theBRB&apos;s concession on the basic wage, an increase of about 1 per centin the Board&apos;s previous 11 per cent offer, to operate from 1 May,1972. In total, therefore, Mr. Jarratfs award would have involved an increase of about 12i per cent in the BRB&apos;s wage bill in the 12months from 1 May, 1972. The unions, however, had rejected thisaward and had adhered inflexibly to the claim for a 14 per cent increase. Their members had now begun a national &quot; go slow &quot;. Hehad therefore met Mr. Feather, the General Secretary of the TradesUnion Congress (TUC), and members of the TUC General council that afternoon and had asked them for constructive suggestions forresolving the situation which did not involve further concessions tothe rail unions. He had also invited them to use their good offices in helping to persuade the rail unions voluntarily to ballot their members on Mr. Jarratfs award. The TUC representatives, whileoffering no positive suggestions, had seemed anxious to appearhelpful and had pressed upon him the importance of avoidingprecipitate action. They had said that they could not themselvesmake any proposals without first consulting the TUC Finance andGeneral Purposes Committee, which could not meet before the afternoon of Tuesday 18 April. In reply he had pointed out that theGovernment could not allow the procedures of the TUC to inhibitnecessary action; and he had asked Mr. Feather to meet him againthat evening. As he had informed the TUC representatives, he had also invited the rail unions to meet him at 8,30 a.m. the following morning in order that he might urge them to ballot their members.The Minister for Transport Industries said that the &quot; go slow &quot;had led to widespread disruption of passenger services, although there had as yet been no sympathetic action on the London Under-ground. The BRB wished to have 24 hours&apos; experience of developments before attempting to provide a considered assessment of its effect on freight services. AH oil refineries and all but 20collieries had been serviced that day, although in some cases at a lower level than usual. But henceforward the disruption was likelyto be cumulative. The BRB considered that the unions, led by the
National Union of Railwaymen, were intent on a confrontation withthe Government but that, if so, this was an approach which theirrank and file members might not be so ready to support.In discussion it was suggested that the TUC were concerned to undermine the Industrial Relations Act rather than to help theGovernment and that the Government would therefore attractcriticism if they remained inactive for 24 hours While waiting on the tuc&apos;s Finance and General Purposes Committee. Moreover, if that committee then put forward proposals which were notdemonstrably unacceptable, there could be further delay while these were explored in turn. The present dispute probably provided abetter test case for the Industrial Relations Act than was likely torecur for some time; and if, in these circumstances, the Governmentfailed to invoke the Acfs provisions, its credibility would be seriouslyundermined and the Government would suffer a significant politicalreverse. But, although it would be politically essential to invoke theIndustrial Relations Act if other approaches failed, the Governmentshould be seen to have exhausted all other reasonable means ofsecuring the union&apos;s voluntary co-operation before seekingcompulsory Orders under the Act; and, having asked for the TUCshelp, they would find it difficult to justify not allowing them the24 hours which they had requested in which to consider theirresponse. It could be made clear that the Government were not taking other action meanwhile because the TUC had asked for timein which to suggest ways in which to resolve the situation; and the tuc could be given a deadline for producing a constructive solution,failing which the Government would apply to the Industrial Court.A &quot; cooling-off&quot; Order, however, would not necessarily improve the situation on the railways and a compulsory ballot under theIndustrial Relations Act might well produce a result which did notresolve the dispute. A State of Emergency should therefore beproclaimed in good time. This would reduce the risk that theGovernment might be compelled to introduce severe emergencyrestrictions abruptly: and, by affording powers e.g. to conservestocks of essential materials, it might in practice do more to defeat the railwaymen&apos;s industrial action than Orders obtained under theIndustrial Relations Act.In further discussion the following main points were made (a) The purpose of a &quot; cooling-off &quot; period was to allow timefor a dispute to be settled; but in applying for the necessary Order itwas not necessary to specify the way in which the period would beused. Thus, although in the current dispute a &quot; cooling-off &quot; periodseemed likely to be useful only in allowing time fpr the unions to reconsider their rejection of Mr. Jarratfs award or to enable a ballot to be organised, it would not be essential, in applying to theCourt, to indicate which of these courses was to be adopted. TheCourt could, if necessary, be asked at a later date to order a ballot.In making the application to the Court, however, the Secretary ofState for Employment would need to declare himself satisfied thatbreaches of contracts of employment were occurring or threatenedand that the industrial action involved was, or was likely to be,gravely injurious to the national economy. A reasonable argumentcould be presented on both points, although the Governments caseon the second would be weakened if the effects of the railwaymen&apos;s
go-slow proved to be less serious in fact than was at presentenvisaged.(b) The Industrial Court would wish to give the unions 6 hours&apos;notice of the hearing of an application by the Government. If theapplication were delayed until the morning of Wednesday, 19 April,a hearing could probably not be arranged until that evening.  If a, &quot; cooling-off &quot; period was then granted and the unions did not defy itofficially, it would be at least 24 hours before its effectiveness could be judged. To defer the Proclamation of an Emergency until after a&quot; cooling-off&quot; Order had been obtained and its effectiveness hadbeen assessed might therefore make it impossible to invokeEmergency Powers before the weekend. To advise a Proclamationsooner, however, would imply that the Government expected the&quot; cooling-off&quot; Order to be ineffective. Even so, it might prove necessary to obtain Emergency Powers before applying for a&quot; cooling-off&quot; Order if industrial action seriously threatenedessential supplies. If an Order was then obtained and provedeffective, the Regulations made under the Emergency Powers couldbe allowed to lapse.(c) Directions under Emergency Regulations to conservesupplies of fuel oil to the industry in the Midlands might be neededat a very early stage. Normal stocks at rail-fed terminals were generally equivalent to only about one week&apos;s consumption; but these could be husbanded to maintain supplies to essential users for to 4 weeks if Regulations were made prohibiting supply to non-essential users. The oil companies had already been asked to limitmovements from such terminals to the level of replacement supplies.(d) The Commission on Industrial Relations had advised that apostal ballot of railwaymen would take some 23 days to yieldresults. A ballot at work places might produce results more quickly;but it would be more vulnerable to the effects of any boycott. the ballot would need to ask railwaymen to decide between acceptingMr. Jarratfs award and continuing industrial action. The chancesthat the result would be in favour of accepting the award were nothigh, although they might improve if voting took place when- railwaymen had been exposed to the pressure of public opinion fora further period.(e) Before the rail unions were asked to ballot their members itshould be confirmed that none of them were bound by rules whichwould imply that a ballot would take an inordinate length of time.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that it would be politic to afford the TUC thenecessary minimum of time to consult their Finance and general purposes Committee in order that they might have a reasonableopportunity of making a constructive response to the Secretary ofState for Employment^ request. In discussion with Mr. VictorFeather and his colleagues later that evening, the Secretary of state should impress on them, however, that he would need to know the tuc&apos;s intentions by 5 p.m. on the following day, in order that theGovernment might have time to initiate other steps that eveningshould that be necessary. He should also arrange to meetrepresentatives of the three rail unions early on the following day,as he had arranged; and, provided that he was satisfied that they
were not precluded, for example by union rules, from carrying out a ballot in a speedy and proper manner, he should urge them tosubmit the arbitrator^ award to their members by this means. TheCabinet further agreed that, in the absence of a satisfactory response from the rail unions or the TUC by the following evening, application should then be made to the Industrial Court for a &quot; cooling-off &quot;Order for a period which initially would be used to bring further pressure to bear on the rail unions to ballot their membersvoluntarily. The Solicitor General should arrange for the Court tobe notified informally of this contingency in order that the Courtmight be considering arrangements to determine the application inthe course of Wednesday, 19 April. In addition, it should beintimated publicly that the Government had it in mind to make anearly application to the Court, but had agreed first to give the TUCa reasonable opportunity of responding constructively to theSecretary of State&apos;s request for their help in seeking means of resolving the dispute by a voluntary procedure. The Cabinet also agreed that, failing a solution on this basis, it would be necessary toconsider making a further application to the Industrial Court to order a compulsory ballot of members of the three rail unionsemployed by the BRB on the question whether they favouredaccepting the arbitrator^ award and ending their industrial action.Although it might take some three weeks for the Commission on industrial Relations to organise and conduct such a ballot, itsoutcome might be favourable since railwaymen might by that time be more ready to bow to the pressure of public opinion.Consideration might need to be given later in the week to advising the Proclamation of a State of Emergency if it became clear thatthe railwaymen&apos;s action was threatening the maintenance of essential supplies, for example by interfering with the flow of oil to the rail-fed terminals supplying industry in the Midlands. An EmergencyProclamation before the weekend would also be desirable andjustified if, following the grant of a &quot; cooling-off&quot; Order by theIndustrial Court, the unions declined to withdraw their instructionsto their members to go slow or if unofficial action sufficient to causedisruption on a wide scale continued after the unions had complied with the Order.The Group of Ministers (GEN 94) under his chairmanship whowere keeping developments in the rail dispute under review, would continue to meet frequently. Some reinforcement of the existinginterdepartmental machinery for dealing with emergencies might berequired; and in order to expedite the flow of information to thegroup from the Departmental emergency units established in theDepartments of the Environment and Trade and Industry and toco-ordinate the presentation of the issues requiring/decision day by day he had invited the Lord Privy Seal to take charge of a small group of officials from these and other Departments principally concerned. %The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Ministers concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office,18 April, 1972.
