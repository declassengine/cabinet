secret. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.secret. The Secretary of State for Defence informed the Cabinetthat, as the result of the latest exchanges with the Prime Minister of malta, Mr. Mintoff, the Government of Malta should now be in nodoubt about the limit to which both the British Government and theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation were prepared to go in extendingfinancial assistance to Malta in connection with the conclusion ofa new defence agreement between the British and Maltese Govern-ments. Mr. Mintoff and his colleagues were now considering theterms of these latest offers; but their reaction was not yet known.Meanwhile, it might be desirable to give further consideration to the phasing of the rundown of our military presence in the island.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for defence.SECRET*3. The Secretary of State for Employment said that he had held separate meetings with the National Coal Board (NCB) and theNational Union of Mineworkers (NUM) on the preceding morning.He had suggested to them that the deadlock in negotiations mightbe broken by exploring the possibility of a settlement whereby highercash concessions would be made in return for an agreement extendingfor a period of more than 12 months; and both parties had eventuallyagreed to proceed on that basis. The NUM, however, had made itclear that they would be interested only in a substantially increasedoffer and that they remained unwilling to consider any form of independent mediation. It had been agreed that a joint meeting would be held in the evening; and, while it was in progress, theMinisters most immediately concerned had met under the PrimeMinisters chairmanship to consider what should be the Governmentsobjective in the conciliation. It had been concluded that it was important to secure the offer by the NCB of terms which weredemonstrably reasonable and to make these known as soon aspossible in order that, if they were rejected by the NUM, publicopinion would appreciate where the responsibility for the continuanceof the strike lay, particularly if at the same ^ime power cuts and thegeneral discomfort of the coal shortage were increasingly being felt.The offer, of which details had been published in that morning&apos;s Press,included a minimum earnings guarantee of  22 a week  2 a weekhigher than that which the Trades Union Congress (TUC) were currently seeking to establish and cash increase half as muchagain as in the NCB&apos;s final offer, in return for an agreement extending* Previously circulated Q&amp; a Confidential Annex.secret a2
for 18 months. Although the NUM had declared this unacceptable,on the grounds that it represented no improvement in percentage terms over the offer which had been previously made, this would bea helpful factor if they eventually agreed to a settlement of broadly the same order of magnitude; and it should also be valuable inrelation to public opinion that further negotiations had now takenplace at the Governments instigation. Although it was probablyunlikely that the NUM Executive would agree to put the revised offer to their membership, their President had indicated willingness tocontinue negotiations that day, after the Executive had met. the increasing difficulty of maintaining supplies of coal made it urgentto secure a resumption of work as quickly as possible. But it was doubtful if the Government could associate themselves with morethan a marginal improvement in the offer now tabled without prejudicing their incomes policy as a whole. Failing a settlement on that basis, therefore, he proposed, if his colleagues agreed, toappoint a court of inquiry forthwith. It was for consideration whether, in making this known to the NUM, he should suggest thatthe miners should resume work on the basis of the new offer without waiting for the outcome of the inquiry. It would be difficult for theminers to reject such a suggestion without forfeiting a further degreeof public sympathy. At the same time it would inevitably createsome expectation that the court of inquiry would award more than was now on offer.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that, beforethe Proclamation of a State of Emergency, the electricity generatingBoards had been prevented by their statutory supply obligations fromshedding load in order to conserve fuel stocks. It was now urgentto introduce severe restrictions on the use of electricity because theincreased intensity of picketing had immobilised a significant part ofthe power stations&apos; remaining coal stocks and the supplies which were still available might not suffice beyond the end of the following week,although a rigorous cut-back in electricity consumption would allow the stations to operate for some days more. Thereafter, and untilthe normal supply of coal supplies could be restored perhaps not until some weeks after work in the mines was resumed the output capacity of the generating Boards would be reduced to as little as25 per cent of the normal supply. It might then be impossible to operate the grid at a level which would maintain supplies to con-tinuous process industry and other essential users; and the widespreaddisconnections which would be inevitable would bring much ofindustry to a standstill and cause large numbers of workers to belaid off. If the activities of pickets were relaxed and coal presentlyimmobilised became available, this critical situation might not occuruntil the end of February. If, on the other hand, the miners resumedwork quickly, we should still face a period of severely reducedelectricity output extending,into March, until the normal flow of coal supplies was restored.The Attorney General said that the provisions of the industrial relations Act which related to secondary boycotts, &quot; blacking &quot; ofsupplies and the inducement of other workers to take action resulting in the frustration of-a commercial contract would not come into force
until 28 February. Except where there was a breach of the criminal law it was not, for example, unlawful for pickets to seek to make coalalready held by third parties unavailable for use. Such picketingwas immune from legal action even if it frustrated a commercialcontract, unless the inducement to break the contract was direct.There would in any event be little point in seeking injunctions againstpickets, since they would apply only to named individuals, notorganisations, and would not prevent others than those named from continuing their activities. On the whole most of the picketing whichhad taken place had been lawful. Where there was intimidation and it had been argued that in certain circumstances this would depend on the mere number of pickets picketing was unlawful. Anumber of arrests had, in fact, been made and prosecutions hadbeen undertaken; but the activities of pickets confronted the policewith very difficult and sensitive decisions.In discussion it was suggested that, in view of the severity of the impending threat to electricity supplies and to employment, which no action open to the Government could postpone by more than afew days, the first objective should be to secure a resumption of workand tactical considerations must be subordinated to this purpose.The miners might be induced to return to work either by an improved pay offer or by the increasing pressure to which they wouldbe subjected as they progressively lost the sympathy of public opinon as a result of the impact of power shortages and the adverse publicity which their intransigence would attract if they rejected the generousoffer now made to them. Every effort should therefore be exerted to impress on public opinion that this offer would give the miners signi-ficantly more than the average industrial wage, together with aminimum earnings guarantee which was higher than that sought bythe TUC. If any marked improvement in this offer were to emerge from conciliation, however, the Government would be directly asso-ciated with it and there would be risk of serious damage to theirincomes policy. It would accordingly be preferable, if no settlement where obtainable on the basis of this offer, to proceed by way of a courtof inquiry, despite the risk of further delay. In conveying thedecision to set up a court of inquiry to the NUM the Secretary ofState for Employment should nevertheless seek to persuade the union to resume work while it was sitting, if necessary by agreeing to theimmediate payment of the new rates.In further discussion the following main points were made (a) The present law on picketing appeared to permit activitiesextending well beyond what could be regarded as tolerable. Butcareful legal examination had not revealed any effective remedieswhich could be used against peaceful persuasion by miners&apos; picketsto induce other workers to take sympathetic action against stocksor supplies which were not the property of the NCB. Where the actions of large numbers of pickets and their sympathisers clearlyexceeded the lawful limits the police had clearly to use their discretion in seeking to enforce the law. For example, the Home secretary had been informed since the Cabinefs meeting began that the chief constable of Birmingham had that morning found it necessary to request the closure of the West Midlands Gas Board&apos;s Saltley coke
depot because lorries were unable to reach it through a crowd ofsome 7,000, despite the presence of some 500 police. The depotsupplied coal merchants, who had been requested by the Secretaryof State for Trade and Industry to supply priority consumers firstbut were under no obligation not to supply others. Its enforcedclosure therefore represented a victory for violence against the lawfulactivities of the Gas Board and the coal merchants; and it would therefore be desirable to ensure that the depot re-opened at an earlydate. Since the crowd at the depot would have been reinforced byengineering workers holding a 24-hours token strike, this might bepossible on the following day. This experience, nevertheless, provideddisturbing evidence of the ease with which, by assembling largecrowds, militants could flout the law with impunity because of therisk that attempts to enforce it would provoke disorder on a large scale.(b) There was some evidence of intimidation not only by picketsbut by strikers applying for social security benefit to which theywere not properly entitled.(c) It was now urgent to impose further restrictions on the useof electricity both in order to conserve fuel against possible failure to secure an early resumption of work and in order to impress on public opinion the gravity of the situation. The Ministerial Com-mittee on Emergencies at their meeting that afternoon should con-sider, however, whether it was desirable to proceed with the proposed order restricting the use of electricity for domestic space heating,which was not enforceable and depended for its effect on publicco-operation. It might be preferable to rely^ instead, on an appealto the general public to economise in the use of electricity in the homeand on the enforced saving which would result from the proposedrota cuts which were to begin on the following day. The cabinet were reminded, however, that within the total expected load reductionof 35 per cent from all the restrictions in contemplation, as much as14 per cent would derive from the expected response to the Orderrestricting domestic space heating. A statutory restriction was likelyto be more widely observed and would be seen and accepted as moreconvincing evidence of the seriousness of the situation than a mereappeal for economy. The Ministerial Committee on Emergencieshad also had reservations about the uneven impact of the proposedrestrictions on industry. Medium-sized consumers, for example,would be prohibited from using electricity on three named days aweek as well as on Sunday and the largest consumers would berequired to reduce their maximum demand and total consumption by 50 per cent, whereas small consumers would he subjected to rotacuts on only two days a week. Little would be gained by discon-tinuing television transmissions; and it might be preferable to rely on the rota cuts of electricity in this respect.(d) For the future risks might be spread by encouraging self-generation of electricity by industry on a far wider basis than was permitted under current policies. But this would make no substantialdifference to our vulnerability to an interruption in the publicelectricity supply.
(e) It would be desirable to give further consideration to thepossibility of invoking the provisions of the Industrial Relations Actif the NUM maintained their intransigent attitude, particularly ifthey rejected the findings of a court of inquiry. Application might then be made for a ballot order. But it might not be practicable to conduct a ballot satisfactorily in less than two or three weeks; andthere were clear risks of its results being affected by intimidation.(/) The offer of an 18-month agreement giving the miners a 50per cent improvement in the offer previously made to them for 12months might jeopardise forthcoming negotiations with other important groups of workers, such as the railwaymen, unless it couldbe clearly established that the miners constituted a special case.From this standpoint the findings of a court of inquiry might be helpful. But it was in any case arguable that the greater stabilityderiving from a longer-term agreement and in the case of the minersthe advantage of postponing the annual round of negotiations from november to May more than outweighed any loss in forgoing theeffects of pay de-escalation for an extra six months.(g) In the electricity pay dispute of the previous year the Govern-ment had insisted that the terms of reference of the court of inquiry should require it to have regard to the national interest. It was for consideration whether this stipulation should be repeated in thepresent instance, since the Government had subsequently made itpublicly clear that they expected all concerned with pay determina-tion to take the national interest into account. Moreover, a specific reference on this occasion would increase the difficulty of persuading the NUM to co-operate with the inquiry; and, even if they did so,it would afford them opportunities to delay the inquiry by claimingthe right to present expert evidence on the issue. The WilberforceInquiry in the previous year had taken a full month.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, unless the NUM indicated in the resumeddiscussions at the Department of Employment that they wereprepared to settle the dispute on the basis of the offer already madeto them, perhaps with some comparatively marginal improvementor concession such as its backdating to 1 November, the Secretaryof State for Employment should not pursue conciliation further but should arrange to set up a court of inquiry. He should seek, how-ever, to persuade the NUM to procure a resumption of work whilethe inquiry was sitting; and he was therefore authorised, if he found it desirable, to suggest that the offer already made should be putinto payment immediately work was resumed. There might betactical advantage, however, in seeking to reach this point in two stages. Initially, when it became clear that there was no prospectof agreement on an offer of the present order of magnitude, theSecretary of State might inform the union that he was unable totake the process of conciliation further and urge them to withdraw their opposition td arbitration or an independent inquiry. If they maintained their refusal to countenance this procedure, he might then take no further initiative until the following day, when he would inform them of his decision to appoint a court of inquiry and suggestan immediate return to work on the basis of the existing offer without waiting for the inquiry&apos;s findings.
The Cabinet also agreed that the proposed court of inquiry should consist of two independent members sitting under thechairmanship of a High Court Judge. While the terms of referenceneed not specifically require the inquiry to have regard to the national interest, it should be made known, by reference to earlier Govern-mental statements charging all concerned with pay determination totake the national interest into account, that this stipulation wasimplicit in the decision to appoint a court of inquiry in the present case. The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of Statefor Employment should consider whether it would on balance be advantageous to submit Government evidence to the court on thenational interest.The Ministerial Committee on Emergencies should give con-sideration at their meeting that afternoon to the urgent need to restrict further the use of electricity, taking account of the points made in discussion. The Home Secretary, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Attorney General,should review the implications of the incident at the West MidlandsGas Board&apos;s coke supply depot in Birmingham and should consider what action was required to secure its early reopening and to preventfurther incidents of a similar nature there or elsewhere. TheSecretary of State for Employment, in consultation with the attorney general, should arrange for the law governing picketing to be reviewed, with particular reference to the suggestion that peacefulpicketing should be lawful only at the workers&apos; normal place ofemployment. The Secretary of State for Social Services should arrange to put in hand a further re-examination of the eligibility ofstrikers for social security benefits on grounds of hardship or familyneed.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Ministers concerned to be guided accordingly.SECRETUnited 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChancellorKingdom       of the Duchy of Lancaster (CP (72) 15) to which was annexed aPolicies in      report by an interdepartmental group of officials following a reviewan Enlarged    0f faQ main economic policy objectives which the United KingdomEuropean should seek to pursue after accession to the European Communities.community the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster invited the Cabinetto endorse the recommendations made in the report about the objectives and priorities to be adopted in future work on our european policies. There were five areas in which it would be of critical importance to us to seek to influence the future developmentof Community policies regional and industrial policies, agriculture,economic and monetary union, and external commercial policies. Inaddition, the report emphasised that, in order to keep to a minimum the burden which our contributions to the Community budget would
impose on our economy, it was essential that we should makethorough and detailed preparations for obtaining the maximumreturn from existing programmes of Community expenditure as soonas our membership became effective. Finally, it was essential thatwe should have high-quality staff ready to fill senior posts in theEuropean Commission early in 1973. The Civil Service department were considering how the terms and conditions attaching to theseposts could be made sufficiently attractive; and the Lord Privy Sealwould shortly be visiting Brussels in order to make direct contact with the Commission.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion,&quot; said thatthe Cabinet endorsed the recommended objectives and priorities forour European policies contained in the report. In particular theyendorsed the importance of ensuring that the senior posts availableto us in the Commission should be held by staff of high quality. Themajority of these posts would be filled by secondments from theHome Civil Service; and it would be necessary to assure the staffconcerned that their career prospects would be enhanced by a periodof service with the Commission.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.CONFIDENTIALSite of the 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theEuropean Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (CP (72) 13) reporting thatPatent foe Ministerial Committee on Europe had been unable to reachOffice agreement on a proposal that we should seek to have the EuropeanPatent Office (EPO) sited in this country; and a memorandum bythe Central Policy Review Staff (CP (72) 14) setting out reasons why we should make a bid for a major European institution.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that, since theFederal German Government had for some time been pressing tohave the EPO established in Munich, we could not afford to be too optimistic about our chances of securing it for this country. But itwas essential that we should make a bid for its establishment on a united Kingdom site, not only because this would bring considerable advantages, both presentational and economic, to the United King-dom but also because, even if our bid failed, it would havestrengthened our bargaining position for the future when the location of other European institutions, particularly the European Meteorolo-psychological  Centre, came to be decided.In discussion there was considerable support for the view that we,must seek to ensure that the United Kingdom secured henceforwardits fair share of international institutions. It was also agreed that,although a provincial site would be cheaper than a site in Londonand would have the additional advantage of engaging regionalinterests in our new European connection, a London site was to be preferred not merely because it was appropriate that international
institutions should be located in or near a capital city but also because, in the present instance, it would clearly be advantageous to locate the EPO in close proximity to the new Patent Library inBloomsbury. The expenditure involved might be considerably reduced if a commercial developer could be interested in constructinga suitable building on the site eventually selected and so relieving the Government of liability for the initial capital outlay. this possibility should be further examined. It had to be accepted that,in order to make our bid competitive with those of our Europeanrivals, we might eventually have to concede that the EPO and its staff should be granted comprehensive fiscal privileges. But ourposition on this issue could be reserved for the time being.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were clearly of the view that we should make a determined effort to secure the EPO for this country.The Cabinet Approved CP (72) 13, subject to the points which had emerged during their discussion, and invited the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office,10 February, 1972.
