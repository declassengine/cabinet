ParliamentaryAffairsThe legislative programme,1971-72 SessionPreviousReference:CM (72) 26thConclusions,Minute 2The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Lord President of theCouncil and agreed to review progress on the LocalGovernment Bill at an early meeting.OverseaASairsIraqSECRET2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the nationalisation of the Iraq Petroleum Company by the Governmentof Iraq marked the culmination of the latter&apos;s long-standing dispute with the company. But, although they were probably within theirlegal rights in taking this step, it was regrettable that they had actedwith such abruptness; their decision to do so was possibly connectedwith the recent signature of a Soviet/Iraq treaty. It was forconsideration what action we should take to protect British interests.It might not be to our advantage to &quot; black &quot; Iraqi oil (by analogywith our treatment of Libyan oil following the nationalisation of theinterests of British Petroleum (BP) by the Libyan Government), since this might well provoke other Arab oil-producing States such asKuwait and Abu Dhabi to take action against Western-owned companies. Meanwhile, in order to co-ordinate Western reactions,he had arranged for an early meeting in Paris with representatives ofthe Governments of France, the United States and the Netherlands,whose companies were part owners with Shell and BP of the iraq petroleum Company. The Iraqi Government had indicated that theymight be prepared to consider some separate arrangement with theFrench Government; and the possibility of such a development,1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in&apos;the following week.The Cabinet considered progress on the Local Government Bill.*The Lord President of the Council said that some amendments to the Local Government Bill in the House of Lords were probablyunavoidable; and on this assumption a Report Stage would berequired. The Lords&apos; consideration of the Bill was therefore unlikely to be completed until after the House of Commons had adjourned for the Summer Recess. If the aim of securing Royal Assent to theBill before the end of September was to be achieved, it would thenbe necessary to recall the House of Commons during the course ofSeptember to consider the Lords&apos; Amendments. There would beobvious difficulties in such a course; in particular, a full attendance of Government supporters would be required, since the Governmentsmajorities on the Bill had at times been quite small. He did not atthis stage invite the Cabinet to come to a decision; but it would bedesirable for the matter to be further considered when the Secretaryof State for the Environment returned from his official engagementabroad.
together with its consequences for ourselves and our allies, would be explored at the Paris meeting. The loss of Iraqi oil would not be immediately damaging to us; we derived only 3  per cent of ourannual requirement from that source, although it produced 9 percent of the requirements of Europe as a whole.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that he wouldbe meeting representatives of the two British oil companies later that day and would then give further consideration to the effects of theaction of the Iraqi Government on our long-term interests.Experience suggested that the Iraqi Government would not beprepared to make a satisfactory settlement with the company; and,although the loss of Iraqi oil would not be critical for us, the effect of nationalisation on our reserves in the longer term could be significant.He was examining the situation urgently and would circulate amemorandum on his findings to the Cabinet.Visit of theUnited StatesPresidentto the SovietUnionThe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the visit ofthe President of the United States, Mr. Nixon, to Moscow hadbeen completed to the general satisfaction of both the United Statesand the Soviet Governments. The former were entitled to claimcredit for the conclusion of the agreement on strategic arms limita-tion, in which they had had due regard to our interests; while theSoviet Government, for their part, were gratified by the attentionpaid to them by the President, which they regarded as confirmingtheir own estimation of themselves as no less influential a worldPower than the United States. It was unlikely that any significantchanges in the foreign policies of the two Governments would result from the meeting, although the Soviet Government appeared to bemore inclined to regard the war in Vietnam as a relatively minorobstacle to the development of better relations with the UnitedStates.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that he hadbeen told by Mr. Flanigan, Assistant to President Nixon for international Economic Affairs, that no progress had been made towards the development of increased commercial exchanges betweenthe two countries.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary and the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry.VietnamPreviousReference:CM (72) 28thConclusions,Minute 2The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and commonwealth office, Mr. Royle, and other recent visitors to China had been impressed by the intensity of Chinese hostility to the Soviet Union.The Chinese Government had refused to allow the passage of Sovietarms to North Vietnam; and it seemed that as a result of that action and of the American mining of the port of Haiphong the military
Soviet UnionPreviousReference:CM (71) 49thConclusions,Minute 2situation in Vietnam was now more favourable to the forces of theGovernment of South Vietnam. Events had shown that PresidentNixon&apos;s assessment of Soviet reactions was right; and this would nodoubt be helpful to him in the forthcoming Presidential election.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that at therecent meeting for signature of the Berlin Agreement he had had anopportunity to represent to the Soviet Foreign Minister,Mr. Gromyko, that the time had come to re-establish diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union on amore normal basis, despite the stress to which they had been subjected in recent months by our action in expelling certain Sovietintelligence officers. The moment might be the more opportune inthat it now appeared to be the intention of the Soviet Governmentto work for stabilisation of the situation in Europe while continuing to exploit any opportunity for expansion in the Middle East and indian Ocean.North AtlanticTreatyOrganisationPreviousReference:CM (71) 63rdConclusions,Minute 2The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the meetingof the North Atlantic Council in Bonn on 30-31 May had been satisfactory and that the way was now open for preparation for aconference on European security and co-operation in the followingspring. Formal multilateral preparations were likely to startimmediately following the Presidential election in the United states in the autumn of 1972.CentralTreatyOrganisationPreviousReference:CM (71) 24thConclusions,Minute 2The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the19th Meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Central treaty organisation (CENTO) in London had been dominated by theevident intention of the Government of Pakistan to try to turn theOrganisation into an instrument for prosecuting their quarrel with india. This had raised the question whether our interests were bestserved by keeping the Organisation in being. On balance, however,it was probably in our interest to continue to support CENTO, themore so since the Governments of Turkey and Iran evidently found ituseful.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.JapanPreviousReference:CM (71) 49thConclusions,Minute 2The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that he hadpaid a useful visit to Japan. His object had been to add to the representations already made on behalf of Dther Governments thatthe Japanese Government should work actively to ensure more stabletrade conditions and that the possibility of expansion of trade between us should not be undermined by uncontrolled marketing of japanese exports in narrow sectors of production. He had arranged with Japanese Ministers that officials would report in September onthe progress achieved in implementing decisions taken to these ends.His approach had been opportune since it appeared that the JapaneseGovernment were currently developing new economic policies which141569-16
should have the effect of increasing the spending capacity of theJapanese population and permitting the improvement of social conditions, changes which should prove incompatible with theaggressive commercial enterprise which at present characterised thecountry.In the course of a brief discussion it was recognised that theJapanese export trade was based upon a highly efficient industry which had benefited from a very high rate of capital investment andreflected a very high level of productivity. Moreover, althoughJapanese exporters enjoyed in consequence considerable advantages in international trade, their success was attributable also to theirgreat determination in seeking out and exploiting relatively easymarkets. The British markets for fibres and ball bearings were cases in point; markets in other European countries were also being subjected to similar attacks. Unless the Japanese Governmentindicated very soon that they intended to moderate their exportpolicies, it would be necessary to take firm action ourselves.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that it was necessary to consider ways and means of protecting British firms from the damaging effects of Japanesecommercial techniques. The Economic Policy Committee should consider the matter urgently and make recommendations.The Cabinet-(3) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.secret. The Secretary of State for Employment said that the JointCommittee of the two sides of the port industry, which was being set up to examine the problems of the industry under the jointchairmanship of the Chairman of the Port of London authority and the General Secretary of the Transport and General WorkersUnion (TGWU), would be holding its first meeting that evening.CM (72) 28th Although union officials had succeeded in preventing the proposedConclusions, strike of tally clerks, militant elements within the TGWU were minute 4 pressing for a one-day strike of dockers to coincide with thereconvening of the Delegate Conference. The Joint Committee must now aim to make sufficient progress to secure a further postponement of official strike action, in order to have time to complete its reviewfree of the pressures which a strike would impose.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for employment.IndustrialAffairsIndustrialAction inthe DocksPreviousReference:
The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the railwaymen&apos;spay negotiations.*The Minister for Transport Industries said that the british railways Board (BRB), in the person of the Board Memberresponsible for industrial relations, proposed to meet the three railunions that morning in preparation for a further exchange of viewsbetween the BRB Chairman and the unions. The unions appearedto be in no mood to contemplate a compromise settlement of their pay dispute; indeed, officials of the Associated Society of locomotive engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) were under considerable pressure from militant elements for the immediate resumption of industrial action. Since this situation left the BRB with little scope for a new initiative, the prospects of avoiding further industrial action seemedslight. The most likely date for its resumption was the followingFriday. The senior management of BRB were now very concerned about the increasing decline in morale among the management atlower level and the lack of discipline among the rank and file; andthey were becoming anxious about the risk of accidents in any further period of industrial action.The Lord Privy Seal said that the latest review of contingency planning had shown that the maintenance of supplies for power stations during a rail strike would be unlikely to present a serious problem provided that supplies by road were not interrupted.Endurance at the power stations in a full rail strike was estimated to be 10 to 12 weeks without the introduction of restrictions onelectricity consumption and to be indefinite if restrictions equivalentto those imposed at the worst period of the miners&apos; strike were introduced. If, however, deliveries by road were interrupted bypicketing or sympathetic action such as had occurred during theminers&apos; strike, endurance would be three to four weeks withoutelectricity restrictions and six to eight weeks with restrictions as during the coal strike. As regards oil priority consumers shouldhave a minimum of six weeks&apos; endurance in all circumstances. Inthe event of a railway &quot; go-slow &quot; similar to those which had already occurred, non-priority consumers in the most vulnerable area, theMidlands, would have about four weeks&apos; endurance at normal levels of consumption, provided that about half the oil usually delivered by rail reached them. If the oil companies were also able to use roadtankers to supplement supplies, endurance would be increased toabout five weeks. In a full rail strike oil supplies for non-priorityconsumers would be liable to fail during the third week. The effecton employment was hard to assess. But, in broad terms, if therewere a work-to-rule on the pattern adopted previously by the railunions, about 100,000 individuals in the Midlands and a similarnumber in Yorkshire might be laid off or put on short time after five weeks, or four weeks if it proved impossible to supplement raildelivery by road on this occasion. If there were a full rail strike,involving the interruption of the carriage of oil by rail, and if no additional road movements were possible, the number of workers* Previously circulated as a Confidential Annex.SECRET
affected might be about 400,000 by the fourth week, rising perhaps to 1 million thereafter. Plans existed for the use of troops to supple-ment the supply of oil by road, if necessary. It seemed unlikely thatthe coincidence of a dock strike with a rail strike would addsignificantly to the problems of securing the continuance of essential services.In discussion, it was suggested that, following the result of the railwaymen&apos;s ballot, the rail unions had made it clear that they werein no mood to compromise on their claim for payment of the new rates of pay from 1 May, involving a 14 per cent increase, and thattheir intransigent attitude throughout the negotiations showed thatthey were determined to prosecute this claim by every means opento them, regardless of the interests and views of the general public.It would be mistaken, therefore, to suppose that the unions would settle at present on any basis other than the full concession of a14 per cent increase. Nevertheless, the consequences of concedingtheir demands in full would be very serious both for the nation andfor the Government. If the Government were now seen to lack thepolitical will to resist the railwaymen&apos;s attack on their incomes policy,its credibility would be destroyed since, unless the Governmentremained firm in their treatment of pay claims in the public sector,private employers would certainly not withstand excessive claims and the Government would then find themselves with no means ofcountering an unacceptable rate of inflation other than a statutoryprices and incomes policy. Moreover, even if the governments supporters in Parliament could be brought to endorse such a policy,it would not relieve the Government of the need to continue resistingunreasonable and inflationary demands. It was therefore essentialthat the Government should now stand firm in the face of the threat of renewed industrial action on the railways, even though the railunions might be determined to press their demands to the point ofoutright confrontation. It should not necessarily be assumed thatthe unions would persuade their members to sustain industrial actionover a long period, since railwaymen would quickly lose more intake-home pay than they stood to gain from winning their demandfor the backdating of the new rates of pay by one month. But, ifthe Government were to resist the unions&apos; demand successfully, itwas essential to counter the present tendency of public opinion toassume that only a minor difference with regard to the effective date,involving a comparatively small sum of money, remained in disputeand that some reasonable compromise should therefore be possible.The general public must be convinced that the question was one of resisting industrial blackmail, in which rail users/and the country ingeneral were being held to ransom for a further increase in an alreadygenerous pay offer. Given that fuel stocks were near their maximumat the start of the summer and that the balance of payments was inconsiderable surplus, there was unlikely to be a more favourable time than the present to meet the union challenge on this issue of principle.On the other hand, despite the apparent strength of the Govern-ment s present position, the outcome of a confrontation with the railunions could not be predicted; and it would be disastrous to embark
on a confrontation if victory could not be assured. Althoughindustrial action on the railways might initially be limited, the disciplinary measures which it would force the BRB to take wouldbe liable to provoke a full-scale strike which would subject the public to very serious inconvenience, would cause widespread industrialdisruption and might lead to a serious increase in unemploymentwithin a few weeks. The overwhelming vote in the recent ballot infavour of resumed industrial action, however, indicated that it was unlikely that even in these circumstances the railwaymen would be deterred from continuing the strike; and public opinion would not easily be persuaded that the cost of continuing to resist their demandswas worth while. Ultimately, the Government would probably be forced to yield to these pressures and to meet the railwaymen&apos;demands in full. If so, however, it would be better for the concession to be made now. Previous experience showed that major strikes,once started, could only be ended at a price; but a concession madenow need not represent a defeat for the Government, since they hadalready compelled the rail unions to observe the procedures prescribed by law under the Industrial Relations Act. In doing so they hadadmittedly put the unions in baulk, since the result of the railway-men^ ballot made it virtually impossible for them now to accept the12^ per cent settlement which was on offer if payment of the new rates was made from 1 June. The ballot need not, however, prevent them from reaching a settlement below their full 14 per cent demand.Nor did it oblige the BRB at this stage to take the initiative in proposing some specific compromise settlement. But in order to enlist the support of public opinion it was very desirable that theGovernment and the BRB should be in the posture of having showntheir readiness in principle to reach a reasonable compromise if theunions were also willing to do so. It was in fact BRB&apos;s purpose in their discussions with the rail unions that morning to explore theunions&apos; willingness to compromise; and, if the exchanges broke down,it would be important to make it publicly known that the Board had expressed a readiness to reach a compromise settlement and had invited the unions&apos; suggestions. If the unions refused to settle for lessthan their full claim, public opinion should then be readier to supportthe Board and the Government in any ensuing confrontation.In further discussion, however, it was pointed out that thiscourse, while having certain presentational advantages, was unlikely to produce an agreed settlement and that the Cabinet had still todecide whether, when the unions had finally refused to compromise,the Government could face a confrontation with the confidence thatthey would be able to carry it to a conclusion without being forced into ultimate concession of the unions&apos; full demand. They could hope to do so only if public opinion could be persuaded that,despite the willingness of the Government and the Board to reach a compromise settlement^ the unions had insisted on pressing a whollyunreasonable demand at the cost of holding the nation to ransomand deliberately challenging the Governments authority; and theywould need to be prepared, if necessary, to put to the test their view that a major question of principle was involved and that in thesecircumstances it was in the public interest to resist the unions&apos;
demand. It would not be easy, however, to establish clearly thatthese were the issues at stake; and there was the danger that, bydemonstrating their willingness to compromise on either the effectivedate or the percentage of the present offer, the Government andthe Board would so narrow the remaining area of difference withthe unions that the task of convincing public opinion of the need to resist concession of the union&apos;s full demand would become evenmore difficult. It would therefore be helpful to explore further thepossibility of finding some alternative way of modifying the offer,for example, by extending the period for which the settlement would apply, which would meet both the unions&apos; case for backdating andthe Governmenfs desire to limit the cost of the settlement to 12\ percent.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) It would be desirable that the BRB should be ready,immediately after a settlement of the railway pay dispute, to announceany increase in fares and freight charges which they had it in mind to make as a result, in order that the connection between wage and price increases might be brought home to the public. It would benecessary, however, to consider carefully the justification for anyproposed price increases which were in excess of the criteria laiddown by the Confederation of British Industry.(b) If there were no progress in the discussions between theBRB and the unions, it might be desirable for the Secretary of Statefor Employment to invite both parties to meet him in order toascertain whether there was any scope for compromise.(c) The present dispute was delaying the negotiations on there organisation of the railways, which had the objective of reducingthe BRB staff by 6,000. But it would probably be undesirable to raisethe matter during the pay negotiations, lest the unions insisted onan undertaking that there would be no redundancy.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theattitude of the unions would be critical in determining the course ofaction which the BRB should follow. The Cabinet agreed that theBoard must have reasonable flexibility of tactical manoeuvre. TheChairman had already been informed that he might concede imple-mentation of the pay offer as from 22 May provided that this wouldresult in a prompt and final settlement but that, if the Board desiredto make any further concession, he should first consult the Ministerfor Transport Industries. The Minister should now seek to persuade him that the Board&apos;s best course was to induce the unions themselvesto propose a compromise settlement. /The Cabinet-Took note, witlrapproval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Minister for transport industries to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office,6 June, 1972.
