secret parliamentary l. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons on its return after the Summer Recess on tuesday, 17 October, and in the remainder of that week. If, as now seemed possible, the Local Government Bill were not completed in the House of Lords in the period of two weeks beginning on11 September, it would be necessary for that House to sit into thefollowing week. It was proposed that Parliament should assemblefor the next session on Tuesday, 31 October.secret oversea 2.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the affairs President of Uganda, General Amin, had announced that all AsianUganda holders of British passports in Uganda would be required to leavethe country within three months and that he looked to us thereafter to assume responsibility for them. Details of this decision werenot yet available; nor could we be certain about its motivation.But General Amin&apos;s political standing in Uganda had recentlydeclined as a result of tribal disputes; and it seemed probable thathe had taken this action in an attempt to regain popular support.The number of individuals involved could not be assessed withaccuracy; but preliminary estimates suggested that there mightbe about 57,000 British passport holders in Uganda. Moreover,there were some 55,000 and 20,000 others in Kenya and Tanzaniarespectively, where the Governments were known to resent their presence and might now follow the example of President Amin by having them removed. The British High Commissioner in Kampalahad been instructed to seek an urgent interview with PresidentAmin in order to emphasise to him the inhumanity of his intendedaction, the damage which it would inflict on the Ugandan economy andthe international condemnation which it was likely to attract. It would&apos;help the High Commissioner if he were able to reinforce his repre-sentations with a personal message from the Prime Minister. But,since it seemed unlikely that President Amin would modify his decision, an interdepartmental body had been established in orderto consider, on the advice of the Law Officers, the various courses of action open to us. In the last resort we could not disclaimresponsibility for British passport holders, even if we so wished;nor would public opinion in the countries most closely involvedaccept an attempt to do so. Nevertheless, it might be necessaryto adopt a more restrictive attitude towards the entry of British -passport holders into the United Kingdom, even if we left unim-paired the right of dependants to join heads of households, whichwe had always respected. For example, although entry voucherswere currently limited to 3,500 a year, some 14,000 individualswere in fact admitted to this country.The Home Secretary said that he had already put in handcontingency planning against the risk that we might be requiredto admit large additional numbers of Asian British passport holdersat short notice. The Ministerial Committee on Immigration and community relations would consider the problem on the following day.   We should not suppose that a reduction in the number of141569-20
entry vouchers would suffice to solve the problem, since it would? r &quot; have only, a marginal effect on the total number of Asian immigrants-v: &quot; but would arouse disproportionate concern in some of the old commonwealth countries whose citizens would be disadvantaged.From the presentational point of view it was important that weshould be seen to be doing all we could to persuade President Aminto adopt a more reasonable attitude.In the course of a brief discussion it was accepted that we couldnot disclaim responsibility for British passport holders. But wemust seek to ensure that world opinion was fully seized of theproblem if a mass movement of population in a state of panic wasto be avoided. A Commonwealth or international conference might not provide a wholly appropriate forum for. thispurpose. But the Commonwealth Secretary General, Mr. ArnoldSmith, might be moved to urge Commonwealth Governments toconsider whether they could contribute to the relocation of theAsians who were to be removed from East Africa; and a suitableresolution by the United Nations might be helpful.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that urgent interdepartmental consideration shouldbe given to the situation and that the outcome should be referred tothe Cabinet. Since many Ministers would be on holiday in theimmediate future, the Cabinet agreed that he should have discretion,in consultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary andthe Home Secretary, to take any action which might be requiredurgently.The Cabinet .......(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to inquire whether the Commonwealth Secretary general would be prepared to ask Commonwealth governments for their assistance in dealing with the problem of relocat-ing British passport holders who were removed from east Africa.Antigua The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the internalPrevious       situation in Antigua was again giving cause for concern. We had no reference:    obligation to intervene in support of the local Government; but aCM (72) 34th frigate was in the area and would be available in case of need.Conclusions,Minute 3 The Cabinet-[. (3)  Took note of the statement by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.secret. The Secretary of State for Employment said that there was still a possibility that Lord Aldington, the Chairman of the Port ofLondon Authority, and Mr. Jack Jones, the General Secretary ofthe Transport and General Workers Union, might be able to produceacceptable proposals for a settlement of the docks dispute, althoughIndustrialAffairsThe DocksStrikePreviousReference :CM (72) 39thConclusions,
this was beginning to appear rather less likely. If proposals of thiskind could not be devised, the alternatives would be a long strike or a surrender to militancy. It would therefore be desirable togive Lord Aldington and Mr. Jones another day or two in which to continue their attempts to promote an agreement, the more sosince the dispute was now confined to a very narrow range of issues.All parties agreed that small wharves using unregistered labour should not handle foreign cargoes. Similarly, there was no disagree-ment on the subject of whole-load containers packed by, or consigned to, manufacturers. The argument now centred on the part-loadcontainers (20 per cent of the total), some of which were not being dealt with by dockers. The number of jobs involved was small;but, especially with regard to one or two container firms, theemotional issues involved had come to transcend the intrinsic merits of the case. The dockers would not be content with an assurance that negotiations could proceed on the question after they had returned to work; they were seeking a firm guarantee that dockerswould be given the jobs involved. The Aldington/Jones discussionsmight have made enough progress to make it realistic for Mr. Jonesto convene a Docks Delegate Conference later in the week withoutrisking a second rebuff. But he had thought it right to warn Mr.Jones that, if no summons to such a Conference had been issued byThursday or if a Conference were summoned but did not meetuntil the following week, the Government would have to take adecision on Friday about other measures to clear the docks.The Lord Privy Seal said that the position in the docks was generally unchanged. A few small ports were still working; but allthe main docks were now at a standstill. Stocks of animal feeding-stuffs were falling rapidly; and in some of the Scottish islands,including Orkney and Shetland, the shortage of food was causinganxiety. Attempts were being made through unofficial channelsto persuade dockers to volunteer to unload animal feed; but sofar they had not succeeded. Since it would take the Services a week from the issue of the deployment order to become fully effective,a decision on the use of troops to move cargoes would probablybe required by the end of the week. Its public presentation wouldbe very important; if the introduction of troops provoked sympathetic-thetic action by the road transport workers in support of the dockers,a critical situation could develop.In discussion the following main points were made (a) Although the effect of a combined dock and road haulagestrike would certainly be serious, Mr. Jones would wish to avoidit if possible.(b) There were some signs of more violent picketing by dockers.But this would not enlist public opinion in their favour; and arrange-ments for police action to deal with situations of this kind were now more satisfactorily co-ordinated on a national basis.(c) It would be important to give effective publicity to thedanger to livestock and to the initial industrial effects of the strike,including the laying-off of over 2,000 workers by InternationalHarvesters Ltd.141569-20b*
Meetings withthe Confeder-ation ofBritishIndustry andthe TradesUnionCongressPreviousReference:CM (72) 36thConclusions,Minute 4Pay of theIndustrialCivil ServicePreviousReference:CM (72) 37thConclusions,Minute 6(d) There had been confusing reports about the eligibility for for Supplementary Benefit of dockers who volunteered for workand subsequently gave their earnings to charity. In the circumstances in question Supplementary Benefit could not be paid.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itmust be made clear to Mr. Jones that, in default of a Docks delegate conference later in the week or of an offer by dockers to unloadanimal feedingstuffs, the Government would have to introduceServicemen into the docks. The Ministers concerned in the debate onthe Emergency Order-in-Council later that day should consult theSecretary of State for Social Services about the best means of dealingwith the question of payment of Supplementary Benefit to dockerswho worked voluntarily during the strike.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Employment to warnMr. Jones of the circumstances in which the government might be compelled to introduce Servicemen into the docks.The Prime Minister said that the resumed discussion withrepresentatives of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) andthe Trades Union Congress (TUC) on the previous evening had hada satisfactory outcome; and a further programme of work had beenagreed with a view to another meeting on 14 September. The TUCrepresentatives were not willing to enter into any agreement before their annual conference had taken place earlier that month; but theirattitude on the question of the Industrial Relations Act appeared tobe becoming more reasonable.The Lord Privy Seal said that he had had a further meeting withrepresentatives of the Industrial Civil Service. While they remainedstrongly opposed to arbitration in the present dispute, they were anxious to resume negotiations. He proposed to continue informal discussions.The Cabinet-(3)  Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister and theLord Privy Seal.SECRETEconomic 4.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the cabinet situation that, on the basis of the latest economic forecasts, output was continu-ing to rise at a rate approximating to 5 per cent per annum, whileindustrial output per head was provisionally judged to be no lessthan 8^ per cent higher than a year earlier. Exports had sufferedless disruption than imports from recent industrial unrest andremained buoyant. The latest forecast of industrial investment was
more optimistic; the rate of increase in the retail price index wasconsiderably less than a year before; and the standard of living had improved more in the last two years than at any time in the previoussix. There was also a reasonable expectation of a moderate current account surplus on the balance of payments.All these favourable indications, however, could be nullifiedif the problem of cost inflation were not solved. The situation inthis respect was aggravated by several factors which would tend toencourage retail prices to rise again. These included an increase in import prices resulting from the depreciation of sterling; the intro-duction of fair rents as a result of recent legislation; the levies whichwould become payable when we became a member of the european economic Community; and the introduction of Value Added Tax.There were various means by which the Government could moderatethe impact of these forces if they saw fit to do so. But in eachcase the effect would be to increase the level of demand, whichwas now broadly in line with the basic assumption adopted in thelast Budget, and to create considerable problems of financing whichwould aggravate the difficulty of curbing public expenditure. Ifthe Government were to retain their freedom of action to take such steps as might be appropriate to limit the rise in prices, it was essential that they should not relax their efforts to limit public expenditure and that, in the forthcoming round of wage negotiations,they should do all in their power to confine wage increases to theminimum. They should not allow themselves either to be deflectedfrom this purpose by the excessive increases which had had to be conceded during the coalmining and railway disputes or to be undulyinfluenced by the more co-operative attitude which the trade unionsappeared to be adopting in the current tripartite discussions betweenthe Government, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and theTrades Union Congress.In discussion there was general agreement with these views.An increase of nearly 8  per cent in productivity should considerablyreduce the need for significant increases in retail prices; and this consideration should be put forcefully to the CBI in relation to the limited renewal of the period of price restraint which they had now accepted. It was also agreed that the Government should be careful not to build too much, in terms of public expectation, on short term forecasts, which were necessarily based on a projectionof current tendencies without regard to changes of policy whichmight be found necessary or desirable from time to time. Even so,it might be salutary to ensure that the public were reminded of themore favourable aspects of the economic situation, which in many respects was developing in accordance with the basic policies whichhad provided the foundation for the last Budget.The Futureof theNuclearIndustryPreviousReference:CM (72) 35thConclusionsCONFIDENTIAL5. The Cabinet considered a Note by the Secretary of Statefor Trade and Industry (CP (72) 90), to which was annexed a draft parliamentary statement on nuclear reactor policy and the futureof the nuclear industry.SECRET
The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that thedraft statement, which he hoped to make that afternoon, had beenprepared in the light of prolonged discussion in the ministerial committee on Economic Strategy. It emphasised the government&apos;s intention to press ahead rapidly with the development of the fastbreeder reactor (FBR) in the hope of placing the first full scaleorder for it in the late 1970s and of using it thereafter for the major part of nuclear generating plant orders from the mid-1980sonwards. As regards the choice of nuclear reactor in the medium term until the FBR came into full scale operation the draft statementreferred to the continuing work on the steam-generating heavywater reactor (SGHWR) and the advanced gas-cooling reactor (AGR)and, more briefly, to the Governmenfs intention to engage in inter-national collaborative work on the development of the high temper-nature reactor (HTR) and on the safety aspects of the light waterreactor (LWR). Although the draft statement mentioned further work to establish the safety of the SGHWR, this might be misleading,since there was no reason to suppose that the safety of the SGHWR,as distinct from the LWR, might be in doubt. The reference could therefore be deleted. For the rest the statement sought to strike the right balance by indicating the potentialities of the SGHWRwithout committing the Government to a definite decision in itsfavour at this stage; and it made it clear that this choice would depend on the result of the evaluation studies to be carried out overthe next 18 months. The statement stressed the need for a singlestrong industrial nuclear design and construction unit, closely involved with the Atomic Energy Authority (sea) and British Nuclear FuelsLimited (BNFL) and capable of playing a leading role in inter-national collaboration. But the decision on its structure was left open until discussions with all interested parties had been completed.It also included an announcement of the establishment of a nuclear power Board, containing representatives of all the interested bodies,to advise the Government on all aspects of civil nuclear powerpolicy.In discussion it was pointed out that the North of ScotlandHydro-electric Board intended to make a simultaneous announce-ment that afternoon of the decision to build an oil and gas-firedpower station, to be commissioned in 1978. In order to avoidapparent discrepancy between the two announcements, the Parlia-mentary statement on the nuclear industry should make it clear thatthe main need of the generating Boards for nuclear power stations would arise after 1980 rather than from the late 1970s as the draftimplied. ,The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that it was important that the Governmenfs optionson the choice of reactor and on the structure of the nuclear design and construction industry should be left open for the present. they accordingly approved the proposed Parliamentary statement subjectto the amendments suggested in discussion. The Secretary of Statefor Trade and Industry should now initiate further consultations,without commitment, with all the interested parties on the future
structure of the nuclear industry, and should report the outcome ofthese consultations to the Ministerial Committee on economic strategy. He himself would arrange for a further study of thealternative concept that the nuclear industry might be reorganisedon the basis of public enterprise, rather than a commercial company,possibly by a reconstitution of the Atomic Energy Authority. the ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy would then need toconsider the options further in the light of the outcome of that study and of the consultations with commercial interests.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Approved the proposed Parliamentary statement attachedto CP (72) 90, subject to the amendments agreed in discussion, and invited the Secretary of State for Tradeand Industry to make it that afternoon.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry toreport to the Ministerial Committee on economic strategy the outcome of his further consultations withinterested bodies on the future structure of the nuclearindustry.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for a study of an alternative concept of the nuclear industry,based on public enterprise.confidential industrial 6.   The Secretary of State for Employment said that theTraining Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy (EPC) had reviewed the proposals contained in the consultative document &quot; Training inthe Future&quot; in the light of the comments received during the consultations. There had since been further discussion amongthe Ministers mainly concerned, the outcome of which was reflected in a draft Parliamentary statement which he had circulated to members of the Cabinet. This recorded that the Training Oppor-tunities Scheme proposed in the consultative document had been widely welcomed and that the development of the scheme was inhand. The other main proposals in the consultative documentconcerned the establishment of a National Training Agency and thefuture of the levy/grant scheme. As regards the former many ofthose consulted, including the Trades Union Congress (TUC) andthe Confederation of British Industry (CBI), had expressed concern about the proposed separation of the agency responsible for trainingfrom the Employment Services Agency which had been set up within the Department of Employment. He intended to discuss thematter further with the TUC and the CBI before reaching conclusions on the eventual form of organisation; but for the time being he pro-posed to reorganise the training services as an Agency within his department, matching the management structure of the EmploymentServices Agency.   This Training Services Agency would carry out
the broad range of activities previously proposed for the proposed national Training Agency.As regards the future of the levy/grant system, much responsibleopinion was convinced that its complete abolition would lead to adecline in the amount and quality of training in important industries and that some continuing financial incentive to the provision of effective training was necessary. He therefore proposed that smallerfirms should be wholly exempt from levies, present levels of exemp-tion should be raised, and Industrial Training Boards should berequired to exempt from levy any firm which they were satisfiedwas carrying out such training as was reasonable to meet its own needs. Firms which did not qualify for exemption, however, mightbe required to pay a levy not exceeding 1 per cent of the pay roll; andthe money would be used by the Boards to encourage better trainingin the industries with which they were concerned. Adequate appealmachinery would be instituted.In discussion it was suggested that, although the present pro-posals might prove unwelcome to some of the government&apos;s supporters, any proposals in this field were likely to provokecontroversy. The Government would need to demonstrate that the appeal procedure for the levy/grant system would be independent of the Industrial Training Boards and that it would be operated with the aim of maintaining a reasonable standard of training inrelation to the actual needs of the industries concerned. It wouldalso be necessary to reach early decisions about the future organis-ation of the training and employment services. The proposals toestablish a training agency outside the Department of employment and, possibly, to move towards the establishment of a NationalManpower Commission which would include the EmploymentServices had major implications both for the organisation of Govern-ment Departments and for the large amount of public funds involved;and these would need to be carefully studied before a decision wastaken. If it was decided to establish such a Commission, this might need to be held in reserve as a bargaining factor in the current discussions with the TUC and the CBI.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the levy /grant system should continue in the modified form proposed by the Secretary of State for Employment.The future organisation of the training and employment services required careful consideration; and the Secretary of State for employment should discuss his proposals further with the ministers most closely concerned. He should also consult the TUC and CBIon the matter, but without entering into any commitment to a par-ticular form of organisation. In the light of these consultations a full report on all the available options should be circulated to the ministerial Committee on Economic Policy for consideration. In themeantime, the Cabinet agreed that the Secretary of State shouldmake a statement to Parliament on the lines which he had indicated.
The Cabinet-(1)  Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2)  Invited the Secretary of State for Employment (i) in consultation with the Home Secretary and lord president of the Council, to make a parliamentary statement on the lines agreed in their discussion;(ii) to consult further with the Confederation of BritishIndustry and the Trades Union Congress, without commitment, about the future organisation of thetraining and employment services;(iii) to discuss with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Lord Privy Seal and the Secretary of State for social Services the implications of his proposals regarding the future organisation of the training and employment services;(iv) to circulate a further report to the ministerial committee on Economic Policy in the light ofthese consultations.SECRETLegislative 7.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of programme state for the Home Department and Lord President of the Council1972-73 Session (CP (72) g9) on the Legislative Programme for the 1972-73 Session.The Home Secretary and Lord President said that the cabinet had decided in principle that a significantly lighter programme was desirable in the following Session. But since the programme had beenapproved in May several essential additional Bills, listed in Part of the Annex to CP (72) 89, had been brought forward; and, althoughnone of these was individually of great weight, in the aggregate theywould add significantly to the demand on legislative resources. Inaddition it was necessary to allow for possible measures on industrial policy, on Northern Ireland and on Compensation to nationalised industries for Price Restraint. If such measures proved to benecessary, as seemed probable, they would be liable to be bothcontroversial and expensive in terms of Parliamentary time. Therewould also be demands for more time on the Floor of the House for northern Ireland Orders in Council. The situation would be aggravated by the fact that the Governmenfs supporters might be divided on some of the major Bills in the programme, particularly on Water Reorganisation and On Local Government Finance and miscellaneous Provisions. Moreover, the preparation of a numberof major Bills, including those dealing with Water Reorganisation,Local Government Finance and Miscellaneous Provisions, ConsumerCredit and Training and Employment, had been delayed pendingdecisions on policy; and it would be correspondingly difficult to accommodate them in the programme.previous reference :CM (72) 24thConclusions,Minute 7
In this situation he was prepared to defer his Bill on CriminalEvidence, especially since this would satisfy those who argued thatthe Government should not adopt this measure precipitately andwithout proper consideration of its implications. The defermentshould be accepted by the Governmenfs supporters provided that the government&apos;s intention to enact a Bill on this subject during the lifetime of the present Parliament remained clear. The Secretaryof State for Trade and Industry had agreed that the Bill on ConsumerCredit should be deferred, on the basis that its preparation would proceed, as drafting resources permitted, in order that it might beready for introduction in the 1973-74 Session or in the 1972-73Session if, unexpectedly, an opportunity arose for it. In its place a Bill on Insurance should be added to the programme, provided that policy issues and drafting instructions could be settled urgently andthat the Bill would be ready for introduction immediately after the christmas recess. The Bills dealing with Water Reorganisation andLocal Government Finance and Miscellaneous Provisions would belate, difficult and controversial among the Governmenfs own supporters, who had already been severely tested by the pressure oflocal loyalties aroused by the reform of local government. Whileit would ideally be desirable for both Bills to be passed during thenext Session in order that they might take effect at the same time asthe reorganisation of local government in April, 1974, they couldonly be accommodated at the expense of other measures. TheSecretary of State for the Environment, however, felt strongly thatthe Bill on Water Reorganisation should not be deferred, although he was prepared to exclude certain pollution provisions from it. TheSecretary of State was also prepared to defer the Bill on Road Traffic,which would have incorporated the Keeper Liability proposals, andto reduce the number of provisions in the Local Government finance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill; but he would then propose aseparate Bill (perhaps in the 1973-74 Session) to provide for a localgovernment ombudsman. In these circumstances it might be expedient to allow the Bill on Water Reorganisation to proceed inthe 1972-73 Session, provided that agreement could be reached onthe treatment of land drainage. But the Bills on Local government finance and Miscellaneous Provisions and Road Traffic I KeeperLiability should be deferred until 1973-74. The possibility of finding a place for a short Bill on a local government ombudsman in the1972-73 Session should be kept open; and the preparation of the Billon Road Traffic I Keeper Liability should proceed, as draftingresources permitted, on the same basis as the Bill on ConsumerCredit. The Secretary of State&apos;s proposal to include Bills onNature Conservancy and Night Assemblies was/ unrealistic, since these Bills could be accommodated only at the expense of other measures; but the Bill on Urban Motorways I Land Compensationmight be enlarged. kOn this basis the Cabinet might agree that provision should bemade in the 1972-73 Session for the additional Bills set out in the annex to CP (72) 89 and that the Bills on Criminal Evidence,Consumer Credit, Local Government Finance and miscellaneous provisions and Road Traffic I Keeper Liability should be deferred
until 1973-74. Even so, the programme would completely pre-emptthe amount of legislative time which, on average, was available on the floor of the House; and any further additions would inevitablyaggravate the burden to be borne by the Governmenfs supporters.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that there was a strong case for a Bill in the 1972-73 Session to make certain changes in the electoral Law. The Speakefs Conference to consider these andother possible changes, however, would not begin its task until theautumn; and, while the Speaker had been invited to make an interimreport, this might not be received in time for legislation to beintroduced in the 1972-73 Session. A decision, therefore, could notbe taken at this stage.In further discussion there was general agreement that a numberof Bills would have to be deferred. While the measures on CriminalEvidence, Consumer Credit and Road Traffic I Keeper Liabilitywould incorporate a number of desirable features, it was accepted that provision could not be made for them until the 1973-74 Session.The proposed Bill on Local Government Finance and miscellaneous provisions could be substantially reduced in order to incorporateonly those provisions which would be welcomed by the governments supporters. In the main, drafting instructions had already beenprepared for the provisions which would be incorporated in.thisshorter Bill. Nevertheless, there would be considerable pressure for a comprehensive Bill; and it would be wrong to defer the wholeBill, since this would involve a disproportionate reduction in theDepartment of the Environment&apos;s programme. On the other handMinisters had not yet reached decisions even on some of theprovisions which it was desired to include in the shorter Bill; andthese might well be controversial. Moreover, although a reductionin the number of provisions would lighten the burden on the draftsman, it would not necessarily save time on the Floor of theHouse of Commons or in Committee; and the proposed curtailment of the Department of the Environment&apos;s Bills was not out of balancewhen the size of their programme and the deferments accepted byother Departments in the present Session were considered.The Bill on Water Reorganisation was urgently needed in orderto safeguard the nation&apos;s water supplies and to avert industrial andeconomic damage. The proposals had received strong support inthe Press and from interests concerned with water supply and the environment. If the Bill were not introduced, the Governmentwould be strongly criticised; and, if it were not enacted in the1972-73 Session, the functions of the 1,200 existing drainage and sewerage authorities would pass to the 300 new district authoritiesin April 1974, thus necessitating a subsequent reorganisation whichwould be even more controversial and keenly contested. Providedthat a satisfactory agreement could be reached on the treatment ofland drainage, Government backbenchers would be in favour of theBill; and the waterways interests would probably accept theproposals.A Bill to constitute a new Nature Conservancy Council was required in order to give effect to the proposals in the White Paper on141569-20c*
Government Research and Development. But, although there wouldbe difficulties if the Bill were not introduced in the 1972-73 Session,the White Paper did not commit the Government to the introductionof the necessary legislation at any particular time.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed to the proposals in CP (72) 89, with the exception ofthe proposal to defer the measure on Local Government Finance and miscellaneous Provisions. He would discuss with the Home secretary and the Secretary of State for the Environment the case for including a short Bill on Local Government in the programme for the 1972-73Session. For the rest the legislative programme should be kept under close review; and, if further additions became essential or majormeasures to deal with Northern Ireland or Industrial Policy hadto be introduced, it would be necessary to consider compensatingreductions in the programme. The outstanding drafting instructions for Main Programme Bills should be completed urgently.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Agreed that provision should be made in the 1972-73 Sessionfor the Bills listed in Part A of the Annex to CP (72) 89.(3) Took note that additional measures might be required on northern Ireland, Industrial Policy, Compensation to nationalised Industries for Price Restraint and electoral registration; and agreed that, if these measures were brought forward, compensating reductions in the pro-gramme should be considered.(4) Agreed that the proposed Bills on Criminal Evidence,Consumer Credit and Road Traffic I Keeper Liabilityshould be deferred until the 1973-74 Session.(5) Took note that the Prime Minister would discuss with theHome Secretary and the Secretary of State for the environment the case for introducing a short Bill on local Government in the 1972-73 Session.(6) Invited the Ministers concerned to arrange for outstandingdrafting instructions on Main Programme Bills for the ensuing Session to be completed forthwith.Civil ServiceManpowerPreviousReference:CM (72) 16thConclusions,Minute 5CONFIDENTIAL8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal (CP (72) 87) on Civil Service manpower.The Lord Privy Seal said that the latest public expenditure forecasts showed an increase in the non-industrial Civil Service of30,000 over the next two years; and the cost of the Civil Service asa proportion of the Gross National Product was rising. There were three basic obstacles to efforts to contain this increase: theintroduction of new policies which were politically important but
required additional manpower; unwillingness to discard old and continuing functions; and the fact that the numbers requireddepended on subjective judgments by line management who had no real incentive to reduce staff. Pressure must therefore be renewedin the last two areas, by means of a comprehensive efficiencycampaign in each Department. The objective should be a reductionof 1 per cent per annum in the total forecast staff requirement overthe next three years, beginning with 1972-73. While it might be too late for some Departments to achieve a reduction of 1 per cent by april, 1973, every effort should be made to achieve the full cumulativereduction of 2 per cent by April 1974. For this purpose a minister in each Department should be designated to subject the manpowerrequirement to severe scrutiny in consultation with the parliamentary secretary, Civil Service Department.In discussion it was objected that many Departments would findserious difficulty in achieving a reduction of the order suggested,either because the introduction of new policies was already beingjeopardised by staff shortages or because the workload was largely dependent on the extent to which the service was used or because an actual reduction in staff numbers would be involved. Moreover,a reduction based on public expenditure forecasts would tend topenalise those Departments who had already sought and obtainedstaff savings through greater productivity; and, although a sustainedeffort should certainly be made to achieve higher efficiency, an arbitrary numerical objective could not be applied uniformly to all departments. On the other hand the public expenditure forecaststo which the staff reductions should be related already madeallowance for changes attributable to the forecast expansion orcontraction of work. Moreover, the proposed reduction wouldinvolve only 21,000 staff over a period when 108,000 new staff wouldbe recruited; and it was difficult to believe that it would beimpossible to realise productivity gains yielding an overall staffsaving of 1 per cent each year.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that there should be a comprehensive effort to achieve greater efficiency and productivity with the objective of reducing numbers to the extent suggested by the Lord Privy Seal.But they also recognised that, although some quantitative criterionwas required for this purpose, some Departments would have difficulty in achieving a reduction of the order proposed. A minister in each Department should therefore be given the special responsi-bility of searching for manpower savings, in consultation with theParliamentary Secretary, Civil Service Department. While themain emphasis should be placed on increasing productivity,opportunities for saving staff by eliminating unnecessary work shouldnot be overlooked.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited all Ministers in charge of Departments to arrangefor a Minister to be charged, in consultation with the
Parliamentary Secretary, Civil Service Department, with responsibility for seeking staff savings on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up oftheir discussion.CONFIDENTIALRunway Sites 9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the home for the Third Secretary (CP (72) 85) on the choice of runway sites for the third london Airport London Airport.The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial Committee on regional Policy and the Environment (RE) had considered the choice of sites for the runway at Maplin Airport and the implications forthe consequent withdrawal of the Ministry of Defence Proof and experimental Establishment from Shoeburyness.   Of the fourpossible sites published in April as a basis for consultation twohad been eliminated from further consideration.   Site B had nooutstanding advantage; and Site D, although the most remote and hence preferred on environmental grounds, was the most expensive.The effective choice, therefore, lay between Site A (the Roskill site)and Site C.   Site A was preferred by the Secretary of State for defence because it was compatible with their programme for theremoval of the Shoeburyness Establishment; and considerations ofexpenditure were also in its favour, since reclamation costs forSite C would be some  5 million higher.  But the best estimate ofthe capital costs of access which was currently available suggestedthat there was little to choose between the two sites; and the otherresource and time costs which would fall on those who used the airport were less favourable to Site A than previously estimated.Moreover, in environmental terms the choice of Site C rather thanSite A would remove 900 houses outside the 35 noise and numberindex (N.N.I.) contour; and night noise disturbance would also be less.The Secretary of State for the Environment accordingly favouredSite C on the grounds that the choice of Site A would forfeit theco-operation of Essex County Council and that their opposition,together with that of amenity interests, could lead to protracteddelay in completing the airport.   A decision in favour of Site C,however, would advance the date by which the ShoeburynessEstablishment would have to be moved; and the Secretary of Statefor Defence considered that, if Site C were chosen, it would beimpossible, on present plans, for the airport to be opened in 1980without unacceptable disruption to the defence programme.The Committee had decided, on balance to recommend Site C on environmental grounds; had agreed that the cost might be higher,but not significantly so; and had concluded that, although thedevelopment of Site C might take rather longer than the developmentof Site A, the difference need not necessarily be significant since adecision in favour of Site C would enlist the goodwill of the localauthorities and environmental interests. Once the alternative sites for the Shoeburyness Establishment had been secured its recon-struction could be accelerated, albeit at a cost. The Governmentcould not now be sure of completing the airport by 1980 at eithersite; but the choice of Site C was less likely to lead to unmanageable
delay and would not involve the Government in the difficulty ofjustifying, after they had decided to locate the new airport at Maplinon environmental grounds, the choice of the least environmentallyattractive site in that area. A decision on the site was needed inorder to enable detailed planning for reclamation to proceed and thelegislation establishing the Maplin Development Authority to beintroduced early in the next Session. On a balance of all the considerations involved Site C seemed to entail the least disadvantage,although the date for opening the airport must inevitably dependon the time within which the defence facilities could be withdrawnfrom Shoeburyness without unacceptable disruption.The Secretary of State for Defence said that the choice ofsite for the runways affected the length of time for which theProof and Experimental Establishment would be able to continue touse the facilities at Shoeburyness. On present plans the choice ofSite A would allow the Establishment to maintain its programme ofwork at Shoeburyness on a basis which was tolerable; but the choice of Site C would curtail this period by two years. The Establishmentplayed a major part in the development of armaments and theproving of ammunition; and the interruption of its work would have serious consequences both for the equipment of our own Forces andfor our exports of arms. It had proved impracticable to find asingle site capable of re-accommodating the facilities displaced fromShoeburyness; and it might now be necessary to disperse these facilities between four sites Tain in Scotland, Spadeadam inCumberland, Ty Croes in Anglesey and Eskmeals in the Lake DistrictNational Park. Resistance on environmental grounds could beexpected to the choice of Eskmeals; and there was liable to be particularly strong local opposition on both political and environ-mental grounds to the use of Tain. It did not appear practicable to transfer facilities from Shoeburyness to the Outer Hebrides,despite the increased employment which would result, because thelocal weather conditions were unsuitable for proof work and theuse of the existing rocket range would be adversely affected.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed in principle that Site C should be preferred. they recognised the problems involved in moving the defence facilitiesfrom Shoeburyness in the light of the inevitable public oppositionto any proposals to enlarge defence establishments. But therewould also be increasing pressure from the general public for anearly opening of the Third London Airport. The Secretaries of Statefor Scotland, for the Environment and for Wales should thereforegive the Secretary of State for Defence every assistance in relocatingthe Shoeburyness facilities and in avoiding disruption to essentialdefence work.The Cabinet- v(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Approved in principle the proposals in CP (72) 85, on theunderstanding that the Ministers concerned would give
the maximum assistance to the Secretary of State for defence in achieving a suitable relocation of the Proofand Experimental Establishment at Shoeburyness.Cabinet Office,9 August, 1972.
