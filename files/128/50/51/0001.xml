confidential the 1.   The Prime Minister, on behalf of all his colleagues, extendedGovernment     a warm welcome to those Ministers who were joining the cabinet for the first time.CONFIDENTIALMeasures *2.   The Cabinet considered the Parliamentary timetable of theto Restrain      Counter-Inflation (Temporary Provisions) Bill.InflationThe Lord President of the Council said that decisions were urgently needed on the Parliamentary timetable of the Counter-Inflation (Temporary Provisions) Bill, which would receive its SecondReading in the House of Commons on Wednesday, 8 November.Normally the Bill would thereafter be remitted to a StandingCommittee, which would begin work on Tuesday, 14 November.If it were judged necessary to apply a timetable Motion to the Bill,this might be better tabled in Committee than on the Floor of theHouse. On this basis, however, the Bill would not become law before about mid-December. An alternative course would be totake the Committee stage on the Floor of the House. This should ensure a quicker passage for the Bill; but it would also impose agreater burden on the Governmenfs supporters and would delayother urgent Government business.In discussion it was suggested that, if the Committee stage were taken on the Floor of the House, this would not only be liable tocreate an unwelcome precedent in relation to other Bills but wouldalso ensure greater publicity for the Opposition case againstparticular provisions of the Bill. On the other hand to send the Billupstairs would imply that during the period while it was being discussed the Government would have no powers to restrain pay and price increases which did not conform with the standstill; and,if this continued for more than a few weeks, it would become increasingly difficult to make Orders subsequently reversing such increases. This situation would be quickly exploited by the moremilitant trades union leaders. It was in any case desirable to impress on public opinion the urgency of making the counter-inflationary measures effective as rapidly as possible. This suggested that theCommittee stage should be taken on the Floor of the House andthat the subsequent stages should follow with the minimum of delay,possibly 3 days in all during the following week being allotted forthe passage of the Bill through all its stages in the House ofCommons.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the, need to secure early passage of the Counter-Inflation (Temporary Provisions) Bill was overriding; that the Billshould therefore be the subject of a timetable Motion; and that itshould be committed to a Committee of the whole House, with the* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.CONFIDENTIAL146897-10 b*previous reference:CM (72) 49thConclusionsParliamentaryTimetablefor the counter-Inflation(temporary provisions)Bill
GovernmentInformationServicesOperation ofthe StandstillPreparationsfor thesecond stageaim of securing its passage through the House of Commons duringthe following week. The passage of the Bill through the House ofLords should also be expedited as far as possible.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.The Prime Minister said that the Home Secretary would remaingenerally responsible for the Governments information services andthat an additional Parliamentary Secretary had been appointed tothe Civil Service Department to assist him in discharging this responsibility. All Ministers should co-operate in making the new arrangements fully effective in the campaign which must now bewaged to enlist the support of the public for the measures which theGovernment were taking. In particular, efficient arrangements mustbe made forthwith to deal with inquiries and complaints about price increases. The Ministers concerned should circulate a description of these arrangements to their colleagues as rapidly as possible inorder that all Ministers might be appropriately briefed. TheSecretary of State for the Environment should discuss with the LordChancellor the arrangements to be made for dealing with questions about commercial rents during the standstill.The Prime Minister said that Ministers should be firm in implementing the standstill, which must be seen to operate efficiently and impartially. The maximum pressure should be brought to bearon manufacturers and retailers not to seek to raise their prices; and close consultation should be maintained both with leading retailersand with independent organisations in this field. The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, in consultation with the Home Secretary, theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Secretary of Statefor Employment, should consider whether it would be desirable tointroduce in the Counter-Inflation (Temporary Provisions) Bill aprovision similar to Clause 3 (which dealt with the modification ofexisting contracts of employment) in order to enable contracts inrelation to prices to be modified in circumstances where one of theparties was unwilling to pay a higher price but would be legallybound to do so by an existing contract.It would also be necessary to review the structure of Ministerialand official committees concerned with questions of pay and prices.In the meantime the Minister of. Agriculture should consult theChancellor of the Exchequer about the degree of reassurance whichmight be given to those of the Governments supporters in the Houseof Commons who were concerned that paragraph 17 of the white paper &quot; A Programme for Controlling Inflation: The First Stage &quot;(Cmnd. 5125) might require the standstill to be so interpreted as to delay the implementation of the pay awards to agricultural workersby the two Wages Boards concerned.The Prime Minister said that the Government would now need to press ahead with preparations for the further legislation whichwould be required at the end of the standstill. These preparations
would take account of the recent tripartite discussions with the confederation of British Industry (CBI) and the Trades UnionCongress (TUC); and it was to be hoped that it might be possible to resume those exchanges in order to discuss the more detailed arrangements for giving effect to the new policy. The Governmentwere not committed, however, to adopting all the proposals whichhad been put forward during the tripartite discussions. the preparations for the further legislation would be the responsibilityof a task force under Sir William Armstrong, which would be concerned to analyse for the Cabinet the options open to them inorder to achieve the longer-term objectives in Cmnd. 5125. Hewould welcome any suggestions which Ministers might have in this regard, bearing in mind the overriding need to introduce policies which would be fully effective to achieve the Governmenfsobjectives.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment, theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry and theMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to circulateinformation about the arrangements made by their departments for dealing with inquiries and complaints about prices during the standstill.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment to discuss with the Lord Chancellor the arrangements for dealingwith inquiries about commercial rents during the stand-still.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Tradeand Industry and the Secretary of State for employment to consider the desirability of making provisions in the counter-Inflation (Temporary Provisions) Bill for thestatutory modification of contracts dealing with prices.(5) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss with theMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food the most appropriate presentation of the issues arising in relationto agricultural workers&apos; pay increases.SECRETForeign and 3.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theCommonwealth Chinese Government had taken great pains to ifiake his visit to PekingSecretary&apos;s ^ interesting and enjoyable; and they now seemed generally wellvisit to Peking disposed towards us. They continued to be obsessed with the intentions of the Soviet Union, and they were relatively cool and reserved in their attitude towards the United States. In their viewFrance was too close to the Soviet Union; and they hoped that theUnited Kingdom would play the dominant role within the european communities. They thought it important that the defence of europe should continue to rest on the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
and the United States strategic nuclear deterrent. So far as HongKong was concerned they had stressed that, while this remained animportant issue between us, it was one which they were prepared to resolve without undue haste and essentially by negotiation. but their proposal that a Chinese representative should be appointed in hong Kong would be liable to cause considerable difficulties locally;and it would be necessary to consider what counter proposals we might put forward.He had already circulated some general impressions of Chinato his colleagues (CP (72) 118). The primitive nature of life and theextravagant use of manpower were very striking features of theChinese economy. On the other hand the Chinese Government were faced with the need to make an unprecedentedly rapid adjustment to the demands of modern technology and to the social problems which would be created by the transition from labour-intensive tohighly mechanised industry. In this context it was impressive to observe the implicit obedience which was paid to all decisions by theParty leadership, despite the mystery in which they were shrouded.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.Cabinet Office,7 November, 1972.
