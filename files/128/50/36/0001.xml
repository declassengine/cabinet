Secretariat :The Right Hon. Sir Burke trend . J. anson mr. H. F. Ellis-ReesSubjectReorganisation of the Nuclear Industry
SMCRET3SECRETReorganisation The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofof the Nuclear State for Trade and Industry (CP (72) 69) about the reorganisationIndustry of the nuclear industry. They also had before them a Note by theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry (CP (72) 73), to whichwas annexed a report on the same subject by an interdepartmentalgroup of officials and a note summarising the main views which hadbeen expressed by industry and by other interested bodies.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that,although the current examination of energy policy had not yet beencompleted, it already indicated clearly the need to develop the useof nuclear power to the maximum extent. While the UnitedKingdom had led the world in the introduction of nuclear power inthe 1950s and our scientific and technological achievements in this field were still of a high order, our nuclear construction projects had met severe technical problems and we had been relativelyunsuccessful in export markets. Some of the difficulties must be attributed to the present structure of the industry, as a result of whichnuclear reactors were, developed by a statutory body, the atomic energy Authority (sea), but were subsequently designed andconstructed for industrial use by private enterprise in the form oftwo consortia, whose members tended to be influenced more by theirrespective commercial interests than by the need to create a strongcompetitive position for the British nuclear industry as a whole.The two consortia were inherently unwieldy in form and hesitant indecision; and they were competing against each other in a market which was too small to maintain more than one. Moreover, thefabrication of nuclear fuel had also been transferred from the AEAto a wholly owned subsidiary company, British Nuclear FuelsLimited (BNFL).There were, broadly, two Ways in which the industry might be reorganised. One, following the course adopted in France, would add a capability for design and construction to the existingtechnological capability of the sea. But French experiencesuggested that this form of organisation was unsatisfactory in several respects. The alternative, modelled on the practice in theUnited States and Germany, would build the new organisation onthe foundation of a commercial company which would inject strong and effective management into the structure. The only british company which at present appeared able to provide the necessaryresources and managerial ability for this purpose Was the GeneralElectric Company (G.C). The Ministerial Committee on economic strategy had concluded that, on balance, the advantages of acommercially-oriented organisation outweighed the risks ofentrusting a further vital industry to the control of G.C, providedthat this did riot jeopardise our technological pre-eminence in thefield of nuclear energy.v The Committee had therefore agreed, subjectto endorsement by the Cabinet, that we should seek to establish anew form of organisation in which the existing consortia would bereplaced by a single strong company which would be under effective and unified management provided by G.C as a majority shareholderand would be encouraged to forge close links with correspondingenterprises in Europe.  Under this proposal there would also be a141569-18b*
reallocation of responsibility between the industry, the sea andthe Government, whereby the new company would have theresponsibility for initiating proposals for the development of reactorsand their fuel and a Nuclear Power Board would be created toimprove co-ordination between the bodies concerned and to provideconcerted advice to the Government on those major issues whichwould need to be kept under Government control. Some link wouldbe needed between the new company and BNFL, probably in theform of a minority shareholding for the latter. Adequate safeguardswould be required to secure proper control of the public money which would still have to be provided to support nuclear research and development and to ensure that the Government was able todetermine the nuclear systems to be adopted. It would also benecessary to arrange that G.C and the other shareholders in the new company should not be given any preferential position in the placing of its contracts.In discussion considerable concern was expressed about theextent to which G.C was already gaining control in a number of essential industries involving advanced technology. The present proposal would create a commercial monopoly involving anadditional industry of this kind. This might be avoided if theindustry could continue to be organised on the basis of two consortiaor the monopoly took the form of a public enterprise drawing onthe experience of private companies with expertise in this field. Ournuclear strength was based largely on our research capability, whichwas centred in the sea; and we still had a significant technicallead, notably in the development of the fast breeder reactor. Itmight yet be possible to eliminate the faults of the present generation of advanced gas-cooled reactors; and the British-developed steamgenerating heavy water reactor might still prove preferable, for reasons of safety, to the American-developed light water reactor.If the present proposals were implemented, however, there was a risk that G.C, which had not had great experience of nuclear develop-ment, would prefer to draw on the technology of other countries andto manufacture light water reactors under licence, thus weakening theBritish industrial base. A proposal to place the industry in the handsof a single private company, while much of the research anddevelopment was still subsidised from public funds, might also beopen to the criticism that it would confer an uncovenanted benefiton the shareholders concerned, including individual Ministers, whodeclared their interest in this respect during the discussion, andothers among the Governmenfs supporters. The result might be to provoke a demand that the industry should be nationalised.On the other hand, there were only two major companies in this field even in the United States; and the British economy, by analogy,could not accommodate more than one industrial organisation ofthis kind. G.C should also be better able than a public corporation to form effective links with the corresponding European industries.The Government should be able to retain control of the choice ofreactor systems by means of their financial support for research anddevelopment. It might be desirable, however, to supplement themanagerial capacity of G.C in the new organisation by recruitingindividuals with particular experience in nuclear matters andmobilising the expertise of other companies through minorityshareholdings.
In further discussion it was suggested that the full benefit wouldnot be obtained from a commercially-oriented organisation if it wasconstrained by Government instructions on the choice of reactorsystems and by the intervention of the proposed Nuclear PowerBoard. The proposal under consideration might therefore prove tobe an unsatisfactory compromise between letting the new companyoperate in a fully commercial manner and adopting a solution basedon some form of public ownership. But it would in any case benecessary to impose some control on the large sums of public money which would continue to be needed to support research and develop-ment; and this would be provided by the Nuclear Power Board,which would also ensure co-ordination of the various interested bodies, particularly the electricity generating Boards, whoseunsatisfactory ordering policy had been one of the principal reasonsfor our relative lack of success in our domestic nuclear reactorprogramme.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy would now need toconsider the matter further in the light of the views which had been expressed by the Cabinet. The Committee should also give thought to the choice of nuclear reactor systems, the action to be taken tomeet the requirements of the electricity generating Boards in the short term and the timing and content of any necessary public statement.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office,11 July, 1972.
