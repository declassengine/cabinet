confidential parliamentary 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the affairs House of Commons in the following week.European They also considered the arrangements for the Second ReadingCommunities   of the European Communities Bill.bill previous reference:CM (72) 4thConclusions,Minute 1OverseaAffairsIrish RepublicBangladeshPreviousReference:CM (72) 4thConclusions,Minute 2CONFIDENTIAL2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theCabinet would have learned that the British Embassy in Dublin hadbeen attacked on the previous day by crowds demonstrating againstthe Governments policy towards Northern Ireland and that thebuilding had been gutted. He proposed to make a parliamentary statement that day, in which he would seek to convey a warning tothe Government of the Irish Republic that, if such acts of violencewere repeated, this could lead to a serious deterioration in therelations between the two countries. Immediate retaliatory measures,on the other hand, would serve only to exacerbate an already difficult situation; and he proposed to resist any suggestion that they shouldbe taken. Meanwhile, the Irish Foreign Minister, Dr. Hillery, hadembarked on a tour of countries where he hoped to stimulate support for the attitude of his Government; and appropriate instructions had been sent to our Ambassadors to enable them to take steps to offset any publicity hostile to our interests which might result fromDr. Hillery&apos;s tour.The Cabinet 1.   Took note, with approval, of the statement by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he proposedthat we should formally recognise Bangladesh on 4 February andthat he should make the appropriate Parliamentary statement onthat day. Although the Governments of France and Italy were nowunlikely to be ready to extend recognition quite so soon, a numberof Western countries had already taken this step or intended to doso on the same day as ourselves. Conditions in Bangladesh were still somewhat unsettled; and reports indicated that the new regime&apos;difficulties would be considerable. But he-judged that we ought to delay recognition no longer. Moreover, it would be desirable thatwe should have completed this action before he set out on his forthcoming visit to India lest the inference be drawn that we hadresponded to Indian pressure. It seemed very unlikely that PresidentBhutto of Pakistan, who had invited him to visit Islamabad on19 February, intended to break diplomatic relations with us.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that thewithdrawal of Pakistan from the Commonwealth and the possible
request of Bangladesh to join it would carry implications for thestatus in the United Kingdom of citizens of those two countries.These implications should now be examined in detail. In generalour attitude should reflect the principle that the privileges whichaccrued to a country and to its nationals through membership of theCommonwealth should not normally be retained in the event of itswithdrawal.The Cabinet 2. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.3. Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for a study of thestatus of nationals of Pakistan and Bangladesh in thelight of the points made in their discussion.CONFIDENTIALNorthern Ireland 3. The Cabinet discussed the situation in Northern Ireland;Previous the conclusions reached were separately recorded and issued only to reference: The Queen, the Prime Minister and those Ministers who had to takeCM (71) 55th   action.The conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file heldby the Secretary of the Cabinet.Conclusions,Minute 4MaltaPreviousReference:CM (72) 4thConclusions,Minute 3CONFIDENTIAL4. The Secretary of State for Defence informed the Cabinet thathe expected to resume on Monday, 7 February, his discussions withthe Prime Minister of Malta, the Italian Foreign Minister and theSecretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(NATO) on the terms on which a new defence agreement between britain and Malta might be concluded. In a minute dated 2 Februaryhe had informed the Ministers immediately concerned of a numberof points on which he sought the agreement of his colleagues both torefuse certain concessions and to offer certain others in the last resort,should he judge it to be necessary. In his opinion these concessionswould be justified in order to finalise a defence agreement whicheffectively met all our own objectives and those of our NATO allies.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that,although certain questions of allocation, between DepartmentalVotes would require further consideration and some of the possibleconcessions (particularly in respect of import duty) were unpalatable,the Cabinet agreed that the Secretary of State should have discretion to conduct negotiations on the lines which he had proposed.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
IndustrialAffairsCoalminers&apos;StrikePreviousReference:CM (72) 4thConclusions,Minute 4*6.strike.secret the Cabinet resumed their discussion of the coalminers&apos;The Secretary of State for Employment said that there had beentwo developments which discouraged the hope of a satisfactoryearly solution of the coalminers&apos; dispute. First, the General Secretaryof the National Association of Colliery Overmen and Deputies,which had been steadfast in maintaining safety standards in the mines during the strike, had informed him of the likelihood that his executive would the following day decide to refuse to continueworking, in the face of the difficulties which their members wereencountering from pickets of the National Union of Mineworkers(NUM). He had agreed to meet the Executive and would do all hecould to strengthen their resolve. Second, the Chrysler MotorCorporation had increased their pay offer to the 6,500 car workers who were on strike at the Linwood plant to 20 per cent over 18 months,the equivalent of an annual rate of increase of about 14 per cent.Meanwhile, there had been no sign that the NUM were prepared to moderate their intransigent attitude; and the National Coal Board(NCB) now considered that, unless an attempt were made during thefollowing week to end the deadlock, there would be a progressivehardening of the attitude of the miners which would make it increasing difficult to achieve a settlement. He hoped that by thefollowing Tuesday a settlement of the pay negotiations for the manual workers in the electricity supply industry would have beenreached, on the terms approved by the Ministerial Committee on pay Negotiations, which would diminish the threat of an interruptionin the supply of electricity and would tend to isolate the miners.But, even if such a settlement were not achieved in the negotiationsdue to take place on the following Monday, the need for an earlyinitiative in the coal dispute would remain. This was accentuated bythe decision of the Opposition to debate the coal strike in the Houseof Commons on the following Tuesday; and it was desirable thathe should by then already have taken the initiative rather than thathe should subsequently appear to yield to pressure by the Opposition.In discussion the following main points were made (a) It was now apparent that the activity of pickets providedlittle scope for effective action under the civil law, although action could be taken by the police under the criminal law when the circum-stances warranted it.   It was important, however, that the Central* Previously recorded as a Confidential Annex.SECRETSecurity of 5.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that in theDowning Street interests of security Treasury Passage would henceforward be closedby day as well as by night. Ministers were being notified of alternative arrangements to allow them ready access to the Cabinet Office.Consideration was also being given to the need in present circum-stances to institute stricter security in the Downing Street area.In the course of a brief discussion the Cabinet agreed on theneed for more stringent arrangements to improve the security ofGovernment premises and to insure the safety of Ministers and their staffs.
Non-industrial civil Service:Central PayIncreasePreviousReference:CM (72) 4thConclusions,Minute 4Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) should refrain from unguardedstatements about the effects of picketing, which gave encouragement to the NUM.(b) The arguments in relation to the early Proclamation of aState of Emergency, in order to permit restrictions to be imposed onthe supply of electricity, seemed finely balanced. On the one hand it was undesirable to take such action before it was essential. no power cuts had been necessary so far, in part because of milderweather and in part because of co-operation by the general public in reducing their demands for electricity. Public opinion might therefore not see the justification for emergency powers at this stage.On the other hand, if the Proclamation were delayed for anotherweek, the effect on the CEGB&apos;s coal stocks would be severe and their ability to withstand a prolonged miners&apos; strike by conserving stockswould be seriously impaired. Generating capacity would be reducedto one-third of the demand for electricity if the CEGB&apos;s coal stocks were exhausted. Moreover, the Electricity Council did not considerthat a Proclamation before the following Monday would have any significant effect on the course of their own pay negotiations. one possibility would be to make the Proclamation in the middle of thefollowing week, although it would be preferable to avoid taking suchaction while an attempt was being made to settle the miners&apos; strike.(c) It would be desirable that, during the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons, the current rates of pay of miners andthe size of the increase offered by the NCB should be clearly stated.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it was important that the Government should not seem to be weakening intheir resolution at this juncture. The Cabinet were inclined to theview that the Proclamation of a State of Emergency should not bemade until it was clearly justified; but the effect of delaying the proclamation on the CEGB&apos;s ability to continue to meet the demandfor electricity needed further clarification. The Ministerial Committeeon Emergencies should meet again later that day in order to reconsiderthis aspect of the situation and should report to him whether a proclamation was required on the following day.The Cabinet 1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Ministerial Committee on Emergencies to reconsider the need for the Proclamation of a State of Emergencyon the following day.The Lord Privy Seal said that the National Staff Side of the CivilService had that morning decided to accept the final offer made tothem in relation to the Civil Service central pay increase. Anannouncement would be made later that day.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Lord Privy Seal.Cabinet Office,3 February, 1972.
