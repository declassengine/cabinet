The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons in the following week.Housing The Cabinet agreed that, in view of the failure of the Opposition(Finance) Bill   to agree to reasonable suggestions for making progress with theHousing (Finance) Bill, a Timetable Motion should be tabled inrespect of its remaining stages.Oversea AffairsBritishHondurasPreviousReference:CM (72) 4thConclusions,Minute 2CyprusPreviousReference:CM (72) 10thConclusions,Minute 4PakistanPreviousReference:CM (72) 10thConclusions,Minute 4SECRET2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that evidencehad been received within the past weeks that the Government ofGuatemala, who claimed sovereignty over British Honduras andwere opposed therefore to our plans for granting independence tothe territory, might be considering seizing it by force. It had become necessary to reinforce the very small garrison in British Hondurasin order to ensure that in case of need additional troops could be flown in to defend it; and the garrison would have to be maintained at this higher level for so long as the Guatemalan threat continued.The Guatemalan Government, however, had reacted sharply to thesedispositions; and he had accordingly instructed the Minister ofState for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs to take the opportunityoffered by his current visit to the area to meet the GuatemalanForeign Minister and to explain to him the limited character of ourreinforcement and the reasons for it. If the Minister of State could secure a firm assurance from the Guatemalan authorities that theyhad no designs on the territory, it would be possible to reduce thegarrison to its former strength. Since the United States Governmenthad also shown some concern about the situation, the Minister ofState would also make similar representations in Washington; andhe hoped to persuade the United States authorities to reinforce the effectiveness of any Guatemalan assurances by endorsing them and urging the Guatemalan Government to observe them in full.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the situationin Cyprus was becoming increasingly tense. The Greek Governmentwere exercising great pressure on President Makarios to realign hispolicies and to reconstruct his Government; and the presence ofGeneral Grivas in the island constituted an additional focus ofdisaffection. The situation could quickly deteriorate further if general Grivas was successful in securing popular support. TheTurkish Government had so far remained calm; but they could notbe expected to be indifferent if the Greek Government intervenedmore blatantly. So far there had been no challenge from any of theparties involved to our position in the Sovereign Base Areas; and our right course would be to avoid, so far as possible, becoming involvedin the dispute.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he wasplanning to pay a short visit to Islamabad immediately before his forthcoming tour of Israel. He hoped to establish a sound workingrelationship with President Bhutto of Pakistan; and he proposed topress him to improve relations with both India and Bangladesh.Present indications suggested that Bangladesh would be accepted as
a member of the Commonwealth, although one or two of its Muslimmembers were still hesitant about expressing their agreement.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.SECRETIndustrial 3.   The Minister for Transport Industries said that the negotiations-Affairs ations between the British Railways Board (BRB) and the railwayRailwaymen&apos;s unions on 7 and 8 March had gone substantially according to plan.Pay The eventual offer made by the Board would cost 9 - 84 per cent on negotiations the wage bill. The unions&apos; reaction had not been quite as hostilePrevious as had been expected; and there had been no breakdown in the reference: negotiations. The National Union of Railwaymen (NUR) had (72) 12th withdrawn in order to prepare a case for a higher offer; and theConclusions Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF),who were demanding separate treatment for train crews, might seek to resume discussions on the following day. The Chairman of BRBnow intended to suggest to the Board that they should be prepared toincrease their offer to a maximum of 11 per cent, which they couldpresent as eminently fair and as the maximum which they could afford. If, as the Chairman considered probable, the unions rejectedsuch an offer, the Board would look to the Government to decide whether they wished to accept a breakdown in the negotiations orto pursue the possibility of a settlement at a higher level. TheBoard feared that, if there were a breakdown, the militant elements in the unions would thereafter prevail. There was also the risk thatASLEF alone would strike, leaving the Board with little option underthe guaranteed week agreement but to pay for a minimum of 8 weeks 29 million a month in wages to members of the other 2 unions whowould be unable to work because of the strike. The Chairmanwould not feel that his authority had been prejudiced if the Govern-ment decided that they were unwilling to allow the negotiations tobreak down. On the other hand it was relevant that the attitude taken by the Press so far tended to be less sympathetic to the unionsthan during the recent miners&apos; strike; and it was also significant that, whatever attitude the unions adopted publicly, they had not so far broken off negotiations.The Secretary of State for Employment said that his impressionafter the first day&apos;s exchanges, was that the Board had managed thenegotiations well. The outcome so far was as favourable as could have been expected. It was particularly important, however, thatno indication should be given to the unions that the Governmentwould be unwilling to face a strike, lest a settlement at any reason-able level should become impossible. Until he had more detailed information about the composition of the offer and the atmospherewhen the negotiations were adjourned, he could not judge the Board&apos;schances of achieving a settlement within their proposed limit of11 per cent. It might prove to be right to let the Board go to thatlimit; but they should not be encouraged to raise it.  If the nego-
tiations broke down, it would be necessary to decide whether to seek to conciliate or not. The Board were conducting separate dis-cussions with the unions about the problem of redundancy, whichwas of particular concern to the NUR. They saw no prospect offurther deferring redundancies; but he had told them that if, byconcluding a separate agreement on compensation for redundancies,they could reduce the level of the main pay settlement, the Governmentwould think that helpful. They were considering this possibility;but they had indicated that any such settlement would be costly.In discussion it was argued that, if the BRB were allowed toincrease their offer to 11 per cent and the unions still refused to settleat that level, the offer was bound to become public and would thenconstitute an unacceptably high minimum for subsequent conciliationor arbitration. Another excessive settlement at this juncture might put in jeopardy all the progress which the Government had made in reducing the level of pay increases over the last 18 months. On theother hand, a decision not to increase the offer might well precipitatethe breakdown of the negotiations, followed by industrial action ata stage when coal stocks had got to recover after the miners&apos; strike.Unless the Government were ready to accept the potential conse-quences, they would be unwise to try to stop the Board from continuing to negotiate up to the limit which the Chairman was proposing. But, whatever was decided, the risk of an early break-down would remain; and it was essential before that risk materialisedthat public opinion should be convinced of the merits ofthe Board&apos;s offer and the unreasonableness of the unions&apos; case forresorting to industrial action. It was the failure to convince thecountry at large that the miners were exaggerating their entitlementwhich had contributed to the high settlement which had eventuallyhad to be conceded in that case. It was essential, therefore, to driveit home that the offer already made to the rail unions would put their minimum rates on a level with those of workers in the gas,electricity and water industries and to bring out that over recentyears railwaymen had fared well by comparison with other industries.While it could be argued that the Government ought to commit themselves in support of the BRB&apos;s case at an early stage in thenegotiations and to demonstrate a determination to stand firm,Government intervention before the negotiations had broken downwould risk playing into the hands of militant elements who were anxious to see the Government defeated in a direct confrontation.The Railways Board should themselves be pressed to distribute asmuch information as possible to counter the claims which the unions were likely to make about the inadequacy of the offer; and if, as seemed inevitable, the unions sought an early appearance on tele-vision, the Chairman of the Board should be ready himself to appear on television in order to explain the generosity of the Board&apos;s offerwhile seeking to avoid prejudicing the course of further negotiations.The recent Government statement on the financial implications ofthe miners&apos; settlement had been well received by the Press; and itwould be desirable to arrange for it to be followed up in the context. of the rail pay negotiations, by bringing out the consequences of theclaim and the offer for fares and freight charges. It would also be helpful to secure favourable Press comment on the Board&apos;s present
offer before negotiations were resumed. This action could be supplemented, in speeches by Ministers, by general references tothe dangers of inflation and the need to ensure that the level of wage settlements was not allowed to rise again.In further discussion, it was argued that, with the lessons of theminers&apos; strike and settlement in mind, the Cabinet ought also toconsider what the Government&apos;s policy should be if the rail unionscould not be brought to settle at a reasonable figure but sought to insist that their claim should be conceded in full and initiated strike action which, as in the case of the miners, could ultimately threaten the life of the community. The Government&apos;s first response in those circumstances might be to seek to obtain a &quot;cooling-off&quot; order fromthe National Industrial Relations Court. But that would not relievethem of the responsibility of deciding how far they should be preparedto go in conciliation, whether before or after obtaining such an order,in order to avert a major and potentially crippling strike. whatever the magnitude of any such threat to the life of the community, therewas a point beyond which no responsible Government could contemplate concessions without surrendering their authority. Inthe case of the railwaymen it would not have been defensible to setthat level lower than the offer which the BRB had already been authorised to make. But it could be argued that it should not be higher than the cost of conceding rates of pay which the Governmenthad satisfied themselves and could convince public opinion constituted fair and reasonable remuneration in the circumstances;and it was certainly not as high as the increase of 16 per cent demanded by the rail unions. If it became evident that a union would notmodify an obviously unreasonable demand and intended to press itat the risk of causing general disruption, the Government mighthave to be prepared to test their credit with the country by invitingParliament to pass urgent legislation in order to reduce the indus-trial power of those who resorted to strike action. Such legislation might, for example, circumscribe picketing and curtail the entitle-ment to social security benefits which enabled strikers to transfer tothe community at large their responsibilities for supporting their families during a strike, however long it might last.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet noted that the BRB were not expected to propose a settlement with the rail unions costing more than 11 per cent on the wage bill.The Minister for Transport Industries should inform the Board that,while the Government would not wish to object to their making some improvement in their present offer of 9 - 84 per cent in orderto secure a settlement, they would be concerned if any increase raised the offer much above 10 per cent; and he should impress on them atthe same time the potential consequences at any subsequentarbitration or conciliation if negotiations broke down on the basis oftoo high an offer. He should avoid leaving the Board with any impression that the Government were currently contemplatingintervention in order to persuade them to go further than they them-selves thought right in order to prevent a breakdown in the negotia-tions. The Cabinet also agreed that, since the negotiations were still atan early stage, it would for the present be inappropriate for Ministers
to become involved by speaking in support of the Board&apos;s offer orseeking to influence public opinion against the unions&apos; claim. ButMinisterial speeches could properly emphasise in general terms the paramount importance of curbing inflation and preventing the levelof wage settlements from rising again; and against the risk of anearly breakdown in negotiations it was important that public under-standing and support of the BRB&apos;s reasonable offer should be mobil-ised over the next few days. The Lord President should take appropriate action to that end. The Minister for transport industries should impress on the Chairman of BRB that it was his responsibility to secure an effective public presentation of the Board&apos;scase and to arrange publicity for the ways in which the Board&apos;present offer took account of the particular aspects of railwaymen&apos;spay which had been publicised as causes of grievance. If unionspokesmen were to appear on television, it would be desirable for theChairman to arrange to do so himself. He should also be asked tomake clear the likely consequences both of the Board&apos;s present offer and of the unions&apos; demands in terms of increased fares and freight charges. In order to enable Ministers to take suitable opportunities of supplementing these arrangements by the Lord President and theBoard, the Minister for Transport Industries should as soon aspossible circulate to members of the Cabinet a note setting out theprincipal features of the Board&apos;s offer. The Ministerial meetingunder the Chairmanship of the Home Secretary on the following morning should consider further the implications of the presentsituation and should review the contingency planning against a railstrike. The Cabinet would resume their discussion on Tuesday,14 March. The Secretary of State for Social Services should seek to advance the circulation of his proposed memorandum aboutsupplementary benefits for strikers in order that the Cabinet might consider it at a later meeting in the following week.The Cabinet 1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Minister for transport Industries to be guided accordingly.2. Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to circulatehis proposed memorandum on supplementary benefits forstrikers in time for the Cabinet to consider it in thefollowing week.Unemployment The Secretary of State for Employment said that, although theand Trade unemployment returns which were due to be published in theFigures following week would still be distorted by the effects of the coalminers&apos; strike, they were likely to show an increase in the totalnumber of unemployed and a decrease in the number of vacancies.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said that itwould be necessary to emphasise that the number of unemployed hadbeen inflated not only by the coal miners&apos; strike but also by the factthat the strike had created a more general lack of confidence on thepart of employers which had discouraged them from re-engaging all
the labour which had been temporarily discharged during the dispute.The forthcoming trade returns seemed likely to afford a furtherdemonstration of the extent to which wage inflation had eroded our competitive position. But, while this was a point which could usefully be made in private discussion with the Confederation ofBritish Industry and the Trades Union Congress, it might merelyserve to undermine industrial confidence still further to place undueemphasis on it in public.The Cabinet 3.   Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.Post-ApolloProgrammePreviousReference:CM (70) 35thConclusions,Minute 5CONFIDENTIAL4. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Trade and Industry (CP (72) 23) and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, (CP (72) 24) about a proposal for United Kingdom partici-pation in a European programme of studies of the post-apollo programme of the United States.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that, whenthe Cabinet had previously considered proposals by the european space Conference (ESC) for joint studies of the post-Apollo pro-gramme, they had decided against United Kingdom participation onthe grounds that we could not support a programme in whichthe costs and benefits were so ill-defined. The United StatesGovernment, however, had recently invited European countries toparticipate in a new post-Apollo development programme, whichwas fundamentally different from, and more closely defined than,its predecessor in 1970. Before deciding whether to accept this invitation the ESC proposed to undertake further studies, of whichthe United Kingdom share would amount to  240,000 out of a totalof  1-2 million. Other European countries did not regard them-selves as committed to the development programme merely by taking part in the studies; and by participating ourselves we should both enjoy a better opportunity for deciding what part, if any, we wished to play and be helping our partners to formulate a Europeanresponse to the United States initiative. Hawker Siddeley Dynamicshad been promised the lead in one study if we took part; and other british firms would receive valuable design work. But, if we declined,recent efforts to organise the European space industry in inter-national consortia would be liable to be frustrated. /The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the proposed studieswere the prelude to further^ commitments to which we should beinvited to agree at the meetings of the ESC beginning in May. Itwould be more difficult to withdraw later if we participate in the studies now. There was no user requirement for the space trans-portation system; and there were no known economic benefits to be gained by joining the post-Apollo programme. The only beneficiarywould be the United Kingdom space industry at the expense of the
Government; and there was little doubt that the United StatesGovernment regarded European participation mainly as a meansof sharing the high costs of the programme which they had under-taken in order to relieve unemployment in their own aerospaceindustries.In discussion it was argued that failure to take part in the studiesmight deprive our aerospace industry of important future work.The post-Apbllo programme could have a profound effect on thetechnology of satellites; and, even if the user requirements were atpresent unknown, it was important for our industry that all the options should be kept open. Other European countries hadalready decided to initiate a programme of studies, whether weparticipated or not; and it would damage our interests to stand aside at this juncture. On the other hand decisions relating to major technological developments should be taken against the strategic background of the future plans for the industries concerned.Seen in isolation, the lack of an adequate user requirement for thepost-Apollo system suggested that we should refuse to participate,but it was not possible to reach a considered judgment in theabsence of any comprehensive policy for the aerospace industry. an interdepartmental Committee had been set up to consider the long-term basis of the industry; and it would be appropriate for thepost-Apollo programme to be discussed in the context of its conclusions.In further discussion the following additional points were made (a) An initial contribution to a programme of studies would inevitably imply a commitment to proceed to development, if the studies proved successful.(b) The post-Apollo programme could not easily be justified interms of keeping options open; no industry would be willing to invest in so expensive an option.(c) The produce of the post-Apollo programme was claimed to bea cheaper way of putting satellites into orbit. An analysis should bemade of the comparative costs of purchasing our future launchingrequirements independently of post-Apollo.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theUnited States Government had decided to spend  2,200 million over six years on the development of a space transportation systemlargely in order to avoid unemployment in the United States aero-space industry. No applications had been suggested for morethan a fraction of the very large assumed volume of space traffic onthe basis of which the system had been planned; nor were therescientific grounds for a development of that magnitude. We had had previous experience of technological projects which had exceededearly estimates of costs; and it was right to approach any new proposal with some scepticism. On the other hand it was not easy to decide in which advanced technologies we should invest; and options shouldnot be closed without proper consideration. Before we were askedto take decisions in the ESC about a European response to the UnitedStates&apos; invitation it was essential that the post-Apollo programme
should be considered in the context of our plans for the future ofthe aerospace industry. As regards the proposal to participate in European studies of the post-Apollo programme, the cabinet were divided in their views; and the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry should provide further information before they resumedtheir discussion in the following week.The Cabinet-1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry tosubmit a memorandum setting out the arguments forand against participation in the post-Apollo programme,in the context of the long term strategy for the UnitedKingdom&apos;s aerospace industry.northern ireland previous reference:CM (72) 13thConclusionsCONFIDENTIAL5.
