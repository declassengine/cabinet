The Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs said that there had been some disturbances in Antigua on31 October. As a precaution against the possibility of furtherdisorder a frigate had been stationed off Ihe island with instructionsto intervene, if necessary, in order to protect the Governor, the deputy British Government Representative, and United Kingdom&quot; belongers &quot;.The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that the Icelandic Government had agreed to hold further negotiations, at Ministerial level, with Her Majesty&apos;s Government.The date and place for these had not yet been fixed; but they mightbe held about the middle of November.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statements by the Minister of State forForeign and Commonwealth Affairs.The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that all the remaining Asian holders of United Kingdompassports (UKPH) in Uganda would have left that country by8 November, the terminal date prescribed by the Ugandan President,General Amin. Nearly all the stateless Asians, who had proved tobe fewer in number than was originally supposed, should also have left by the same date.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs should circulate a memorandum on the steps that might be taken to obtain a ruling, possibly by the International Court of Justice, that theUgandan Government had acted illegally in expelling the Asiansand in not allowing them to take their assets with them. Such a rulingmight serve to discourage any other Governments which might beParliamentary 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons in the following week.  While a numberof Government backbenchers might not support the Motioncontinuing the provisions for sanctions against Southern Rhodesia,it was expected that the Members in favour of the Motion wouldcomprise an adequate majority. In the House of Lords thecorresponding Motion was expected to be carried despite theopposition of a substantial number of Government Peers. If, how-ever, the Motion were defeated, it would be necessary to make afurther Order at once and to ensure its approval by each Housebefore 16 November.There would be important debates on economic affairs in bothHouses on 7 November; and it would be necessary for the ministers concerned to keep in close touch about the content of their speeches.
tempted to follow Uganda&apos;s example. The discovery that an AsianUKPH, now in this country, was receiving  29 a week in relief hadattracted widspread criticism. It was clear that UKPHs must betreated on the same basis as other individuals; and there might wellbe exceptional family circumstances in this particular instance whichaccounted for the large sums involved. Nevertheless, it would be helpful if the Secretary of State for Social Services would providehis colleagues with full details of the case.The Cabinet (2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.northern ireland previous reference:CM (72) 46thConclusions,Minute 4SECRET3. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland said that the initial response to the Governmenfs recent Green Paper on thefuture of Northern Ireland had been favourable. The Bill toauthorise a plebiscite on the Border was now before Parliament;and the Ulster Unionist Party had welcomed the formulation ofthe questions on which it was to be based. No decision had beentaken about the date on which it should be held; but it might proveundesirable to delay it beyond the end of January 1973. In that case the voting would have to take place on the basis of the existingElectoral Register. It the plebiscite was delayed until the newRegister was available, it could not take place before March. Itwould entail formidable security problems, which would almost certainly require a substantial increase in the level of our Forces inNorthern Ireland. It would also be liable to be characterised by a significant degree of the impersonation which was an almost tradi-tional feature of any voting in Northern Ireland; and, although wemust do what we could to prevent this, we should not be able toeradicate the practice entirely. It was for consideration whether weshould invite independent individuals to act as observers of the plebiscite. But this would probably be inadvisable, since their safetycould not be guaranteed and their presence might merely aggravatedisorder. He had ascertained that the attitude of the Opposition tothe Bill would probably be helpful; but, if they opposed it, theconsequences, for security in Northern Ireland could be serious.The Security Forces had recently achieved some major successesagainst the Irish Republican Army (IRA). A significant number ofits officers had been arrested; and over 100 of its members had beencharged in the courts in the past month. From some points of view the Protestant extremist factions now presented a more serious threatthan the IRA, particularly as regards their gross intimidation ofRoman Catholics in isolated areas. Their raids across the Borderalso constituted an increasingly serious problem, since they made it more difficult for us to bring pressure to bear on the Prime Ministerof the Irish Republic, Mr. Lynch, to, take stronger action againstthe IRA operating against Northern Ireland from the Republic.Moreover, the authorities in the Republic would be fully entitled to
fire on raiding parties, to arrest and charge any raiders whom theymight catch and to seek extradition of any identified raiders whoreturned to Northern Ireland. For all these reasons it might soon be necessary to detain some of the leading Protestant extremists andto bring them before the new tribunals.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for northern Ireland.IndustrialAffairsDiscussionsbetween theGovernment,theConfederationof BritishIndustryand theTrades UnionCongressPreviousReference:CM (72) 47thConclusionsSECRET*4. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that at the resumed discussion with the Confederation of British Industry(CBI) and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) on the previous day the representatives of the latter had reported the reaction of their general Council to the Governmenfs requirement at the end ofthe earlier meeting on 30 October that, before discussions could becarried any further, the TUC should indicate whether they wereprepared to accept that any policy to reduce inflation, whether itwas on a voluntary or a statutory basis, must provide for the regulation of increases in pay as well as increases in prices. The TUChad given no clear answer to this question. But they had indicated a number of other topics which they wished to discuss; and theyhad formulated their position in a written statement, which theyhad tabled at the outset of the meeting. This included a proposal that the Government should undertake to prevent an increase inthe Retail Price Index above a predetermined figure, a proposal which was not merely impracticable in itself but could also beregarded as substantially met by the threshold agreement which theGovernment contemplated including in any final agreement. after further discussion, however, the TUC had made it clear that theywere no longer prevented by the original insistence of their general council on a statutory control of prices from discussing other elements in a possible comprehensive agreement; and the prospectof renewed negotiations had opened up once more. The representa-tives of the CBI had shown themselves equally anxious to avoid a breakdown of the discussion. In the event the meeting had con-eluded with a statement by the Government and the CBI that theycould only accept either a completely voluntary arrangement or a voluntary arrangement reinforced by statutory powers over the whole range of prices and incomes; but that, provided that the TUC clearly understood that neither the Government nor the CBI could finallyaccept an arrangement on any other basis, At should be possible tocontinue negotiations. It had been agreed that this statement,together with the document indicating the further issues which the tuc wished to discuss, should remain confidential for the timebeing.It was on this basis that the discussions would now be resumedthat afternoon; and it must be accepted that, during that meeting,
the critical question of the maximum permissible increase in pay would be raised. There was little room for bargaining on the figureof  2 a week which the Government had already prescribed for thispurpose; and, although the representatives of the TUC might seek a further adjournment of the discussions in order to report once again to their General Council, it was equally possible that, if theGovernment adhered to this figure, they would regard the positionas having reached deadlock and would break off the discussions.In that event it would be necessary for the Government to legislateforthwith for an emergency &quot;freeze&quot; of prices and incomes for alimited period, during which longer-term legislation would have tobe prepared in order to put on a more permanent statutory basis the type of arrangement on which the Government had hoped toreach voluntary agreement with the TUC.In discussion there was general endorsement of this statementof the Governmenfs position. It was suggested, however, that, ifthe discussions broke down on the size of the maximum permissibleincrease in pay, it would be to the Governmenfs advantage inpresentational terms that the difference between their own offer andthe tuc&apos;s demand should be seen to be significantly wide. More-over, it would be important to ensure, if possible, that the TUCshould not be able to manoeuvre the Government into a position inwhich the breakdown would appear to have been provoked by someother element in the proposed arrangement on which the Govern-menfs position would be less easily defensible. If, for example,the TUC chose to find a breaking-point in the Governmenfs refusal to contemplate suspension or repeal of the Industrial Relations Act,it could not be assumed that the Government would necessarilycommand wide public support. On the other hand it would beillogical to concede to the TUC a fundamental reappraisal of theoperation of an Act which the more extreme unions were deliberate-ately making inoperable; and, since it was unlikely in any case that the current discussions would result in an agreement whichwould be acceptable as a whole to the Government, it would be unwise to sacrifice the support of the more moderate elements inthe unions by appearing to be ready to compromise on the principlesof a statute which the Government had deliberately enacted in anattempt to create a more equitable and orderly structure ofindustrial relations. It would be preferable to adhere to the position which the Government had already assumed, namely, that theywould be ready to review the working of the Act after a reasonable period had elapsed in which its practical effects could be judgedin the light of experience. /The TUC might similarly seek to engineer a breakdown of thediscussions on the excusev that the Government, by refusing to contemplate any amendement of the recent housing finance legisla-tion, were deliberately rejecting the possibility of reducinginflationary pressure by a abatement of the forthcoming increases in rents, an abatement which would be justified as much on socialas on economic grounds. The Government were at risk of beingembarrassed if the TUC did in fact succeed in convincing public
opinion that this was the main reason why the discussions had broken down; and it was perhaps for consideration whether, if the increases in rents were to stand, there should be some adjustment of the maximum permissible increase in pay in order to provide an element of compensation. Alternatively, if the maximum permissibleincrease in pay must remain at  2, some part of it might be regardedas specifically allocated to offset the increases in rents. On the otherhand, to enlarge the permissible increase in pay would be to increaseinflationary pressure still further; any reversal of the government&apos;s policy on housing finance would represent a political retreat whichwould be keenly resented by the Governments supporters in theHouse of Commons; and the proposed increase in the needsallowance which would limit the effect of the rent increase forrebated tenants of local authority houses represented the most effective means of ensuring that increases in rents which werejustifiable on economic grounds did not entail unnecessary socialhardship. As regards houses in the private sector, the majority oftenancies were controlled on the basis of a concept of &quot; fair rents &quot;,which were designed to ensure the efficient maintenance of theproperties. In these cases an artificial restriction of rents would merely entail a deterioration of the conditions in which the tenantslived; while, so far as furnished accommodation was concerned,the only result would be the wholesale eviction of tenants. Finally,it was as true of rents as it was of the Industrial Relations Act thatthe Government had very little room for tactical manoeuvre. Itwas virtually certain that the militant unions had now decided to force the issue to a breaking point; and there was little, if any,prospect that the current discussions could result in an agreement which the Government could accept on either political or economic grounds. In these circumstances it would be dangerous to offer tonegotiate separately on any individual element or elements in the type of comprehensive arrangement which the Government had inmind. This would merely open up once again the whole area ofdiscussion which the Government had brought effectively under control by their requirement to the TUC on 30 October to state their position unequivocally; and during the subsequent period inwhich the TUC would resort to leisurely bargaining and frequentreferences to their General Council and to the Executives of the major unions, further excessive wage claims would be pressed forward and the Government, lacking any statutory powers of restraint, would finally lose control of the situation.The TUC would be likely, however, to advocate, in addition,the claims of pensioners; and, since the Government had it in mindin any case to take appropriate action to ensure that pensionersshared the nation&apos;s increasing prosperity by conceding a once-for-alladditional payment in the spring of 1973, it might be tacticallyadvantageous to suggest to the TUC that afternoon that the valueof this concession would be dependent on their accepting a maximum permissible increase in pay of the order which the government themselves had in mind. If the negotiations reached deadlock onthis point and the TUC had been warned that, to the extent towhich they sought to insist that the pay increase should be larger
the benefit to pensioners would have to be less, it should be possibleto demonstrate to public opinion that it was the greed of the unionsrather than the obstinacy of the Government which had contributed to the final breakdown of the discussions. If so, however, it wouldbe necessary for the prospective lump sum supplement to be cur-rently convincing; and it was not clear why it should be impossible,despite the admitted additional administrative burden on the Depart-ment of Health and Social Security and the Post Office, to makeit effective before the spring of the following year. The Chancellorof the Exchequer, in consultation with the Ministers concerned,should consider urgently whether the payment could be expedited.In further discussion the Cabinet were informed that drafts ofthe Bill and the accompanying White Paper which would be required if the discussions broke down would be circulated for the informa-tion of Ministers during the day. Further work on these texts wouldbe co-ordinated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer; and theMinisters and officials concerned should take particular care toensure that there was no premature disclosure of the governments intentions as regards legislation. Since it was not possible to foreseedevelopments during the next few days, all Ministers should remain within easy access of London.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would be guided duringthe next stage of the negotiations with the confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress, by thegeneral sense of their discussion.The Cabinet were informed that an offer, which had beenapproved by the Government, would be made that afternoon to theunions concerned in the current pay negotiations in the electricity supply industry in an attempt to promote a very rapid settlement.In the course of a brief discussion it was agreed that any points of difficulty which arose in other pay negotiations now in train, e.g.the London allowance for teachers, should be resolved, if possible,by discussion between the Ministers concerned and the Chancellorof the Exchequer.SECRETReyrolle 5.   The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that theParsons Reyrolle Parsons Group, a major employer in the North East, wasGroup faced with a grave financial crisis which, in the absence of Govern-ment support, might force it into liquidation. The Group&apos;s affairs had for some time been under investigation by N. M. Rothschildand Sons Ltd. on the Governmenfs behalf. Their report would bedue in a few weeks; and the long-term future of the Group could then be assessed. It would probably need to be reconstructed,some parts being sold (possibly to the General Electric Company)and some being merged with other enterprises. In the meantime the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy had concluded thatPendingWage ClaimsClaim bythe ElectricitySupplyWorkers
the Group should not be allowed to go into forced liquidation. TheCommittee had agreed that Government support in an appropriateform should be provided in order to enable the company to continuetrading until its future could be reassessed and that this supportmight best take the form of an advanced payment of up to  7 million on the Ince power station contract. It would be necessaryto bear well in mind, however, the possible liability for the Group&apos;sdebts which the Government might be held to incur under Section332 of the Companies Act 1948; and the Law Officers would be kept informed of developments. The Group was due to issue its interimstatement on the following day; and it would probably suffice thatthis should merely indicate that the contract for the Ince turbogenerator had been agreed on terms which provided for an advancedpayment. But an early Government statement would be necessaryin order to restore confidence; and this should make it clear thatthe Government were intervening on grounds of regional policy but were not underwriting either the present structure of the Group orthe present level of employment.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal.It would be necessary to attach stringent conditions, e.g. as regardsdividend distribution, to the assistance which the Government wouldbe providing; and great care should be taken to secure the leastdamaging presentation of the redundancies which would still be inevitable to some extent.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for trade and Industry and invited him to proceed accordingly.Rate SupportSupport Grant1973-74PreviousReference:CM (72) 45thConclusions,Minute 4CONFIDENTIAL6. The Cabinet had before them Notes by the Secretary ofState for the Environment (CP (72) 105 and CP (72) 114), togetherwith a minute from the Secretary of State to the Prime minister dated 1 November, 1972, containing proposals for negotiation withthe local authority associations to determine the level of rate support grant for 1973-74.The Secretary of State for the Environment said that he now had to propose to local authority associations a figure for &quot; relevant expenditure&quot; in 1973-74 on which grant would be paid. In thelight of preliminary discussions with the,, associations he believedthat a realistic figure would be  4,934 million at June 1972 prices,which was some  34 million less than the figure which the associa-tions had proposed; and he sought the Cabinefs agreement tonegotiate within a margin of  10 million above this figure. Thiswould imply expenditure in 1973-74 of  67- 77 million above thepresent provision in the Public Expenditure Survey Committee(PESC) report; and a projection of the policies consistent with thesefigures would produce total expenditure in 1976-77 which would be 74 million above the PESC provision. It had been suggested that
in order to limit the rise in expenditure local authorities should berequired to make savings of  30 million on the level proposed for1973-74. But a settlement at less than the realistic cost of the policies which the Government expected local authorities to followentailed the risk that actual expenditure would exceed the forecast;and in that event authorities would have to make up any shortfallon grant by higher rates.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the figure for relevant expenditure proposed by the Secretary of State for the Environmentmust be considered in relation to its effect on PESC. Rate support grant constituted an important restraint on local authorities, whoseexpenditure was growing at a faster rate than public expenditure as a whole. Although some welcome savings had been offered inthe field of education, further economies were needed if the growth of public expenditure was to be kept within acceptable limits,especially since it might be given a further impetus by measures taken as a result of the current tripartite discussions on prices and incomes.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet recognised the importance of helping the domestic rate-payer. They would wish to consider the proposed level of rate support grant for 1973-74 in relation to an agreed figure of relevant expenditure. The Secretary of State for the Environment and theChief Secretary, Treasury, should consider further the figure to be offered for the forthcoming negotiations with local authorities,bearing in mind the need both to relieve pressure on public expendi-ture and to avoid exacerbating negotiations by appearing to imposeunrealistic economies. They should seek to circulate agreed proposals to the Cabinet in the following week.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office,2 November, 1972.
