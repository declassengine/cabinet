The Government were not committed to adoptingall the proposals put forward in the recent tripartite discussions withthe Confederation of British Industry and the Trades UnionCongress. Moreover, it would be important to avoid creating theimpression that the Government necessarily intended to adopt apermanent statutory policy.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that work on the second stage should be pressed forward urgently with the objective of introducing the related bill as early in December as possible. For this purpose the work shouldbe given the highest priority.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.The Lord President of the Council said that the two Bills togive effect to the Governmenfs counter-inflationary policies, togetherwith the further legislation which would be needed on NorthernIreland, would occupy a substantial proportion of the legislativetime available in the current Session. It would therefore be necessaryto effect compensating reductions in the legislative programme. Hewould discuss the possibilities in this respect with the ministers concerned and would make an early report to the Cabinet.The Cabinet-(2) Took note, with approval of the statement by the lord president of the Council.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the Parliamentarytimetable for the Counter-Inflation (Temporary Provisions) Bill.Under the proposed Timetable Motion the Bill would becompleted in the House of Commons on Monday 20 November. Itwas expected that it would complete its passage through the House ofLords by Thursday 30 November. It would be necessary, however,to make provision for Lords Amendments to be considered by theHouse of Commons.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theTreaty governing future relations between East and West germany had now been initialled by representatives of the Federal republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. It was not likelyto influence the result of the forthcoming elections in West Germany;but it should pave the way for the admission of both countries to theUnited Nations in the spring of 1973. The Soviet Government had made some difficulties about the concurrent Four Power declaration on Quadripartite Rights and Responsibilities in Berlin; but agreement had been reached on the disputed issues.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that althoughthe President of the United States, Mr. Nixon, had won an over-whelming personal victory in the Presidential Election earlier in theweek, the Democratic Party had retained a majority in both theHouse of Representatives and the Senate. We could not assume,therefore, that there would be any significant diminution in theCongressional pressure on the President to reduce the level of UnitedStates forces in Europe.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.*The Cabinet considered certain implications of the recentexpulsion of Asian holders of United Kingdom passports fromUganda.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that urgent consideration was being given by the Departments concerned to thepossible need to introduce legislation amending the concept of british nationality and citizenship in case other countries should be tempted to follow the example of the President of Uganda, General Amin,by expelling Asian holders of United Kingdom passports (UKPH).As regards United Kingdom &quot; belongers&quot; in Uganda GeneralAmin&apos;s intentions were still unclear. But he had spoken of expropri-ating some of their farms; and we must face the possibility that anexodus of &quot; belongers &quot; would develop. We had already succeeded in reducing their numbers unobtrusively from 7,000 to about 3,500.In discussion it was represented that legislation of the kindenvisaged would be contentious and, therefore, likely to be protracted.There was accordingly a risk that UKPHs would-be tempted to try to enter this country in considerable numbers during the passage ofthe Bill. This made it essential to avoid any premature disclosure of the Governments possible intentions. We should also explorewith the Governments of Malaysia and Singapore, where the majorityof non-African UKPH&apos;s were concentrated, the possibility of reaching inter-Governmental agreements which would give ussome assurance that the matter would be dealt with in an orderly
manner. Here, again, it would be important, albeit difficult, to ensurethat discussions of this kind remained confidential. Finally, it wouldbe useful to ascertain whether the Government of India would beprepared, possibly with some financial assistance from ourselves, toencourage UKPFTs to settle in India rather than in the UnitedKingdom.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said thatdomestic public opinion would not tolerate a repetition of the influx of UKPH&apos;s which had resulted from General Amin&apos;s action. work should therefore be pressed forward, urgently and in conditions of strict security, to define the type of legislation which would berequired in order to anticipate this risk. We must also recognisethat it would not be possible to avoid discussion of the Ugandanepisode and its possible implications at any Meeting of Common-wealth Heads of Government which might be arranged in 1973.The Cabinet Took note, with approval of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.IndustrialAffairsNationalIndustrialRelationsCourtJudgment inthe Case ofMr. JamesGoadMeasures toRestrainInflationPreviousReference:CM (72) 50thConclusions,Minute 2CONFIDENTIAL3. The Secretary of State for Employment said that on theprevious day the National Industrial Relations Court had imposed a fine of  5,000, to be paid by 21 November, on the EngineeringSection of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers (AUEW)for defiance of a Court order that the union should appear before theCourt in the case concerning the exclusion of Mr. James Goad fromthe union&apos;s affairs. The Executive Committee of the - AUEWwould now meet to consider the union&apos;s reaction. Since it was insome financial difficulty as a result of strike payments made earlier in the year and of arrears of payment of subscriptions by a substantial number of members, it might not be in a position to defy the Courtindefinitely. It was perhaps unlikely, therefore, that the case would develop in such a way as to result in industrial unrest comparable with the disturbances which had arisen from some earlier decisionsof the Court; but he would watch developments closely.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for employment.The Prime Minister said that in order to supervise the executionof the Governments counter-inflationary policy a ministerial committee on Counter-Inflationary Measures had been established.This Committee, which would supersede the Ministerial steering committee on Pay Negotiations, would examine issues relating to both pay and prices and would be supported by two Official Commit-tees, dealing with pay and prices respectively.Urgent action was now required to reassure public opinion aboutretail prices.  In particular, it would be desirable that the leading
retailers should publish a description of the measures which theywould take to restrain price increases and that lists of the mostimportant food prices should be published by the main food retailersat frequent intervals. The Home Secretary should discuss with theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food, and with the Secretary of State forthe Environment in the case of rents, the most effective form of publicity in support of the Governmenfs policies. The Secretary ofState for Trade and Industry should consult the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster about apossible statement on the treatment of steel prices during the periodof interim &quot; freeze &quot;, in the light of our obligations to the european coal and Steel Community. In a slightly longer perspective theChancellor of the Exchequer should consider, in consultation withthe Ministers concerned, the action, if any, to be taken in relation tosuch matters as Value Added Tax and rating revaluation.As far as pay negotiations were concerned, the Trades UnionCongress would probably seek to concentrate public attention on those pay claims affected by the &quot; freeze &quot; which, if conceded, wouldhave been of benefit to low-paid workers. But the Governmentcould not afford to make exceptions in such cases as the national health Service (NHS) ancillary workers, lest a precedent should beestablished which could rapidly undermine the policy as a whole.Meanwhile, the Lord Privy Seal should ensure that contingency planning against possible industrial action by the NHS ancillary workers, the coalminers and the gas and water manual workers was maintained at an advanced stage of readiness. Similarly, the HomeSecretary, together with the Secretary of State for the Environment,should consider how best to reassure Chief Constables that Policerecruitment, which was of critical importance in relation to themaintenance of law and order during industrial disputes, would notbe inhibited by the pressure to restrain increases in the rates as aresult of the review of Rate Support Grant.The Cabinet-(2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(3) Invited the Home Secretary to discuss with the Secretary ofState for the Environment, the Secretary of State for Tradeand Industry and the Minister of Agriculture, fisheries and Food the arrangements for publicity about the restraint of retail prices.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to considerthe desirability of indicating the Governmenfs intentionsabout steel prices.(5) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, together with theMinisters most closely concerned, to consider what further action might need to be taken to restrain prices in the longer term.
(6) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to keep the contingency plansagainst industrial unrest under close review.(7) Invited the Home Secretary to discuss with the Secretary ofState for the Environment the effect on Police recruit-ment of restraint on increases in the rates.Rate support grant 1973-74PreviousReference:CM (72) 48thConclusions,Minute 6CONFIDENTIAL4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the level of relevant expenditure and the rate of grant to be negotiated with local autho-rities in England and Wales for 1973-74. They had before them amemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Environment (CP (72)119).The Secretary of State for the Environment said that following the discussion in Cabinet on 2 November there had been further discussions with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and the Departmentof Education and Science. He had agreed with the Chief secretary that in the coming stages of the negotiations about rate support grant the Government should invite the local authorities to co-operate inpolicies designed to restrain the growth of the rates, should declaretheir willingness to help them to this end by adopting a more generousattitude on rate support grant than in the last settlement and should at the same time impress upon them the need to moderate thegrowth in expenditure in 1973-74. They should also draw attentionto the problems presented by the rising trend in expenditure oversubsequent years. For 1973-74 the local authority associations had proposed a figure of relevant expenditure of  4,960 million. the spending Departments thought that a realistic figure would be 4,934 million; but the latter figure was itself some  60- 70 million higher than was implied by the provision in the report of the public expenditure Survey Committee (PESC). His first object was to persuade the (local authority associations to accept the Depart-mental forecast; and he would also seek to negotiate a further reduction of  25 million on this figure. The Chief Secretary had accepted that it might prove impracticable to secure a figure lower than  4,934 million, but in that event he would consider it the more essential to devise means of preventing this substantial excess overthe PESC provision from persisting into subsequent years.As regards the rate of grant, he considered that he should be in aposition to offer 60 per cent in the negotiations. The Chief Secretaryaccepted that the outcome must be in the range of 59-60 per cent butconsidered that a 59^vper cent grant, an increase of \\ per cent on theprevious settlement, would enable local authorities to keep theincrease in rates in 1973-74 close to 5 per cent. It had accordingly been agreed that in negotiations with the local authority associationsthe Government should seek to determine the level of grant at 59^per cent but would offer 60 per cent if that proved necessary. he invited the Cabinet to approve these arrangements.
In discussion it was argued that the pressure on public expendi-ture made it imperative to avoid determining a rate of grant higherthan was judged necessary to contain increases, particularly for domestic ratepayers, within acceptable limits. To concede morethan this would encourage local authorities to incur unnecessaryexpenditure; and, since a half percentage point in the rate of grantrepresented an additional cost of about  27 million to the exchequer the savings which might be achieved were not negliglible. On theother hand a rate of grant of 59^ per cent would make it barelypossible to restrict average rate increases to 5 per cent; and it was desirable that the Ministers concerned in the negotiations with thelocal authorities should have some scope for flexibility. Arrange-ments on the lines proposed for England and Wales would be acceptable for the subsequent negotiations with local authorities inScotland.It was further noted that a particular problem in controllingrate increases arose in the case of the Greater London Council (GLC),since the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA), whose present policies were opposed to those of the Government, was able toissue demands on the GLC for all its requirements unchallengedand the GLC was then obliged to transfer the liability to the rate-payers. It was very desirable that means should be found ofterminating a situation in which the ILEA bore no direct reponsibilityfor the financial implications of its policies and in which the GLClacked effective control over a major part of its budget; and there might be scope for including provisions to this effect in the Bill on local government finances which was now in preparation.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposals of the Secretary of State for the environment and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in relation to thefigure for relevant expenditure. Their concern as regards the rateof grant was to limit the burden of the rates, particularly on the domestic ratepayer, and to give no encouragement to increased expenditure by local authorities. The Secretary of State for the environment should consult the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Chief Secretary, Treasury, about the progress of his negotiationswith the local authority associations; and he should seek to secure a settlement, at a rate of grant not exceeding 60 per cent, whichwould so far as possible keep the average increase in rates below5 per cent. Consideration should also be given to ways of ensuring that the ILEA should not have an uncontrolled right to determine the amount of educational expenditure which /the GLC was toprecept on the inner London boroughs.The Cabinet (1) Approved CP (72)119.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theSecretary of State for Wales and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, to negotiate with the local authority associa-tions 
(i) a figure of relevant expenditure for rate support grant for 1973-74 not exceeding  4,934 million at June,1972, prices;(ii) a rate of grant not exceeding 60 per cent.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment, inconsultation with the Lord President and the Secretaryof State for Education and Science, to examine, on thelines suggested in their discussion, the scope for including in the forthcoming legislation on local government finance provisions to curtail the right of the Inner LondonEducation Authority in effect to determine unilaterallythe Greater London Councils precept in respect ofexpenditure on education.Cabinet Office,9 November, 1972.
