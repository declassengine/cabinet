The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that anTurkey organisation calling itself the Turkish Liberation Army had kid-napped two British subjects and one Canadian national, who were working with the Turkish Air Force under arrangements made throughthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. The Turkish Governmentwere energetically trying to secure the release of these three men.On former occasions of the same kind they had shown themselvesresolute in their refusal to yield to blackmail; and they had been successful in securing the release of four members of the UnitedStates Air Force who had been kidnapped. On the other hand theyhad failed to rescue the Israeli Consul-General in Istanbul, who hadeventually been murdered by his captors. In the present case noransom had yet been demanded; but it could be assumed that theorganisation would seek to bargain the lives of the hostages againstthe release of three of their own members who had been arrested bythe Turkish Government and condemned to be executed. The PrimeMinister had sent a message to the Turkish Prime Minister, Dr. Erim,urging that all possible steps should be taken to secure the early release of the captured men; and, in view of the known policy ofthe Turkish Government towards blackmail, this message had been so worded as to entail the least risk of causing misunderstanding.British The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary reported that he hadHonduras       sent a message to the Foreign Minister of Guatemala, Dr. Herrera,Previous        which was intended to allay his suspicions about the reasons for reference:      the reinforcement of our garrison in British Honduras and to paveCM (72) 14th   the way for the resumption of negotiations about the future of theConclusions,    territory.  Dr. Herrera&apos;s reaction, however, had been to return anMinute 2       uncompromising message, reasserting the Guatemalan claim toBritish Honduras.   It appeared virtually certain that the GuatemalanGovernment would attempt to take over the territory as soon as itwas declared independent; and, since the Prime Minister, Mr. Price,was committed to working for independence, the internal pressures on him were likely to increase so long as independence was delayed.   our best course in these circumstances would be to consult the UnitedStates Government about the possibility of persuading the Organ-isation of American States to urge the Government of Guatemala to respect the rights of the people of British Honduras to self-deter-mination and subsequent independence.  But, on any realisticassessment of future prospects, a British garrison might well berequired in the territory for a considerable time.The Cabinet Took: note -of the statements iby tiae Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.secret parliamentary 1.

The Home Secretary said that a further meeting between theBritish Railways Board (BRB) and the rail unions was taking placethat day. The Ministerial Steering Committee on Pay negotiations had discussed the Board&apos;s proposed tactics, in the light of reports by the Minister for Transport Industries of his discussions with theChairman, Mr. Marsh. Apart from a possible offer of some minor improvements which could be contained within the limit of anincrease of 11 per cent on the wage bill on which the BRB wereresolved, the Board had no intention of further raising their offer;and the Committee had agreed that they should not be encouraged to do so. But there might be only a slight chance of a settlement at11 per cent; and the Committee had been concerned that the Boardappeared to have given little thought to possible means of avertinga final breakdown in the negotiations which would oblige theGovernment to intervene. In the Committee&apos;s view the worstoutcome of all, in both political and economic terms, would be aconfrontation which could only be resolved by direct Governmentmediation or the appointment of a court of inquiry and another highsettlement. They had therefore asked the Minister to make clear to the Chairman the importance of avoiding an irretrievable break-down at the end of negotiations; and it was now Mr. Marsh&apos;intention, if the unions threatened to break off negotiations that day,to impress upon them the serious consequences for the railways of afinal breakdown and to invite them to adjourn in order to reconsider the Board&apos;s offer carefully and thereafter to meet him again before considering industrial action. If necessary, he would also under-take to represent their further arguments to his Board, althoughwithout offering hope of any further improvement in the offer. If,when the unions met the Chairman again, they were still unper-persuaded to settle, the Committee felt that he should them urge then toagree to arbitration under the industry&apos;s own standing procedures.In discussion some criticism was expressed of the Board&apos;s tactics.It appeared that the Chairman would intervene personally in thenegotiations only after the Board&apos;s final offer had been put to, and rejected by, the unions and the Board had therefore lost all room for manoeuvre. It was unlikely that the unions would believe thatMr. Marsh was intervening only in order to confirm his negotiators&apos;assertion that the Board&apos;s last offer was indeed final; and they wouldsuppose that by applying further pressure to the Chairman in personthey might extract a further improvement of the Board&apos;s offer.3. The Cabinet considered the situation in Northern Ireland.Their discussion and the conclusions reached were separately recorded and issued only to The Queen, the Prime Minister and those ministers who had to take action.The conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file heldby the Secretary of the Cabinet.
Moreover, since the Board had taken no steps to ensure that the rank and file railwaymen were informed about the extent to whichthe Board&apos;s final offer would benefit them, there was a considerablerisk that the more militant members of the unions&apos; Executives would secure the rejection of the offer unchallenged. When justifying their final offer to the unions, it would be important that the Board should rest upon its generous size rather than on their inability to afford anylarger increase, lest the unions should be led to think that they could secure a higher offer by transferring their pressure from the board to the Government. Although arbitration could not be resisted if theunions were to ask for it, it would not necessarily be right for theChairman to propose it himself. Indeed, if a reference to arbitrationhad been in mind, it would have been preferable for the Board not tohave offered an increase as large as 11 per cent during the negotiations.On the other hand the Cabinet could not reasonably seek to dictate detailed negotiating tactics to the Board, who had in factplayed their hand skilfully and, by averting the threat of industrial action for several weeks, had gained valuable time in which the economy had been able to recover to some extent its capacity to withstand the effects of industrial action. The Chairman&apos;s part in pay negotiations varied by tradition from industry to industry: andwhereas it was normal in the coal industry for the Chairman toparticipate personally, the opposite was true in the case of the rail-ways and the electricity supply industry. It was the Board&apos;s own view that their offer was generous as well as being the most whichthey could afford to pay; and they would make this clear to theunions. If negotiations finally broke down, they would then launch a substantial publicity campaign about the facts of the case and the size of their offer. It was less for their negotiating tactics that theBoard should be criticised than for their apparent readiness to regard a breakdown in the negotiations as terminating their own part in thematter and transferring to the Government the responsibility of finding a solution of the deadlock. If, however, when negotiationsbroke down, it was hoped to deny the unions the support of publicopinion and so to avert the threat of industrial action, it would be important to be able to maintain that they had been urged to acceptarbitration. In any event the use of some arbitral process would be inevitable after a final breakdown; and resort to the Railways&apos;Arbitration Tribunal could be expected to have less damaging resultsthan direct Government mediation or the appointment of a courtof inquiry.In discussion of the prospect of industrial action it was suggestedthat the Government should not lightly conteniplate a confrontationwhich they might find it impossible to carry through to a successful outcome. An official rail strike could cause as much economicdamage as the recent vminers&apos; strike; and its repercussions mightaccumulate even more rapidly. If, as was perhaps more likely atthe outset, the unions chose to adopt a work-to-rule rather than to declare an official strike, the impact would be more delayed and itshould be possible to withstand the economic effects for considerablylonger without serious harm. Even a work-to-rule, however, couldquickly antagonise the travelling public and so help to bring pressure
on the railwaymen. It might be impracticable to invoke the &quot;cooling-off&quot; provisions of the Industrial Relations Act against action short of a strike, since railwaymen would not be breaching their contracts of employment by working to rule. Moreover, even if a &quot;cooling-off&quot; order were to be obtained, the Government could not remaininactive once direct negotiations between the Board and the unions had broken down but would be obliged to take steps to conciliate,either directly or by appointing a court of inquiry. This emphasised the desirability of averting a final breakdown in the negotiations.But a rejection by the unions of the Board&apos;s offer, whether industrial action were then threatened or not, would leave open the possibilityof using the ballot order provisions of the Act; and the Departmentof Employment had the necessary contingency planning in hand.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, if therail unions rejected the BRB&apos;s pay offer and a breakdown of negotiations followed or was threatened, the next steps would be of critical importance. The Cabinet might therefore need to meet again on the following day. Meanwhile, the Home Secretary should arrange for the Cabinet to be supplied with the latest assessment ofthe effects of the various levels of industrial action which might betaken in support of the railwaymen&apos;s pay claim, together with the counter-measures open to the Government. Resistance to industrial action, however, could succeed only if it had the support of thegeneral public. A concerted effort by the Government and the board to mobilise public opinion would therefore be essential when thenegotiations concluded; and the Secretary of State for the Environ-ment should ensure that full preparations were made accordingly.More generally, the Governmenfs standing would be criticallydependent on their success in effecting a sufficient change in thepresent balance of industrial power to ensure that irresponsible pay claims could no longer be pursued with impunity and at grave risk tothe national economy by means which threatened the essentials of life of the community or by resort to intimidation and subversion.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Home Secretary andthe Secretary of State for the Environment to be guided accordingly..v cabinet Office,28 March, 1972.
