secret the 1.   The Prime Minister, referring to the resignation of theGovernment Home Secretary on 18 July, said that this was the first time formany years that his colleagues, whether in Government or in opposition, had met without having the benefit of Mr. Maudling&apos;swisdom and experience. The Cabinet would wish him to sendMr. Maudling, on their behalf, a message of sympathy and good wishes.The Cabinet Warmly endorsed the Prime Ministers proposal.ParliamentaryAffairsFramework forGovernmentResearch andDevelopmentPreviousReference:CM (72) 26thConclusions,Minute 7SECRET2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet were informed that the White Paper &quot; framework for Government Research and Development&quot;, which had been published the previous day, had been given a reasonably favourable reception by the Research Councils, although the reactions of thePress had been mixed. The Chairman of the Select Committee on science and Technology had, however, adopted a severely criticalattitude; and the Lord Privy Seal would probably receive an invita-tion from the Committee to give evidence on the White Paper in thefollowing week. On balance, it would probably be unwise for suchan invitation to be declined, but a point of principle appeared to be involved, namely, whether a Select Committee ought to examine aGovernment Minister on a White Paper before the House ofCommons itself had considered it.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President of the Council to consider thepoint of principle which had been raised; and to discuss withthe Chairman of the Select Committee on Science and technology how the matter might best be handled.secret oversea 3.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the affairs Cabinet would have read reports to the effect that President Sadat ofEgypt Egypt had requested the Soviet Government to withdraw the soviet military advisers from that country. Neither the exact extent ofthis withdrawal nor the reasons for it had yet become clear. But itwas known that Egyptian efforts to persuade the Soviet Governmentto supply weapons which would give them an offensive capabilityagainst Israel had not succeeded and that President Sadat had forsome time been under pressure from his Army Commanders to.remove their Soviet advisers. Moreover he probably judged thatthe Soviet Government were content to allow the existing stalematein the Arab-Israel dispute to continue indefinitely, an attitude which,
for internal political reasons, the Egyptian Government could not afford to accept. He had also come under increasing pressure fromother Arab States, particularly Libya and Saudi Arabia, to reduce the degree of his reliance upon Soviet support. His speech to the Arab.Socialist Union on 18 July seemed to imply that the egyptian authorities would take over bases established by the Soviet militaryteams for their own purposes, unconnected with the Arab-Israeldispute; and, if this proved to be so, it would constitute a very seriousrebuff indeed for the Soviet Government. It seemed likely, however,that the Soviet personnel who were operating aircraft and the SAM 3missile sites would remain in Egypt.President Sadafs move, which the Soviet Government had triedunsuccessfully to prevent, had been greeted with popular acclaim inEgypt. But, unless he could obtain from other sources the offensiveweapons which Soviet policy had denied him, his position would inevitably become weaker; and this might lead the public to turnagainst him. There was little which we ourselves could do to influence the situation. There could be no question of our supplyingoffensive weapons, although we had already sold Egypt certain military supplies and this trade could possibly be increased. It hadbeen the policy of the French Government since the Arab-Israel war of 1967 to refuse to supply arms to the disputants; and, although itwas possible that President Sadat would be able to secure from france the arms which he needed, it was unlikely that he would beable to do so.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.Olympic The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there hadGames been an unfortunate Press disclosure in the Federal German Republicon the subject of Rhodesian participation in the Olympic Gameswhich were to be held in Munich. The Federal Government hadprivately asked us whether, if they allowed a Rhodesian team to take part in the Games, this would constitute a breach of the sanctions against Rhodesia; We had replied in confidence that in our view it would. News of this exchange had now been made public in sucha way as to suggest that we had taken the initiative in an attemptto frustrate Rhodesian participation. We were taking steps to correct this misrepresentation; and, meanwhile, the InternationalOlympic Committee had announced that decisions on participationlay solely with them.The Prime Minister,, summing up a brief discussion, said that,in so far as we claimed that we retained jurisdiction over Rhodesia,we should be careful not to allow ourselves to be manoeuvred intoa position in which we might appear to be denying British status toRhodesian athletes. But the Cabinet agreed that the matter wasnot one with which Governments needed to concern themselves; ifthe Rhodesians wished to send a team to the Olympic Games, it
would be for the organisers of the Games to decide upon itsacceptability and to stipulate conditions for its participation.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.EuropeanEconomicCommunityThe SummitEFTA Non-CandidatesPreviousReference:CM (72) 34thConclusions,Minute 4InternationalMonetaryReformSECRET4. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that ameeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers had been held on theprevious day to review the preparations for the European Summit.The French Foreign Minister, M. Schumann, had again emphasised that a reasonable consensus was necessary about a relatively fewitems on which specific decisions could be taken if the Summit wereto be successful and had emphasised the French Governmentsconcern with monetary union: without such a consensus France didnot believe it would be profitable to hold a Summit. The general attitude of Foreign Ministers was however that such a consensuscould be reached and planning continued on the basis that the summit would take place on its original date. The ad hoc group of the Permanent Representatives of the Six and the Ambassadors ofthe Acceding countries would be meeting again at the beginning ofSeptember to continue preparations, and there would be meetingsof the Finance Ministers in Luxembourg and the Foreign ministers in Rome on 11 September. The suggestion had been made that bothmeetings should be held in Rome and might be followed by a com-bined meeting of Foreign and Finance Ministers on 12 Septemberwhich could review preparations for the Summit as a whole.The negotiations over the European Free Trade Area Non-Candidates had now almost been concluded. Agreement had beenreached with Portugal over tomato puree and with the european economic Community (e.c.) on the terms of an agreement withIceland which preserved our position in the fisheries dispute. Afurther meeting with representatives of the Finnish, Swedish and austrian Governments was to be held later that day in London on paper and it was hoped that as a result final agreement would bereached on this also. Signature would then take place on saturday although the fall of the Finnish Government, which wasnot connected with the negotiations over paper, might mean thatFinland would for the time being initial but not sign the Agreement.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the meeting ofEuropean Finance Ministers in London had been successful. Thiswas the first time that a group of countries had agreed on their objectives over international monetary reform and was also the first time that the Finance Ministers of the enlarged e.c. had met outsidethe territory of the Six. A number of foreign representatives had made to him the point that the balance of influence was changing ina desirable way. The Finance Ministers were also generally welldisposed to the idea of a joint meeting in September between finance and Foreign Ministers.
The Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.northern ireland previous reference:CM (72) 36thConclusions,Minute 3SECRET5. The Cabinet reviewed the situation in Northern Ireland.Their discussion and the conclusions reached were separatelyrecorded and issued only to The Queen, the Prime Minister and those ministers who had to take action.The conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file heldby the Secretary of the Cabinet.IndustrialAffairsUnemploymentStatisticsPreviousReference:CM (72) 36thConclusions,Minute 4CONFIDENTIAL6. The Secretary of State for Employment informed the cabinet of the monthly unemployment returns to be published that day.Between the June and July counts total unemployment in GreatBritain and Northern Ireland had increased from 834,000 to 868,000;excluding school leavers and adult students the number had fallen by 1,000. The number of unfilled vacancies had decreased slightly.Although the trend varied between regions, it appeared that thefalling trend of totally unemployed had now slowed down.In discussion renewed concern was expressed about the formof public presentation of the monthly unemployment figures. Eventhough adult students were now excluded from the totals therewere other categories registered as unemployed who were not infact seeking full-time employment on a permanent basis, for examplemen who were over 60 and retired, and whom it was therefore mis-leading to show as unemployed. It might also be possible at thesame time to show separately those who had been wholly umemployed for less than four weeks. On the other hand, it was not possible to change the total number on the Register without also making changesin the National Insurance Register. The importance of improvedpresentation was, however, increased by the risk that the number of students registering as unemployed might rise substantially once it became generally realised that students were able to register on atemporary basis.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thepresent emphasis on the total numbers wholly unemployed created a misleading impression and every effort must be made to improve the public presentation of vthe monthly count. It would be desirablethat the basic figure published should show those who were genuinelyseeking permanent employment, that attention should be concen-trated on this to the maximum lextent possible and that other categories should be shown separately. The Lord President and theSecretary of State for Employment should consider ways in which this might be done, starting with the August count.
The Secretary of State for Employment said that the ministerial steering Committee on Pay Negotiations would, later that day, be considering the dispute over the pay of National Health Service(NHS) electricians, who had refused earlier that week to co-operate in a court of inquiry unless the Government was first prepared tomeet their current pay claim in full. The electricians had given noticeof strike action to start from 26 July. There were, however, indica-tions that the union concerned, the Electrical and Electronic TradeUnion (EETU) would accept a court of inquiry if the present link with rates in the electrical contracting industry generally were main-tained for one further year. This merited serious considerationsince the EETU were led by one of the more moderate union leaders,whose support in the tripartite discussions with the Confederation ofBritish Industry and the Trades Union Congress on the control of wage inflation would be valuable. On the other hand, maintaining the link would involve an increase of  2-60 a week, which wouldhave serious repercussions for the negotiations for other public sectoremployees, the industrial Civil Service being most immediatelyaffected. In the event of a strike it should be possible to keepelectrical services at hospitals running at a tolerable level for 6 to weeks, unless other NHS workers or the supervisory staff tooksympathetic action.The Lord Privy Seal said that the unions representing theindustrial Civil Service would be meeting later that day to considerthe Governmenfs offer of arbitration, which they would probablyformally reject. He would know the outcome the following weekand it was not impossible that, despite their rejection, they might be willing in the last resort to consider some form of arbitration orinquiry. In the meantime it was unlikely that there would be morethan sporadic and local industrial action.The Secretary of State for Employment said that in answeringan arranged Question in the House of Commons on the WindeyerReport on lead poisoning amongst workers employed by Rio TintoZinc at Avonmouth, which would be published on 26 July, he would bring out the fact that no case of such poisoning had been discoveredwhich would constitute a lasting danger to health. Any legislation which became necessary as a consequence of the report could nodoubt be subsumed in the legislation needed to give effect to therecommendations of the Committee on Safety and Health at work under Lord Robens.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Secretary of State for employment and the Lord Privy Seal.
The DocksDisputePreviousReference:CM (72) 34thConclusions,Minute 6CONFIDENTIAL7. The Cabinet had before them a note (CP (72) 81) by theSecretary of State for Employment covering a memorandum on the docks dispute which he and the Minister for Transport industries had circulated to the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Ministerial Com-mittee on Economic Policy (EPC) had that morning discussed therecommendations likely to be made in the interim report of theCommittee under the chairmanship of Lord Aldington and Mr. JackJones which was considering the problems of container work, thetemporarily unattached register (TUR) and other related matters.The Joint Chairmen had indicated that they would be recommendingmeasures to eliminate the TUR by improved severance pay, coupled with some temporary work sharing which they believed necessaryto avert a national dock strike. On work sharing the Aldington/Jones Committee envisaged that the reallocated dockers would bepaid full wages subject to some form of wage sharing: this might cost from  2-6 million to  5 million for six months. Any conse-quential increase in the levy payable by employers to the national dock Labour Board (NDLB) would in the Committee&apos;s view be too much for the industry to bear, and they sought Government help.On severance pay, the Committee proposed that for a limited period,say until the end of the year, the maximum entitlement of dockerswho were not fully fit or who were over 55 should be increased from 2,300 to  3,800, and that the minimum severance entitlement forall dockers should be raised to  1,500. They thought that some,500 dockers might take advantage of these terms, at a total cost ofabout  4^ million. The Ministerial Committee on Economic Policyaccepted that some temporary work sharing was a necessary (thoughregrettable) step, but agreed that the Government could not give itovert financial support. The Governments aim should be to find a lasting solution by running down the industry&apos;s labour force; andthe Governments financial contribution should be directed to aonce-for-all attempt to increase the number of unfit and older menleaving the industry. They should not finance increases in theminimum severance pay for fit dockers. EPC agreed with theSecretary of State for Employments proposal that, in order to givethe severance offer the greatest impact and avoid increasing the levy,he should be given discretion to offer that the Government would,for a period of six months, finance the total cost of severance pay tounfit dockers and those over 55, and that the maximum payment formen in each category should be  4,000. This offer would be con-ditional on no official, or widespread unofficial, strike action takingplace. There were no specific powers under which the Governmentcould make a grant for this purpose to the NDLB; but as the proposal was for an emergency scheme for a limited period, it would bepossible to proceed by way of a vote Estimate. A continuing scheme would need legislation. The cost and extent of this assistance would depend partly on the number of men who took advantage of thescheme, and partly on the amount needed to avoid increasing the levy; it might be as much as  10 million. The Joint Committee were
due to publish their report on the afternoon of 24 July, and on thefollowing day the Secretary of State for Employment proposed to announce to Parliament details of the Governmenfs financial contribution.The Secretary of State for Employment said that the london docks that morning were nearly at a standstill through unofficialaction both by lorry drivers against the docks and by the dockersagainst container depots. If this were to continue much longer, thefuture of some firms would be at risk. Against this background, he considered that there was added merit in the proposal to do away with the TUR: the removal of a pool of surplus labour would lessen the demand to extend the area of docks work and remove pressure from the dockers&apos; side in the container dispute.In discussion it was agreed that the financial contributionproposed would be a valuable step towards ending the dock labour scheme and bringing about the prospect of permanent employment for dock workers. It was moreover the only prospect of avertinga national dock strike; and if after all a strike were called, thegenerosity of this offer should create a climate of opinion favourable to the Government. The increases to the Joint Committee&apos;s recom-mended maximum payments that were now proposed would offset the requests for financial assistance in work sharing and severance forfit v/orkers, which the Government were not prepared to concede.On the other hand, it was important that the Governmenfs helpshould not be presented in a way which might seem a precedent forother industries, particularly the mining industry and the railways,which were also running down their work force. It must be repre-sented that the dockers were a special case, because they were outsidethe national redundancy scheme, and because the rate of rundownhad been exceptionally severe; and care should be taken whenemphasising the generosity of this offer in order to encourage a goodresponse from dockers affected to avoid stimulating demands fromother industries for comparable treatment.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposal that the Secretary of State for employment should have discretion to offer a financial contribution from the Government covering the total cost of severance pay tounfit dockers and to those aged over 55, on condition that thenational dock strike was called off. He should consult the lord president and other Ministers concerned about the statement hewould be making to Parliament and should do everything possibleto see that the Governmenfs offer was presented in a way whichwould minimise the risk of its being used as a precedent for otherindustries.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the summing up of their discus-sion by the Prime Minister.
(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Employment, in consulta-tion with the Lord President of the Council, to announceto Parliament the terms of the Governments financial contribution to the National Dock Labour Board.reorganisation of the national health ServicePreviousReference:CM (71) 24thConclusions,Minute 5SECRET8. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Social Services (CP (72) 79) about Reorganisation of theNational Health Service in England and by the Secretary of State for wales (CP (72) 80) about Reorganisation of the National health service in Wales.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that in the lightof comments on the Consultative Document on National health service (NHS) Reorganisation in England which he had issued inMay 1971 he was now ready to publish a White Paper announcing the Governments decisions. The administrative pattern described in the Consultative Document would, in general, be reaffirmed.Long negotiations, which were continuing, had been held with the teaching Hospitals Association in order to allay the anxiety they felt about the loss of the teaching hospitals&apos; independence and he hadin mind a number of safeguards which he proposed to suggest in hisfurther negotiations.He proposed that the number of local authority members on each area Health Authority (AHA) should be four. The primary purpose was to include on the AHA some members active in and knowledge-able about the management of closely related local government services. Four members would be sufficient to allow for the inclusionof members with knowledge of the personal social services, education and other relevant services and of the local authority&apos;s general policies. These members would not be on the AHA to represent theviews of the public; that would be the function of the representativesof the district councils and voluntary organisations who would sit on the community health councils. The local government interest might argue that four members was not enough. Any increase would, however, overweigh the local authority&apos;s influence on theAHA&apos;s financial and other decisions; would destroy a proper balance in the composition of the AHA, unless the total number of members were increased to an undesirable extent; and would be strongly resisted by many individuals working in and associated with the nhs who were hostile to local authority party politics exercising too great an influence over the operation and development of the NHS.He proposed to make a number of textual amendments to the draft white Paper in order to demonstrate that the Government had hadthe interests of patients very fully in mind in reaching decisions onthe new administrative structure; and this would be a point whichwould be stressed in presenting the proposals. He sought agreement to the publication of the White Paper on Tuseday, 1 August,subject to final confirmation of this date with the Lord President ofthe Council nearer the time.
The Secretary of State for Wales said that his draft White Paperreaffirmed the proposals of the Consultative Document on NHSReorganisation in Wales issued in June 1971 and were complementary to that in respect of England. The administrative pattern would beessentially the same, after allowing for the smaller scale which made it unnecessary to interpose a Regional Health Authority betweenthe eight AHAs and the Welsh Office; but there would be an agency,the Welsh Health Technical Services Organisation, which would beresponsible for certain specialist functions although not for generaloversight. The proposal in the Consultative Document to set upa new advisory Welsh Health Council had been dropped in favourof continuing to rely as necessary on the existing Welsh Council, butit might be necessary to review this arrangement when the Commis-sion on the Constitution reported. He strongly supported the pro-posal made by the Secretary of State for Social Services that thenumber of members appointed by local authorities to the AHAsshould not exceed four. He proposed to arrange for the White paper to be published on Thursday, 3 August.In discussion it was argued that the local authorities would be strongly opposed to the number of their appointees on the AHAsbeing confined to four. This was less than the number proposed bythe previous Administration and fell far short of the degree of localauthority participation advocated by the Conservative Party when in Opposition. It would be undesirable if the sincerity of the government&apos;s declared intention to devolve more responsibility tolocal authorities were put in question and the goodwill of localauthorities forfeited because we insisted on a rigid restriction on thenumber of members they would be entitled to appoint. Such a restriction would by no means guarantee that the AHA would be anymore competent and efficient; would cause resentment disproportionate-tionate to the likely benefits; and would be seriously embarrassing.The minimum number of members likely to be acceptable to thelocal authorities was five.On the other hand, it was argued that, although the number oflocal authority members had not been proposed in the ConsultativeDocuments, the local authorities were already aware that the views expressed by the Conservative Party in Opposition had been modified by the Government and if a further change were now made theGovernment would be accused of vacillation. The medical profession, which was somewhat dissatisfied with the proposedreorganisation, would probably not press their arguments for anincreased number of doctors and nurses on the AHAs if the localauthority members did not exceed four. But if this number were increased there would be strong pressure for wider changes to bemade. The result might well be the destruction of the prospectswhich now existed for the formation of a board consisting of memberswhose direct allegiance would be to the AHA. A cohesive and loyalboard was of considerable importance to the NHS organisation,particularly since it was entirely financed from central Governmentfunds. Any concession made to the claims of the local authorities would be against the general interests of the NHS.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the draft White Papers on National Health ServiceReorganisation. The question of an increase in the local authorityrepresentation on the Area Health Authorities could then be recon-sidered in the light of the representations which were bound to bemade: if concessions proved to be necessary, they might have to bemade both to the local authorities and to the medical profession. Inthe presentation of the proposals the benefits of the new organisation for patients should be emphasised.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the draft White Papers on National health service Reorganisation attached to CP (72) 79 and cp (72) 80, subject to the textual amendments to which reference was made in the discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services and theSecretary of State for Wales to arrange for publication ofthe respective White Papers on 1 August and 3 August,subject to final confirmation of these dates with the lord president of the Council nearer the time.Cabinet Office,20 July, 1972.
