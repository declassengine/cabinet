Subject:Industrial Affairs
IndustrialAffairsMeetings withthe confederation-tion of BritishIndustry andthe TradesUnionCongressPreviousReference:CM (72) 46thConclusions,Minute 5SECRET* The Cabinet considered the attitude to be adopted by theGovernment spokesmen in the resumed discussions with the Con-federation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the trypartite discussions on prices and incomes policy with the Confederation ofBritish Industry (CBI) and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) were due to be resumed that afternoon. There had been no overt changein the position of the parties since the last meeting at the end ofthe previous week; and it would therefore be necessary to resume the exchanges on the basis of the suggestion which had been putforward on that occasion by the Director General of the national economic Development Office namely, that a voluntary system of regulation of pay and prices should be reinforced, so far as necessary,by statutory powers held in reserve and that the Government shouldlegislate to this effect.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal.It was accepted that the Prime Minister must have discretion, inthe light of the exchanges with the CBI and the TUC, to judge whether the legislation conferring these powers on the Governmentshould be enacted at the outset of the new arrangements or whetherit should be introduced only when some manifest breach of thearrangements had been seen to make it essential. There might be certain advantages in adopting the former course in so far as the government&apos;s posture would be more convincing in terms of public presentation if they were seen to be prepared to deal with any breach of the voluntary understanding as soon as it occurred. Moreover,the Government would be better placed to avoid any accusationof legislating with retrospective effect.The Cabinet then considered the course which the Governmentshould adopt if the discussions that afternoon ended in deadlock.It was agreed that only two courses were open to them. Theycould continue to try to give effect to their policies by voluntarymeans, contesting as best they could each excessive wage claimas it came forward. Alternatively, they could now seek a statutory basis for the proposals which had emerged from the discussions withthe CBI and the TUC and had been shown to be acceptable to theformer, although not to the latter; and, since the legislation would inevitably take some time to prepare and enact, it would be neces-sary to ensure that during the interim period, which might be 90days, there would be a prohibition on any increases in wages and prices, which would itself need to be given statutory form.The Cabinet then considered this concept of a pay and prices&quot; freeze &quot; in greater detail. The following main points were made (a) It would expose the Government to the charge that, in sofar as their legislation would purport to enable them to controlprices as well as wages, it would be inconsistent with the contention,which they had maintained throughout the discussions with the* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET146897-7 a 2
CBI and the TUC, that it was administratively not possible toenforce effective and comprehensive statutory price control. this criticism could be countered on the grounds that the interim arrangement would be for only a limited period; that it need not therefore seek to achieve the degree of precision and justice whichwould be expected of a more permanent arrangement; and that inany case the prices of agricultural produce would have to be exempt from control.(b) Moreover, it was significant that the President of theAmalgamated Union of Engineering and Foundry Workers,Mr. Scanlon, had declared publicly that the trade union movementwere thinking not in terms of a &quot; freeze &quot; on prices but rather interms of a limit of, say, 5 per cent on their increase. It was forconsideration, therefore, whether the Government should introduce into the interim period itself the concept of a limit on increases in wages and prices which had hitherto figured only in their proposalsfor a permanent system of wage and price regulation. In the caseof wages this might take the form of the  2 a week which ministers had already accepted for the longer term; or it might be expressed as a percentage increase. Similarly, the concept of a &quot; threshold &quot;agreement might be brought forward from the permanent settlement and be included in the measures to be adopted during the interim period. As against these considerations, however, it was suggestedthat, if the arrangements to govern the interim period were devolped in this way, it would become necessary to provide for their effectiveenforcement; and this would require the Government to elaboratearrangements for this purpose which it should be possible to deviseby the time when the permanent legislation was introduced but itwould not be possible to improvise in time for the immediate legislation which would govern the interim period. Moreover, thearrangement would no longer be a &quot; freeze &quot;; and the presentationalvalue of this simple and drastic action would be largely sacrificed.(c) But, even if the concept of a &quot;freeze&quot; was maintained,increases in certain food prices-particularly those of bread, sugar,milk, meat, fruit and vegetables would be unavoidable during the interim period. Short of a system of rationing, there appeared tobe no means by which they could be avoided, particularly duringthe Christmas season. But they would be so clearly inconsistent with the concept of a &quot; freeze &quot; which was to apply to prices no less than to wages that some means of eliminating, or at leastminimising, them must be found. This might entail Exchequersubsidies in appropriate cases. Alternatively, it might be possibleto introduce a &quot; two-tier &quot; system of pricing, whereby no increases would be permitted in the prices of basic necessities but the priceof luxury items, which it would be essential to continue to permitif essential commodities were not to disappear from the market,would be allowed to find their own level. The Minister of Agricul-ture, Fisheries and Food, in consultation with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, should give urgent consideration to these possibilitieswith due regard to our obligations to the European Economic Com-munity (e.c.) in relation to sugar.
(d) In principle, the same considerations applied to the price ofsteel. Here, too, it would be necessary to seek a derogation from our commitment to the e.c. to increase the price of steel as from1 January, 1973. If this derogation was only brief, it should bepossible to arrange it without too much difficulty. But this con-sideration underlined the importance of stating precisely, from the outset, the period for which the interim &quot; freeze &quot; would last.(e) The prohibition on price increases should extend to service as well as goods; and it should also comprise dividends and, possibly,profits from speculative transactions in land.(/) It would be necessary to consider carefully the definition ofthe powers to be comprised in the interim legislation, together withthe penalties to be prescribed for any breach of its requirements.Offences could be made the subject of either civil or criminal proceedings; but, since procedure by way of civil injunction might,if the injunction were disregarded, entail the application of criminalpenalties, it might be simpler to proceed from the outset on thebasis that offences would be a matter for the criminal law. TheHome Secretary and Lord President, in consultation with the attorney General and other Ministers directly concerned, should give urgent consideration to these issues.(g) It might be possible to effect some saving in the Parliamen-tary time which would need to be allotted to two separate Bills,almost inevitably at the expense of other items in the Governmenfslegislative programme, if the Government relied for the interim period on the dormant powers under the Prices and Incomes Act1966. These, however, could not be exercised in the absence ofthe National Board for Prices and Incomes, which had been created by that Act as the instrument for giving effect to its provisions but had been abolished by the present Government. Moreover, eventhough it might be possible to reconstitute the Board with reasonablespeed, it would undoubtedly give great offence to the governments supporters in Parliament if the Government were seen to be unableto give effect to their policies except by invoking powers which their predecessors had taken and they themselves, when in Opposi-tion, had bitterly contested. Alternatively, it might be possible tomake use of the emergency powers to control prices which had been incorporated in the legislation enacted on the eve of the 1939-45war.  This possibility should be further explored.(h) In giving effect to the control or limitation of increases inprices and charges, the Government would need to make sure thatthey did not provide those local authorities who were refusing to implement the rent increases required by the Housing Finance Actwith an excuse and a justification for their defiance of government policy. v(/) It would also be necessary to keep in mind the various inter-national obligations of the Government which might be held to be inconsistent with the course which the Cabinet were now considering.The Cabinet then turned to consider the date when the interim period should begin in relation to certain current negotiations for
pay increases which were likely to reach a critical stage within thenext few days.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that earlier in the morning the Ministerial Steering Committee on Pay Negotiations hadreviewed the pay settlements which might be reached during thecourse of the week on the assumption that the Bill to deal withthe interim period would not be effective until the following week.Meetings were taking place that day in respect of the agricultural wages Board (England and Wales), the British Waterways Boardand Govan Shipbuilders; and it seemed right to allow these toproceed on the basis that settlements would probably be reached as indicated in P (72) 38.  Similarly, it seemed right not to frustrate the settlements likely to be reached later in the week in respect of rolls-Royce (1971) Limited, London Transport buses, teachers(London allowance), university technicians and Atomic energy authority manual workers.  The negotiations about local authority manual workers had been deferred; but, if they could be reinstated,a settlement on the basis proposed in P (72) 38 was acceptable, eventhough this would subsequently cause considerable resentmentamong the National Health Service ancillaries who would subse-quently be caught by the &quot;freeze&quot;.  Similarly, a settlement for theindustrial Civil Service seemed possible if the arbitrator^ awardcould be brought forward sufficiently. There seemed no justification,however, for facilitating a settlement of the Municipal Airports(manual workers) claim.  There remained the claims by the police and the electricity power supply workers, which raised specialconsiderations.    A settlement of the Police claim was highly desirable; and an offer could be justified in relation to an establishedformula. On the other hand this formula would produce a relatively high award; and very careful presentation would be needed.Electricity power supply was the crucial claim.  If this could besettled on acceptable terms, there was a strong case for reaching agreement on all the other claims, except that of Municipal Air-ports (manual workers), in order to avoid a confrontation with thepower unions.   If, however, a settlement of the electricity supplyclaim was unlikely, it would be best to introduce the Bill regulating the interim period as soon as possible and to make it effective fromthe date of the statement of the Governmenfs intentions which thePrime Minister intended to make during the Debate on the Addresson the following day.In discussion doubts were expressed whether the electricityunions would be ready to reach a reasonable settlement once the government&apos;s plans for incomes policy in the longer term were known. Indeed, the Executive might be unwilling even to ballot its members on an offer of less than  3. On this assumption an attemptto settle the claim by agreement might be counter-productive, sinceany offer, even if rejected, could seem to establish a minimum forsettlements after the 90-day &quot; freeze &quot;. Moreover, in the short term the Government might be open to the criticism of having deliberatelydelayed the &quot;freeze&quot; in order to avoid a confrontation with thepower unions. On this basis the right course would be to emphasise
that the &quot; freeze &quot; was a purely interim arrangement, which wouldnot inhibit a reasonable settlement subsequently. If the powerunions then initiated industrial action against the &quot; freeze &quot;, theywould merely be provoking a confrontation which would have beeninevitable in any event at some stage.On the other hand the power unions had been persuaded to defer industrial action by a virtual undertaking by the employersduring the previous week that, if negotiations were resumed on  November, they expected to be in a position to make an offer. Ifthis offer were now withheld, the employers could reasonably becharged with a breach of faith; and this might affect public support for the Governmenfs position more generally. Moreover, if an offer was not made to the power unions and they subsequently tookindustrial action, it would be impossible to invoke the provisions ofthe Industrial Relations Act providing for a &quot; cooling off &quot; period,whereas, if a reasonable offer was made and was rejected, this would put the Government in a stronger position in enforcing a standstill.The position of Mr. Chappie was also relevant. He was a moderateunion leader; and, if a settlement were attempted this week in a manner which might create the impression that the Governmentwere anxious to avoid a confrontation, this might weaken his position with his more militant members. On the other hand his position might be even worse if no offer were made at all, since he might then seem to have been persuaded to withdraw his earlier threat of industrial action on the basis of an undertaking which was subsequently dishonoured.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that one possibility would be to try to avoid a final deadlock in the resumedmeeting with the CBI and the TUC later that day in order to allowfurther consideration to be given to the terms of the Bill regulating the interim period of &quot; freeze &quot; and to provide an opportunity forthe claim by the power unions to be settled before the terms of that bill were announced. But it was probably unrealistic to suppose that public opinion would now accept any further postponement of a statement indicating the Governmenfs intentions; and these would therefore have to be disclosed in his speech in the debate on the Address on the following day. This still left open the alterna-tives of making the &quot; freeze &quot; effective forthwith or, as a majority ofthe Cabinet seemed to prefer, from a somewhat later date whichwould allow a realistic offer to be made to the power unions. Itwas not necessary to reach a final decision at this stage, particularly since it would probably be necessary for Ministers to meet again inorder to review the position in the light of the outcome of thediscussions with the CBI and the TUC. In the meantime urgent consideration should be given to the points which had been raised in the discussion.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Home Secretary and Lord President, in consulta-tion with the Attorney General, to give furtherconsideration to the form, content and timing of the Bill
to provide for an interim &quot;freeze &quot; on increases in prices and wages.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, toconsider the action which might be taken to controlfood prices generally during the period of the &quot;freeze&quot;,with particular reference to bread and sugar.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later stage, when itwould also be necessary to consider suggestions whichhad been made to extend to one year the period of review; of entitlement to the Family Income Supplement, freeschool meals and free welfare milk; to keep the price of school meals at its present level; and to extend the needsallowance to rent rebates in order to emphasise the fair-ness of the measures which the Government envisaged.Cabinet Office,30 October, 1972.
