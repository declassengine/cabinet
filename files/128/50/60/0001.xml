ParliamentaryAffairsNationalHealthServiceReorganisationBillCONFIDENTIAL1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the week following the Christmas Recess.The Cabinet were informed that as the result of the acceptanceof an Opposition amendment in the House of Lords on the previous day the National Health Service Reorganisation Bill now containedno provision authorising charges for contraceptive supplies. Anumber of Government supporters had voted in favour of the amend-ment; and there seemed no prospect that the decision could be reversed at a later stage in the House of Lords. By the time theBill came before the House of Commons the Report of the Popula-tion Panel would probably have been published; and, if so, the considerations with which it would deal, no less than the issues ofpublic expenditure implicit in the amendment of the Bill, would bevery relevant to the decision whether to seek restoration of thecharging power.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Governmenfs attitude to this question would require carefulconsideration, initially by the Home and Social Affairs Committee.The Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to submit proposals to the Home and Social Affairs Committee, with due regard to the forthcoming Report of the PopulationPanel, about the attitude to be adopted by the Governmentto the issues raised by the amendment of the national health Service Reorganisation Bill.SECRETBritish Steel 2.  The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the development corporation strategy of the British Steel Corporation (BSC). They had beforeDevelopment them a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Trade andStrategy Industry (CP (72) 156) summarising aspects of the strategy which hadPrevious been reviewed at a meeting of Ministers with the Chairman and reference: members of the Board of the Corporation after the Cabinefs lastCM (72) 58th discussion of the subject. A draft Parliamentary statement on theConclusions, bsc&apos;s modernisation programme was annexed to this memorandum.Minute 11The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that it hadbeen made clear to Ministers at their meeting with the representativesof the BSC that, in evolving their development strategy, the board had examined a large number of options. They had maintained that by comparison with other developed countries the United kingdom had under-invested in its steel industry for a decade and that modern-isation was essential if costs were to be reduced and the quality ofthe product was to be improved on a scale which would enable theindustry to compete within the European Coal and Steel Com-munity and in a world market where demand was expected to rise
from 600 to 900 million tonnes between 1970 and 1980. As regardsthe most vulnerable features of their strategy the Corporation hadalready reduced their estimate of probable exports in order to lessen the risks of unprofitability; their expectation of a rising share of theUnited Kingdom market reflected the fact that the fastest demandgrowth was for their products; and their price assumptions reflectedmoderate estimates of the probable trend of prices generally. Thepossibility that a development strategy on these lines would resultin too low a level of profitability must be weighed against the risks to employment in the industry, together with the threat to the balanceof payments and to the growth of the economy, which would arise ifinvestment were too small. The reduction in costs to be derivedfrom the concentration of bulk steel making at large coastal workswas particularly relevant. To redevelop steel making at Shotton,in particular, would entail an extra cost of  4 a tonne; and the3,850 jobs which would be saved by this means would involve 1,300fewer jobs at Port Talbot. Even so, finishing processes employing6,000 men could economically continue at Shotton. The reductionof manpower in the industry must be seen in perspective. Since theindustry was nationalised in 1967 some 50,000 jobs had already been,or were in process of being, dispensed with, and in Yorkshire, inparticular, the industry had shed 20,000 jobs without serious industrial unrest or widespread hardship. By contrast, job losses under theBSCs present proposals would amount to no more than some 30,000,spread over a period of years; and, although there would be serious effects in some places, none of the closures would occur before1974-75 and most would take place towards the end of the decade.The scale of redundancies would ultimately be even greater than was implied by the strategy, if the industry was not modernised andas a result ceased to be competitive.At the meeting the part-time members of the Board had shown themselves fully committed to the strategy and had confirmed thatit was both feasible and necessary if the British steel industry wasnot to become the residual legatee of other countries&apos; investmentdecisions. In sum the Corporation^ representatives had developedtheir case with force and conviction; and the Government should now be prepared to approve the strategy in principle. Thereafter,they should abstain from unduly detailed intervention in its imple-mentation; but in view of the relevance of the timing of itssuccessive stages to both the profitability of the industry and to thesocial and economic problems which the strategy would create it hadbeen agreed with the Corporation that every major development would be reviewed by the Department of Trade and Industry in thelight of changes in the critical considerations and would not proceed without the Governmenfs agreement.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he had been considerably reassured by the meeting. The Board had clearlyappreciated the need to retain a balanced range of steel productionin Scotland; and the changes in their strategy which they had accepted should ensure that redundancies in Scotland over the next five years should not, broadly, exceed those of the last five. There
was room for improvement, however, in the Corporation^ approach to industrial relations, particularly as regards their practice of informing trade unions locally of decisions about forthcomingclosures and rundowns as soon as they had been reached. InScotland announcements of this kind had led to unnecessary publicalarm, which had been exploited by the Governmenfs political opponents. This might be avoided if BSC could be persuaded totake the Government into their confidence at an earlier stage oftheir planning.The Secretary of State for Wales said that the meeting with theBoard&apos;s representatives had merely demonstrated that, having reached a carefully reasoned decision about their strategy, the corporation were now impervious to its social and regional consequences. for wales this would mean a loss of 17,000-18,000 male jobs, including4,500 at Ebbw Vale, 4,500 at Cardiff, 6,000 at Shotton and 2,000at Wrexham, offset by a gain of only some 1,500 jobs at Port Talbot.The threat to Shotton was particularly severe, since apart from the bsc there were only two major employers of labour locally and opportunities in a radius of ten miles must be sought in the develop-ment areas of Wrexham and Merseyside, which were already sufferingfrom high male unemployment. The Corporation had given no sign,however, of acknowledging Shotton&apos;s admirable record of industrial relations; nor had they appeared to recognise that Shotton, EastMoors and Llanwern were all currently profitable. They had alsodiscounted, without sufficient justification, the more cautious, butperhaps more realistic, option under which their target capacity ofliquid steel production would be reached somewhat later by forgoingthe proposed Teesside complex in favour of preserving capacity atShotton and developing other steel works already in existence.In discussion there was general agreement that, whateverreservations the Government might feel about the Board&apos;s competencein the past or their assumptions for the future, they could notchallenge the Board&apos;s commercial judgment on the basis of com-parable technical knowledge. The fundamental question, therefore,was whether they retained confidence in the Board itself. From thispoint of view it was relevant that the Ministers who had attended the discussion with members of the Board had been favourablyimpressed by the manner in which they had developed the economic arguments for their strategy. The Chairman had admitted that anumber of the assumptions on which it was based were sensitive to changes in world prices and markets; but it was clearly unrealistic to approach the problem on the basis that all the assumptions mightbe falsified. The Board had been able to claim, with justification,that their estimates of market share and price margins were basedon experience over the last two years and that their calculations of demand were consistent with the fact that the BSC were the mainproducers of basic steel in Europe. They could also maintain thatthe element of flexibility in their strategy lay more in the rate atwhich the older plants would be run down than in the timing ofnew investment. It might, indeed, be unwise for the Governmentto approve the development strategy in general terms but to reserve
to themselves, not least in the interests of Wales, the right to decide the construction timetable for the Teesside complex which, as oneof the two main sources of crude liquid steel in the United Kingdom,would be a basic feature of that strategy. Moreover, it could notbe assumed that, if the strategy was pronounced to be unacceptable,the alternative plan which the Corporation would then adopt wouldprovide a reprieve for the Shotton plant or cause any less socialdistress in Wales. In fact, however, Wales already contained one-third of the steel industry and would benefit, under the strategy,from one-third of the new investment; and redundancies in wales would be no more than proportionate to the numbers employed.Finally, the Corporation had already accepted a less rapid rate of expansion at Port Talbot in order to conform with the requirementsof the public expenditure programme; and the Government must ensure that there was no repetition of the circumstances of the late1950s, when the profitability which the steel industry had achievedas a result of the demands of an expanding national economy hadmasked the need for new investment and uncertainty about the futurehad made the industry reluctant to undertake it. Nor should theGovernment accept bsc&apos;s development strategy now and then proceed to impede it by insisting too rigidly, or at inordinate length,on the application of their guidelines.These considerations, however, had to be set against the inevit-able doubts both about the advisability of devoting so much of our national resources to the steel industry and about the Board&apos;s ability to make a success of their strategy. The record of other nationalised industries, particularly in relation to the exploitation of nuclear powerand North Sea Gas, had not been very reassuring in this respect.Detailed examination of the bsc&apos;s proposals had suggested that itmight be prudent to adopt less optimistic assumptions; and whenchallenged about these assumptions, the Board&apos;s representatives atthe meeting had been unable to supply a wholly convincing answer.Their acceptance of the need for flexibility in the implementation ofthe strategy could also be called in question, and they themselves hadacknowledged that the decision to build a new steel complex onTeesside, together with the decision to expand Port Talbot, would inevitably pre-empt a substantial part of the potential growth of capacity over the decade ahead and would therefore preclude other possible developments which had strong local backing. If their estimates proved mistaken, the effects of the necessary retrenchmenton the older plants could be very serious. There must also be some doubts about&quot; the Board&apos;s capacity in the field of industrial relations at the local level and their willingness to appreciate the social and regional implications of their decisions. So drastic a reorganisation of the industry would not be achieved without considerable opposition. .The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet recognised the risks which were involved in an industrial programme of this magnitude. But in the light of their discussions with the Board the Ministers most closely concerned were satisfied, on balance, that the bsc&apos;s development strategy was the
result of a very thorough examination of the economic and com-mercial factors and that it must logically be accepted or rejected as a whole. The Cabinet therefore agreed that it should be endorsedin principle, subject to the safeguards that the timing of certain majordecisions would be reserved to the Government on the basis proposedby the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. The Cabinet were particularly concerned, however, about the social consequences insome areas, notably Shotton, Corby and Consett; and the responsible ministers should therefore examine urgently ways in which Depart-mental resources could best be mobilised in order to provideco-ordinated and comprehensive assistance to those areas.The Cabinet (1) Approved the development strategy of the British steel corporation, as set out in CP (72) 152 and 156, subjectto safeguards on the timing of major developments.The Cabinet then considered the form in which their decisions should be announced. Public opinion would be particularly con-cerned about two separate issues first, the nature of the assumptionson which the Corporation^ strategy was based and the considerations which had led the Government to conclude that it could be endorsedin principle; second, the Governmenfs intentions as regards theprovision both of alternative employment for labour made redundantby the strategy and of more general assistance to the areas whichwould be adversely affected by its progressive development. Inprinciple it would be desirable to deal with both these considera-tions in the initial announcement of the Governmenfs decision and,if possible, to reinforce the discussion of the social and regionalimplications of the strategy by an indication of the specific measureswhich the Government envisaged in this context. This suggestedthat a White Paper might provide the best means of announcing andjustifying the Governmenfs decision. On the other hand it wouldnot be possible to defer an announcement of that decision until afterthe Recess without creating the impression that the Cabinet were divided on the issues involved and were unable to reach a definite conclusion; and it would be equally impossible to include in any statement made before the Recess precise details of the measureswhich the Government contemplated to offset the unemployment andother adverse social consequences which would result from the implementation of the strategy. In these circumstances the wisestcourse would be to make an announcement in Parliament on thefollowing day, indicating that the Government had endorsed theCorporation^ strategy in principle; that this strategy had beenelaborated after careful consultation with themselves; that they were particularly concerned to alleviate its adverse social impact in certain areas; and that they proposed to adopt for this purpose measuresanalogous to those which had been taken in the early 1960s to develop the industrial infrastructure of the North East by creating specialinterdepartmental teams with responsibility for dealing with theproblems of a depressed area on a comprehensive and imaginativescale. It might also be possible, at an appropriate moment, to linkthe development strategy with the forthcoming announcement of anew programme of advance factories.
The question of the assumptions on which the strategy was basedand the considerations which had influenced the Government in their examination of it should be reserved for more detailed elaborationin a White Paper, which should be published before any Parliamen-tary debate on the Governmenfs decision after the Recess. It wouldbe important that this White Paper should be confined to a discussionof the issues involved and should not provide any avoidableopportunity for the basic decision itself to be reopened.The Cabinet-(2) Agreed that a Parliamentary statement announcing their decision should be made on the following day.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, inconsultation with the Home Secretary, the Secretary ofState for Scotland and the Secretary of State for Wales to revise the draft statement annexed to CP (72) 156 in thelight of their discussion and to submit the revised text tothe Prime Minister as rapidly as possible.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, inconsultation with the Ministers concerned, to prepare, for publication before any Parliamentary debate on thedevelopment strategy of the British Steel Corporation, a white Paper discussing the assumptions on which thatstrategy was based and the considerations which had led the Government to endorse it.Cabinet Office,20 December, 1972.
