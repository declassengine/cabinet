secret. The Prime Minister tendered the Cabinets congratulations to the Ministers concerned with the Northern Ireland Bill on itsrapid passage through both Houses of Parliament in the previous day&apos;s sitting.The Cabinet would also wish to express their appreciation of theskill and speed with which Parliamentary Counsel had drafted theBill.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.SECRETShipbuilding 2.   The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that onthe previous day the Ministerial Committee on Economic policy had agreed the steps which should be taken in order to maintainactivity in the three yards of Govan Shipbuilders Limited. Thenecessary action had to be taken by the end of February because theScotstoun yard would otherwise run out of work by then. Under thearrangements which had been agreed by the Committee Govan Ship-builders Limited would receive  35 million of Government finance,of which  17 million was required to write off losses on the construc-tion of ships and the remainder to purchase, modernise and keep inoperation the three yards.  3 million of the  17 million for write-offon ships, however, would be payable in due course in any event underthe general production grants scheme.  10 million of this totalGovernment provision could be saved by closing down the Scoutstounyard, but only at the cost of sacrificing 2,000 jobs. The prospectrevealed by the studies on the future viability of Govan ShipbuildersLimited which had been made for the Government by Hill Samueland the Maynard Group was not very satisfactory. It indicated that,while the company might move from deficit into surplus in about three years&apos; time, they could not be expected to reach full commercialviability within the next five years. In the last fortnight, since it had appeared that the bid for Clydebank Shipyard by a United Statescompany was being seriously pursued, considerable progress had beenmade with the unions and shop stewards about methods of working in Govan Shipbuilders Limited. Nevertheless, if the general levelof unemployment was lower and economic activity was reviving more rapidly, he would not have felt it necessary to recommend financial support for the three yards on the scale now envisaged. The Minis-terial Committee on Economic Policy had recognised that the case for Government intervention was principally a social one; and itwould therefore be appropriate to make known the Governments..........       decision in the debate on unemployment in the following week.In discussion it was pointed out that a decision to provideGovernment finance on this scale for a company whose prospectswould remain dubious would not be likely to commend itself to theGovernments supporters. Moreover, unless the history of the affairwere made abundantly plain, the public would be left with theimpression that the Government had originally decided to abandonParliamentaryAffairsNorthernIrelandBillPreviousReference :CM (72) 9thConclusions
Upper Clyde Shipbuilders Limited to its fate; that there had beena &quot;work-in&quot; under the leadership of the shop stewards; and thatthis had compelled the Government to change their mind and toprovide finance on a wholly exceptional scale. It would also benecessary to be ready to rebut the argument advanced by theOpposition at the time of the collapse of Upper Clyde ShipbuildersLimited that the company could have been saved at that point bythe provision of assistance which was very modest by comparisonwith the amount which would now be involved. Finally, it was important to avoid any premature disclosure of the government&apos;s decision until the debate on the following Monday, and particular care should be taken by all concerned in this respect.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for trade and Industry and agreed that he should indicate the Governmenfs intention to provide additional financialassistance to Govan Shipbuilders Limited during the debate on unemployment in the House of Commons in the follow-ing week.secret. The Lord President said that the Legislation Committee had approved the terms of the Monopolies, Mergers and restrictive practices Bill at their meeting on the previous Tuesday but had been concerned both about the weight of this prospective addition to the government&apos;s existing legislative commitments in the current session and about the extent of the controversy which was likely to beprovoked by the Bill. Without in any way underestimating its importance he had regretfully come to the conclusion that, in view ofthese considerations, he must recommend to the Cabinet that theBill should not be introduced. This would be preferable to thealternative course of introducing the Bill in the expectation that itmight have to be abandoned before it reached the Statute Book.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that, although he recognised the force of the Lord President&apos;s arguments, the Billrepresented an important element in the Governmenfs economicprogramme, which would transform competition policy in thiscountry and would be warmly welcomed by the governments supporters as a major, constructive measure of reform.In discussion, it was generally accepted that the Bill shouldmake a significant contribution to the reduction of inflation, theprovision of incentives and the stimulation of competition. On theother hand it was lengthy and gave ample scope for controversy asregards, for example, the breadth of the powers to be conferred onthe proposed Director General of Fair Trading and Competition,the references to European Community obligations, the favourable treatment to be given to certain professional services and the suggested reference of restrictive labour practices to the monopolies commission. The issue of prices and incomes policy was also likelyMonopoliesMergers andRestrictivePractices Bill
to be involved, since the previous Administration^ Commission for industry and Manpower Bill, which had lapsed at the General Elec-tion, would have amalgamated the Monopolies Commission and theNational Board for Prices and Incomes.The Bill could be introduced in the House of Lords, but with little prospect that time could subsequently be found for it in theHouse of Commons, a consideration which in itself would create difficulties for the Governments supporters in the Upper House andwould cast doubt on the Governments ability to manage theirlegislative programme.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were reluctant to set the Bill aside for a later Session. Butto attempt to enforce its passage would be liable to have a damagingimpact on the Governments other legislation and would adversely affect a number of major Bills of critical importance. The Cabinettherefore agreed that the Bill should not be introduced in the current session.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Monopolies, Mergers and restrictive practices Bill should not be introduced in the current session.OverseaAffairsCyprusPreviousReference:CM (72) 7thConclusions,Minute 5Visit of thePresident offlie UnitedStates toChinaSpainSECRET4. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary informed, theCabinet that the recent importation of arms from Czechoslovakiaby the President of Cyprus, Archbishop Makarios, continued to causeconcern to both the Greek and Turkish Governments. The GreekGovernment had pressed the Archbishop to surrender the arms tothe United Nations Force in Cyprus; but he had refused to do so.Although the tension now appeared to be rather less, the TurkishGovernment were still expressing misgivings.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the visit of the President of the United States to the PeoplCs Republic ofChina appeared to be proceeding satisfactorily and would probablybe of considerable assistance to the President in his forthcomingelectoral campaign. A second consequence of the visit might beincreasing anxiety on the part of the Government of the soviet union about Chinese intentions in the short term, particularly if it seemed likely that United States policy towards the People&apos;s Republicmight become less hostile.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he proposedto visit Spain during the following week in response to an invitation from the Spanish Foreign Minister that they should &quot; think together &quot;about the future of Gibraltar. It might be to the general advantage to try to direct these exploratory discussions towards an arrangementsimilar to that which we had reached with the Argentine Govern-ment about the Falkland Islands, whereby the question of sovereigntywas set aside while efforts were made to develop co-operativemeasures in such matters as trade. It was not clear, however, howfar this would be feasible in the case of Gibraltar.
Pakistan The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, followingour recognition of Bangladesh, he considered it desirable to visitPakistan at an early date. He had accordingly arranged to do soimmediately following a visit which he was due to pay to Israel insome two weeks&apos; time. He intended to do everything possible topromote a reconciliation between the leaders of Pakistan and Bangla-desh; it was unfortunate that the Prime Minister of Bangladesh had so far refused to meet the President of Pakistan until the Governmentof Pakistan had recognised Bangladesh.Qatar The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that on the basisof present information he did not consider that any formal act of recognition by the United Kingdom Government would be necessaryfollowing the assumption of power in Qatar by the former DeputyRuler Sheik Khalifah.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.New Zealand The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food informed theCabinet that the New Zealand Government had asked for the post-ponement of the last instalment, due to be implemented in July, 1972,of the imposition of a levy on imported lamb. A similar request forthe postponement of the previous instalment from January, 1972, hadbeen rejected; but there were political arguments in favour of post-postponing the final instalment until January, 1973, at a cost of some  Ifmillion. There would be advantage in announcing this decision in the context of a visit either by a United Kingdom Minister to NewZealand or by a New Zealand Minister to the United Kingdom.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the final instalment of the imposition of the levy should be postponed until January, 1973, and that the NewZealand Minister of Agriculture should be invited to London with aview to the announcement of this decision in the context of his visit.The Cabinet (2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion,SECRETIndustrial 5.   The Secretary of State for Employment said that the totalAffairs of unemployed in Great Britain at the February count, includingUnemployment those temporarily out of work, amounted to 1,571,000 or 6-9 per cent of the insured work force. This very large figure had, of course, been seriously inflated as a result of the impact of the coalminers&apos; strike on industry in general. The underlying trend of wholly unemployed,seasonally adjusted, was more satisfactory. There had been a rise of only 1,000 between January and February, compared withincreases of 10,000 and more a month for many months past. Therehad been decreases in the number of wholly unemployed, unadjusted,in both Scotland and Wales. Moreover, seasonally adjusted figures
Coalminers&apos;StrikePreviousReference:CM (72) 8thConclusionsof vacancies had increased slightly in February. On the other hand there was evidence that in the circumstances of the past week or soemployers had reassessed their labour requirements more critically;and, although the &quot; labour shake-out&quot; had seemed to be ending, thecoal strike appeared to have given many employers grounds forprolonging it.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for employment.The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial Committee on emergencies had considered earlier that morning a report by theMinister for Industry on the coal prospects following the withdrawalof pickets by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). Thereport was more hopeful than had seemed likely in the previous week.The National Coal Board (NCB) had already managed to transportf million tons; and on the assumption that there was a favourable response in the ballot and a satisfactory return to work by the minerson the following Monday, over 2 million tons of coal should bemade available from stocks and new output in the following week,of which 1  million tons would be coal for power stations. Shortlythereafter deliveries of power station coal might approach the weekly normal for the time of the year. On the basis of these figures and an assurance from the British Railways Board (BRB) that theyshould be well able to transport these amounts of domestic coaltogether with prospective imports, the Central Electricity GeneratingBoard (CEGB) and the Electricity Council now believed that afurther significant easement of restrictions on electricity consumption was possible with effect from the following Monday. They recom-mended that rota cuts should be retained on the present basis, thatthe electricity consumption of large industrial firms should beincreased from 60 per cent to 85 per cent and that the medium-sizedfirms should be allowed either four days&apos; working a week, instead ofthree, or unrestricted operation subject to the rota cuts on twoworking days a week. The latter of these alternatives was preferable.The restrictions applying to the domestic consumer would not be relaxed at present. An announcement about the proposed relaxationsfor industry was required that day. The estimates of coal and electricity supply and the consequent relaxation of electricityrestrictions had been based on the retention of rota cuts for approxi-mately three weeks and therefore depended upon the continuance ofthe State of Emergency for that period. The CEGB, however, would still recommend the proposed relaxations even if the State ofEmergency were to be allowed to expire on 8 March. On the under-standing that the proposals would not in fact pre-empt the cabinets decision about the renewal of the State of Emergency, the committee recommended that the proposed relaxations should be approved.In discussion some concern was expressed about the possibleneed for renewing the State of Emergency; it would be particularlyundesirable to have a further Parliamentary debate on the emergency powers. On the other hand, given that the outcome of the ballot andthe consequent extent of the return to work were still uncertain and
that there must be a continuing risk of a period of cold weather, theneed to prolong Emergency Powers might well arise. It might bepossible to make the further proclamation on 8 March and then toallow the Emergency Regulations to lapse after seven days withoutdebating them; and, although this might provoke the charge that theGovernment had had no intention of debating the extension, it mightbe justified on the ground that it was customary to allow the use ofEmergency Regulations for up to seven days before they wereconfirmed by Parliament. In the event of a rail strike emergency powers might in any case be required; but the Government wouldnot be justified in renewing the existing Powers in order to conservecoal stocks in anticipation of that contingency.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet approved the proposed relaxation in the restrictionson the industrial use of electricity from 28 February, on the under-standing that this did not pre-empt a decision whether to renew theState of Emergency on 8 March. This question would need to beconsidered further when the situation became clearer, following the expected resumption of work by the miners. The relaxations should,as proposed, be announced in the House of Commons that day, inorder that industry might have adequate notice. Meanwhile, hehad invited the Lord Privy Seal to co-ordinate action to ensure that power supplies to industry and domestic consumers were re-estab-lished as rapidly as possible. The Ministerial Committee on emergencies should continue to supervise progress on the resumptionof coal supplies, including the problems created at the docks by theimportation of extra coal. He had put in hand a review of theorganisation to deal with civil emergencies in order to provideMinisters on future occasions with better and more up-to-date information upon which to base decisions.The Cabinet (2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry toarrange for the announcement of the proposed relaxation of electricity restrictions.Pay Policy The Cabinet considered a Note by the Secretary of State forAfter the       Employment (CP (72) 22) about pay claims which were at presentWilberforce     outstanding.Recommenda-tlons The Secretary of State for Employment said tb.at his Note didnot attempt to review incomes policy in the longer term or to consider what could be done to change the balance of industrial bargaining power. He would be preparing further memoranda on these matters,in which he would also review the law governing picketing and would consider what could be done to require the unions to pay strike pay.His present Note, which had been considered by the ministerial steering Committee on Pay Negotiations on the previous evening,listed the main public sector pay claims at present outstanding, not all of which required early decisions. The first indications of union
attitudes in the aftermath of the report of the Wilberforce Court of inquiry were not altogether discouraging. The claim for nurses hadbeen settled at about 8 per cent; and there were signs that the Unionof Post Office Workers might reach agreement on their claim at about the same level. His recommendations, which had beenapproved by the Ministerial Committee, were that the Governmentshould still seek to achieve public sector pay settlements at 8 per centor less over the next few months; that the implications of possibleindustrial action by the rail and steel workers should be urgentlyexamined; that it should be the objective to avoid further &quot; whollyexceptional&quot; cases in the current pay round and to achieve settle-ments by negotiation or conciliation in preference to a court of inquiry; that there should be further discussions with the confederation-tion of British Industry (CBI) and the employers&apos; organisations; andthat all possible steps should be taken to rebuild coal and otherfuel stocks as rapidly as possible, against the possibility of an earlyrail strike. The meeting being held later that day between the BRBand the three rail unions would provide some indication of the likelihood-hood of this. It was the Associated Society of Locomotive engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) who were most likely to prove militant on this occasion. The objective, bearing in mind that the new railway pay agreement would not come into force until 1 May, must be to defersubstantive negotiations as long as possible.The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial Committee hadcommissioned urgent assessments of the strength of the case forincreased pay which the railway unions could deploy; of the likelihood-hood of a railway strike and the extent of the damage which itcould cause, taking into account the possibility of support fromother unions; and of the tactical options which might be open to ministers in dealing with the negotiations on railwaymen&apos;s pay.In discussion of the threat posed by the railwaymen&apos;s pay claim,it was noted that the basic rates paid to railwaymen were lower thanthose paid to surface workers in the coal industry prior to theWilberforce recommendations. It was likely that the more militantelements on the ASLEF Executive were in touch with similarelements on the NUM Executive; and the ASLEF leaders were involved in a struggle for power within the union which would compel the moderate elements to try to preserve their own position by adopting more intransigent tactics. It would be important forthe BRB to stand firm in the face of the Wilberforce report.Perhaps the most important objective would be to defeat anyproposal that the effective date of the settlement should be advanced;but it would also be desirable to ensure that/on this occasion the levels of pay and conditions of service on which public discussion was based were not those which the unions selected for presentation,but the true figures. Steps should accordingly be taken to ensurethat the BRB had suitable material ready for publication.In further discussion is was suggested that consideration should now be given to the relationship between the Government and the nationalised industries in public sector pay negotiations. It was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain that these undertakings
were free agents in conducting pay negotiations; and it was doubtfulwhether the Government could afford to stand apart from the publicdefence of pay decisions which were likely to attract public criticismunless they were adequately explained and might lead to industrial action on a wide scale. In the case of the strike in the electricity industry during the previous winter early intervention by the Govern-ment had contributed to a successful outcome of the dispute; and itwas for consideration whether any future Government interventionshould be at an early stage or as late as possible.In further discussion the following main points were made (a) It was now clear that the NCB would incur a serious financial deficit as a result of the miners&apos; dispute. The likely loss in1971-72 was  143 million and in 1972-73  150 million, after allow-ance was made for a 5 per cent price increase to yield  30 million.It would be necessary to consider whether a larger price increase would be justified, although this could be at variance with theinitiative on price restraint introduced by the CBI. If there wereto be an increase of more than 5 per cent, it should be madequickly in order that it could be clearly identified as a result ofthe coal strike. Proposals to deal with the anticipated deficit wouldbe put before the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy assoon as possible.(b) The examination of the arrangements for social security benefits, which was due to be completed later in the year, could bebrought forward for early consideration.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet noted the situation in relation to outstanding pay negotia-tions. The Secretary of State for Employment should circulate assoon as possible his further memoranda on the factors affecting thecurrent policy of de-escalation and the balance of industrial bargain-ing power. Further consideration would need to be given to theGovernments role in major pay disputes in the public sector; inparticular, it was debatable whether it was right to leave both thenegotiations and the publicity about the dispute to the nationalisedundertaking concerned, as had happened in the case of the coal strike.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry should arrange for the urgent submission to the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policyof proposals for the treatment of the situation created by the expecteddeficits of the NCB. The Secretary of State for Social services should arrange for the review of social security benefits to be brought forward as suggested.The Cabinet  /(4) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(5) Invited the Secretary of State for Employment to circulateas soon as possible his proposals about de-escalationpolicy and the balance of industrial bargaining power.(6) Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to circulate proposals about the financing of the NCBdeficit to the Economic Policy Committee as soon aspossible.
(7) Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to circulatehis proposals in relation to social security benefits assoon as possible.SECRETFuture 6.   The Cabinet considered memoranda on the future admin-Administration istration of magistrates&apos; courts by the Lord Chancellor (CP (72) 19)of Magistrates&apos; and the Home Secretary (CP (72) 20).CourtsThe Lord Chancellor said that the Home and Social AffairsCommittee had been unable to agree about his proposal that theadministration of magistrates&apos; courts should become the responsibilityof central Government. Now that the Government had assumed responsibility for all the higher courts in England and Wales and responsibility for the administration of the county courts was alreadyvested in himself, the reform of the administration of magistrates&apos;courts was the most important single measure of law reform atthe present time. The responsibility was at present divided betweenfour authorities: the Home Secretary, himself, the local authoritiesand the local magistrates&apos; courts committees. This division not onlyresulted in inefficiency but also made effective control of the systemimpossible. The different priorities which local authorities assigned to the courts in their areas resulted in widely differing standards of court administration and, therefore, in varying standards of justice.Central control would enable court staffs to be deployed more effectively and by providing a better career structure, would encouragement-age recruitment. It would also enable better training facilities tobe provided for the staff; and it would encourage more efficientstandards of accounting, which would for example, facilitate the recovery of unpaid fines, which now amounted to  7 million. Itwas a necessary prerequisite to many important law reforms whichhe had in mind. Some adjustment of the present system had to bemade in order to take account of the forthcoming organisation oflocal government; and the necessary provisions in the Local Govern-ment Bill would shortly be reached in Committee in the House ofCommons. There was already danger of a breakdown in theadministration of magistrates&apos; courts in London; and central control would have to be instituted sooner or later. If so, it should begin in April, 1974, simultaneously with the new structure of localgovernment. Of the interests concerned with magistrates&apos; courtsthose who might be concerned to maintain the present position, theCentral Council of Magistrates&apos; Courts Committees and the localauthority associations, were against change but the other interests,including the Magistrates&apos; Association and the Justices&apos; Clerks&apos;Society, as well as the legal profession, favoured central control.The Home Secretary said that it was possible to exaggerate theadvantages of central as against local administration. There was bound to be a lack of uniformity, because the needs of different areasvaried. But this would not be remedied by central control, particu-larly since central control would not of itself ensure that additional
funds would be available to improve or rationalise standards. Itwas true that the Magistrates&apos; Association had favoured central control; but this was probably because the magistrates were underthe erroneous impression that in a system of central control theywould continue to be able to appoint their own clerks. Thearguments for central control of the magistrates&apos; courts couldlogically be applied to a wide range of services which were at present under local control; and they had, indeed, been used to advocate the central control of the police. The assumption of central control would involve complicated and contentious legislation in the next session of Parliament; it would alienate local government opinion;and it would run contrary to the Governments policy of decentralisation-tion. It was important that local communities should feel that theywere involved in the maintenance of law and order; and it would therefore be undesirable to make the proposed change. Moreover,if the control of magistrates&apos; courts were centralised, the present administration of the probation and after-care service would become an obvious anomaly; and it would be difficult to avoid transferringresponsibility for the service either to the local authorities or to central Government. This was not an issue which should be facedat the present time, when the urgent need was to secure the rapid expansion of the service.In discussion it was suggested that a decision at this juncture tocentralise the administration of magistrates&apos; courts would be liableto alienate the local authorities, particularly in relation to the LocalGovernment Bill now before Parliament. The local authorities werein any event having to adjust themselves to considerable structuralchange, not only in local government itself but also in relation to social services, the National Health Service and the water industry.It was not reasonable that they should have to accommodate them-selves to yet another change which they would probably regard asunwelcome on its own merits. Moreover, if local authorities ceased tohave any part to play in the administration of magistrates&apos; courts theywould be likely to be less willing in future to continue the arrange-ment under which many magistrates&apos; courts met in council premises.In this respect centralisation would lead to pressure for higherexpenditure. It was always possible to criticise the arrangements inparticular areas. But the magistrates&apos; courts succeeded in dealingwith the great bulk of criminal cases without general criticism; and itshould not be assumed that central control would result in more efficient administration than local control. There was always an argument for the central control of local services on the ground of efficiency and uniformity. But the Governments declared policy wasto decentralise rather than to centralise; and they were already in danger of criticism for apparent breaches in that policy. A Bill togive effect to the Lord Chancellor&apos;s proposals would undoubtedly becontentious; and the Oppbsition in Parliament would be likely to favour the continuance of the present arrangements.On the other hand the central control of magistrates&apos; courts,particularly since all other courts in England and Wales were nowunder central control, was the most logical system of administration;and it was undesirable that local authorities should have any influence
in the administration of justice. The interests of justice should be the sole criterion upon which the issue should be decided. The argument for centralising the administration of magistrates&apos; courts was essen-tially different in character from the arguments for centralising other local services; and the main argument for not centralising policeadministration, namely that it was undesirable that the centralGovernment should acquire excessive power in this respect, was not relevant to the administration of magistrates&apos; courts.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thegeneral view of the Cabinet was that, although in principle thecentralisation of the administration of magistrates&apos; courts had advan-tages, it would not be appropriate to make any change at the presenttime. The possibility of change at some future date should not be excluded; but in the meantime no indication should be given thatthis possibility was under consideratoin.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office,24 February, 1972.
