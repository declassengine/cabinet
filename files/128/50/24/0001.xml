The Prime Minister said that the visit to London of theFederal German Chancellor, Herr Brandt, had been very succesful and had afforded a useful opportunity to discuss a wide range of subjects of interest to the two Governments. In particular, it had become evident that the Federal Chancellor agreed substantiallywith our own views both on the manner of preparation for themeeting of Heads of Government of the European economic community which was planned for the autumn and also on theresults which we might expect from that meeting.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that HerrBrandt was that day facing a critical debate in the Federal GermanParliament on a Motion described as &quot;a constructive vote of no confidence &quot;. If the Opposition Parties secured a majority for this motion, as was not impossible, Herr Brandt would probably bereplaced as Chancellor by Herr Barzel. The Soviet government might be expected to react adversely to such a change. But the policies of Herr Barzel&apos;s party, the Christian Democratic Union,were generally friendly towards ourselves; and we should be ableto continue to count on Federal German support as regards our accession to the European Economic Community.The Cabinet 1.  Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister and theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theNorth Vietnamese, as expected, had launched a major attack in theCentral Highlands area of South Vietnam. So far the Army of theRepublic of Vietnam appeared to be holding their ground fairly well,although the scale of the attack was very formidable and the weather was impeding United States air operations in support of the south vietnamese. It was too early to say with7 certainty that the south vietnamese would be able to hold the invasion indefinitely; but thedanger of military defeat was perhaps smaller than the risk of apolitical collapse by the South Vietnamese Government.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary drew the attentionof the Cabinet to the rather critical line which had been taken bythe Press in reporting on our interventions at the Third united nations Conference on Trade and Development now meeting in
Santiago. He was taking action in an effort to improve reportingof the British role; and he would consider further whether therewere any practical steps which we might take, e.g. by remission orrescheduling of debt, to improve the effectiveness of our aid to the developing countries.The Cabinet 2.  Took  note  of  the  statements  by  the  Foreign  and commonwealth Secretary.northern ireland previous reference:CM (72) 22ndConclusions,Minute 3SECRET3. The Cabinet considered the situation in Northern Ireland.Their discussion and the conclusions reached were separatelyrecorded and issued only to The Queen, the Prime Minister andthose Ministers who had to take action.The conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file held by the Secretary of the Cabinet.IndustrialAffairsBritishEuropeanAirwaysPilots&apos; PayNegotiationsAirlineCorporation^Ground StaffPayNegotiationsRailwaymen&apos;sPayNegotiationsPreviousReference:CM (72) 22ndConclusions,Minute 5CONFIDENTIAL4. The Secretary of State for Employment said that, following the failure of British European Airways (BEA) and the British AirLine Pilots&apos; Association to reach agreement on a pay increase forBEA pilots, the latter had been working to rule. BEA had nowdismissed certain pilots, acting on legal advice that their refusal to fly a new aircraft was a breach of their contracts of employment.These dismissals might harden attitudes in the pay dispute. Hewould continue, however, to keep in touch with both sides.The Secretary of State for Employment said that british european Airways and the British Overseas Airways corporation had reached a pay settlement with their ground staff which apparently involved an average increase of 8-3 per cent per annum for the three years 1 January, 1971, to 31 December, 1973. Thedetails of the settlement needed further examination; but the agreedincrease appeared to exceed the level which Ministers had asked the Corporations to observe as the maximum.The Cabinet 1.  Took note of the statements by the Secretary of State for employment. /The Minister for Transport Industries said that, following therestoration of normal railway services and the beginning of the&quot; cooling-off &quot; period in the railwaymen&apos;s pay dispute, the british railways Board (BRB) had arranged to discuss with the railunions on the following day the resumption of negotiations.The Board expected that a settlement would not be attainable untilthe very end of the &quot; cooling-off &quot; period; and they were accordinglynot attempting to force the pace with the rail unions.  There was
as yet little sign that the latter would be prepared to accept less than their 14 per cent claim; and, while BRB for their part intended to resume negotiations on the basis of their offer of an 11 per cent increase from 1 May, 1972, the railwaymen&apos;s basic rate being increased to  20 per week on 1 January, 1973, and the differentialsabove the basic rate being maintained, they doubted whether theywould be able to avoid eventually conceding as much as the Arbitrator, Mr. Jarratt, had awarded. Meanwhile, the london transport Executive had informed the rail unions, in response totheir claim for Underground workers, that they would be preparedto apply from 1 May whatever basic rates were agreed between theunions and BRB. There had been some pressure among Under-ground workers for industrial action; but the unions had so far doneno more than threaten that such action would begin on the underground if their claim was not met in full by Monday, 8 May.The Cabinet 2.  Took note of the statement by the Minister for transport industries.British SteelCorporationManualWorkers&apos; PayNegotiationsThe Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that, as agreed by the Ministerial Steering Committee on Pay Negotiations,the British Steel Corporation (BSC) had been asked not to offer intheir negotiations about the pay of manual workers in the steelindustry an increase of more than 9 per cent and to concede this onlyin return for an agreed settlement. In negotiations on Wednesday,26 April, with the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation (is to),however, BSC had in fact tabled an offer for an increase of some9 per cent and had failed to secure a settlement. The union hadstood firm on their claim for an increase of some 13 per cent. BSCwere likely to resume negotiations with is to in about a fortnightand in the meantime would be meeting the other unions concerned.The Cabinet 3.  Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for trade and Industry.CONFIDENTIALPromotion of 5.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the SecretaryCouncil House  0f State for the Environment (CP (72) 46) on the promotion of sales and Land council house sales. They also had before them a draft Parliamen-Availability     tary statement on land availability and house prices,and HousePrices The Secretary of State for the Environment said that since theGovernment had taken office and had lifted restrictions on the saleof council houses sales had increased from 6,000 in 1970 to nearly17,000 in 1971. It was expected that in the light of the rent increases which would result from the Housing Finance Bill more tenantswould wish to purchase their houses. Nevertheless, a number ofcouncils refused to sell houses. Further action was now needed to encourage more sales; and this action would also help to bringthe supply of houses for sale more quickly into line with demand.
Increased sales of council houses might be achieved by legislation,which might take one of three possible forms. It could confer oncouncil tenants the right to buy their houses; or it could require localauthorities to submit schemes for the sale of a proportion of council houses; or it could place on local authorities a duty to reviewcontinuously the use of their existing powers to sell houses. As analternative to legislation, however, a strongly worded circular mightbe issued, exhorting local authorities to sell council houses to thoseof their tenants who wished to buy them. This circular might be accompanied by a threat of legislation in one of the three formsmentioned if the response was unsatisfactory. Measures to compellocal authorities to sell houses would be very controversial andwould arouse considerable resentment. Legislation requiring localauthorities to review the use of their existing powers would be opento the same objection if it included sanctions; and, if it did not doso, it would be likely to be no more effective than exhortation. on balance, therefore, the best course would be the issue of a strongcircular.The demand for housing at present greatly exceeded the supply;and, especially in the South East and the Midlands, there was an acute shortage of building land. The rapid increase in house prices was largely accounted for by this shortage, which had forced up theprice of the available land. The decline in house building which hadpersisted for two years before the Government took office had beenreversed as a result of a combination of measures which had madefinance for house purchase more freely available and had restoredthe confidence of developers. This trend had also been assisted bythe general rise in incomes. The supply of houses was nowimproving rapidly; but because builders had hesitated to increase their purchases of land until the previous year, the sudden increasein the current level of demand for the relatively small amount ofland which was suitable for building and was immediately availablehad led to a sharp increase in prices. It was important to persuadedevelopers to have confidence in the Governments intention to adhere to their policy of positive planning as exemplified in theSouth East planning strategy, under which the most suitable areas to meet the needs of housing and economic development had beendesignated. The Government should not respond to pressures to release more land for building by permitting incursions into GreenBelt land; and developers must also be persuaded of the Govern-ment&apos;s resolution on this matter. Full use of the available planningprocedures should be encouraged in order both to minimise delaysand to ensure a positive approach by planning authorities. Anumber of technical problems, however, had to/ be overcome inorder to release more land for building; and specific measures todeal with these would be required. He proposed that localauthorities should be empowered to borrow an additional 80 million to spend on assembling land for early private housingdevelopment and should also be allowed to capitalise interest charges on land acquired for this purpose for up to five years.Loan sanctions for sewerage should be readily granted; and localauthorities should, where necessary, be supported in compulsory purchase applications for land assembly.   He also proposed the
expansion by private development of some of the older New Townsin the London region. No legislation would be required; and itwould not be necessary to divert further mobile industry to these areas. He also proposed to encourage the earlier use of landalready within these towns; and he intended to arrange for partsof the dockland areas in London at present being comprehensivelyexamined by consultants to be planned for housing without awaitingplans for the whole area. He proposed to announce these measures in the course of the Supply Debate on rising land and house priceslater that day.In discussion there was general agreement with the measures proposed for increasing the availability of building land. It wassuggested, however, that, since these measures would not in generalbe quick to take effect and problems other than availability of land would remain to be dealt with, they should not be presented as afinal solution to the imbalance between supply and demand for houses. On the other hand full weight should be given during the debate to the Governments achievements in increasing the supplyof houses for sale and to the various measures, including the recentconcession on Stamp Duties, which had been taken in order to mitigate price increases. Difficulties in providing sewerage for building land had frequently given rise to criticism; and the proposalto ease loan sanctions for such work should be emphasised.Mention might also be made of measures to ensure that surplusbuilding land held by public authorities would be released as quickly as possible.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for the Environmentshould issue a strongly worded circular to local authorities with aview to increasing sales of council houses. No mention should bemade at this stage, however, of the possibility of legislation if the response to the circular proved to be unsatisfactory. It was important to establish a climate of opinion in which developerswould be encouraged to release their stocks of building land. this might be achieved if it were generally accepted that effective measures would be taken to ensure that a continuing supply of building land would be made available, with the result that the present rate of increase in land prices would not be maintained. The Cabinet agree the measures proposed by the Secretary of State for the Environmentfor increasing the supply of building land. In announcing these measures he should bear in mind the points which had been mentioned in discussion. Close attention should be paid to meansof increasing the supply of houses for sale.These various measures would be liable to create a new range of problems, particularly as regards the mobilisation of manpower and materials which would be required if the Government were tobe seen to be dealing effectively with the housing problem; and theHome and Social Affairs Committee should consider these issues asa matter of urgency on the basis of proposals circulated by theSecretary of State for the Environment. The Committee shouldalso review the number of appeals against refusal of planning permission which were still awaiting decision.
The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of Statefor the Environment to be guided accordingly.confidential. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry about the long-termreview of the British Steel Corporation (BSC) (CP (72) 42), to whichwas annexed the draft of a proposed Parliamentary statement.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that the review by a joint steering group of the long-term financial positionand development plans of the BSC had now been completed. Thework of this group had shown that the target productive capacityproposed in the bsc&apos;s development plan of February 1971, namely,43 million ingot tons by 1980, was excessive in relation to theprobable size of the market. This conclusion was supported by theresults of a study by independent consultants of the prospects forthe world market for steel. It was now recommended that theCorporation should aim at a productive capacity in 1980 within the range 28-36 million ingot tons. This recommendation allowed fora growth in the home market at 3 \ per cent a year up to 1980; andit also took account of the less favourable world demand for steel,which had caused steel industries in other countries similarly tomodify their development plans. The BSC still favoured the upperend of the capacity range as a basis for further planning. But the consultants inclined towards the lower end and had advised that, ifmaximum profitability were the only consideration, a capacity evenlower than the recommended range might be desirable. Theprospects of profitability within the range were not good; and thiswould present problems for us as a member of the european communities since, if the Corporation regularly incurred losses,other member countries might feel that this was tantamount to a subsidy.The BSC were now carrying out a detailed reassessment of their development plans in the light of the revised capacity range; andthis would not be completed until later in the year. But theconclusion of the present review would undoubtedly cause disappointment -pointment because the earlier BSC production target had givengrounds for hope that major new developments might be in prospect.On the other hand the position would have been even more difficultif the Government had accepted the previous BSC proposals in1971. The new capacity range did not represent a reduction in thepresent size of the industry. Investment was recommended at 200- 280 million a year throughout the remainder of the decade;and this was higher than the level of investment in any previousperiod.A draft Parliamentary statement, announcing the outcome ofthe review, was annexed to CP (72) 42.   This made it clear thatSteelIndustryBritish steel corporation:Long-TermReviewPreviousReference:CM (71) 21stConclusions,Minute 8
substantive decisions on the long-term prospects of the industryand the case for a major new development could not be taken until later in the year. It was not practicable, however, to delay makinga statement now. The decision to undertake the review had been announced in Parliament; there was considerable public interestin it; and the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries was nowstarting an investigation of the BSC. He therefore invited theCabinet to agree that the Minister for Industry should make astatement on the lines proposed at an early date.In discussion it was suggested that it was difficult to see whytotal British steel capacity should be restricted to a range of28-36 million ingot tons when Japanese productive capacity wouldhave increased by amounts of this order over five years. Thiscomparison indicated a weakness in our whole industrial structure.Moreover, the proposed statement would not appear consistent withthe Governments declared purpose of supporting economic expansion; and the assumed 3^ per cent rate of growth would be compared unfavourably with the rate of economic expansion whichthe Government in fact hoped to achieve over the next few years.The statement would be particularly disappointing to those parts ofthe country, such as Hunterston, which had been looking for major new steel developments; and it would also be criticised asbeing based on a pessimistic view of our competitive ability.On the other hand the growth of the Japanese steel indusrty was based on a sustained rate of economic growth substantially higher than our own; and its expansion over the next few years would be the result of investment decisions already taken. even so, the Japanese industry was already under-used and would continue to be so for a considerable time. Although its plant was more modern than our own, it had shown a loss in the past year.The excess capacity in Japan was putting severe pressure on worldsteel prices and, therefore, on the profitability of the steel industries of other countries, including our own; and it was also having a severe effect on the raw material and freight markets. The earlierBSC investment plans would have required very large amounts of additional public expenditure. There seemed no realistic likelihood-hood that the required capacity in the United Kingdom would exceed the upper end of the range now recommended; and the risks involved in installing excess capacity probably outweighed those of under-provision. In any public statement it would be important to stress that the revised capacity range did not imply a reduction inthe size of the industry but reflected a more accurate forecast ofthe likely rate at which requirements would grow. It would alsobe prudent to arrange for the Corporation^ development plans tobe re-examined each year in order that they might be kept in line with the latest estimates of demand.In further discussion, the following points were made (a) The comment in paragraph 7 of the draft statement that considerable progress was being made by the BSC towards greater efficiency might be over-optimistic, particularly having regard tothe difficulty which the Corporation were experiencing in finding
a new Board member for finance. The extent to which theCorporation constantly changed their forecasts of profits, investment and manpower requirements was disturbing. On the other handaccount should also be taken of the new arrangements which theywere introducing to improve forward planning and to institute amore efficient system for the control and monitoring of performance.(b) The Corporation had given assurances that the long-term programme would be ready by the summer. It might nevertheless be prudent to avoid too definite a commitment on that point in thestatement.(c) The statement should in any case be deferred until after theParliamentary debate in the following week on the Timetable motion for the European Communities Bill. But in order to anticipatefurther pressure it would be preferable to give a firm undertaking thatit would be made during the week immediately thereafter. Theannouncement by the BSC of the pattern of &quot; basing points &quot; whichthey proposed to adopt for steel prices after entry into the european communities would also need to be deferred until after the Timetabledebate, even though, since the BSC were already consulting steelusers, there was a risk that their intentions would become publiclyknown before then.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet was being asked to take a major decision about the futureproductive capacity of the BSC which would be liable, in the formproposed, to attract considerable public interest and criticism.Since the statement could not be made for a few days, the cabinet would wish further consideration to be given to the issues involved,in the light of which they could resume their discussion at a meetingduring the following week.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.CONFIDENTIALInternational 7.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of telephone Posts and Telecommunications (CP (72) 45) about a proposal by theExchange post Office, following international tendering, to import equipmentEquipment      for a new international telephone exchange.The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications said that thePost Office were anxious to meet criticisms of the inadequacy ofinternational telephone communications, particularly with thecountries of the European&apos; Economic Community, and had invitedinternational tenders for equipment for a new international exchange.They had received two tenders, one from L. M. Ericsson of Sweden,and one from Plessey, the only United Kingdom supplier of the equipment concerned. Plessey&apos;s tender had been  8 million higherthan Ericsson&apos;s and had also been subject to a cost-escalation
provision. In addition the Plessey equipment would entail higherrunning costs. The Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy had recognised the arguments in favour of accepting the British tender interms of the employment which it would provide; but they had feltthat these were outweighed by the commercial advantages of theSwedish tender. Plessey had subsequently agreed to reconsider theirtender. But their revised offer was still considerably higher thanEricsson&apos;s; and the other advantages of the Ericsson tender remained.The Post Office Board would not, therefore, readily be persuaded toprefer the Plessey tender or to accept public responsibility, without compensation for doing so. Rejection of the Ericsson tender wouldalso give rise to serious international difficulties, particularly inrelation to the European Free Trade Area (EFTA). Moreover,Plessey had probably exaggerated the employment advantages ofawarding the contract to a British manufacturer; and the Post office were in any event prepared to commit themselves to placinganother large order for international exchange equipment, worth 12- 13 million, with Plessey. It was undesirable that the Post office should be tied wholly to the single United Kingdom supplier of thiskind of equipment; and it would accordingly be in the interests of efficiency to allow them to place the present order with Ericsson&apos;s.In discussion, it was suggested that the orthodox principle that public purchases should be made in the cheapest market by opentender needed to be tempered by closer attention to the best use ofour national resources and to the needs of United Kingdom industry,especially at a time of high unemployment and under-used capacity.There were already signs that the coming phase of economic expansion would be liable to entail increased imports which would put the balance of payments under renewed strain. Instead ofcontemplating the award of a  15 million contract to a foreigncompany a British public corporation should have been concerned to seek an acceptable arrangement with their British suppliers bydiscussion and negotiation. Now that Plessey had agreed to reduce their tender the extra cost of awarding the contract to them insteadof to Ericsson appeared to be less than the cost of the unemploymentbenefit which would be involved if the work were done in Sweden.Nor was there reason for being unduly sensitive about the impact on Swedish opinion if the order were placed in this country; Swedenhad not hesitated to adopt gratuitously critical attitudes towardsother British domestic policies with which they had no direct concern.For the future it would be desirable for the public corporations andother major customers of British industry, if they had complaints about the performance of their supplier firms, to seek remedies otherthan the threat of placing orders abroad with consequent damage tothe British economy, even if this involved in some cases abandonment of open tendering in favour of negotiated contracts.On the other hand, since the contract in question had been opened to international tender, the Post Office must surely abide bythe results. The present was a particularly difficult time to act in contravention of EFTA agreements; and failure to award the contract to the winning Swedish tenderer could damage the wider prospects for our exports to Sweden. Ericsson&apos;s had promised to spend
45 per cent of the contract price in the United Kingdom, whereasPlessey&apos;s had now said that, if they were awarded the contract, someof the work would have to be sub-contracted to a subsidiaryenterprise in Brazil or Portugal. Plessey&apos;s behaviour in relation to.. the present order had been indefensible; and their previous record of performance on Post Office contracts was poor. It would be wrong to require the Post Office to forgo the lower price, the cheapermaintenance costs and the greater expectations of timely deliveryand reliability of the equipment which were offered by Ericsson&apos;s,especially since they were ready to negotiate a further contract withPlessey of a broadly similar value.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet reluctantly agreed that, for the reasons brought out in their discussion, the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications should not seek to dissuade the Post Office from accepting the tender byL. M. Ericsson. The Chancellor of the Exchequer should arrange,however, for further consideration to be given to means of avoidingsimilar embarrassment in relation to future public procurementcontracts; and where there was risk that important orders mightbe lost to British industry, it might be necessary to stipulate that public corporations should not invite tenders from foreign suppliers.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister of Posts and telecommunications-tions to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office27 April, 1972,
