secret parliamentary 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons in the following week.OverseaAffairsIcelandicFisheriesDisputePreviousReference:CM (72) 52ndConclusions,Minute 2SpainPreviousReference:CM (72) 38thConclusions,Minute  new Zealand/AustraliaUnitedNationsSECRET2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that themost recent Ministerial negotiations in Reykjavik about the Icelandicfisheries dispute had again ended in deadlock. He would have anopportunity to discuss the matter with the Icelandic ForeignMinister, Mr. Augustsson, at the forthcoming meeting of north atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) Ministers; but he did not expect to be able to make any further significant progress, since it seemed clear that Mr. Augustsson and the Icelandic PrimeMinister, Mr. Johannesson, were not prepared to make any further concessions to us unless they could be assured of the concurrence of the two Communist Ministers in the Icelandic Government. Wemust therefore face the probability that we might shortly need toprovide naval protection for our trawlers. For the present, however,the arrangement under which one frigate was on station just outsidethe 50-mile limit and another was within 36 hours&apos; steaming seemedadequate.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that at his recent meeting in Madrid with the Spanish Foreign Minister, SefiorLopez Bravo, he had been able to avoid any direct conflict of view on the question of Gibraltar; and it had been agreed that the subject should be deferred for a further period. It had also been agreedthat a personal representative of the Foreign Minister should meetthe Chief Minister of Gibraltar, Sir Joshua Hassan, for informal discussion of the issues involved.He had also been impressed by the greater interest which theSpanish Government were now showing in developing co-operationwith us in a number of fields, including defence, in marked contrast to their attitude at his last meeting with Senor Bravo six months before.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that it seemed likely that the Australian General Election would result, as theNew Zealand General Election had already done, in a labour government. In both countries Labour Administrations might be opposed to any overt discrimination in favour of the Old Common-wealth in our immigration policy.The Cabinet-V(1) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that as a resultof a Congressional decision on the relevant appropriation the UnitedStates had informed the United Nations that their contribution to
the Organisation must be reduced from 31 per cent to 25 per cent of the Organisation^ budget. As against the time when the matter would be put to the vote they had obtained the support of othermembers of NATO; and this placed us in an embarrassing position.Nevertheless, an important issue of principle was involved, sincecontributions to the United Nations were determined by &quot; capacity to pay&quot;, as measured broadly by Gross National Product; and onthis basis of calculation a United States contribution of 25 per centwas too low. There was therefore a good case for instructing theUnited Kingdom Delegation to abstain on the vote and, possibly,for proposing that the Secretary General of the United Nations,Dr. Waldheim, should organise a re-examination of the system of financing the United Nations before any final decision was taken.In discussion it was suggested that, in view of the growingpressure in the United States for some reduction in their contribu-tion to the cost of the defence of Western Europe, it might not bein our interest to abstain on a proposal which the United states administration judged would relieve them of part of a comparableburden. Our abstention in defence of principle would not have any practical effect on the issue in the United Nations, especially since our only supporters were likely to be Spain and Malta. More-over, a reduction in the United States contribution would not resultin any increase in our own contribution, since the forthcomingadmission to membership of the Federal Republic of Germany andthe German Democratic Republic should broadly offset the reduc-tion in the United States contribution. Nevertheless, the UnitedStates action could be regarded as having deprived us of theopportunity to press for a reduction in our own contribution whichwould have been open to us if the United Nations had been ableto look forward to the German contributions without any reductionin the degree of United States support.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, on balance, it seemed likely to be in our interest to vote in supportof the United States proposal. But we should suggest that theSecretary General should promote a review of the kind suggestedby the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary; and we might alsoexpress to the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Rogers, ourconcern about the manner in which the matter had been allowedto reach the point of virtual decision without adequate prior con-sultation between the United States Government and ourselves.The Cabinet-(2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary to take action accordingly.
confidential. The Cabinet considered the measures to be adopted in orderto ensure a more convincing presentation of Government policyin relation to Value Added Tax (VAT) both in the forthcoming debate on the Opposition Motion seeking postponement of theintroduction of VAT and in the country generally.In discussion the following main points were made (a) The forms which had been issued for completion byretailers in preparation for the introduction of the new tax wereunnecessarily complicated and would be liable to lead to confusion and misunderstanding. It was probably too late to reissue them on a more simple and intelligible basis; but the need for clarificationshould be borne in mind for the future.(b) There was at the moment considerable public scepticismthat price reductions would be made in all cases where the intro-duction of VAT should result in a reduction in the amount of taxpayable. It would be important to ensure, if necessary by theinstitution of special administrative arrangements for the purpose,that price reductions were in fact enforced in such cases; and this consideration would be particularly relevant in relation to those goods about which public opinion was especially sensitive, e.g.children&apos;s clothing, as distinct from other articles, e.g. jewellery and similar luxury goods, where considerations of social policy did notapply with equal force.(c) Urgent measures were needed to counteract an increasingground-swell of hostility to VAT. This was to a large extent causedby misunderstanding of the scope and purposes of the tax; but itwas also provoked to a lesser extent by deliberate misrepresentations-tion on the part of those who were opposed to the GovernmenfsEuropean policies in principle.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theChancellor of the Exchequer should consider whether any action could be taken in order to simplify the administration of VAT,particularly as regards the forms to be completed by retailers. Heshould also pursue the measures which he was already taking to enlist the support of responsible editors and journalists in orderto ensure the balanced presentation of the Governmenfs policy asregards the new tax. For this purpose he should consider, inconsultation with the Home Secretary, whether any further publicitymeasures were needed, including a Press campaign early in 1973,in order to improve public understanding of the detailed operationof VATIt was essential that, as had been agreed in the Governmenfsrecent discussion of counter-inflationary measures with the Con-federation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress, theeffect of VAT on prices should be the subject of close and continuingobservation in order to ensure that reductions in the amount of taxpayable were fully transferred to the public in the form of lower prices.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation with the
other Ministers principally concerned, should consider whether anyfurther action was required for this purpose.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the other Ministers principally concerned, toconsider the issues referred to in the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and to report theconclusions to the Prime Minister.Agricultural The Cabinet were informed that Orders deferring the imple-Wages mentation of the increases in minimum wages recently recommendedby the Agricultural Wages Boards for England and Wales and forScotland were shortly to be laid before Parliament. In view of thefact that the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board had seen fit, afterthe beginning of the &quot; freeze &quot; on wages, to make a further increasein the minimum wage which they had recently recommended inorder to bring minimum agricultural wages in Scotland to the same level as had just been recommended by the Board for England andWales, the Government^ attitude during the debate on the Orderswould need very careful consideration.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe action of the Scottish Board appeared at first sight to be indefensible; and the Secretary of State for Scotland should verifywhether the Board had in fact been in order in recommending anadditional increase after the &quot; freeze &quot; had begun. Even so, a strict application of the Governmenfs counter-inflationary policy wouldrequire that no assurance should now be given that this recom-mendation would be implemented at the end of the &quot; freeze &quot;, since it would clearly be prejudicial to the success of the government&apos;s policy if an isolated exception were permitted to a principle whichwas otherwise being firmly maintained. On the other hand theScottish National Farmers&apos; Union had recently agreed to issue ahelpful statement, urging farmers not to increase wages during the&quot;freeze&quot;; and it might be desirable, both in order to avoid prejudicing this initiative and for reasons of general policy, to refrain from pressing the issue to the point of decision at this juncture.   The relevant Order had been drafted on this basis.The Cabinet (3) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Ban on The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that in theLamb light of the public concern about rising meat prices he had examinedExports the possibility of holding the price of lamb at its present level,despite the increasing world demand for meat, the seasonal increasein domestic demand and the issue of licences by the french authorities for the import of lamb. The recent increases in theprice of lamb which amounted to some 20 per cent in the last
month-had been due largely to substantial sales of Britishproduction to the continent of Europe, particularly France; and,despite the fact that consumer resistance had led. to a temporaryfall in price in the last few days, the only way of halting the upward trend was to impose a ban on exports. Such a ban would probablybe needed until the beginning of the new lamb season next May,although it was not proposed that any specific period should be announced. A ban would not result in our imports of lamb from new Zealand being diverted to Europe, since New Zealand lambdid not have ready access to Continental markets. But it would be unpopular with British farmers and might lead to problems withthe European Economic Community (e.c.) after January 1973. Itshould be possible, however, to resolve these problems without undue difficulty since no sheep meat regulation had yet beenpromulgated by the Community. If the ban was agreed, it wouldbe desirable to announce it that day and arrange for it to comeinto effect early in the following week. The e.c. would need tobe notified of the announcement in advance.In discussion it was suggested that the recent rise in the priceof lamb and the lack of cheaper meat reinforced the need for theGovernment to be seen to be taking action to limit increases in food prices in the interests of the pay and prices standstill, particularlyin cases where they were able to exert some influence. the objective should be to encourage British farmers to produce morelamb in order that shortages might be reduced and the price mightbe stabilised. On the other hand, the Government had encouragedfarmers to expand production of lamb for export, citing particularly the opportunities provided by the e.c. market; and this had beena powerful factor in enlisting the support of the farming communityfor our membership of the Community. As a result our farmershad already had considerable success in building up a substantialexport trade to Europe; and a ban on exports at this juncture would represent a severe, and possibly permanent, setback to this initiative,the effects of which would be felt most sharply by those farmers,such as hill farmers, who were least able financially to withstandit. Moreover, confidence in the e.c. as an expanding British market would be shaken; and the Governmenfs supporters would not understand why the Government had themselves taken action whichmust inevitably have this effect. In the short term we could expectmerely to anticipate further price increases, not to secure an actualreduction; and there would inevitably have to be a substantial increase when the ban was lifted, perhaps at a time when seasonalprices were high and in any event at a difficult juncture in relationto the second stage of the counter-inflationary policy. We shouldalso verify that a ban of the kind envisaged, of which seven days&apos;notice would have to be given to the e.c., would not infringe anyCommunity regulations, since the worst outcome of all would be toimpose a ban and then to be forced by the Commission to rescind it.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that themajority of the Cabinet judged that the objections to a ban on theexport of lamb outweighed the advantages. The effect of risingfood prices during the standstill, however, was so important in the
context of the public attitude to the Governmenfs counter-inflationary policy that the matter might need to be consideredagain. In the meantime it was desirable to have more precise information about the effect which a ban on exports would have on the price of lamb; whether such a ban would be permissibleunder the Treaty of Rome; and, if so, what the attitude of the EECwould be likely to be.The Cabinet (4) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(5) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to circulate information about the effect on lamb prices ofa ban on exports.(6) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to arrangefor further consideration of the legal implications ofsuch a ban under the Treaty of Rome.(7) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to seek the advice of the United Kingdom Delegation to theEuropean Economic Community on the attitude of theCommunity to such a ban, on the assumption that itwas not contrary to our Treaty obligations.CONFIDENTIALPolicy on 4.   The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofEducation state for Education and Science (CP (72) 133) and by the Secretaryof State for Scotland (CP (72) 136), to which were attached draft white Papers on Educational Policy in England and Wales andin Scotland.The Secretary of State for Education and Science said that proposals for future strategy for education, based on threeProgramme Analysis and Review Reports prepared by the Educa-tion Departments, had recently been submitted to, and approvedby, the Home and Social Affairs Committee. White Papers setting out the Governmenfs proposals had subsequently been drafted andwere now before the Cabinet for their agreement. Broadly speak-ing, the drafts proposed a 10-year strategy, the principal features ofwhich were (a) A major expansion of nursery education.    ,(b) A programme for improving or replacing obsolete second-dary schools.(c) An increase in the building programme for special schools for handicapped children.(d) The continued improvement in the staffing ratio in schools,although at a reduced rate.(e) Improved arrangements for the training of probationaryteachers and the in-service training of qualified teachers.
(/) The continued expansion of higher education, although at a rather lower rate.This constituted a balanced programme for continued expan-sion. The implications in terms of expenditure corresponded to the relevant sums for the education programme which would be includedin the White Paper on Public Expenditure due to be publishedtowards the middle of December. For later years the programme was described in sufficiently flexible terms to avoid entailing a precise financial commitment. It was proposed that both reports should be published on 6 December.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the strategyproposed in the Scottish White Paper was broadly the same as for england and Wales, although there were certain significant varia-tions. These arose partly from the differences in the educationalsystems of the two countries and partly from the fact that theCommittee of Enquiry into Teacher Education and Training (theJames Committee) had not been concerned with Scotland.In discussion, the proposals in the draft White Papers were generally welcomed. It was suggested that there might be some criticism of the proposed reduction in the rate of expansion of higher education; but the Cabinet were assured that the universitiesthemselves were not likely to find the proposals unpalatable so faras student numbers were concerned, although they might be lesssatisfied as regards the implied restraints on unit costs. It mustbe accepted that the employment expectations of individuals enter-ing higher education would have to be revised, since there were unlikely to be sufficient jobs in future at the level at present regardedas appropriate for graduates. Even so, the Government would need,in presenting the proposals to the public, to emphasise that, despite the adjustment of the education programme now envisaged, theexpansion of higher education would continue; and, more generally,the positive aspects of the Governmenfs policy should be stressedthroughout the White Paper. In particular it should be made clearthat the proposed major expansion in nursery education was notbeing achieved by abandoning expansion in any other direction.Appropriate arrangements, including Ministerial speeches andbroadcasts in the regions, should be made in order to secure themaximum presentational impact for a major development of the government&apos;s social policies.In further discussion the following main points were made (a) It was agreed that the title for the White Paper for Englandand Wales should be &quot; Education: A Framework for Expansion &quot;.(b) It should be made clear in both White Papers that theywere concerned primarily with the allocation of resources and with questions of organisation, not with the content of education. Other-wise it might be suggested that the Government were evading issues for example, unruly behaviour in schools and the persistence of semi-illiteracy about which there was considerable public concern.(c) The wording of the paragraphs in the White Paper for england and Wales dealing with play groups might usefully be
further reviewed in consultation with the Department of health and Social Security.(d) It was suggested that the differences in emphasis betweenthe two White Papers on certain issues might result in misunder-standing and, possibly, political embarrassment. The Cabinet were assured, however, that these differences were defensible by referenceto the respective educational systems of the two countries and shouldnot give rise to significant criticism.(e) It was agreed that, pending a definite decision on thepossibility of relating tuition fees more closely to economic costs and introducing a loan element into the support system for post-graduate students, it would be preferable to omit all reference tothese topics.The Prime Minister,summing up the discussion, said that,subject to the drafting points which had been raised in discussion,the Cabinet agreed that the two White Papers should be published on 6 December. They represented a major policy initiative by theGovernment and should be presented as such. Their positiveaspects should be stressed; and it should be made clear, in particular,that the proposed major expansion in nursery education would be accompanied by a continuance of the expansion of higher education and of the programmes for upgrading or replacing obsolete schools and for improving the numbers and training of teachers. In viewof the importance of the Governmenfs proposals, it might be desir-able for debates to take place in one or both Houses of Parliamentwhen time permitted.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretaries of State for Education and science and for Scotland, subject to consideration of the draftingpoints mentioned in discussion, to arrange for the white papers to be published on 6 December.(3) Invited the Secretaries of State for Education and science and for Scotland, the Home Secretary and the lord president: of the Council to consider the arrangementsfor ensuring that the White Papers received maximumpublicity.(4) Invited the Lord President of the Council and the lord privy Seal to consider whether arrangements should bemade for debates in one or both Houses of parliament in due course.
parliamentary questions onthe Activitiesof theInstitutionsof theEuropeanCommunitiesSECRET5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (CP (72) 131) to which was annexed a noteby an interdepartmental working group of officials discussing thetreatment of Parliamentary Questions about the European economic community after the United Kingdom became a member of theCommunity on 1 January 1973.The Lord President of the Council said that the working group had recommended that Ministers should answer Questions aboutdecisions taken, or under consideration, by the Council of ministers and all its subordinate bodies and, in particular, about the attitude adopted in the Council and its subordinate Committees by UnitedKingdom Ministers and officials; that they should answer questions about the attitude adopted by their officials in theManagement and Regulation Committees on which member governments were officially represented; and that they should beprepared to reply to Questions which merely sought information on the activities of Community institutions for which there was no direct Ministerial responsibility. Questions should be answered bythe Minister with policy responsibility for the particular subjectraised in the Question. Those which were of a general nature,however, should be answered by the Foreign and commonwealth secretary or, as now occurred in practice in appropriate cases,by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, without being formallytransferred.The Ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedure had agreed that Departments should follow these proposed guidelines,which should not be made public at this stage. Whether a reply should be refused in certain cases would depend upon the substanceand terms of the Question; but in practice Ministers would prob-ably be able to frame their Answers in a way which did not amountto an outright refusal to reply. When Ministers had had some experience of Questions on Community matters it should be possibleto reach a clearer view about their appropriate treatment, particu-larly as regards those relating to actions of the Council of ministers which had been taken against the views of United kingdom ministers or seeking information on matters not strictly within thearea of Ministerial responsibility.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the proposed guidelines should be observed by Departments but should not be made known publicly. It wouldbe necessary, however, for Ministers to ensure that they were notdrawn by irresponsible Questions from Members who were opposedto British membership of the Community into premature disclosure of the proposals which we intended to put forward, or the attitudeswhich we had it in mind to adopt, in negotiations within theCommunity. It would be preferable initially to adopt a restrictiveapproach to Questions on Community matters than to commit our-selves to a more generous practice in answering Questions which
experience might lead us to regret when it was too late. The lord president of the Council should inform the Speaker in confidence of the Governmenfs policy on these issues.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of the discussion.(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council to inform the speaker in confidence of the Governmenfs proposedapproach to Parliamentary Questions on European Com-munity matters.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Lord President of the Council, toarrange for Departments to be informed of the guidelineswhich should be observed in dealing with such Questions.Report ofthe SelectCommittee onParliamentaryQuestionsPreviousReference:CM (72) 28thConclusions,Minute 1SECRET6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (CP (72) 127) about the Report of the SelectCommittee on Parliamentary Questions.The Lord President of the Council said that the SelectCommittee had been established following a report in the Sunday times that civil servants in the Department of the Environmenthad prepared a &quot; bank&quot; of draft Parliamentary Questions on housing matters, with a view to their being tabled by government supporters for oral answer when the Secretary of State for the environment was first in the Questions list. The then Secretaryof State had made a statement to the House of Commons about these allegations on 13 December 1971. The Select Committeehad been given wide terms of reference in order that considerationof the &quot; Question bank&quot; issue might take place within the widercontext of a review of Question Time procedure generally. Themost important conclusion of the Select Committee, whose report had now been considered by the Ministerial Committee on Parlia-mentary Procedure, was that it was not the role of civil servants to seek to redress the Party balance of Questions on the order paper and that civil servants should not be asked to prepareQuestions which had that object. While this conclusion was not entirely satisfactory from the Governmenfs point of view, the ministerial Committee recommended that it should be accepted,mainly because nothing less would have ensured the agreement ofthe majority of the Select Committee. It was the most favourableconclusion which was likely to be generally acceptable to the Houseof Commons; and to reject it might revive controversy about anincident in which there was now little interest. It was one element in a number of proposals which had the objective of arresting therecent decline in the quality and value of Question Time; and itcould be presented in that light. The Ministerial Committee were satisfied that the limitation on the assistance given to Ministers by
civil servants which was implicit in this decision need not lead toany further restriction on the unqualified service which they ren-dered to the Government of the day; indeed, the Select Committeethemselves had specifically distinguished between the preparationof a &quot; bank &quot; of Questions for use as a means of redressing theParty balance of Questions and the proper use of &quot; inspired&quot;Questions designed to enable Ministers to deal adequately with matters of current interest and concern. It might still be necessary,however, for the Government to re-emphasise that the traditionalpolitical neutrality of civil servants did not connote impartiality asbetween the Government in office and the Opposition and that itwas proper for civil servants to place themselves freely at thedisposal of the Government except where to do so could be shown to be improper by reference to clear rules or precedents. in accepting the Select Committee&apos;s conclusion the Government wouldnot be admitting that the action taken in the particular case whichhad been the occasion of their inquiry had been improper; and support for that contention could be found in the Select Committee&apos;sReport.As regards the remainder of the Report, the Ministerial Com-mittee recommended acceptance of the proposed experiment in the rationing of oral Questions and the introduction of a system of&quot; priority &quot; written Questions. They were not, however, in favourof the proposed extension of the Prime Ministers Question time on Tuesdays or of the introduction of a new Friday Question Time.The remainder of the recommendations were of a minor nature;and the Ministerial Committee&apos;s conclusions about them were setout in the Annex to CP (72) 127.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the balance of advantage lay in acceptingthat civil servants should not in future be asked to prepare Parlia-mentary Questions with the objective of redressing the Party balanceof Questions. This would be in no sense an admission of pastimpropriety; nor should it imply any further restriction on theassistance given to Ministers by civil servants. He would arrangefor appropriate guidance on this matter to be included in thestandard document on &quot;Questions of Procedure for Ministers&quot;.The Cabinet approved the other proposals in CP (72) 127.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion. /(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council to announce inthe House of Commons at the earliest opportunity theviews which had been reached by the Government onthe Report of the Select Committee on parliamentary questions.
Defaults onthe housing finance ActsPreviousReference:CM (72) 52ndConclusions,Minute 3CONFIDENTIAL7. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState for the Environment (CP (72) 132), the Secretary of State forScotland (CP (72) 134) and the Secretary of State for Wales(CP (72) 130) about the action to be taken against local authorities who were failing to implement the provisions of the Housing FinanceActs.The Secretary of State for the Environment said that in Englandthree defaulting local authorities remained. He had made a defaultOrder against Clay Cross Urban District; and an extraordinaryaudit of their housing accounts was in progress. They were unlikely to respond to the Order; and the audit might therefore result inthe imposition of a surcharge of over  500 on the non-implementingmembers of the Council and, possibly, in their eventual disqualifica-tion. The London Borough of Camden, who had refused to assessfair rents for their dwellings, had been informed that a default Orderagainst them was being considered. If they failed to respond, he proposed to make the default Order and, if necessary, to follow it up by a direction for an extraordinary audit. The withholding of housing subsidy might also be considered. A default Order hadbeen made against the third recalcitrant local authority, ConisbroughUrban District; and it was hoped that they might comply with it.If they did not do so, however, he proposed to issue a direction foran extraordinary audit.The Secretary of State for Wales said that he had made defaultOrders against Merthyr Tydfil County Borough and Bedwas andMachen Urban District, who were the only Welsh authorities stillrefusing to implement the Act. It seemed unlikely that either ofthem would comply with the Order. If they did not do so, he proposed on 8 December to appoint Housing Commissioners todischarge certain of the housing functions of the two authoritiesand to hold a Press conference in Cardiff on that date in order toexplain the reasons for this action.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that 20 Scottish localauthorities continued to refuse to implement the Act. Localenquiries had been held in relation to four of these, includingGlasgow, and had now reported that they were in default. he proposed to issue default Orders against these four authorities. Ifthey failed to comply, two courses of action were open to him, themore advantageous of which was that he should, assume responsi-bility for certain of their housing functions. Arrangements werebeing made for further local enquiries to be held in relation to theother local authorities concerned.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that action on the lines proposed in the memoranda by the Housing Ministers should be taken against thoselocal authorities who were still refusing to implement the provisionsof the Housing Finance legislation.  It would no doubt be argued
in some quarters that such action to enforce rent increases was inconsistent with the Governmenfs counter-inflationary policies; butfairness demanded that the few recalcitrant authorities should comeinto line with the great majority who were already charging fairrents to their tenants. In view of the sensitive political issues involved, however, the Cabinet should be promptly informed of anysubstantial further developments; and they should be consulted inparticular about any action which was likely to involve the surchargeor disqualification of local councillors.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office,1 December, 1972.
