The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons in the week following the Whitsun Recess.The Cabinet gave further consideration to the subject ofParliamentary Questions.*The Lord President of the Council said that the SelectCommittee on Parliamentary Questions were likely to include intheir report a recommendation that it was not the role of theGovernment machine to seek to redress the Party balance ofquestioning and that civil servants should not be asked to prepareQuestions which had this object. The Committee might also express the view that, if a system of Written Statements were introduced to replace &quot; inspired&quot; Questions, civil servants should no longer be asked to prepare Questions for Members at all. While such a conclusion would not be entirely satisfactory from the Governmenfspoint of view, it would perhaps represent an acceptable compromise.He had only recently become the Committee&apos;s Chairman and itwould not be easy for him to try to amend the agreement on thismatter which had earlier been reached within the Committee.Indeed, to do so would risk reopening the whole issue to the disadvantage of the Government.In discussion it was suggested that an important point ofprinciple was involved, the implications of which the committee did not appear to have appreciated. The Head of the Civil Service, inhis evidence, had made it clear that the traditional political neutrality of civil servants did not connote impartiality as between theGovernment of the day and the Opposition. It was not for theSelect Committee to purport to prescribe the scope of activity by civil servants which might be regarded as proper in this context.Moreover, it was important not to accept any restriction on thefunctions of civil servants which might provoke further pressurethat they should not be freely at the disposal of the Government forother Parliamentary purposes, such as the provision of assistancewith certain Private Members&apos; Bills. The statement made by theSecretary of State for the Environment on 13 December, 1971, hadbeen based on the advice that the Government were entitled to expect the public service to give unreserved assistance to ministers in the prosecution of the Governmenfs policies; and it would be unfortunate if the propriety of the practice as regards parliamentary questions which had been defended by the Government at thattime were now to appear to be called in question, as it would balfour the Committee expressed the views which they were thought tohave in mind. /In further discussion it was suggested that it would also be undesirable for the Committee to suggest that, if a system of WrittenStatements were introduced, civil servants should no longer be askedto prepare Questions for Members at all. There would continueto be occasions upon which Ministers wished to inspire a question on a matter which was not appropriate to a Statement; and there
would be no impropriety if civil servants continued to assist them on such a matter. The preparation of a &quot; bank &quot; of Questions hadbeen of very limited extent; and it would be helpful if this could bemade clear in the Committee&apos;s Report.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, eventhough the Government need not accept the recommendation madeby the Committee, it would be desirable if some modification of their probable findings could be arranged in order to take account of thepoints made in the discussion. .....The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion, and invited the Lord President of theCouncil to be guided accordingly.OverseaAffairsRhodesiaPreviousReference:CM (72) 27thConclusionsSECRET2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that reports received from Her Majesty&apos;s Diplomatic Missions indicated thatfirst reactions to the publication of the Pearce Report and to theParliamentary Statement which he had made on 23 May, were onthe whole reasonable and showed a welcome understanding of our attitude. As we had foreseen, Mr. Ian Smith, the Rhodesian leader,was maintaining that the Pearce Commission had totally misjudgedthe situation. In general, however, criticism had centred mainlyupon the question of sanctions; and there were likely to be increasingpressures for their stricter application. In reply it would be reasonable to point out that we had been scrupulous in taking theaction required of us by the United Nations; and that, if the record of others was less satisfactory in this respect, it was open to theUnited Nations to urge them to comply more strictly with the relevant Resolutions. In Rhodesia itself the situation appeared sofar to be calm.Vietnam The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the SouthPrevious        Vietnamese  Army  had  started  to  counter-attack  the  NorthReference:      Vietnamese and, although still under some pressure from NorthCM (72) 26th  Vietnamese forces in the southern part of the territory, had had a conclusions,    measure of success.  This should have been helpful to the PresidentMinute 3       0f tne United States, Mr. Nixon, in his discussions in Moscow withthe Soviet leaders. No movement of ships in and out of the north vietnamese ports which had been mined by the United States forces had been detected; and it was reported that the Chinese Governmenthad refused permission for Soviet vessels containing supplies for north Vietnam to use Chinese ports instead.Iceland The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that ourrelations with the Government of Iceland were developing in such away that there was a risk that we should find ourselves in a situation
UNCTADPreviousReference:CM (72) 23rdConclusions,Minute 2The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the ThirdUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development had nowcompleted its meeting at Santiago. The results were not verysignificant; and it was unfortunate that it had been necessary for us,in the legitimate interests of the developed countries, to resist firmlya number of proposals for action for which the developing countries were pressing. The intervention during the Conference by theMinister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, LadyTweedsmuir, had helped to correct the rather negative impression of our contribution to the Conference which had earlier been current.The Cabinet-Took  note  of  the  statementsCommonwealth Secretary.by  the  Foreign  andSECRETNorthern 3.   The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland informed the Ireland Cabinet that, although the operational significance of the barricadesPrevious erected by Protestant extremists in Belfast during the previous reference: week-end had been exaggerated, the Army had had to employ aCM (72) 26th judicious mixture of force and negotiation in order to ensure that conclusions, they were dismantled. The incident had reinforced the fears of minute 5 moderate Protestants that a violent Protestant reaction could not much longer be contained; at the same time it had encouraged certainsimilar to that of the fisheries dispute in 1962. A complicatingfactor, resulting from the fact that the Icelandic Government was a coalition of very different Parties, was that, although the ForeignMinister, Mr. Agustsson, was well disposed towards us, the FisheriesMinister, Mr. Joseffson, a Communist, was determined to oppose the interests of the Western Powers and in particular to work forthe removal of the United States base at Keflavik. It was therefore important that we should do everything possible to support theendeavours of the former, while frustrating those of the latter. the icelandic Ministers now in London had brought proposals for interim arrangements for our fishing following their unilateralproclamation of a 50 mile extent of their territorial waters, whichwould take effect on 1 September next and against which we hadlodged an appeal with the International Court of Justice. To acceptthe present proposals would be to impose an intolerable restraint onour catches off Iceland; and we should therefore reject them, whileindicating to the Icelandic Government that we remained ready to try to negotiate some form of compromise. There were grounds forthinking that it might be possible to make a tolerable agreement;but, if we failed to do so, we should be obliged to consider what measures of protection for our trawlers in waters claimed by Icelandit would be possible to provide. Together with the Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food, he would shortly submit to theCabinet proposals for dealing with these problems.
less responsible elements, including some Ministers of the formerNorthern Ireland Government to hope that the threat of this reactioncould be used as a political weapon.  It was expected that furtherbarricades would be erected by the Protestant faction during thecoming week-end. Provided that these were clearly temporary and did not cause serious obstruction to traffic in major thoroughfares,the security forces would act with discretion and would seek to secure their removal with the minimum use of force. The Protestant rallyplanned to be held in Londonderry on Saturday, 3 June, was viewedwith greater enthusiasm by the local Unionist leaders in that citythan by the Ulster Vanguard leader, Mr. Craig, who seemed to regard as an embarrassing political necessity the prominent part which he was due to play in the demonstration.   It might prove necessary to prohibit the rally from crossing to the west bank of theRiver Foyle.   In the Roman Catholic community, emotions hadbeen aroused by the accidental shooting by the Army of a youthin Londonderry; but the far greater revulsion caused by twomurders by the Irish Republican Army (IRA), one of a soldier, theother of a civilian, had led to a number of significant moves on thepart of those within the Roman Catholic community who sincerelydesired an end to violence.   The visit which five women fromLondonderry had paid to him on the previous day could be expectedto improve the atmosphere, although it would be unwise to encouragepremature hopes of rapid progress.  The women from Londonderryhad told him that they had asked the IRA to desist from violence and had assured him that, if the military presence was withdrawnfrom the Bogside and Creggan areas, the &quot; Provisional&quot; wing ofthe IRA would lay down their arms in those areas within 24 hours.He had replied that he must have tangible evidence of the good faithof the &quot; Provisional&quot; wing but that, if they were to lay down their arms, he would within 24 hours authorise the withdrawal of themilitary posts in the two areas. The women had not disputed thatit was reasonable for the Army to return fire against any person whofired at them; subject to this proviso, however, he had agreed withthe General Officer Commanding, Northern Ireland, that thesecurity forces would play as inconspicuous a role as possible in londonderry until the results of his meeting with the women couldbe further assessed.   These developments appeared to offer a prospect of some improvement in the tense situation within theProvince; but the IRA remained liable at any moment to intensifytheir campaign of terrorism in the hope of provoking a violentProtestant reaction.He would frame his statement in the House of Commons that afternoon in as restrained terms as possible; and he would seek to gain the maximum of advantage from his announcement of theformation of an Advisory Commission of seven Protestants and four Roman Catholics, all of whom were prominent and responsiblemembers of the community.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for northern Ireland.
secret. The Minister for Transport Industries said that the result ofthe railwaymen&apos;s ballot was likely to be declared on 30, or possibly31 May. He had had a preliminary discussion with the chairman and Deputy Chairman of the British Railways Board (BRB) aboutthe likely outcome and the manner in which the Board might reactto it. They believed that railwaymen would vote in support of theirunion leaders rather than on the merits of the pay offer and that theunion&apos;s campaign had hardened railwaymen&apos;s attitudes. Thesensitivity currently being shown by railwaymen in ordinary work-ing relationships was further evidence of this. The Board did notthink that a low poll or a small majority for resuming industrial action would significantly affect the union&apos;s decision; and they expected that, unless they took steps to re-open negotiationsimmediately after the declaration of the ballot, they would facerenewed industrial action, perhaps in the form of one-day strikes ora ban on weekend working. In the interests of good discipline, therailway management would then be obliged to send home those menwho refused to work properly; and the BRB recognised that this might provoke a full strike. Their main anxiety about facing furtherindustrial action was the risk of permanently losing freight traffic.In these circumstances they were disposed to think that they should seek at an early stage to renew contact with the unions and should beready to make some concession on the effective date for implement-ing the new rates of pay. Initially, they might propose advancingthe date by one week (although they might ultimately be preparedto go further) and seek, in return, union agreement to improveworking practices which would have an equivalent cash value. Hehad warned the BRB that Ministers would not readily be persuadedthat they should make further concessions which appeared to be designed to save the face of the rail unions. He had also discussed with them the suggestion that the BRB might implement unilaterallyfrom 1 June the new rates of pay; and, while they saw no objection in principle to this course, they had said that there might be someadministrative difficulty in paying the new rates to signalmen inview of the proposals, separate from the pay negotiations, to reorganise their grading structure. This difficulty could perhaps be overcome by paying the money in their case into a suspenseaccount, pending final allocation of signalmen to their new grades.In discussion, the following main points were made (a) If the BRB made any early move after an adverse ballot tore-open negotiations with the unions, they were likely to be ledultimately to concede the full claim. This would be repugnant tothe Governments supporters and, probably, to the general public,especially since it was not certain that any attempt to reinstituteindustrial action would prove wholly successful.(b) A majority vote of those concerned in a pay claim in favourof pressing it by industrial action did not itself demonstrate that itwas right to concede the claim, any more than did industrial action without a ballot; and any tendency by Press commentators to arguethe contrary should be countered accordingly.
(c) There might be merit in the BRB&apos;s paying the new ratesfrom 1 June irrespective of the outcome of the ballot; and, despite the particular difficulty of establishing the appropriate rates forregraded signalmen, this should be practicable. On the other hand,immediate payment of the increased rates would largely offset the railwaymen&apos;s loss of earnings from any reimposition of the ban onovertime; and it might therefore be better not to implement new rates while the threat of renewed industrial action remained.(d) It was not clear why, in response to resumed industrial actionof a limited kind which might be no more than a general incon-venience, the BRB should be contemplating disciplinary action on a scale likely to provoke a full strike and widespread disruption; andthey might be better advised to act more cautiously.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the tactics to be adopted when the outcome of the ballot was knowncould not be decided in advance. Nevertheless, the Minister for transport Industries should make it clear to the BRB that ministers would not wish them to make any move to re-open negotiations withthe rail unions following the declaration of the result of the poll untilMinisters had had an opportunity to consider the position. Ameeting of the group of Ministers most closely concerned, under his chairmanship, would probably need to be arranged for thispurpose in the middle of the following week.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Minister for Trans-port Industries to be guided accordingly.industrial action in theDocksPreviousReference:CM (72) 26thConclusions,Minute 6The Secretary of State for Employment said that discussions with the port employers earlier that morning had made it clear thatit was not now very likely that a strike in the docks could be avoided.At the meeting of the National Joint Council (NJC) for the PortTransport Industry on the previous afternoon the Chairman of theNational Association of Port Employers had put forward proposalsdrawn up by the Chairman of the three major port authorities fora Joint Committee of the two sides of the industry to examine theproblems of the industry. The Committee would give particular attention to the extension of the loading and unloading of containersin port areas by dock labour; the provision of additional ware-housing, cold storage and distribution points within port areas; thepossible reduction if not elimination of the Temporarily UnattachedRegister (TUR); and co-ordinated assessment by port authorities of the labour requirements within their areas. While the objectivewould be to seek a long-term solution, the Committee, which wouldbe jointly chaired by the Chairman of the Port of London Authority,Lord Aldington, and the General Secretary of the Transport andGeneral Workers&apos; Union (TGWU), Mr. Jack Jones, would seek toproduce an interim report within six weeks. The employers had assured the union that they would use their best endeavours to secure
opportunities for new jobs for redundant dock workers with com-panies associated with the port employers and shipowners; and theyhad offered a substantial but so far unspecified increase in fall-backpay, to take the form of a &quot; terminal notice &quot; payment for men onthe TUR who elected to leave the industry after three months. Theyhad also offered staged increases in leave, on a scale which would ensure that by 1974 the TGWU&apos;s claim for an extra week&apos;s holidaywould be met. They had not, however, increased their present offer of  22 fall-back pay, which took account of the increase in the costof living; nor had they proposed that the Joint Committee shouldstudy voluntary severance, including the possibility of contributions to finance it. The TGWU representatives had agreed to considerthe employers&apos; proposals; and the meeting had been adjourned untilthe following Tuesday afternoon. But the union had been unwilling to reconvene their Delegate Conference on the basis of the proposalsso far put forward. Mr. Jones appeared to accept that the employers&apos;offer constituted a major improvement and a genuine attempt to dealwith the problems in the docks. But it seemed unlikely that evenif he wished to avoid strike action, he would be able to do so in the face of militant action within the TGWU at local level, which wouldexacerbate the conflict between the dock and the road haulage mem-bers of the union, and of the problems arising from the TGWU&apos;srelationships with the National Amalgamated Stevedores and DockersUnion. It was also arguable that strike action might be not un-welcome to Mr. Jones, since it would help to solve his problems in securing compliance with the Orders made by the Industrial Courtagainst those TGWU members engaged in &quot; blacking &quot; containers.The union might, however, postpone strike action for a few dayswith the object of first extracting further concessions from theemployers and, perhaps, from the Government.In discussion the following main points were made (a) It was unfortunate that the employers in the dock industry were among the weakest and most badly organised groups of management. They had the tradition of mishandling their industrial relations, as exemplified in the present case by the action of Southern, Stevedores Limited, who had in fact offered their redundantemployees generous terms, while creating the impression of treatingthem harshly.(b) Attention should be given urgently to the public relationsaspect of the docks dispute. The public were inadequately informed of the likelihood of, and the reasons for, a strike; and there wasa risk that a dock strike would be adduced in the campaign to demonstrate that the Industrial Relations Apt had led to more, ratherthan less, industrial action. The TGWU were now concentrating on securing a high rate of fall-back pay and a solution to the con-tainer handling problem; it would be important to emphasise theunreasonableness of the claim that fall-back pay should be equivalentto average earnings, which were around  40 a week. In addition,there would be advantage in the Secretary of State for Employmentsmaking a Parliamentary statement describing the situation in thedispute, on the following day.
(c) Although a dock strike might appear to provide a suitablebasis for an application by the Government to the Industrial court for a &quot; cooling-off&quot; Order, there were several objections to thiscourse. In particular, such an Order might be flouted: the TGWUhad been unable to secure the compliance of their members with theOrders which the Court had already made in relation to the &quot; black-ing &quot; of containers.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwould be necessary to give further consideration to the role whichthe Government might play in the docks dispute when the outcome of the resumed meeting of the NJC was known. In the meantime the Secretary of State for Employment, in consultation with the lord president, should make a statement on the dispute in the House ofCommons on the following day.The Cabinet (2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of Statefor Employment to be guided accordingly.PrescriptionChargesPreviousReference:CM (71) 53rdConclusions,Minute 5CONFIDENTIAL5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Social Services and the Secretary of State for Wales(CP (72) 56) on prescription charges.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that in 1970 theGovernment had announced in the White Paper &quot; New Policies for public Spending &quot; (Cmnd. 4515) that prescription charges should be related more closely to a proportion of the cost of the individualprescription. In 1971 they had decided to abandon the proposal tointroduce a system of graduated charges. The announcement, how-ever, had been so framed as not to exclude the possibility of a futurechange in the system by which the level of the flat-rate charge was settled. He had been invited to bring the matter before the cabinet again in the spring of 1972. The two questions which must now beconsidered were (a) Whether prescription charges should be increased in thenear future under existing powers; and, if so, by how much and winter what point.(b) Whether the Government should introduce new legislation which would enable the Secretary of State to/ establish a fixedrelationship between the flat-rate prescription charge and the average cost of a prescription and to make consequential alterations in thecharge annually by administrative action. By this means the policy announced in Cmnd. 4515 would be put into effect, at least partially.The existing charge of 20p per item had been introduced on1 April, 1971. It could be increased by Regulations, which wouldbe subject to the Negative Resolution procedure. If an increasewere to be made but were to be kept in line with the Confederation
of British Industries&apos; price initiative and thus not exceed 5 per cent ayear, a new charge of 22p might be introduced from 1 October, 1972.The yield would be small about  2  million in a full year; andthe increase would arouse a great deal of political controversy.The purpose of establishing a fixed relationship between thefiat-rate prescription charge and the average cost of a prescriptionwould be to secure greater buoyancy in the yield of prescription charges; and the relatively small annual adjustments which wouldbe necessary should cause less political and presentational difficultythan larger increases made at longer intervals and based on no clearrationale. The legislation needed for this purpose could also includeother new powers to vary the amounts and methods of assessment of charges to patients; the categories of individuals entitled to exemp-tion or refunds; and the description of those appliances for whichcharges were not to be made. These new powers could be used to implement the intention, announced in Cmnd. 4515, to reduce theage of exemption from dental treatment charges from 21 to 18 andalso to make desirable adjustments in optical charges. Theseproposals would be unpopular and politically controversial. On theother hand the new powers were all likely to be needed at sometime or other; and it would be useful to establish the principle of a fixed relationship between the prescription charge and the average cost of a chargeable prescription. There would not be time for thenecessary legislation in the present Session; and, since there would clearly be difficulties in introducing it in the 1972-73 Session, neitherhe nor the Secretary of State for Wales wished to press for a Bill inthat Session. The Bill reorganising the administrative structure ofthe National Health Service in England and Wales would come before Parliament during that Session. But Royal Assent would berequired by Easter, 1973; and the controversy which would bearoused if the additional charging provisions were included would seriously delay its passage.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that it would be impolitic to increase the prescription-tion charge on 1 October and that no convenient opportunity tointroduce legislation to provide the powers needed to make the other changes could at present be foreseen.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Secretaryof State for Social Services and the Secretary of State for wales to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office,26 May, 1972.
