confidential the Queen 1.   The Prime Minister conveyed to the Cabinet The Queen&apos;swarm appreciation of the gift which they had presented to her incommemoration of her Silver Wedding.confidential parliamentary 2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons in the following week.In the course of a brief discussion of the progress of the Counter-Inflation (Temporary Provisions) Bill the Cabinet were reminded that it was essential that all stages of this measure should be com-pleted by 1 December.It was agreed that maximum publicity must be secured for the government&apos;s counter-inflationary policies in the immediate future.In the context of prices it would be particularly important to emphasised-sise that, while food prices must necessarily be partially exempt fromthe operation of the Bill, the Government were doing all they could to stabilise the prices of essential foodstuffs and that excessiveincreases in food prices would be subject, no less than other excessiveprice increases, to the Bill&apos;s corrective provisions.The Cabinet considered the tactics to be adopted during the debate on the Opposition Motion about the children who had beenborn with severe physical deformities as a result of the administrationof the drug thalidomide to their mothers during pregnancy. It wasnoted that it would be necessary for certain Ministers to declare a personal interest in the matter by virtue of membership of Lloydssyndicates which might be involved in underwriting the risksconcerned.The legal proceedings occasioned by the claims for compensationhad already been very lengthy and might be further prolonged. TheGovernment, however, could not intervene while the case was subjudice or press the Distillers Company, who had marketed the drug,to seek to ensure a settlement agreeable to all the parents by offering a larger amount of compensation. Nevertheless, the delay in thepayment of compensation the reasons for which had been grosslymisrepresented in the Press was provoking a strong emotionalreaction on the part of the public and of many Opposition members and was a source of increasing embarrassment to the Government.A final settlement of the claims, however, was being frustrated only by the continued opposition of a small minority of the parents; andthere were now indications that the Company, who had hithertorefused to deal with the parents otherwise than comprehensively,might be willing tov reach a separate settlement with those parentswho had agreed to the proposals which had been put forward.There was pressure, at the same time, for the Government toestablish a fund for the benefit of the children irrespective of a settle-ment of the claims. This would impose a very heavy additional burden on the Exchequer; and in any event it was arguable that thePrices andIncomesPolicyPreviousReference:CM (72) 51stConclusions,Minute 1OppositionMotionRelatingto ChildrenDamaged bythe DrugThalidomide
children&apos;s need was even more for practical help and supporting services than for substantial financial assistance. It was insufficientlyrealised how much had already been done by way of providingmedical, social and educational services for the children concerned;and further consideration was being given to means of identifyingany deficiencies in this respect which might still remain. It would be important, however, to make it clear to public opinion that thalido-mide children were only a very small proportion of the total numberof disabled children, a good many of whom were no less severely affected in other ways, and that to give preferential treatment tothalidomide children would both be unjust to the others and constitute a dangerous precedent.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment spokesman in the debate would have to strike a balance between raising Unduly high expectations and adopting too negativean attitude. They should deploy the arguments which had emergedduring the Cabinefs discussion; and as regards the legal aspects ofthe case they should present the history of the proceedings in such away as to emphasise that the responsibility for the delay in reaching asettlement^ which was causing so much concern, did not lie at the door of the courts or of the Government. If the Distillers company were now prepared to conclude a separate settlement with thoseparents who had already accepted the proposed compensation, itmight be helpful if this, too, could be stated in the debate. Furtherconsideration should therefore be given to this possibility by theMinisters concerned.The Cabinet 1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services, in consulta-tion with the Lord President of the Council and the attorney General, to ascertain whether the DistillersCompany were now prepared to reach an immediatesettlement with those parents who had agreed to theproposed compensation and whether, if this was so, thefact could advantageously be made public during theforthcoming debate on the Opposition Motion.3. Subject to the outcome of those enquiries, invited ministers who would be speaking in the debate to be guided bythe Prime Ministers summing up.opposition motion onAxle &quot;weights and size of LorriesThe Cabinet were informed that the issue of the proposedEuropean Community directive on vehicle weights and dimensionswas becoming a contentious issue among certain of the governments supporters and that there was also strong opposition on environ-mental grounds to the prospect that lorries with 11-ton axle weightwould be allowed to operate on roads in the United Kingdom.Although it was arguable that too much importance should not be
attached to indiscriminate criticism of this kind and that the right course was to specify the traffic conditions in which heavier lorriesmight be permitted to operate in this country, the Government mustoppose the draft directive in its present form. The prospects of our being able to delay a decision by the Community until after our entry on 1 January, however, now seemed reasonably good; and thereafter we should be in a better position to argue our case. If,contrary to expectation, the Community were to take a decision inthe meantime we could hardly be expected to observe it. In replying to the Opposition Motion on 29 November, therefore, the Ministerfor Transport Industries would wish to make it clear that we mustoppose the draft directive in its present form and to add that allpossible steps were being taken to emphasise our views to the Govern-ments concerned. Given the strength of feeling on this issue it wouldbe appropriate for the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to windup the debate.ImmigrationPolicyPreviousReference:CM (72) 52ndConclusions,Minute 1SECRET*The Cabinet considered the situation which had been created by the Governmenfs defeat on the previous evening on Motionsrelating to the Immigration Rules for Control on Entry and Controlafter Entry.The Chief Whip said that various motives had prompted the seven Conservative backbenchers who had voted against the Govern-ment in this debate and the 53 who had abstained. Their attitude had been dictated partly by their continuing resentment about theGovernment&apos;s policy in relation to the European Economic Com-munity (e.c.); and this had been aggravated by the recent press campaing alleging that the Governmenfs immigration policies wouldhenceforward discriminate in favour of immigrants from other mem-ber countries of the e.c. at the expense particularly of those from the member countries of the Old Commonwealth. But at the root oftheir opposition to the Government lay a growing fear that otherEast African countries might shortly follow the example of Ugandaby expelling United Kingdom passport holders (UKPHs), who wouldthen exercise their entitlement to settle in this country, and that asa result we should be faced with an intolerable repetition of the recentinflux of Ugandan UKPHs.In these circumstances the Government would clearly have totable amended Rules; and, although the dissident backbenchers,having expressed their displeasure, might then fall into line, thesituation would have to be dealt with very carefully.In discussion the following main points were made (a) It was agreed that the Government had been right to face the challenge on the previous evening and to refuse to withdraw theMotions. To have adopted the latter course would have beendamaging to the morale of the 240 backbenchers who, whatever theirprivate misgivings, had loyally supported the Government.
(b) It would be necessary to try to ensure that the anti-Europeansentiment which was implicit in the previous evening&apos;s vote was notaggravated by similar occasions in future, e.g. the forthcoming debate on the Opposition Motion about the e.c. directive on vehicle weights and dimensions, which might provide further scope for those groups of backbenchers who, for their own motives, were deliberately seeking to frustrate the Governmenfs policies, particularly in relation to europe.(c) Moreover, the Government must recognise that, over the lasttwo years, they had made very heavy demands on the loyalty oftheir supporters in relation to, e.g. their European policies as awhole, the Value Added Tax, local government reorganisation, etc;and it would be unwise to press backbenchers too hard on furthercontentious issues. It was perhaps not sufficiently understood thatthe powers of a Government to deal decisively with such problemsas immigration, industrial unrest, etc., were necessarily limited ifthe system of Parliamentary democracy was to continue to ensurefreedom for full discussion and debate; and it would be necessaryto avoid providing any unnecessary scope for the expression of themore authoritarian views which, although perhaps not very significantat present, were tending to become more widely shared.(d) Above all, it would be essential that the Government shouldbe prepared to deal, possibly at very short notice, with the situationwhich would arise if we were threatened with a new influx of UKPHs,particularly from East Africa. In extreme circumstances there mightbe no alternative to forcing a one-clause Bill through Parliament asa matter of the greatest urgency. In any event, however, the examina-tion of our nationality law, which was currently being conducted bythe Law Officers, should be completed as rapidly as possible; and avery early opportunity should be found to consider its recommenda-tions. At that point the Government might face the grave decision whether to deprive many of the individuals concerned of their british nationality; and they would have to weigh the endorsement which thiscourse would receive from certain sections of public opinion againstthe threat to the unity of the Commonwealth which it would entail,the damage which it would therefore inflict on many of our interestsoverseas and the offence which it would give to those of the Govern-menfs supporters who subscribed to the concept of a multi-racialCommonwealth and would be outraged if British citizens were madestateless persons by a British Government.(e) In addition, we should seek to bring the position under,greater control by appropriate inter-Governmental agreements, regu-lating the movement of UKPHs, wherever circumstances might makeit possible for us to do so. This might be feasible, for example, inthe case of Malaysia. We should also consider whether, if weseemed likely to face the threat of a substantial new influx of UKPHs,it would be possible to deal with it by instituting some scheme of comprehensive resettlement on British territory other than the UnitedKingdom.(/) Meanwhile, the most practical method of dealing with the.situation created by the previous evening&apos;s debate might be to deal
separately with immigrants from the e.c. and immigrants from theOld Commonwealth. The rules to deal with the former should bepublished and debated in Parliament in the relatively near future.At the same time the Government should be seen to engage in consul-tations with the Old Commonwealth countries in the hope of influenc-ing them towards greater understanding, and possibly evenacceptance, of the immigration rules which we might have to apply in their cases.The Cabinet 1. Invited the Lord President to consider, in the light of their discussion and in consultation with the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary, the Home Secretary and other ministers concerned, the alternative form in which the immigration Rules for Control on Entry and Control afterEntry might be tabled for Parliamentary approval.2. Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for urgent consideration to be given to the amendment of the lawon nationality.IndustrialAffairsOne-dayStrike byASLEFIndustrialAction inthe DocksPreviousReference:CM (72) 46thConclusions,Minute 3CONFIDENTIAL3. The Secretary of State for Employment said that, while theostensible reason for that day&apos;s 24-hour strike by members of the associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF)was the fact that the experimental Advanced Passenger Train (APT)had been moved by staff of the British Railways Board (BRB) whowere not members of ASLEF or the National Union of Railwaymen,there was an underlying dispute of a continuing and more seriousnature. The ASLEF Executive Committee were seeking to use thedevelopment of the APT as a means of attempting to secure im-improvements in the pay not only of those who would be concernedwith its operation but also of all their other members. Their tacticsappeared to be to use the joint working party of railway management and unions which had been set up to review the wage structure ofdrivers as a means of pressing for immediate pay increases, in advanceof the next annual pay settlement which was due in the followingMay. It was unfortunate that the fact that the BRB had convenedonly one meeting of the working party had enabled ASLEF tocomplain of delay in the discussion of their case. But the otherrailway unions were not supporting them in their increasingly belligerent-ent attitude; and there was no case for Government intervention inthe dispute at this stage.The Secretary of State for Employment said that it seemed likely that lorry drivers working for members of the Imported Meat trade association might now be prepared to cross the unofficial picket lines which had for some months been maintained by dockers at the EastLondon depot of Midland Cold Storage Limited. This might lead toreprisals by the dockers, which could result in an increase in the priceof meat. This, however, might prove less unwelcome than thealternative outcome-namely that, if the drivers refused to try to
cross the picket lines or were prevented or dissuaded from doing so,Midland Cold Storage might decide that there was no alternative totheir seeking a hearing by the National Industrial Relations Courtof their allegation of unfair industrial practice by both the transport and General Workers Union and the National Amalgamated Steve-dores and Dockers. There was no action which the government might at present usefully take without appearing to be interfering inthe freedom of action of those concerned in the dispute.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Secretary of State for employment.CivilLiability forPersonalInjuryPreviousReference:CM (72) 52ndConclusions,Minute 4CONFIDENTIAL4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordChancellor (CP (72) 129) about the composition and terms of refer-ence of the Royal Commission which the Cabinet had recommendedshould be established to consider the basis of liability for personal injury.The Lord Chancellor said that at a meeting of the ministers principally concerned it had been agreed that, although brief termsof reference were attractive, the balance of advantage favoured the longer version now before the Cabinet, in particular because theywould offer less encouragement to a recommendation in favour ofa State insurance scheme. It was proposed that the question whether there should be a right of action in an unborn child should be oneof the matters to be considered by the Royal Commission; but, since it had important legal implications, it was suggested that it shouldbe referred forthwith to the Law Commission and the Scottish law commission as a separate issue in the expectation that their reportswould be available in time for them to be taken into account bythe Royal Commission.As regards the composition of the Royal Commission it was proposed that there should be 14 or 15 members. This would resultin a rather larger body than might be ideally desirable. But it was difficult to reduce the numbers, given that the Lord Advocate con-sidered that a Scottish judge should be among the members; thatplaces must be found for a barrister and a solicitor; and that theRoyal Commission must not appear to be overweighted with legalmembers.In discussion the following points were made (a) It was important that lay members of high quality shouldbe found to balance the numerous professional members.(b) It was desirable that there should be more than one womanmember.(c) Members to serve on the Royal Commission should be chosen with due regard to the importance of anticipating a recom-mendation in favour of a State insurance scheme.
(d) Further consideration should be given to amending the termsof reference in order to make it clear that the Royal commission would be charged to consider not only in what circumstances and by what means compensation should be payable in respect of death orpersonal injury occasioned by specified causes but also the priorquestion whether compensation should be payable at all.(e) It should be made very clear, when the Royal commission was appointed, that the Government were not accepting any advancecommitment to a State insurance scheme, which would inevitably involve very heavy additional expenditure.In further discussion it was suggested that there did not nowseem likely to be any advantage in arranging for the decision to setup a Royal Commission to be announced in advance of the debate onthalidomide children. Indeed, it might be tactically preferable to defer the announcement until well after the debate. There would therefore be time for the group of Ministers under the Lord Chan-cellor&apos;s chairmanship to give further thought to the points which had emerged from the Cabinefs discussion.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that anearly announcement of the decision to establish a Royal Commissionto consider the basis of liability for personal injury no longer seemednecessary. Accordingly the Lord Chancellor, in consultation withthe Ministers principally concerned, should consider whether any changes were desirable in the proposed composition and terms ofreference of the Royal Commission, having regard particularly tothe need to avoid a recommendation in favour of a State insurancescheme; and should also prepare, for consideration by the Cabinet,the draft of a statement by means of which the Government mightannounce, at the appropriate moment, the decision to set up a royal Commission.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office,23 November, 1972.
