ParliamentaryAffairsValue AddedTaxPreviousReference:CM (72) 54thConclusions,Minute 31973 Revalua-tion for RatingPreviousReference:CM (72) 45thConclusions,Minute 4Presentationof MajorGovernmentPoliciesCONFIDENTIAL1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. The House wouldadjourn for the Christmas Recess on 22 December and wouldreassemble on 22 January, 1973. The House of Lords would adjournon 21 December and, unless additional time was needed for theCommittee Stage of the National Health Service ReorganisationBill, would reassemble on 23 January, 1973.The Cabinet were informed that, although a publicity campaignwas planned for early in 1973 in order to improve public under-standing of the detailed operation of Value-Added Tax (VAT),more effective defensive measures were required in the interim inorder to counter increasing opposition to the new tax.The Cabinet were informed that the Home and Social AffairsCommittee had recently approved proposals by the Minister for local Government and Development for a major publicity campaign,starting immediately after Christmas, in connection with the forth-coming rating revaluation. Since the Committee&apos;s discussion,however, there had been signs of increasing public concern aboutthe effects of revaluation. The rate bills of some individual house-holders were likely to increase by as much as 25 per cent; and itwould be argued that such increases were inconsistent with the government&apos;s counter-inflationary measures. In these circumstances it was desirable that appropriate publicity measures should not be deferred until after Christmas but should be put in hand at theearliest opportunity.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary, in . consultation with theMinisters concerned and the Joint Parliamentary Secretary,Civil Service Department (Mr. Johnson Smith), to consider,,what additional measures should be taken in the immediatefuture to allay public apprehension about the impact of value-Added Tax and rating revaluation.The Cabinet were informed that there were some indications thatthe considerable measure of public support which they had earliersucceeded in enlisting for their policies on counter-inflationary measures and Northern Ireland respectively was being graduallyeroded because of the absence of published decisions about the nextsteps. In both fields, however, the Government, were bound to take time to reach firm conclusions; and Ministers should therefore take every suitable opportunity to emphasise that the apparent delaymerely reflected the Governmenfs determination that their decisions should be soundly based.&apos;
OverseaAffairsNew Zealand/AustraliaPreviousReference:CM (72) 54thConclusions,Minute 2IndustrialAffairsThe Case ofMr. JamesGoadPreviousReference:CM (72) 51stConclusions,Minute 3CONFIDENTIAL3. The Secretary of State for Employment said that Mr. JamesGoad, who had again been refused admission to a meeting of theSudbury Branch of the Engineering Section of the AmalgamatedUnion of Engineering Workers, now appeared likely to renew pro-ceedings in the National Industrial Relations Court against theunion. If the union again refused to attend the Court hearing, theymight incur a further fine for contempt.industrial action in theDocksPreviousReference:CM (72) 53rdConclusions,Minute 3The Secretary of State for Employment said that, in view of thedecision by lorry drivers not to cross the unofficial dockers&apos; picketlines at the East London depot of Midland Cold Storage Limited,the Company might now ask the Industrial Court to expedite the hearing of their allegation of unfair industrial practice by both theTransport and General Workers&apos; Union and the NationalAmalgamated Stevedores and Dockers. It was perhaps unlikely,however, that the matter would come to a head before Christmas.The Government had no official standing in the matter; and it wouldbe wrong to attempt to influence any action taken by the company in pursuit of their legal rights, e.g. by encouraging them to seek a reference by the Court to the Commission on Industrial Relations.2. The Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs said that the Labour Government which had emerged fromthe recent General Election in Australia were already showingthemselves less helpful than their predecessors in the United Nationswhere they were voting against us on Rhodesia and were supporting the Resolution by Sri Lanka declaring the Indian Ocean a zone ofpeace. Their attitudes were likely to have an even more serious effect in the following year when Australia would become a memberof the Security Council. As regards the Five-Power defence arrangements involving Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, singapore and ourselves, the Australian Government were proceedingcautiously; and so far the attitude of the new Government of NewZealand, where the Labour Party had similarly come into power, had also been not unsatisfactory. The Australian Government had not adopted as openly hostile an attitude towards the French nuclear tests in the Pacific as had the New Zealand Government; but wemust expect both Governments to adopt more critical policies inthe context of our impending membership of the European economic community.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Minister of State forForeign and Commonwealth Affairs.
industrial action byNationalHealth ServiceAncillaryWorkersStrike by AsianHosieryWorkersAgriculturalWorkers&apos; PayPreviousReference:CM (72) 54thConclusions,Minute 3The Secretary of State for Employment said that there hadbeen some unofficial industrial action by ancillary workers in theNational Health Service in protest against the suspension of negotia-tions in respect of their current pay claim as a result of the standstill on pay and prices. It was expected that a half day&apos;s strike wouldtake place in hospitals on Merseyside on 15 December.The Secretary of State for Employment said that he had beenasked to conciliate in the dispute involving Asian workers who were on strike at the Mansfield Hosiery Mills in Loughborough on an issue of alleged racial discrimination in relation to promotion. Itmight be necessary to convene a court of inquiry for this purpose.The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that theunions representing agricultural workers had pressed him for achange in the Governmenfs attitude as regards the deferment ofimplementation of their pay award, particularly if the standstill was likely to extend beyond the basic 90 days&apos; period. He had con-fined himself to assuring them that the Government would not wishthe standstill period to last any longer than was necessary; and,although they had been disquieted that they could not obtain anyfirmer undertaking about the future, they were unlikely to resort to industrial action.The Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the Secretary of State for employment and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food.Coal PolicyPreviousReference:CM (72) 55thConclusionsCONFIDENTIAL4. The Cabinet considered a Note by the Secretary of Statefor Trade and Industry (CP (72) 144), to which was annexed a revised draft of a Parliamentary statement on coal policy.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that, in thelight of the Cabinet&apos;s consideration of coal policy at their meetingon 5 December and of their comments on the earlier draft statement annexed to CP (72) 135, he had revised the text in consultation withthe Home Secretary, the Lord President and the Secretaries of Statefor Scotland and for Wales. He proposed that the revised statement,subject to certain further minor amendments, should be made onthe following Monday, 11 December, when the Coal Industry bill was to be introduced in the House of Commons.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet approved the revised statement, subject to minor textualalterations and to agreement between the Secretary of State andthe Chief Secretary, Treasury, on the amendment required to clarifythe Governmenfs position as regards regional grants and theprovision of new employment. The Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster should arrange for the European Coal and Steel Com-
munity to be informed in advance of the statement. Since theGovernment were still uncommitted as regards the arrangementsfor improved redundancy payments, which had not yet beendiscussed in detail with the unions, the Secretary of State shouldurgently consider, in consultation with the Secretary of State for social Services, the Secretary of State for Employment and theChief Secretary, Treasury, the extent to which it might be possibleto modify those arrangements in order to facilitate the employmentof redundant miners in the social services and related fields of work.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (i) to make his proposed Parliamentary statement on coal policy, as amended in the light of the discus-sion, on Monday, 11 December;(ii) to consider further, in consultation with the Secre-tary of State for Social Services, the Secretaryof State for Employment and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, the scope for securing alternative employment for redundant miners in the context of negotiating improved redundancy payments.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to informthe European Coal and Steel Community in advance ofthe proposed Parliamentary statement on coal policy.ImmigrationPolicyPreviousReference:CM (72) 53rdConclusions,Minute secret*5. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary ofState for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and the Secretary ofState for the Home Department (CP (72) 143), to which was annexedthe draft of a Parliamentary statement about the admission to thiscountry of citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies living inother independent Commonwealth countries, holding no othercitizenship and remaining eligible for the issue of United Kingdompassports. &apos;   .The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet faced a complex ofinterrelated issues under the general heading of immigration policy.It would be necessary at some stage to reconsider the basic questionof the amendment of the law regulating British nationality andcitizenship. This, however, raised very difficult issues, which it wouldtake a considerable time to resolve; and any subsequent legislation would itself be contentious and protracted. At the other extremethe Cabinet would shortly need.to decide in what form the Immigra-tion Rules for Control on Entry and Control after Entry, which theHouse of Commons had recently rejected, should be resubmitted toParliament. Both these issues, however, were overshadowed by the
current anxiety among the Governmenfs supporters that thiscountry should not find itself confronted for the second time by aninflux of holders of United Kingdom passports (UKPHs) if othercountries, particularly in East Africa, followed the recent example of the Government of Uganda in forcibly evicting such individualson the ground that they were entitled to enter the United Kingdom.In retrospect we had dealt with the Ugandan episode without unduedisturbance. But public opinion would not tolerate its repetition;nor could we expect to receive on a second occasion theco-operation from other countries of the Commonwealth on whichwe had been able to rely in the case of the Ugandan influx. ThePrime Minister of Canada, Mr. Trudeau, had made it clear during his recent visit to this country that the pressure of illegal immigration towhich Canada was now subject would make it impossible for theCanadian Government to repeat their earlier gesture of admittinga substantial number of UKPHs; and this would probably be true of other countries as well. If so, the United Kingdom would be leftto deal single-handed with any repetition of the Ugandan episode;and it was clear that there could be little hope of making headwaywith any other aspect of the Governmenfs immigration policies untilpublic opinion was reassured that the Government would not toleratea second occasion of this kind. A group of Ministers under his chairmanship had therefore considered in what form this reassurancemight best be conveyed; and the draft Parliamentary statement annexed to CP (72) 143 represented the outcome. Its main purpose was to emphasise that, while we should continue to admit UKPHsfrom East Africa and India under the special voucher scheme in acontrolled and orderly way, it would impose too heavy a burden on this country if we again had to receive large numbers of people who had been displaced from their country of residence by massexpulsion; that any future problems of this nature would thereforeneed to be dealt with by inter-Governmental action; and that forthis purpose it was proposed to embark forthwith on a series of discussions with the Governments of the Commonwealth and othercountries about possible means of dealing with any situation of thiskind.In discussion the following main points were made (a) Those of the Governmenfs supporters who were most insistentthat the Government should prevent any repetition of the Ugandanepisode might well adopt a more moderate attitude in due course,particularly if they realised the limitations on the action which theGovernment could in fact take for this purpose. It would also bea matter for regret if in response to current political pressure theGovernment adopted harsh measures of which public opinion might subsequently come to be ashamed. Even so, the immediate need was to dispel a sense of deep alarm about the prospect of a secondinflux of UKPHs; and there appeared little prospect of doing soexcept by means of a public statement that the Government wouldnot tolerate a repetition of the Ugandan episode. The draft Parlia--mentary statement represented the minimum required for thispurpose; indeed, it might be necessary to go even further by under-
taking to suspend the existing special voucher scheme for a year ormore and thereafter to reinstate it only in relation to immigrants from East Africa and the Old Commonwealth.(b) As against this consideration it was essential to recognisefrom the outset that a statement on the lines proposed would haveno effect on our obligation under international law not to transfer to other Governments the responsibility for UKPHs by making them, in effect, Stateless persons. No change in our municipal lawcould affect that obligation. But it was arguable that a statement on the lines suggested, by giving advance warning of our intentionto limit our liability as an act of policy, might reduce the risk that, ifwe had to give effect to that intention, the other Governments con-cerned would take vigorous measures of retaliation against our interests. Nevertheless it could be reasonably held against us that,if we did adopt this attitude, we should in effect be resiling fromearlier public statements by Government spokesmen in which theyhad accepted that we had a continuing obligation under internationallaw to UKPHs who were forcibly evicted from their countries of residence.(c) It could also be objected to the proposed statement that itwas ambiguous on the question whether, if the Government were faced with a repetition of the Ugandan episode, they would in factrefuse entry to the large numbers of UKPHs who would succeed in reaching this country by one means or another. The Governmentwould not be allowed to evade this issue; and, if they were forcedto acknowledge that they would have no practical alternative toadmitting the individuals in question, the warning which the state-ment was intended to convey would lose its force in advance and thereassurance to public opinion in this country which it was designedto provide would be frustrated. Indeed, if the Government originallypurported to deny admission and were subsequently forced to concede it, their credibility might be so severely shaken that theycould not survive.(d) Moreover, it would be impossible for other commonwealth governments to ignore the statement; and we had no grounds forassuming that their reaction would be other than adverse. It might therefore stimulate those of them who were already contemplatingfollowing the example of Uganda to expel their UKPHs while therewas still time to do so; and many of the UKPHs themselves might regard it as a warning that they should move to this country as rapidly as possible. As a result we might merely precipitate thesituation which the statement was designed to avert J&quot; and any chanceof dealing with the long-term problem by rational and orderlylegislation would be irretrievably lost.(e) On the other hand, it was not conceivable that parliament would enact arbitrary legislation designed to make UKPHs Stateless.In a situation of the kind envisaged we should be compelled to admitthem to the United Kingdom unless there was some other place inwhich they were entitled to re-establish themselves. It was for con-sideration, therefore, whether we should seek to devise, in oversea
territories which we still controlled, areas of resettlement to whichUKPHs could, if necessary, be diverted. Such places would inevitably acquire something of the unhappy reputation of mererefugee camps; and the expenditure involved would be liable to beformidable. Nevertheless, the scope for action of this kind should perhaps be further explored; and we should also give renewed con-sideration to the possibility that certain other commonwealth governments, e.g. in India and Kenya, might be prepared to acceptUKPHs in future in return for substantial financial assistance.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were now seized of the very serious nature of the problem with which they were confronted and would need to resume their discussion in the near future.Relocation ofDefenceFacilities fromShoeburynessPreviousReference:CM (72) 40thConclusions,Minute 9CONFIDENTIAL6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Defence (CP (72) 138) about possible sites for the defence facilities which were due to be moved from Shoeburyness in order to accommodate the Third London Airport.The Secretary of State for Defence recalled that at their meetingon 8 August the Cabinet had accepted that essential defence work should not be disrupted by the decision to site the Third london airport at Maplin and had invited the Ministers concerned to give him every assistance in finding new sites for the facilities to be moved from Shoeburyness. Since then the Ministerial Committee on regional Policy and the Environment (RE) had twice considered theproblem. Three of the four prospective sites to which the Shoebury-ness facilities were to be dispersed did not seem likely to presentserious problems. But the choice of Tain, in Ross and Cromarty,as the fourth site had provoked strong local objection; and the local planning authority had refused planning permission for the changeinvolved in converting the range for use by ground artillery insteadof air weapons. RE had accepted, however, that there was no alternative to Tain and that in these circumstances the normalprocess of holding a public inquiry would only exacerbate feelingand prolong public debate when the Governmenfs course of action had already been determined. They had therefore concluded that public inquiries should not be offered at any of the sites in questionbut that the choice of all four should be announced simultaneouslyas a Government decision.In view of the strong local opposition to Tain and the political difficulties to which it might give rise, he had again reviewed allthe possible sites in the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland,and had consulted the independent Committee under the chairman-ship of Lord Nugent who were examining defence land holdings.This further review had revealed only one alternative site, atCastlemartin in Wales. But the use of this site to relocate thefacilities at Shoeburyness would entail severe problems, since it was
now used as a tank range by the German Army and the RoyalArmoured Corps and the resiting of these facilities would eitherrequire the acquisition of a further 5,000 or 6,000 acres at Kirkcud-bright or jeopardise the possibility of releasing the land at Lulworthin Dorset which was likely to be one of the major proposals to emerge from the Nugent Committee&apos;s review. To dispossess theGerman Army altogether of their training facilities in the UnitedKingdom would be damaging both to Anglo-German relations andto European defence collaboration; and it might also cause theFederal German Government to withdraw the much greater Britishtank training facilities in Germany, which were vital to the efficiency of the British Army of the Rhine. The Cabinet would wish toconsider whether these penalties were commensurate with thoseinvolved in overcoming the local opposition at Tain.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, after examining the problem in detail with the Secretary of State for Defence, he was satisfied that only three sites in Scotland satisfied the technicalrequirements of the facilities at Shoeburyness. The range atKirkcudbright was already due to receive a small part of thosefacilities; but any proposal to acquire another 5,000 or 6,000 acres in order to accommodate the tank training facilities from Castle-jmartin would meet with great opposition. The range at WestFreugh in Galloway would meet the technical requirements; and on grounds of employment it would have been a preferable site for therelocation of the Shoeburyness facilities. But it was already being used for trials of the European medium range combat aircraft(MRCA), to which at least equal priority was given. None the less to move the facilities to Tain would create great difficulties. As aresult of the intensive exploitation of North Sea oil and gas the area was already suffering from almost excessive development; and local opinion, which was also hostile to the proposal on environmentalgrounds, would be hard to persuade that the other sites which thelocal planning authority had offered were all unsuitable. In politicalterms the Governmenfs standing in the north of Scotland wouldbe severely damaged; the credit which they had earned by themeasures of the past two years would be dissipated; and nationalistresistance to the alleged exploitation of Scotland in the interests ofSouth-East England would be reinforced. Indeed, if it were decidedto move the facilities to Tain, it might be preferable to dispense witha public inquiry, which would only serve to secure greater publicity for these criticisms. Moreover, if the outcome of the inquiry wasadverse and the Government were then compelled to overrule the findings, even greater offence would be caused.In discussion it was suggested that there might be scope forexploring a more collaborative approach to the research and testing of weapons with our partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisa-tion, and that sites for this purpose might be available in Europe.If so, the MRCA project might be a particularly suitable candidate for an arrangement of this kind. On the other hand the technicalrequirements for testing the MRCA project were, even more stringentthan those which applied to the facilities due to be transferred from
Shoeburyness; our allies were under the same pressures as ourselvesas regards the provision of training areas, with the result that therewas no spare capacity in Europe to replace the loss of a majorrange; and it would not be practicable to conduct the proof testing of United Kingdom ammunition on ranges outside Europe. Theneed for a decision was now urgent if the programme for the third london Airport was not to be delayed; and two years&apos; search had shown no feasible alternative to Tain.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised that, in the absence of suitable alternatives, itmight in the end prove necessary to resite the Shoeburyness facilities at Tain. A decision to this effect, however, would arouse intense localhostility on environmental and political grounds, would put at risk the Governmenfs position in the north of Scotland and would be severely criticised by the Governmenfs supporters in Parliament.To dispense with a public inquiry would add to these difficulties,not least because a public inquiry had already been held at oneprospective site. In the light of the discussion, he would consultfurther with the Secretaries of State for Defence and for Scotlandbefore asking the Cabinet to reach a decision on this question.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Agreed to resume their consideration of this question at a future meeting.Cabinet Office,7 December, 1972.
