ParliamentaryAffairsBusiness inthe Houseof LordsPreviousReference:CM (72) 34thConclusions,Minute 1SECRET1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord Privy Seal said that, following discussions with theOpposition in the House of Lords, it was clear that it would not be practicable to complete the European Communities Bill in that house before the Summer Adjournment. The House would there-fore reassemble for the remaining stages of the Bill in the week beginning 11 September; and on this basis it should be possible tocomplete the final stages not later than 20 September.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Lord Privy Seal.OverseaAffairsIcelandicFisheriesDisputePreviousReference:CM (72) 34thConclusions,Minute 3SECRET2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the ministerial discussions with the Icelandic Government at Reykjavikhad been broken off on the previous day because it had proved impossible to reach agreement on an interim arrangement for regu-lating fishing off Iceland. The Icelandic Government intended toissue on 14 July new regulations prohibiting from 1 September all foreign fishing within 50 miles of their coastline. We should remainin touch with them in the hope of finding a solution of the problem;but it was very unlikely that any accommodation would in fact prove possible. Meanwhile, we were applying to the International Courtof Justice for a ruling on interim arrangements.The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that the icelandic Government would probably refuse to accept the juris-diction of the International Court. It would now be necessary,therefore, to make preparations to defend our boats operating in thearea off Iceland. This might be done in the long run by usingconverted trawlers; but in the shorter term there was no alternative to asking the Royal Navy to give such assistance as they might beable to provide.The Cabinet 1. Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary and the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food.Australia/ The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary gave the CabinetNew Zealand a brief account of his recent visit to the Far East. In Australia andNew Zealand he had heard no further criticism of our decision tojoin the European Economic Community. On the contrary, it was evident that the Governments of both countries were now activelyconsidering how best to take advantage of the new oppertuinities which our entry would give them. It seemed likely that there wouldbe a change of Government in Australia following the elections due in the autumn; but his discussions with Mr. Whitlam, the leader of
the Australian Labour Party, suggested that Australia^ positionwithin the Five Power defence arrangements could probably bemaintained if the Labour Party came into power.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he hadbeen favourably impressed during his visit to Indonesia by recent developments there. President Suharto was a dominant personalityand, in general, a good influence. Relations with neighbouring countries were developing satisfactorily; and it was salutary thatDutch interests were returning to Indonesia and that the australian government had undertaken to provide training facilities for the indonesian Armed Forces. For our part we were contributing tothe economic development of the country by means of a modestloan, for which the Indonesian Government had expressed theirgratitude.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he had found conditions in Bangladesh very depressing. There was virtually no central administration of the country; and the task of rehabilitation-tation was beyond the capacity of the Prime Minister SheikhMujibur Rahman, and his colleagues. The International Red Crosswere doing all that they could to help; and we had ourselves made very substantial financial contributions. Nevertheless, it was doubt-ful whether the country could expect to rise above a mere subsistence-tence level for the next 10 years or so. He had found Sheikh MujiburRahman obsessed by the need to bring the so-called war criminalsto trial. He had argued strongly in favour of restricting the numberof trials; and the Indian Prime Minister, Mrs. Gandhi, was nowgiving similar advice to Sheikh Mujibur. If he did not accept it,there would be a further serious deterioration of Bangladeshrelations with Pakistan and continuing unrest in the sub-continent.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that his visit to Afghanistan had been encouraging. He had found that theinfluence of the Soviet Government was not as dominant as wassometimes supposed; and he had been impressed by the calibre ofthe King and the Foreign Minister, who had both made it clear to him that their policy was to work for stability in the area and, inparticular, to avoid any action which might create difficulties forPakistan. He believed that this attitude would be found encouragingby the Shah of Iran; and he had left with the King of Afghanistanthe suggestion that he might seek to establish closer relations with the shah.The Cabinet- &apos;2.  Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.
northern ireland previous reference:CM (72) 34thConclusions,Minute 5CONFIDENTIAL3. The Cabinet gave further consideration to the situation inNorthern Ireland; the conclusions reached were separately recorded and issued only to The Queen, the Prime Minister and those ministers who had to take action.The conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file heldby the Secretary of the Cabinet.IndustrialAffairsMeetings withtheConfederationof BritishIndustry andthe TradesUnionCongressPreviousReference:CM (72) 34thConclusions,Minute 6UnemploymentStatisticsPreviousReference:CM (72) 33rdConclusions,Minute 4Civil ServicePayMonopoliesCommissionReportCONFIDENTIAL4. The Prime Minister said that his meeting with the represen-tatives of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) earlier in theweek had provided the occasion for a useful review of current economic problems. The Economic Committee of the TradesUnion Congress (TUC) had rejected our proposal that a small group should be established to examine the measures which might be takento reduce wage inflation; but they had agreed that these problemsshould be further discussed in the National Economic development council. It had subsequently emerged, however, that the TUCrepresentatives were in fact ready to take part in early trypartite discussions with the Government and the CBI; and he had thereforeinvited both organisations to a meeting on the following Tuesday.The Secretary of State for Employment said that there were signs that the total number of wholly unemployed was now startingto rise again, probably as a result of the addition of school leaversto the register. The published total in July, however, would be thefirst to be calculated on the basis of the new provisional arrange-ments under which adult students seeking vacation employment, aswell as school leavers, would be separately identified. The publishedfigure would therefore suggest not that unemployment was risingagain but rather that the rate at which it had been falling was nowbecoming less rapid.In discussion it was suggested that it was important to presentthe statistics in as favourable a light as possible and to ensure thatthose registered as unemployed were not in fact engaged in full or part-time employment in, for example, the building trade.The Lord Privy Seal said that agreement had been reached onthe increase in pay based on the biennial pay research unit findingsfor the professional and technical classes of the Civil Service.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that thereport of the Monopolies Commission on the proposals by Beechamsand Boots to take over the Glaxo Group would be published later that day. In recommending against any form of merger between these three groups the Commission had adopted a more restrictiveattitude than might have been expected when the proposals hadbeen referred to them.
The Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister, theSecretary of State for Employment, the Lord Privy Sealand the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.SECRETPublic 5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChancellorExpenditure     0f the Exchequer (CP (72) 72) to which was annexed the report of theto 1976-77      interdepartmental Public Expenditure Survey Committee (PESC)on public expenditure to 1976-77.  They also had before them amemorandum by the Central Policy Review Staff (CP (72) 75) on thesame subject.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the average annualpercentage increase in public expenditure in prospect when theGovernment took office in June, 1970, had been 3-3 per cent. Theresult of the first review in the autumn of 1970 had been to reducethe annual rate of increase to 2-6 per cent; and at the end of theregular annual review in 1971 it had become 2-7 per cent. Thecurrent report of the interdepartmental PESC indicated that, ifaccount was taken of developments of policy since the last annual review, the average annual rate of increase was now 3-4 per cent.In terms of demand on output the average annual increasein the resources absorbed by public expenditure was 3-8 percent. The report also indicated additions proposed by Departments,mostly for new policies, which would increase total expenditure bymore than  500 million a year by 1976-77. Moreover, other proposals might still emerge from Programme Analysis and Reviews or similarstudies, and allowance must also be made for the prospective costof the tax-credit scheme in the later 70s. If all the additionsproposed by the Departments were approved, the real cost to the economy of public expenditure programmes would rise at an average annual rate of over 4 per cent. Although public expenditure andthe gross domestic product were currently rising relatively rapidly as a result of the measures taken to reduce unemployment, thegrowth of resources when the slack had been taken up would bein line with the underlying productivity of the economy. In thesecircumstances it would be imprudent to commit, in advance,resources which were not in definite prospect.The Government had so far succeeded in making good their claim to be a tax-reducing Administration. In order to avoid a reversal of that policy, they must now seek to ensure that from1973 onwards tax rates could be adjusted sufficiently to offset the&quot; fiscal drag&quot; which was the automatic effect of inflation. Thereport of the interdepartmental committee indicated that an average annual increase in public sector demand of 3-8 per cent could perhaps be just reconciled with this objective, but the prospectivebalance of resources and demand was so finely poised that such acourse was by no means free from the risk of overloading the economy.  Privately-financed consumption would have to grow by
no more than 3 per cent a year, significantly less rapidly than public expenditure; and for this purpose taxation could barely be reducedto the extent needed to offset the net effects of inflation. If public expenditure was allowed to increase more rapidly than the totalshown in the PESC report, there was therefore a real danger either that taxation policy would need to be reversed or that public expend-iture programmes would need to be cut back. The government&apos;s supporters were also known to be increasingly concerned, on political grounds, about the growth in public expenditure programmes. he therefore proposed that, as an objective of policy, the resourcesabsorbed by public expenditure should not be allowed to increasemore rapidly between 1971-72 and 1976-77 than the average annual rate of 3-8 per cent implied by the existing PESC programmes.This would permit a total of public expenditure in 1976-77 of 30,300 million at 1972-73 outturn prices; and the annual rate of increase would still be about \ per cent higher than the correspondingrate in the 1971 White Paper. If the Cabinet endorsed this policy,he proposed, with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to examine withthe Ministers concerned the problems of priorities entailed in Depart-mental proposals for additional expenditure and to make a further report to the Cabinet in September.In discussion there was general agreement with this approach.The restriction of public expenditure programmes to their existing level, however, would involve considerable political and practicaldifficulties. For example, the provision for social security made no allowance for any increase in the purchasing power of retirement pensions after the current year. Pensions would therefore come torepresent a declining proportion of earnings; and this would bedifficult to defend, particularly since they were largely financed from contributions. Once we became members of the European EconomicCommunities (e.c.), the British standard of social securityprovision would increasingly be criticised as comparing unfavour-ably with the general level attained in most other e.c. countries.The Government were also under pressure to improve supplementary benefits by making an additional payment towards winter heatingcosts; and a decision on this question would need to be taken before the Summer Recess if there was to be time to prepare and tointroduce the necessary legislation in order to make payments at christmas. As regards defence, the 1971 public expenditure white paper had included a round sum for 1975-76, on the basis that theprovision for expenditure in that year would need to be further considered in relation to the planned defence programme. Therewould be considerable objection, therefore, to including a figure inthe next public expenditure White paper which could not be defended in relation to likely future needs. In the case of theprogramme for trade, industry and employment, the additional sums which would probably be needed to implement existing policy, e.g.to enable nationalised industries to restrain price increases, seemed likely to exceed the net sum provided in the PESC report for contin-gencies and shortfall.On the other hand the general case for limiting the total ofpublic expenditure to the extent proposed seemed compelling. In the
context of the Governmenfs general taxation policy it was importantat least to be able to offset the effect of &quot; fiscal drag &quot;. The presentgrowth of the economy was made possible by bringing spare capacityinto use. Improvements in productivity took longer to achieve; andit would be imprudent to assume that a substantial improvement inthis respect would have been achieved by the point at v/hich theslack had been taken up and the growth in resources was againrelated to the underlying growth of productive potential. If at alater stage it appeared that more resources would be available, itwould then still be possible to consider increasing the total of public expenditure.In further discussion the following main points were made (a) The interdepartmental report had been prepared as a basis for internal discussion; and for this purpose it was convenient to compare the estimates with corresponding estimates in previoussurveys. For the purpose of public presentation, however, it wouldbe appropriate to place more emphasis on the share of available resources taken by public expenditure. The present programmes were higher than those in previous years partly because of the costof entering the e.c.. In presenting this cost, it was important toensure that receipts from the Communities were brought fully intothe reckoning.(b) The extent to which public expenditure was being devoted tothe support of enterprises, both in the public and in the private sector, which were at present non-profit-making must be a matter for concern as a potential misdirection of resources. On the otherhand some of these enterprises were basic industries or made animportant contribution to the balance of payments. It was notpossible to move effectively towards a free market economy without taking full account of the problems of transition which were neces-sarily involved in ensuring the regeneration of British industry as awhole.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the policy of tax reduction must not be reversedand that it was therefore important to ensure that tax rates couldbe adjusted sufficiently to offset the increase in the real weight oftaxation Which was the inevitable result of inflation. For thispurpose the growth in public expenditure must be related to that ofthe underlying capacity of the economy; and the Government shouldnot at this stage court the risk that public expenditure might sub-sequently have to be cut back. If additional resources proved indue course to be available, it would at that point be permissibleto consider further increases of public expenditure in the total.The Cabinet agreed, therefore, with the proposed objective of policy that the growth of public expenditure, in terms of use of resources,should be no greater tham the average annual rate of 3 - 8 per cent between 1971-72 and 1976-77 which was assumed in the existingPESC programmes. They also agreed that the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, should examine withthe Ministers concerned the problems of priorities entailed in thevarious proposals for additional expenditure and should report the outcome to the Cabinet, if possible by the middle of September.
The Cabinet 1. Took note, with approval of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.2. Approved the proposals in CP (72) 72 and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer to report the outcome ofhis further discussions with departmental Ministers tothe Cabinet, if possible by mid-September.3. Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to circulate a memorandum on his proposal to include in the supple-mentary benefit scheme a special additional paymenttowards winter heating costs.EuropeanCommunitiesParliamentaryScrutinyof DraftInstrumentsCONFIDENTIAL6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (CP (72) 76) about the arrangements for parliamentary scrutiny of draft instruments of the european community.The Lord President said that the Opposition would probablyagree to the establishment of a Parliamentary Committee to considerthe arrangements for this purpose. In considering the attitude to beadopted by the Government in giving evidence to the Committee, the ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedure had reviewedfour possible approaches. The first was to rest on present Parlia-mentary procedures and to make no special arrangements for parliamentary examination of Community proposals. But a Com-munity instrument, once made, could not be overturned by Parlia-ment; and Members needed the assurance of adequate opportunities to influence decisions taken in the Council of Ministers. the ministerial Committee did not, therefore, recommend this course.Equally, they did not consider that a preliminary &quot; sifting &quot; Com-mittee would be adequate by itself, since its selection of those draftsrequiring the attention of Parliament would inevitably create pressure for debates on the floor of the House which could not be satisfied.The third possibility was a Standing Committee, in whose proceedingsany Member would be able to take part. Its procedures would notbe inquisitorial; and it would therefore be less likely to embarrass the Government in the subsequent negotiations with other membersof the Community. Fourth, a Select Committee could be established,with the usual inquisitorial powers. But a Committee of this kind could cause serious embarrassment to the Government by itsquestions and reports on proposals on which Ministers would laterhave to negotiate in Brussels. It would also tend to confine interestin Community matters to a small and relatively exclusive body ofMembers; and this would entail a significant risk that Communityissues would come to be considered separately from generalGovernment policy. A majority of the Ministerial Committee were
accordingly in favour, on balance, of the appointment of a StandingCommittee, combined with a preliminary &quot; sifting &quot; Committee.In discussion it was suggested that the special nature of theCommunity made it desirable that Parliament should have themaximum opportunity to examine the draft instruments in question and that this pointed to the establishment of a Select Committee forthe purpose. A Committee of this kind might adopt a more constructive attitude than a Standing Committee; it would be likelyto make less demands on Ministerial time; and it might establish an acceptable convention about the confidential status of Govern-ment evidence. A Select Committee could also be a JointCommittee of both Houses and would therefore be able to make full use of those peers who would be delegates to the european assembly, whereas there was no precedent for a JointStanding Committee. On the other hand a Select Committee wasapt to be exacting in its demands for both written and oral evidence and would therefore impose a considerable burden on the Depart-mental officials concerned with the draft instruments. Moreover,there seemed little doubt that its investigations would in factembarrass the Government in their subsequent negotiations withthe Community. Even if a Standing Committee could not be aJoint Committee of both Houses, there seemed no reason why the&quot; sifting &quot; Committee should not be a Joint Committee.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet accepted the recommendation in CP (72) 76. ministers should therefore seek to steer the Parliamentary Committee towards a recommendation in favour of a Standing Committee to debatedraft Community instruments after a preliminary appraisal by a&quot; sifting &quot; Committee. In proceedings on the European CommunitiesBill, however, the Governments spokesmen should continue to main-tain that the arrangements for Parliamentary scrutiny were a matter for consideration by the special Parliamentary Committee which hadbeen proposed and should not concede any openings for amend-ments on this issue.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Ministers concerned to be guided accordingly.Allegations ofFinancialCorruption in public LifePreviousReference:CM (72) 34thConclusions,Minute secret*7. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the allegations ofcorruption in public life which formed the subject of a Motion tabledin the House of Commons by the Liberal Party. The Home Secretarywithdrew from the Cabinet at this point; and the Attorney Generaljoined the discussion.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet faced a difficult anddelicate problem.   It would be correct that, before reaching their
political decision on the course which they should adopt, they shouldbe advised by the Attorney General about the legal aspects of thematter.The Attorney General said that the public examination in bank-ruptcy of Mr. John Poulson, although recently suspended by reasonof Mr. Poulson&apos;s illness, had already brought to light certain facts which appeared to provide grounds for further investigation by thepolice. In addition to various actions by Mr. Poulson and hisimmediate associates which might well form the subject of criminal proceedings for fraud, there were grounds for supposing that otherindividuals, including 2 Members of Parliament, several civil servants and various individuals in public life in the north of England, hadbeen parties to transactions in connection with Mr. Poulson&apos;s interests which could expose them to charges of corruption, particularly in sofar as some of them appeared to have received considerable sums ofmoney in circumstances which suggested that these might have rep-resented payment for past or current services. The Home secretary was also involved in Mr. Poulson&apos;s affairs in so far as in 1966 he hadpromoted a company, International Technical and ConstructionalServices Ltd. (ITCS), whose purpose was to obtain foreign contracts forarchitectural and construction work of the kind in which Mr. Poulsonwas interested; and various members of his family had been associated -ated with this company in one capacity or another. When it firstappeared in 1969 that Mr. Poulson might be insolvent, the HomeSecretary himself had insisted that reputable accountants, in theperson of Cooper Brothers, should investigate the situation; andwhen they had confirmed Mr. Poulson&apos;s insolvency the HomeSecretary had resigned in November, 1969. During the three years inquestion, he had received no payment himself from Mr. Poulson; buta sum of  22,000 had been paid at his request to the trust fund of a theatre in which he was interested.There seemed to be little doubt from the private statement which Mr. Poulson had made during the bankruptcy proceedingsthat one of his main purposes now was to defame the Home secretary and to involve him, if possible, in his own disgrace. He had madevarious disreputable allegations about the Home Secretary&apos;s personalconduct, which might well prove to be wholly false. In particular,he had alleged that during a visit to the Middle East he had openedcertain letters which he had been asked by the Home Secretary to convey and had ascertained that they appeared to be designed topromote the interests of a United States company, the Real EstateCompany of America, which had subsequently become the subjectof legal proceedings in the United States. The Home Secretary hadbeen involved in this company; and Mr. Poulson&apos;s allegation was clearly designed to aggravate the recent speculation about hisassociation with its activities. Nevertheless, there was so far no evi-dence in the bankruptcy proceedings that the Home Secretary had been guilty of any impropriety in his dealings with Mr. Poulson, althoughit might be necessary both to give further consideration to hisposition in the latter half of 1969, when he had remained a director ofITCS at a time when he might be expected to have known that Mr.
Poulson was insolvent, and to inquire further into the taxationaspects of the payments which had been made on his behalf to the theatre trust. For the rest, there could be little doubt that when theOfficial Receivers report on the bankruptcy proceedings became available in a few days&apos; time it would indicate that there were grounds for further inquiry into the conduct of many of the other individuals concerned. He himself, together with the Lord Advocate, hadalready reached this conclusion; and they had agreed that, since the alleged offences had occurred in several parts of the United Kingdom,the necessary inquiries should be entrusted to the MetropolitanPolice. They would necessarily take a considerable time to complete;and, although it was possible that in the result only relatively minorprosecutions might be instituted, it seemed more likely that in somecases serious criminal charges would be preferred. Nevertheless, itwas essential that the law should be allowed to take its normal course; and the only reason for which he would be entitled to take any different view on grounds of the public interest would be adecision by the Cabinet that the issues involved were of such a character as to require investigation by a Tribunal appointed underthe Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921. This course, however,would involve a deliberate departure from the normal process oflaw; and, although it might not necessarily preclude a subsequentinquiry under the Companies Acts, it would carry the implication that all those involved would have to be granted immunity from further criminal proceedings. It would only be in extreme circum-stances, therefore, that this could be justified.At this point the Attorney General withdrew.The Prime Minister said that in the circumstances described bythe Attorney General only two courses were open to the Cabinet either to let the law take the course which it would naturally adopt atthis point or to promote an inquiry under the 1921 Act, which appeared to provide the only means of bringing under comprehensiveexamination the activities of various groups of individuals who,although normally entitled to be judged by rather different criteriaof behaviour, were in this instance implicated in the same offencesand must therefore be dealt with on the same basis. Both courseswere open to the objection that they would take, a long time, duringwhich those involved would inevitably be subjected to considerableembarrassment. The Government should certainly not frustrate thenormalprocess of law; and it was particularly distasteful to contem-plate granting immunity from criminal proceedings to individuals who were almost certainly guilty of criminal offences. On the otherhand public opinion might not be satisfied by a normal criminalprosecution; and the pressure for some form of more general inquirymight persist. Moreover, there were certain aspects of the situation,particularly as regards the conduct of the Members of Parliamentinvolved, which did not fall within the purview of legal process andmight be examined more appropriately by a different form of inquiry.The situation was further complicated by the fact that the HomeSecretary was the Minister who was responsible both for the adminis-
tration of the Metropolitan Police and for the constitution of anyTribunal established under the 1921 Act.Finally, it would clearly be necessary to give further consider-ation to the desirability of reopening Parliamentary discussion ofthe issues examined by a Select Committee on Members&apos; Interestsin 1969.In discussion there was general agreement that the law shouldbe allowed to take its normal course. This would admittedly involvesuspending one or more civil servants for possibly a long period during which they might be entitled to continue to draw full pay; andit would also entail the risk that the Government might be accused of refusing to appoint a Tribunal of Inquiry under the 1921 Act becausecertain Members of Parliament were involved. On the other hand,the objections to such Tribunals were formidable and were wellknown; and whenever this procedure had been adopted, it had alwaysprovoked public protest against the distress and embarrassmentwhich were inevitably inflicted on many individuals who were onlymarginally involved and were often wholly innocent. It would benecessary, however, to ensure that, if the Government finallypreferred criminal prosecution to a Tribunal of Inquiry, their motiveswere not misunderstood; and it would be important to emphasise that in those cases in which the evidence was insufficient to justifycriminal proceedings it would remain open to the authorities profes-provisionally responsible in each instance to institute their own inquiriesinto the conduct of the various groups of individuals concerned.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were unanimous in deciding that the law should be allowedto take its normal course and that, if the report of the OfficialReceiver indicated that there were grounds for police inquiries as a preliminary to criminal prosecution, those inquiries should be put inhand forthwith. For the moment it should suffice if he indicated inthe House of Commons that afternoon that the Attorney General andthe Lord Advocate were considering the evidence given at Mr.Poulson&apos;s public examination and were awaiting the preliminaryreport of the Official Receiver and that he hoped to make a further statement in the following week.Cabinet Office,14 July, 1972.
