confidential parliamentary 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet also discussed the Opposition Motion of Censureabout the form of the European Communities Bill. This Motionwould be debated on Monday, 6 March. It was possible that theOpposition would agree to allot one of their Supply Days for thepurpose. The Cabinet agreed, however, that, if they pressed forGovernment time, it would be prudent to concede it; but in that event it might have to be made clear that repeated demands for theallocation of Government time for Censure Motions constituted anabuse of procedure which could not be allowed to continue indefinitely.The Prime Minister said that he proposed to make a statement in the House of Commons that afternoon about the Report of theCommittee of Privy Counsellors on interrogation. Copies of his proposed statement and of the Report itself, which would also bepublished that afternoon, had been circulated to the Cabinet (CP (72)25). He would state that the Government, having reviewed the whole matter with great care and with particular reference to any future operations, had decided that the techniques which the Committeeexamined would not be used in future as an aid to interrogation;and he would confirm that the Northern Ireland Government, whowere constitutionally responsible for the matter in the Six Counties,would adopt the same policy. The Lord Chancellor would make acorresponding statement in the House of Lords.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers statement.secret oversea Affairs 2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thereTurkey: were several difficult aspects of the case of Timothy Davey, theImprisonment 14-year-old boy who had been convicted on the previous day by- of British Turkish court on a charge of conspiring to traffic in drugs and hadSubject been sentenced to imprisonment for more than six years.  Therewere grounds for believing that the offence in question had not beenslight; but, even so, the imposition of so severe a prison sentence ona juvenile would be liable to be strongly condemned by publicopinion in this country. It would not be possible to contemplate any active intervention while the case was under appeal. But hehad asked the Turkish Ambassador in London how far it might bepossible for the Turkish authorities to exercise a measure of clemency,since it appeared that the President of Turkey might be able to intervene after the appeal had been heard.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, reporting on his recent visit to Spain, informed the Cabinet that the Spanish ForeignMinister, Senor Lopez Bravo, had indicated that the Spanish Govern-ment would be willing to conclude a new treaty of friendship andco-operation with Britain and that, provided that it recognisedSpanish sovereignty over Gibraltar, they would be content that itEuropeanCommunitiesBillPreviousReference:CM (72) 7thConclusions,Minute 2The ParkerReportPreviousReference:CM (72) 7thConclusions,Minute 3SpainPreviousReference:CM (72) 10thConclusions,Minute 4
should include whatever conditions might be required to safeguard the interests of the population of Gibraltar and to permit the UnitedKingdom Government to continue to enjoy full use of defence facilities at the base. These proposals would require very carefulconsideration, not least because it must be very doubtful whether theywould be acceptable to opinion in Gibraltar itself. He had suggested to the Spanish Head of State, General Franco, that an accommodation in relation to Gibraltar might be more easily achieved if the SpanishGovernment were first to remove some of the restrictions which theyhad sought to apply to the Colony. General Franco, however, had appeared unwilling to contemplate any relaxation of restrictions inthe absence of simultaneous concessions by the British Government.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.SECRETIndustrial 3.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at the meeting ofAffairs the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy on the previous dayNational Goal the Committee had discussed proposals by the Secretary of State for board Finances Trade and Industry to meet the deficit which the National coal board (NCB) now expected to incur in the current year, primarily asa result of the coalminers&apos; strike. The Committee had approved theproposals to raise the  75 million statutory limit on the Board&apos;saccumulated deficit to  100 million and the  900 million statutory limit on the Board&apos;s borrowing powers to  950 million, both by affirmative Resolution. Since the Board&apos;s deficit would certainlyexceed  100 million, perhaps by  80 million or more, the Committeehad also approved the proposal to introduce a Spring supplementary estimate providing the Board with an emergency grant of  80 million,which would go as far as possible in keeping them within the law,while not pre-empting future decisions on policy for the industry.A rise in the price of coal was also necessary; but the Committee hadnot reached a decision about its size. The NCB had proposed a5 per cent increase, to take effect from 13 April for industrial andgeneral purpose coal and from 1 July for domestic coal. Thegeneral view of the Committee, however, was that an increase of1\ per cent might be justified in the exceptional circumstancesconfronting the NCB, provided that a firm assurance could beobtained from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) that anincrease of this order would not be regarded as prejudicing the futureof their policy on price restraint. It was proposed that all these measures should be announced later that day in a/statement in theHouse of Commons, a draft of which had been circulated to theCabinet. This would make it clear that they were all interimmeasures pending legislation later in the Session on the further financial arrangements to be made with the NCB.In discussion it was questioned whether an increase in coal price as large as 1\ per cent might both create embarrassment in relationto the CBFs policy of price restraint and inevitably pre-empt to someextent decisions on the future role of the coal industry, with possible
implications for employment in the mines. On the other hand the cbi had already said that they regarded the circumstances of thecase as exceptional and that an increase of 1\ per cent in the priceof coal would not, therefore, breach the general policy of price restraint. It was already publicly known before the settlement of thestrike that a 5 per cent increase in price was intended; and the NCBwere now content to seek the agreement of the Coal ConsumerCouncils to a 1\ per cent increase, which the coal trade would alsounderstand and accept. Even a 1\ per cent increase would still leavethe Board with a substantial deficit. Its public presentation, however,required further consideration. The draft statement contained no reference to the possibility that the Government might now think it right to encourage alternative fuels for the generation of electricity;but many of the Governments supporters would feel that the coalindustry should henceforward be allowed to find its true economiclevel in the energy market. Moreover, it would be important to associate the increase in price with the cost of the pay settlementarising from the Wilberforce Court of Inquiry, rather than with amore imprecise estimate of the total cost of the strike. It might alsobe preferable to express the increase in terms of cost per ton ratherthan on a percentage basis.In further discussion of the draft statement the following main points were made (a) In view of the possibility of further industrial disturbance inthe near future it was open to question whether it was wise to emphasised-sise the exceptional measures being paid for by the Government inorder to reduce coal consumption and to rebuild stocks to normallevels.(b) Several price increases had already been announced that week; and it would be preferable to defer the proposed statement tothe following Monday. Alternative arrangements should be madeas regards the Supplementary Estimate which was required.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for Trade and industry should take the action which he had proposed in order to meet theNational Coal Board&apos;s deficit, including an increase of 1\ per cent in coal prices, on the understanding that this level of increase was acceptable to the CBI. The proposed Parliamentary statement should be made on the following Monday and should first be revised,on the lines suggested in discussion, by the Secretary of State for trade and Industry in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Lord President. /The Cabinet-1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Lord President, to revise the draft statementaccordingly.
Railway Pay The Home Secretary said that a meeting of Ministers under his negotiations, chairmanship had considered the tactics for dealing with the forth-coming negotiations on railwaymen&apos;s pay in the light of an assessment of the strength of the unions&apos; case and the damage which a railway strike would cause. The meeting had identified three options.Adherence to a level of increase determined without regard to the findings of the Wilberforce report on the miners&apos; pay claim wouldbe likely to provoke an immediate strike, in which the rail unionscould expect support from the National Union of Mineworkers.This would be especially damaging at a time when coal stocks were at a vulnerable level. Second, a settlement might be sought throughindependent arbitration; but the outcome might be seriouslydamaging to the Governments incomes policy, particularly since thenew chairman of the Railway Arbitration Tribunal was known to bewell disposed to the unions. Third, a settlement could be sought by negotiation; and the meeting had concluded that, initially, thiscourse should be adopted. They accordingly recommended that theCabinet should authorise the Chairman of the British railways board (BRB) in his discussions with the rail unions on 7/8 March toreach a settlement, if possible, at a cost not exceeding 10 per cent ofthe annual wage bill and, if this proved unacceptable, to seek to havethe negotiations adjourned, avoiding a breakdown and consultingMinisters again urgently. If a breakdown could not be preventedand the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen(ASLEF) called a national strike despite the fact that the present pay agreement was not due to expire until the end of April, the Secretaryof State for Employment would wish to consider invoking his powers under the Industrial Relations Act to apply to the National industrial relations Court (NIRC) for a restraint order.The Minister for Transport Industries said that many of thearguments which had led the Wilberforce Court of Inquiry torecommend exceptional treatment of the miners&apos; pay claim could beapplied equally to railwaymen, a number of whom were lowly paid,including a few whose take-home pay was as little as  14 a week.The Chairman of BRB would accordingly face difficult negotiations,which would be complicated by the fact that the objectives of the two principle unions differed. The main purpose of the National Unionof Railwaymen (NUR) was to achieve a significant improvement inbase rates, whereas ASLEF were more concerned to restore their members&apos; former differentials over other railway workers. In thesecircumstances the Government needed to assure the Chairman both that they would allow him reasonable discretion in the negotiations,subject to appropriate guidelines, and that hex had Ministers&apos;confidence.In discussion there was some support for the proposal that theChairman of BRB should be authorised to negotiate a settlement onthe basis of an increase not exceeding 10 per cent and should be givenreasonable tactical discretion within that limit. On the other hand the importance of these negotiations was such that the cabinet should not settle the negotiating limits until they had been able tomake a more thorough assessment of the strength of the unions&apos; case,the risks attaching to industrial action and the measures which
might be taken to counter it. It was also necessary to decide whether,in addition to prescribing the limit which BRB should not exceed intheir attempt to reach an agreed settlement, the Government should determine the level of the Board&apos;s opening offer; and to consider theattitude which the Government should adopt if it became clear that even at 10 per cent a settlement was unobtainable. If BRB indicated a readiness to offer 10 per cent and no settlement were then reached,that figure might become the minimum level of increase for purposesof a reference to arbitration, which, in the circumstances of therailways, could produce an award which would be unacceptable tothe Government.In further discussion, the following main points were made (a) Although it must be the aim to avoid reference of thedispute to arbitration, it was impossible for the Government, con-sistently with their general policy, publicly to discourage the railunions from adopting this course.(b) In view of the vulnerability of coal and electricity suppliesfollowing the miners&apos; strike, it would be important to try to avoid a breakdown in the negotiations on 7/8 March. Thereafter, the nation&apos;capacity to withstand a rail strike would progressively improveas coal stocks were rebuilt. Accordingly, it was desirable to givethe Chairman of BRB a sufficient degree of negotiating flexibility,subject to clear guidelines, to ensure that no early chance of areasonable settlement would be lost. The membership of ASLEFwas in a militant mood; and it was only by a bare majority that theunion Executive had decided to participate in the forthcoming discussions. If they failed then to receive an offer which they regarded as a reasonable basis for continuing negotiations, industrial action was likely to follow very quickly.(c) Before calling an official strike, ASLEF could be expectedto give a week&apos;s notice. Since the present pay agreement did notexpire until the end of April and an official rail strike would cause serious economic damage, there would be strong grounds for anapplication to NIRC for a restraint order under the industrial relations Act. But there was a considerable risk of immediateunofficial action if the negotiations on 7/8 March ended in a break-down; and the scope for using the Industrial Relations Act powerssuccessfully in that contingency would need further consideration.(d) If steps were taken now to alert public opinion to the threat of an imminent rail strike and its possible consequences, the reactionagainst the prospect of renewed hardship and inconvenience might give the unions pause. /(e) Now that the remaining provisions of the Industrial relations act were in force, it was urgently necessary to ensure wider under-standing of their effect on the law governing picketing and toemphasise, in particular, that mere numbers could constituteintimidation and made massive picketing unlawful. The enforce-ment of the law on picketing, however, must remain a matter forthe police, Who must take account of what was practicable in a given situation.  Now that the unions were corporate bodies,
injunctions secured in the civil courts might be more effective as a means of containing picketing than was judged to be the case beforethe Industrial Relations Act was fully in force.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thesuccessful management of the railwaymen&apos;s pay claim and the threatened rail strike would be of cardinal importance to the Govern-ment and the country. Before deciding the strategy to be followed,the Cabinet would need to have a full assessment of the strength andweakness of the railwaymen&apos;s case, together with the industrial power which the rail unions could mobilise and the damage which theycould cause, if they resorted to a strike. The Cabinet should also consider the means by which public opinion might effectively been gaged in order to deter or to defeat industrial action; the possible use of the powers under the Industrial Relations Act to obtain arestraint order; and the prospects of dealing more effectively withillegal picketing under the law as it now stood, including the possi-bility of promoting applications in the civil courts for injunctionsagainst unions in their new capacity as corporate bodies. Memorandadealing with all these matters should be prepared urgently and circulated to the Cabinet, which would meet to consider them on thefollowing Monday. At that point it would also be necessary todetermine the guidance which the Government should give to theChairman of the BRB in conducting negotiations with the rail unions.The Cabinet 3. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of this part of their discussion.4. Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment to circulate memoranda describing the strength and weakness of the railwaymen&apos;s pay claim and the implications of thevarious ways in which it might be treated; and assessing the likelihood, extent and effectiveness of industrial action by the rail unions, taking account of possible support fromother unions.5. Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to circulate a memorandum on the impact of a rail strike on fuel supplies and on industry generally.6. Invited the Secretary of State for Employment to circulate a memorandum about the possible use of the powers under the Industrial Relations Act to apply for a restraintorder in relation both to official and unofficial industrial action.7. Invited the Attorney General, in consultation with the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Employment, to circulate a memorandum describing the practical effectof the present law on picketing and assessing the prospects of promoting criminal or civil action to restrain illegalpicketing and the inducement of breaches of commercialcontracts.
8. Invited the Lord President of the Council to give furtherconsideration to means of mobilising public opinion to deter or defeat industrial action by the rail unions.northern ireland previous reference:CM (72) 9thConclusionsSECRET4.
