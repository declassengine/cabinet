TheLegislativeProgramme1971-72 SessionPreviousReference :CM (72) 24thConclusions,Minute 1SECRET*2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Presi-dent of the Council (CP (72) 48) on the Programme of LegislativeBusiness 1971-1972.The Lord President said that in the period 15 May to 4 Augustthere would be 55 sitting days, after allowing for a week&apos;s break atWhitsun. He estimated that 52 of these days would be needed for essential legislation and other business which could not be deferred until after the Summer Adjournment. There would inevitably bemore demands than could be met for the use of the few remainingdays. Because of the difficulties likely to be encountered by theHouse of Lords, he would arrange for Bills to be completed in theHouse of Commons and sent to the House of Lords as quickly as was practicable. The main problems arose over the european communities Bill and the Local Government Bill. There werecompelling reasons why the European Communities Bill should been acted by mid-September; and it was highly desirable that theLocal Government Bill should be enacted by the end of September.Neither Bill, therefore, could be held over and taken after the summer Adjournment, at the end of the Session. It was not realisticto allocate more than two days a week to the Committee stage of theEuropean Communities Bill. He hoped to be able to send the Billto the House of Lords by mid-July; and he intended to arrange forthe Local Government Bill to reach the House of Lords in advanceof the European Communities Bill. While Government supporters in the House of Lords would be prepared to forgo their holidays inorder to ensure the passage of the European Communities Bill theycould not be expected to support the Local Government Bill in that way once the European Communities Bill had been completed.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It was very desirable that the European Communities Billshould become law before the Common Market referenda in norway and Denmark took place towards the end of September.(b) Departments considered that ideally a number of amend-ments should be made to that Bill; a particularly important oneconcerned the provisions in Clause 6, relating^o the common agricul-tural policy. Any amendments would, however, gravely affect theprogramme for the Bill. If they were made in the House of Com-mons a Report stage which could otherwise have been avoidedwould be required; this would inevitably occupy much valuable timeand delay the Bill. If, on the other hand, amendments were madein the House of Lords then it would be necessary to recall the House* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.secret parliamentary 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs jjjg jjouse of Commons in the following week.
of Commons during the Summer Recess to deal with those amend-ments; and such a course could not be contemplated.(c) While it was highly desirable to enact the Local government bill by the end of September, it would not be possible, in the caseof that Bill, to avoid amendments in the House of Lords; indeedsome Government amendments were contemplated. There wouldbe obvious difficulties, therefore, if Lords amendments had not beenconsidered by the House of Commons before the Summer Adjourn-ment.(d) If the Housing (Financial Provisions) (Scotland) Bill were notenacted by mid-July it would not be possible to bring the new rentarrangements into effect on 1 October, the date to which the Govern-ment were committed, unless an amendment were introduced toenable the Secretary of State for Scotland to make a commencementorder in respect of the relevant provisions. In this way he could reduce the period of one month between enactment and commence-ment if this should prove to be necessary. The inevitable contro-versy over this amendment was preferable to risking a failure tointroduce the new scheme on the planned date and thereby enabling the Opposition to claim success for their tactics.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet accepted the general lines of the programme as at presentforeseen by the Lord President of the Council. They warmly con-gratulated the Lord President and the Chief Whip on their handling of the Session&apos;s heavy legislative programme. The consequences ofany amendments to the European Economic Communities Bill were so serious that it was essential that none was made. departments should be so instructed. The Cabinet agreed to the amendment tothe Housing (Financial Provisions) (Scotland) Bill proposed in discussion.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Ministers concerned to be guided accordingly.OverseaAffairsVietnamPreviousReference:CM (72) 24thConclusions,Minute 3SECRET3. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary informed theCabinet that the military situation in Vietnam was more stable inthat the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, following its recentsetbacks and the subsequent changes in command, was now main-taining its ground more firmly. It was uncertain, however, whetherthe air attacks mounted by v the United States Air Force were yethaving a significant effect upon the supply lines supporting theNorth Vietnamese Army in South Vietnam; and it was possible thata renewed attack on Hue might be under preparation. There was so far no evidence of any operations to sweep the mines which united States forces had laid off North Vietnamese ports.Preparations were still going forward for the forthcoming meeting in
Moscow between the President of the United States, Mr. Nixon,and the leaders of the Soviet Government; but the President^position in these discussions would be liable to become very difficultif the military situation in Vietnam deteriorated further. We would continue to press the Soviet Government to agree that the geneva conference should be reconvened under British and Soviet co-chair-manship. Nevertheless, there seemed little likelihood of Sovietagreement to this course; and a resumption of the discussions inParis between representatives of the United States and North Viet-namese Governments might afford a better prospect of progress towards a settlement.GermanyPreviousReference:CM (72) 24thConclusions,Minute 3The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary informed the Cab-inet that after various complex political manoeuvres in the federal german Republic, the Lower House had voted (though not by an absolute majority) in favour of the ratification of the Treaties con-cluded by the Federal Government with the Soviet Union and with poland. It seemed probable that the Upper House would also vote infavour of ratification and that the need for the Federal Governmentto achieve an absolute majority in the Lower House would therefore not arise. Nevertheless, it was still uncertain how long the federal chancellor, Herr Brandt, would be able to retain sufficient Parlia-mentary support for his Administration; there were several issues,apart from the Eastern Treaties, upon which he might be defeated.The Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.rhodesia previous reference:CM (72) 24thConclusions,Minute 4SECRET*4. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that LordPearce&apos;s Report on the Test of Acceptability concluded that theterms of the proposed constitutional settlement were not acceptable to the great majority of Rhodesian Africans. It would not be possibleto override this finding and to proceed with the implementation ofthe proposals, since to do so would suggest that we were preparedto abandon the Fifth Principle. The reaction of Mr. Ian Smith, the rhodesian leader, to whom a copy of the Report had been conveyedin confidence on the previous day by Sir Denis Greenhill, the Perm-anent Under-Secretary of State, was not yet known; but, if it wasextreme, further progress towards an eventual settlement wouldbecome extremely difficult. In these circumstances, there would be great advantage in an interval for reflection by those concerned;and it was to be hoped that Mr. Smith would concur. If he did,we could maintain, for purposes of public discussion, that it wasimpossible in the light of the findings of the Pearce Commission toproceed immediately to a settlement but that we should endeavourto keep all options open and should meanwhile maintain ourrelations with Rhodesia on the present basis. It would help to create* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
the most propitious climate for further examination of the optionsif it could be made clear at once that, in the absence of a settlement,sanctions would have to be retained. The Law Officers had advised that the unilateral abrogation of sanctions would not be acceptablein international law.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that we should now work to secure agreement on an interval in which all parties could reflect upon possible newapproaches to the negotiation of a settlement; but much would depend upon the reaction of Mr. Smith&apos;s regime to the Pearce Report.The Report would be published on 23 May; and it would be neces-sary for the Cabinet to give further consideration on 22 May, in thelight of Sir Denis Greenhilfs report of his exchanges with Mr. Smith,to the content of the Parliamentary Statement to be made by theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary simultaneously with its publication.The Cabinet-Took note of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.northern ireland previous reference:CM (72) 24thConclusions,Minute 2CONFIDENTIAL5. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland informed theCabinet of the latest situation in the Province. His statement wasseparately recorded and issued only to The Queen, the PrimeMinister and those Ministers who had to take action. The statement is recorded separately in the standard file held by the Secretary ofthe Cabinet.IndustrialAffairsUnemploymentStatisticsPreviousReference:CM (72) 14thConclusions,Minute 3IndustrialAction inthe DocksPreviousReference:CM (72) 24thConclusions,Minute 5CONFIDENTIAL6. The Secretary of State for Employment informed theCabinet of the monthly unemployment statistics to be published that day, which showed, for the first time for many months, asubstantial decrease in the number of unemployed. Between the april and May counts, total unemployment in Great Britain andNorthern Ireland had fallen from over 1 million to 902,000. Therewas also a sizeable increase in the number of unfilled vacanciesnotified. An analysis of the factors, such as the temporary registra-tion of students, which affected the basic unemployment statisticswould be completed shortly.The Secretary of State for Employment said that it now seemed likely that, on the expiry of the 28 days&apos; notice of dispute already given by the Transport and General Workers Union, the union would give the port employers 14 days&apos; notice of strike action. Hehad seen both sides in the dispute, in which a number of issues were involved.  The union officials did not seem to desire a strike, but
Railwaymen&apos;sPayNegotiationsPreviousReference:CM (72) 25thConclusions,Minute 2there was some risk that militant elements might prevail. In thedispute over the loading and unloading of containers the union&apos;sobjective was unclear, but there was doubt whether the remedy laywholly within the employers&apos; competence. He had made it clearthat the union must itself find a solution to the problem of &quot; black-ing &quot; of containers. The negotiations over the guaranteed minimum wage were continuing. The other main issue was the redundancyamongst dockers and tally clerks caused by the transfer of containerhandling to premises where labour other than dock labour could beused. Only about 5 per cent of the total number of containers beinghandled in the docks was involved and he was hopeful that it mightbe possible to find a short-term solution which would bridge the gapuntil the continuing rundown of dock employees had reduced their total number to the level of the work available. He would be seeingthose concerned again later in the week. He proposed, in conjunc-tion with the Minister for Transport Industries, to circulate to hiscolleagues shortly a paper setting out ideas for a solution based onimproving the efficiency of the existing arrangements rather thanmaking major organisational changes.The Cabinet 1.  Took note of the statements by the Secretary of State for employment.The Secretary of State for Employment said that, partly as aresult of delaying tactics by the rail unions, the Court of Appeal.would not now be in a position to give its decision on the unions&apos;appeals against the Industrial Courts ballot Order as early as hadbeen expected. It would therefore be necessary for the Governmentand the British Railways Board (BRB) to be ready to act quicklyonce the Courts decision was announced. Since the industrial court had not granted the unions a stay of execution, the Commis-sion for Industrial Relations (CIR) intended to proceed with the ballot on the following Saturday unless the Court of Appeal gaveinstructions to the contrary. The BRB would then need immediately to mount a comprehensive campaign urging railwaymen to vote infavour of accepting the Board&apos;s offer.The Secretary of State for the Environment said that the BRBhad already made arrangements for Press advertising. In additionthey would place into every railwayman^ pay packet details of the pay he would receive from 1 June if the board&apos;s offer were accepted,by comparison with his current pay; they would be publishing aspecial free edition of Rail News giving the history of the negotiations-ations and full details of the offer for every grade; and they wouldalso publish the latter information in poster form for management to display.In discussion the following main points were made (a) Whilst it would be inadvisable for the Government tocampaign directly for the acceptance of the BRB offer, much couldbe done through other channels to support the Board&apos;s campaign.However it might be desirable to find means of emphasising the
generosity of the settlement now on offer to railwaymen, the BRB&apos;sresolve not to seek Government help in increasing their 12^ per centoffer, and the fact that there would be no Government pressure onthe Board to do so. It would be important to stress that any furtherindustrial action now would be solely directed to securing back pay for the period 1 May to 1 June and could well cost those taking it more than the amount at issue.(b) An adverse vote would not place the Board under any moralcommitment to meet the unions&apos; claim, since the ballot was aboutthe resumption of industrial action, not about the level of the pro-posed settlement.(c) The CIR&apos;s proposed film giving guidance on the ballotarrangements did not seem particularly helpful, and would be shown on television only if the Secretary of State for Employment gavewritten instructions to the British Broadcasting Corporation and theIndependent Television Authority. Since the ballot had been ordered by the Industrial Court and not by him, he had been strongly advised against doing so.(d) It would be necessary to consider how the Governmentshould act if the Court of Appeal upheld the unions&apos; appeal, or ifthe outcome of a ballot indicated support for further industrial action.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, if a ballot took place, it would be important to take all possible steps toarrange for the case for acceptance of the BRB&apos;s offer to be con-vincingly put before railwaymen and the public. He would arrangefor the Ministers most concerned to consider further what action the Government should take if the unions&apos; appeal were upheld or ifthe outcome of the ballot favoured a renewal of industrial action.The Cabinet-2.  Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.confidential . The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Lord Privy Seal(CP (72) 52) and the Secretary of State for Education and Science(CP (72) 53) about the future financing of the Research Councils inthe light of the recommendations in the report by Lord Rothschildattached to the Green Paper, A Framework for government research and Development, Cmnd. 4814.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Government were committedboth to implement the customer/contractor principle in respect ofthe applied research and development (R and D) of the research councils and to preserve the Councils themselves, in a viable form,under the sponsorship of the Department of Education and Science.Lord Rothschikfs report transfers to &quot;customer&quot; Departments ofabout 25 per cent of the funds of the Medical Research CouncilAllocationof Funds tothe research councils
(MRC), 50 per cent of those of the Natural Environment research council (NERC) and 75 per cent of those of the agricultural research Council (ARC), making about  28 million in all (for1971-72 at 1971 prices). At a recent meeting of the ministerial committee on Science and Technology the customer departments had maintained that the proposed transfers should be endorsed andimplemented in full in 1972-73. The Secretary of State for Edu-cation and Science, however, had argued for a smaller transfer; andthe Committee had been unable to resolve this difference. A decisionon the issue was now needed urgently, in order that the drafting ofthe White Paper on Government R and D, publication of whichhad been promised in June, might be completed. In his view theright balance between the respective needs of the customer Depart-ments to acquire additional support for their main activities, andof the Councils to discharge the functions with which they wereinvested by their Charters would best be achieved by transferring 10 million in 1973-74 rising to  20 million in 1975-76, providedthat the safeguards indicated at Annex to CP (72) 52 were accepted.These sums were expressed in terms of 1971-72 prices and excludedany provision for the Nature Conservancy, the Institute of Hydrol-ogy and the Soil Survey, which were under separate discussion.The Secretary of State for Education and Science said that neither she herself nor the Councils opposed the customer/contractorprinciple; all concerned wished to make the Councils more respon-sive to the needs of the executive Departments. But the scale and timing of the proposed transfers needed careful consideration. Thedemands of the customer Departments on the science Vote raisedgrave issues for the Research Council system. If these demands were met but the science budget was not increased, the ARC andNERC would be left with insufficient funds to support their Charterfunctions; and the Governments pledge to preserve their viabilitywould be seen to be broken. The Councils had offered transfersamounting to  7 million. She proposed that  10 million should betransferred in 1973-74, rising to  17 million in 1977-78; and, ifallowance was made for the expected growth of the science budget,this would leave an adequate base of  50 million for the Charterwork of the three Councils. Taking account of the proposal tostrengthen Departmental membership of the Councils, this should enable a new system of partnership to be established betweenCouncils and Departments.In discussion there was general agreement that substantialtransfers should be made from Research Councils to customerDepartments if the Governments announced acceptance of the customer/contractor principle, and the change of policy which thisimplied, were to be taken seriously. In terms of the requirementsof the customer Departments, these transfers should amount to 25 percent of the MRCs funds in the case of the Department of health and Social Security, the Department of Employment and the Scot-tish and Welsh Offices, and to 75 per cent of the ARCs budget inthe case of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. At thesame time it was accepted that the Councils must remain viable.
It was suggested that this would be the case even if transfers were affected at the level recommended by the customer Departments,since most of the funds involved would still represent work to becarried out by the Councils; and neither they nor the universities,therefore, would suffer. On the other hand it was held that in orderto remain viable the Councils needed to retain complete control oversubstantial funds and that only the MRC would be viable if transferson the scale now envisaged were implemented.Moreover, the scientific community, who had been fully con-suited, were generally opposed to transfers of this magnitude; and,although the Government were not obliged to endorse this view, to ignore it completely would be unnecessarily to alienate responsiblescientific opinion. There was general agreement, however, thatthe advice of the Select Committee on Science and Technology, that further studies should precede any transfer at all, should be rejected,since this would merely entail further delay.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that funds should be transferred from the research councils to customer. Departments on the general basis recom-mended by the Lord Privy Seal in paragraph 6, option iii, of cp (72) 52 and that work carried out by the Councils for customerDepartments should be on the basis of commissions for specificprogrammes and not grants-in-aid. The transfers, of specific sums,should be made within a three-year timetable. This would allowtime for the required scientific organisations to be established in allthe customer Departments and for Research Council programmes to be modified in an orderly manner; but the process would not beas protracted as to provide opportunity for further dispute betweenCouncils and Departments which might damage their basic relation-ships. The Cabinet considered that the extent of the transfers in specific years and the allocations to individual customer Depart-ments should be further examined; and he would arrange for the issues involved to be discussed by the Ministers concerned.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing-up of their discussion.SECRET*8. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Lord privy seal (CP (72) 39 and 51) about the first report of the Top salaries review Body (the Boyle Report) on the pay of top public servants.The Lord Privy Seal said &quot;that the Boyle Report had been sub-mitted on 17 March 1972. It recommended increases in the pay of the higher Civil Service, senior Armed Service officers, the higher judiciary and Board members of nationalised industries to takeFirst Reporton Top public servants bythe TopSalariesReview Body
effect from 1 January, 1972, and ranging from  1,000 to  2,500 perannum. Since the recommendations were the outcome of the firstsubstantive review of the pay of these groups since mid-1969, thepercentage increases ranged from 3 - 9 per cent at the top to 8 - 4 percent at the bottom, and represented 6-8 per cent overall, whenexpressed at an annual compound rate. The Ministerial steering committee on Pay Negotiations had agreed that the recommen-dations were acceptable in substance. But they had so far felt that,while the Report and the Governments acceptance of it should be announced as soon as possible, it would not be sensible to do thiswhile the situation over the railwaymen&apos;s pay remained delicate.However, the staff representatives were exerting growing pressure for an early announcement and were themselves in increasing diffi-culty with their members. If they were forced into a public campaignover the delay in dealing with the Boyle Report, the Governmentcould be considerably embarrassed. Delay also meant that mostof the higher judiciary would lose part of the recommended pay increase because the legislative arrangements required to implementit did not allow for backdating. He believed that the best coursenow would be to announce the Governments acceptance of theReport during the period of preparation for the railwaymen&apos;s ballot,while the rail dispute itself was quiescent. If that opportunity werenot taken, an announcement might have to be delayed for severalmore weeks and there would be a growing risk that, in addition tothe awkward pressures for the Report to be published, its recom-mendations would leak and be presented in a manner calculated to embarrass the Government. If his colleagues agreed, the announce-ment might most suitably be made by the Prime Minister in response to an oral Parliamentary Question. Alternatively, he would wishto give the staff representatives an early assurance, in confidence,that the continuing delay in publishing the Report did not mean that the recommended pay increases were at risk; and that theywould be implemented in full and from the due date. In order thatsuch assurances should be effective in reducing the pressure on theStaff Side for some public militant action, they would need to be passed on to a few key people and it was therefore possible that the assurances would leak. But this would be much less damaging thana public campaign against the delay in publishing the Report.In discussion there was general agreement that the Governmentshould implement the recommendations in the Boyle Report: theyhad undertaken to accept the reports of Pay Review Bodies in theabsence of clear and compelling reasons for not doing so. It was arguable that, as there was rarely a wholly propitious time for pub-lishing and announcing the Governments acceptance of such reports, it was normally best for this to be done as soon as possible after they were submitted, so that the Government should not beopen to the charge of delaying publication for political reasons. Onthis argument the Governments acceptance of the Boyle report should now be announced without further delay. It was argued,on the other hand, that, as publication had already been postponedsince March, it would not be sensible to release the Report nowuntil after the completion of the railwaymen&apos;s ballot. The Report
was concerned with the pay of senior people from whom theGovernment were entitled to expect an understanding and respon-sible attitude. It should not therefore be necessary for the lord privy Seal to convey to their representatives an assurance on thelines he had proposed. If such an assurance were given, this fact was bound ultimately to become known and it would then be clear thatthe Report had been withheld to avoid its influencing the outcome of the railway dispute. Moreover, it was not clear how the staff representatives would be helped by having an assurance if, as wouldbe essential, it were given to them in confidence and they werethereby precluded from passing it on to their members.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said the Cab-inet agreed that the Government should accept the Boyle report but that this should not be announced before completion of the railwaymen&apos;s ballot. Meantime, whilst no assurances could be givento the staff representatives, the Lord Privy Seal should press themto continue to behave responsibly and to hold their members to asimilarly responsible attitude.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Lord Privy Seal tobe guided accordingly.
