The Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs said that the visit of the Shah of Iran to Britain from 21 to 25June had contributed notably to the improvement of our relationswith that country. The Shah, on leaving, had expressed his deepsatisfaction with the frank and friendly manner in which he had beenreceived.South east asia TreatyOrganisationPreviousReference:CM (71) 23rdConclusions,Minute 2BangladeshPreviousReference:CM (72) 5thConclusions,Minute 2The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had attended the17th Meeting of the Council of the South East Asia Treaty Organis-ation in Canberra from 27 to 28 June. The meeting had dealtsatisfactorily with matters of concern to the Alliance; and no partic-ular problems had arisen.The Cabinet1.  Took note of the statements by the Minister of State forForeign and Commonwealth Affairs.The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had paid a successful visit to Bangladesh from 23 to 24 June. He had been impressed by the degree of goodwill manifested towards this country.Among matters which were causing the new State serious concernwere the problem of rehabilitation, the proposal to bring Pakistaniwar criminals to trial and the question of the status of Bangladesh inrelation of Pakistan. The critical meeting between President Bhuttoof Pakistan and Mrs. Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India, was taking place that day; and its outcome could not yet be foreseen.But it seemed unlikely that stability in the sub-continent could beachieved until the Government of Pakistan were prepared torecognise Bangladesh. Meanwhile, the Foreign and commonwealth secretary had informed Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Prime Ministerof Bangladesh, that we were prepared to contribute the further sumof  3 million towards rehabilitation.The Prime Minister said that steps should be taken to ensurethat there was more general recognition that our contribution to relief and rehabilitation in Bangladesh had been very substantialindeed; in all some  32.5 million had been provided for this purposeduring the past year.The cabinet.

The Secretary of State for Employment said that the latestspecial confidential weekly count of the unemployed showed that unemployment unemployment was continuing to fall at a steady rate.StatisticsPreviousReference:CM (72) 31stConclusions,Minute 5Pay of the The Lord Privy Seal said that the latest discussions with theIndustrial unions about the pay of the Industrial Civil Service had failed to civil Service achieve a settlement. Although a further meeting had been arranged for the following week, the negotiations were now approachingdeadlock. The Ministerial Steering Committee on Pay negotiations would consider the position further before the discussions were resumed.The cabinet took note of the statements by the Secretary of State for employment and the Lord Privy Seal.IndustrialAffairsCONFIDENTIALHousing 5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the SecretaryFinance Bill     of State for the Environment and the Secretary of State for Wales(CP (72) 68) about default on the Housing Finance Bill.The Secretary of State for the Environment said that theGovernment might encounter opposition to the implemention ofthe Housing Finance Bill from two quarters. First, when the Billcame into force which it was hoped would be not later than8 August certain local authorities might refuse to increase the rentsof their dwellings on 1 October as they were required to do; mightrefuse to assess fair rents for their dwellings; and might refuse toapply the national rebate scheme to their tenants from 1 October.Second, where an authority did make the prescribed rent increases on1 October and apply the rebate scheme from that date, some of their tenants might refuse to pay the increased rents. If the Governmentwere to persuade individual authorities not to commit themselves todefaulting on their obligations, it would be essential to make it3. The Cabinet were informed of the latest developments inNorthern Ireland. Their discussion and the conclusions reached wereseparately recorded and issued only to The Queen, the PrimeMinister and those Ministers who had to take action.The conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file held by the Secretary of the Cabinet.
clear that the implementation of the Bill and of the rent increases which it required would not be postponed as a result of pressure from the Opposition or elsewhere. It would also be very important to ensure that the general public appreciated that the purpose of theBill was to deal effectively with the nation&apos;s housing problems whileassisting lower paid workers through the scheme of rent rebates and allowances. Once the Bill became law it would be necessary to launch an intensive publicity campaign for this purpose.The Minister for Housing and Construction said that sometenants in a number of areas might refuse to pay increased rents.But, if the authorities concerned were given reasonable latitude, theywould probably be able to bring this type of situation under controlthemselves by a combination of firmness and patience as had beendemonstrated by the Greater London Council in dealing with an extensive rent strike following an increase in rents in 1968. If,however, an authority failed or was unwilling to proceed on this basis, the Government could in the last resort appoint a HousingCommissioner under the Bill. It would become clear that localauthorities intended to refuse to increase rents if they did notprepare the notices of the rent increases required on 1 Octoberwhich by law should be issued at least four weeks before the increase was due. When it became evident that an authority would not send out such notices it was proposed to take the initial step leading to a default order which was prescribed in the Bill, namely the despatch to the authority of a notice informing them that the Secretary ofState was considering making a default order against them. Theauthority then had one month in which to make representations.This period would not in practice expire until about 25 October. If,after it expired, the authority persisted in their default, the appro-priate Secretary of State would, after consultation with the Cabinet,propose to make a default order under the Bill, requiring them totake specified steps within a specified period to remedy default. If a default order was made and the defaulting authority did not remedy the default, the following options were open: to make an orderappointing a Housing Commissioner to remedy the default; to reduce,to withhold or to discontinue housing subsidies after giving theauthority time to make representations; or to direct that an extraord-inary audit should be held, which would enable the District Auditor tomake more quickly any surcharge on the councillors responsible forthe default to which they might have rendered themselves liable.Other remedies, such as mandamus, were likely in practice to be tooslow or uncertain in their ultimate outcome to be suitable. If an authority did not themselves remedy the default, the Governmentwere in effect committed to taking at least one of these threemeasures; but the choice and the timing of action could be decided in the circumstances of each case.It should be possible to influence the attitude of potentialdefaulting authorities in the interval before the Bill came into force.Leaders of the Labour groups of some 90 local authorities, includingthe major Labour-controlled county boroughs, had met on 10 Juneat Sheffield and had decided that the implementation of the bill would be contrary to Labour Party principles. They had accordingly
agreed, after more detailed study, to discuss the issue further at aconference on 8 July. Informal inquiries, however, suggested thata number of the major authorities concerned, including manchester and, possibly, Birmingham, would in the event implement the Bill,whatever the outcome of the conference on 8 July, particularly since they would probably be advised to do so by the Labour PartyParliamentary spokesman on housing. Steps had also been takento ensure as far as possible that the full legal implications of defaultwere brought home to the participants in the conference. It wastherefore essential, in order that potential defaulting authorities mightbe subjected to maximum pressures, that the Government shouldmake it clear that there was no question of postponing or modifying the Bill.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the Housing(Financial Provisions) (Scotland) Bill had been the subject of similarmisrepresentation; and it was agreed that action comparable to that envisaged for England and Wales would be needed to put thepurposes of the legislation in correct perspective and to provide against possible defiance by local authorities and tenants. the remedies in Scotland to deal with defaulting authorities, however,were somewhat different from those available in England and Wales.In particular, there was no provision for the appointment of a housing Commissioner; and a default order could only be made after a public enquiry. In Wales three authorities had given formalnotification that they would not implement the Bill; and another 22were still undecided. It was relevant that the National Associationof Local Government Officers had passed a resolution purporting tosupport any member of the staff of a local authority who regarded hisloyalty to his authority as overriding his duty to a Housing Com-missioner. In these circumstances the Government should make their own policy unmistakably clear.In further discussion some concern was expressed that, in thepresent situation, when measures to curb inflation and to stabiliseprices were of critical importance, a large number of tenants wouldbe required to pay rent increases as large as  1 per week. In somecases, however, the increases would be smaller, e.g. in those areas where increases had already been made in the previous autumn; andin localities where an increase of 50p had been made in April nofurther increase would be needed until April 1973. Smaller increases were also expected in those areas, such as Birmingham andNewcastle, where the local authority might be able to show thattheir existing levels of rents approximated to the probable fair rents.Once the Bill had been enacted, however, further legislation wouldbe required if any changes were considered necessary.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it was essential to emphasise the &quot;Governments determination to proceedwith the two Bills and to remove the misrepresentations to whichthey had been subjected. It was particularly important to emphasise the help which would be given to lower paid workers. The Secre-taries of State for the Environment, for Scotland and for wales should arrange urgently, in consultation with the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, the Lord President, the Minister of Agriculture, fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Employment, for the most effective publicity to be given, as soon as the Bill became law, toits purposes and the reliefs which it would provide. The Secretaryof State for the Environment should also circulate the best assess-ment which could be provided of the impact of the increases, in termsof the number of tenants who would be required to pay the fullincrease, the number who would be required to pay lesserincreases and the number who would be entitled to receiverent rebates and allowances. No preliminary notices informing localauthorities that default orders were being considered should beissued until further consideration had been given to the matter bythe Cabinet. In any event the position should be reviewed again ina month&apos;s time.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the ministers concerned to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office29 June, 1972.
