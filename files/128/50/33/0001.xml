secret the Tax-Credit l. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChancellorSystem of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Social ServicesDraft Green (CP (72) 61), to which was annexed a draft Green Paper on thePaper proposed tax-credit system.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in his Budget speechhe had put forward proposals for a new tax-credit scheme, whichwould combine for the first time the systems of personal taxation and social security in this country. He had also undertaken that theGovernment would publish a Green Paper setting out the details ofthe new arrangements and would refer them for consideration by a parliamentary Select Committee. The tax-credit scheme represented a new approach to the integration of tax and social security whichhad hitherto not been attempted in any country. It would provide,without means-testing, a substantial and comprehensive benefit tomany retirement pensioners, an improved system of family support for lower-paid workers and a greatly simplified tax system for mostof the population. It should also make for more efficient administra-tion and save between 10,000 and 15,000 civil servants. It raised,however, three important issues, which would need to be judged inthe light of public reaction. On the treatment of married women&apos;earnings the Green Paper favoured maintaining the wives&apos; specialearned income relief as a tax allowance within the new scheme. Onthe sensitive question of the parent to whom child credits should normally be paid it argued for payment normally to the father butreserved the final decision to be taken in the light of the SelectCommittee&apos;s views and public comment generally. On the coverageof the scheme the Green Paper explained why it was proposed thatthe self-employed and those outside the field of employment shouldbe excluded, at least initially. Final decisions on these points,however, could not be taken until after the Select Committee had reported.While the Government could not be committed at this stage toany specific level of tax-credits, the scheme was bound to be expen-sive. Its cost was estimated in the Green Paper as being in the region of  1,000 million in relation to present circumstances and on thebasis of the levels of tax-credit used for illustrative purposes. it seemed more likely, however, to approach  1,250 million in fact.It was proposed that the Green Paper should be published by theend of June in order to enable the Select Committee to be appointed in sufficient time to commission evidence before the Summer recess and to make an early start on their work when parliament reassembled. This was necessary if they were to report in time toenable the Government to introduce legislation in the following year in order that the scheme might be brought into operation in April1977. , . &quot; &quot;The Secretary of State for Social Services said that the proposals would make it possible for the Government to help, without means-testing, the large group of hard-pressed individuals, particularlyretirement pensioners, who did not qualify for supplementary benefitalthough their income was below the tax threshold.  The scheme
would also substantially reduce the number of people who needed todraw supplementary benefit; and it would have the advantage ofmaking short-term social security benefits liable to tax. there mission of charges for medical prescriptions and school meals,however, would need to remain as separate means-tested benefits, atleast for the time being, in view of the difficulty of integrating them into the new scheme.In discussion it was generally agreed that the scheme wouldmake a constructive and imaginative contribution to the Govern-menfs social policy and would help to reduce the gap, which wouldbecome apparent when we joined the European Economic Com-munity (e.c.), between our social benefits and those of the presentEEC countries. On the other hand the cost of the scheme would bevery substantial and could involve considerable problems of economicmanagement. If the introduction of the scheme happened to coincide with a period when the economic situation would in any event have called for tax reductions, there might not be too much difficulty inaccommodating the cost; but, if not, it would be necessary either to devise means of absorbing the additional public expenditure or tofind alternative sources of taxation. If the scheme had to be financedmainly by raising the level of indirect taxation, this would greatlyreduce its presentational impact. Moreover, against the current economic background, the publication of a Green Paper indicating that the Government intended to inject an extra  1,000 million ormore of spending power into the economy would inevitably be opento misunderstanding. The only Government commitment on the timing of publication was an undertaking that the Green Paper wouldbe presented before the end of the year. Deferment of publicationuntil the autumn would admittedly delay the report by the SelectCommittee and, therefore, the timetable for legislation; but suchdelays might well have arisen in any event.In further discussion it was suggested that the presentation of the scheme in the draft Green Paper needed to be improved,particularly in chapters 5 and 6. The social impact of the schemewas not sufficiently indicated by ranges of mere examples of incomesupport; and the cost estimate was not itemised in such a way asto show the manner in which different categories of individual would benefit. The arrangements for publicity also needed to be carefully examined. Consideration should be given to distributing copiesfree to organisations concerned with social welfare; and the possi-bility of producing a popular version of the Green Paper should be examined.In subsequent discussion the following points were made (a) The draft Green Paper did not indicate the implications ofthe scheme for the financial position of strikers. The practical effect would be that those on strike would be eligible to receive tax-creditsbut would no longer receive the existing family allowances or pay as You Earn refunds. In total, therefore, their position would notbe greatly affected; but it would be necessary to be prepared forcritical questions on this point.
(b) The Green Paper left open for further study the treatment of dependants abroad. Existing family allowances, unlike income taxchild allowances, were granted only in respect of children in thiscountry. Because of the amount of abuse of the present tax allow-ances, the administrative arguments favoured the exclusion of dependants abroad from the new scheme, except possibly to theextent that there might be a commitment to pay them under EECarrangements. This, however, would imply that those at presentlegally receiving income tax child allowances would be worse off;and the point would need further consideration.(c) There was likely to be considerable public support for the contention that the child credits should be paid to the mother, as were the existing family allowances. Since this point might well have to be conceded before legislation was introduced, it might be preferable to modify the Green Paper in this respect forthwith, inorder to anticipate the risk that argument about the mother&apos;s entitle-ment might obscure the real advantages which the scheme would offer to families as a whole.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised the social advantages of the proposed tax-credit scheme but considered that further study should be given to the issues raised in discussion and to the arrangements for public presentation.In any case, publication of the Green Paper at the present time could lead to misunderstanding. Publication should therefore be deferred until the autumn; and in the meantime a group of Ministers underthe chairmanship of the Home Secretary should examine the draftGreen Paper in the light of the points made in discussion and should consider the publicity arrangements in greater detail.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.SelectCommitteeon ProcedureReport onMattersSub JudicePreviousReference:CM (72) 31stConclusions,Minute 2CONFIDENTIAL2. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the SelectCommittee on Procedure^ Report on matters sub judice on the basisof a memorandum by the Lord President of the Council (CP (72) 67).The Lord President said that three possible courses of action were open to the Government. First, they could reject the Com-mittee&apos;s recommendations and leave the existing sub judice rule asit stood. Second, they could accept the Committee&apos;s proposals infull. This would imply relaxing the rule in relation to proceedings(other than for defamation) in civil courts generally, includingproceedings before the Industrial Relations Court, subject to thesafeguard that the Chair would exercise its discretion to prevent any real and substantial danger of prejudice to the proceedings. Third,they could accept the Committee&apos;s proposals in relation to proceed-ings before the Industrial Relations Court but could reject, or possiblydefer for further consideration, any relaxation of the rule with regardto proceedings in other civil courts. To take the first course wouldmean rejecting the unanimous recommendations of an all-Party
Select Committee. It would be strongly argued in the House that an urgent reconsideration of the existing sub judice rule was requiredin view of the increasing involvement of Ministers as parties to courtproceedings on financial and economic matters, particularly asregards actions before the Industrial Relations Court, and that theretention of the rule in its present form seriously inhibited the house in debating matters of current national importance. It would bedifficult to refute these contentions, particularly if the effect was toprevent discussion in Parliament of matters of wide public concernwhich were already the subject of general public discussion andcomment in the Press. It would be particularly difficult to seek tomaintain that Ministers were not accountable to Parliament even onissues on which they could not be &quot; assailed &quot; in the industrial relations Court. Moreover, the present rule did not in fact preventMembers who were determined to find means of doing so from making comments about matters before the courts under the guise,for example, of points of order; and it was frequently only the refuta-tion of such observations which Mr. Speaker was able to prevent.The principal issue in considering whether to accept the Committee&apos;srecommendations in full was whether the proposed relaxation ofthe rule and the proposed degree of discretion on the part of the chair to refuse questions and to prevent debate on matters beforethe civil courts where there was a real and substantial danger ofprejudice to the proceedings would incorporate sufficient safeguardsto ensure that the integrity of the judicial procedure was not affected.The extent and possible effect of any such risk, however, would need to be weighed against the countervailing consideration that, exceptfor the most powerful and overriding reasons, Parliament should notbe inhibited from discussing matters of national importance. Theremaining course was to accept the recommendations in relation tothe Industrial Relations Court alone. But this would imply treatingthat Court in such a way as virtually to concede the claim of theOpposition that it was outside the normal judicial process and wasin some special sense a political court. This would entail a con-siderable risk of undermining its authority. For these reasons, theleast disadvantageous course, on balance, would be to accept theSelect Committee&apos;s recommendations in full.The Lord Chancellor said that, in accordance with the suggestion made by the Cabinet at their earlier discussion, he had consultedsenior members of the judiciary about the Select Committee&apos;srecommendations. They were unanimous in their view that no case had been made out by the Select Committee for a modification of thesub judice rule over the whole range of civil proceedings; and they considered that it would be desirable to postpone/ a final decisionon this matter until the Phillimore Committee on the law of contempthad reported, since it would be only then that it would be possible totake a rational decision on the extent to which public discussion andcomment could properly be allowed without prejudicing such proceedings. The judiciary saw no objection, however, to a relaxation-tion of the sub judice rule in relation to matters brought before theIndustrial Relations Court; and they considered that the risk of appearing to give exceptional treatment to proceedings in thatCourt could be averted if there were to be a general relaxation of
the sub judice rule in relation to any matters which were brought before the civil courts on the application of Ministers or involvedissues of national importance, such as damage to the national economy or national security. The proposed exclusion of defamationproceedings from the relaxation of the sub judice rule seemed tobe based on the assumption that all these cases were tried by juries;but in fact some such cases were tried by judges alone.In discussion there was general agreement that an acceptance ofthe Select Committee&apos;s recommendations in so far as they related tocertain cases before the civil courts which either derived fromapplications by Ministers or involved issues of public importancewould be desirable. While there might be strong feeling in the Houseof Commons that the present sub judice rule was too restrictiveand that the Select Committee had proposed safeguards which shouldprevent any real danger of prejudice to proceedings in the civil courts,it could be made clear in the course of debate on the Report that theGovernment had not rejected these recommendations but considered it desirable to await the Phillimore Committee&apos;s Report. that report would examine the question of possible prejudice to proceed-ings arising out of public discussion and comment; and it would therefore be preferable to defer consideration of the relaxations whichmight be made in the House of Commons&apos; sub judice rule until thegeneral recommendations of the Phillimore Committee were avail-able. The risk of difficulties occurring in relation to proceedings inthe Industrial Relations Court, particularly as respects the position oftrade unions who were not prepared to appear before the Court,might be avoided if the Speaker were to refuse to allow an emergencydebate under Standing Order 9 to take place between the time ofthe application to the Court and the date of the hearing.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet considered that to implement the recommendation made bythe Select Committee on Procedure in relation to matters awaitingor under adjudication in all civil courts might involve some risk ofprejudicing proceedings in those courts. The risk of prejudice to proceedings arising from public discussion and commentoutside Parliament was being considered by the Phillimore Com-mittee on the law of contempt as a whole; and, since similar considerations would be relevant to the question of prejudice arisingas a result of discussion and comment within Parliament, it wouldbe preferable for a decision to be deferred on this recommendation,in so far as it would apply to proceedings in civil courts generally,in order that the question could be considered in the light of therecommendations made by the Phillimore Committee. As regardsthe application of the recommendation to certain proceedings whichwere brought before the civil courts on the application of a minister or raised questions of national importance, such as damage to thenational economy or national security, it would be advantageous forthe recommendation to be accepted and for the decision to be announced immediately. On this basis it would then be possiblefor these matters to be referred to in Questions, Motions or debate in the House of Commons unless it appeared to the Chair that therewas a real and substantial danger of prejudice to the proceedings.This course would have the advantage that the Industrial Relations
Court would not be treated exceptionally as regards the relaxation of the sub judice rule; and the recommendations made by the SelectCommittee on the specific matters which might be brought beforethe Industrial Relations Court could be accepted in full. While therecommendation made by the Select Committee that the sub judicerule should continue to apply to matters before criminal courts,courts martial and judicial bodies such as tribunals under the tribunals of Enquiry (Evidence) Act, 1.921, was acceptable, it mightbe desirable to consider, in due course, whether defamation proceed-ings should be divided into two categories, namely those which weretried by juries and those which were not.The Opposition had informally indicated that, subject to the government&apos;s accepting the Select Committee&apos;s Report, they would agree to a short debate on the matter in the House of Commons onthe following day after 11 o&apos;clock. It might still be possible tosecure their agreement to this course on the basis of the decisionsnow reached by the Cabinet. The Lord President should consulturgently with the Lord Chancellor, the Secretary of State for employment and the Attorney General about the terms of the motion which should be tabled for the purposes of the debate.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Ministers concerned tobe guided accordingly.financial support forInternationalComputersLismitedSECRET3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry (CP (72) 64), to which was annexed a memorandum by the Minister for Industrial Developmentabout support for International Computers Limited (ICL); and aNote by the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS) (CP (72) 65) on thesame subject.The Minister for Industrial Development said that the ministerial committee on Economic Policy, at their meeting on 20 June, had considered three possible options for the future of ICL. First, thecompany might accept a merger with Burroughs, with the result thatit would not be possible to maintain effective United kingdom control of the merged company&apos;s operations in this country. Second,the Government might announce their readiness to support ICLfor a five-year period, with a view to the company&apos;s establishingpartnership arrangements with computer firms in Europe. Third,the Government might confine their immediate commitment tosupporting the company for a more limited period, while theyexplored the possibility of forming an early partnership with a united States, European, or Japanese firm which would obviate theneed for longer term Government financial support. A majority ofthe Committee had favoured the third of these options, on theground that ICL could not survive indefinitely except in a partnershipwhich would provide them with larger resources and a wider market.But the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and he himself had doubted whether there would be any prospect of retaining a real
measure of United Kingdom control in any merger with a substantialUnited States or Japanese company; and, by adopting the thirdoption, therefore, we should merely defer an ultimate choice betweenthe other two courses of action. Since CP (72) 64 had been circulated,however, the Managing Director of Univac in the United kingdom had said that his firm would be prepared to accept a minorityholding in two United Kingdom companies, one a marketing and one a manufacturing company, in which ICL could retain majorityholdings; and this arrangement should enable us to retain in thiscountry a substantial computer manufacturing and research anddevelopment capability under United Kingdom control. Thediscussions with Univac had so far been in general terms; and itwould be necessary both to confirm that the Managing Directorsstatement had been made with full authority and to obtain fullerdetails of the firm&apos;s intentions before forming a final judgment ontheir acceptability. Nevertheless, since it now appeared that there might be some possibility of promoting an acceptable internationalpartnership more quickly than had earlier seemed likely, it wouldbe more reasonable that the Government should make only an interim promise of financial support for ICL, which might be in theterms of the draft Parliamentary statement annexed to the letter of26 June from the Department of Trade and Industry to the PrimeMinister^ Office, a copy of which had been circulated to members ofthe Cabinet.This provided for Exchequer support of  14-2 million for ICLin the period to September 1973, in the form of a grant for thecompany&apos;s research and development programme, in return for whichroyalties would eventually become payable to the Government outof the proceeds of sales or profits. When this statement was madethe company would be informed that the Government wished to seeall possibilities for partnership fully explored before entering into any further commitment; but there should be no public intimationto this effect, since this would risk undermining the company&apos;position. It would also be necessary to ensure that negotiations withUnivac or any other potential partner did not reach the point of apublic announcement until the prospective discussions v/ith theFrench and German Governments had taken place. Whether ornot those Governments were interested in working for closer association between ICL and the computer interests in their own countries, it would be desirable from the standpoint of our widerEuropean policies that we should be seen to have discussed thepossibilities with them; and, meanwhile, ICL should not becomepublicly committed to a United States company.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It was important that the Governments general objectives of fostering European collaboration in high-technology industries andof taking a major initiative on industrial policy at the forthcomingEuropean Summit should not be jeopardised. From this point ofview it might be preferable that any negotiations between Univacor any other prospective partners with ICL should be postponed until after the forthcoming discussions with the French and german governments. These discussions, however, were to be preceded by
exchanges between officials in which it should be possible to takethe first steps in persuading the French and German governments that our purpose in seeking other partners for ICL was to promote a stronger unit which could become in due course a member ofthe wider European grouping which we wished to promote. A weakEuropean group would have little chance of withstanding thecompetition of International Business Machines.ib) The reference in the draft Parliamentary statement to thefinance required &quot; if a substantial indigenous capability&quot; which already existed in ICL was to be maintained might be taken to imply a commitment to United Kingdom ownership. The essential require-ment was that the capability should be not necessarily UnitedKingdom owned but United Kingdom based. The wording should be amended to make this clear.(c) Even so, our hope of successfully promoting a Europeancomputer industry would depend on retaining United kingdom control over a merged company; and it would not be acceptable that negotiations with Univac or other prospective partners for ICL should proceed on any other basis.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Government should provide interim support for ICL in the form of a research and development grant of 14-2 million during the period to September 1973 and that a parliamentary statement should be made on the lines of the draft annexed to the Department of Trade and Industry&apos;s letter of 26 June,amended as necessary in the light of the Cabinefs discussion. TheCabinet further agreed that ICL&apos;s viability in the longer termdepended on their finding suitable international partners and that theMinister, in making this clear privately to the company, should arrange for the possibilities in this respect to be urgently explored.In particular, the proposal by the Managing Director of Univac inthe United Kingdom should now be more fully discussed; but anessential condition of any merger arrangement between ICL and this or any other United States or Japanese company was that it should provide for a substantial computer manufacturing and research anddevelopment capability in this country which would be under UnitedKingdom control. A merger on that basis should enhance ICL&apos;sattraction as a potential partner in a wider European computer industry; and our objective in this respect should be made clear both to Univac and to the French and German Governments. It was important, however, that the negotiations with Univac or otherpotential foreign partners should not become publicly known andthat no final commitment should be made in advance of the Minister^discussions with his French and German colleagues. The minister should arrange for the Civil Service Department and the CPRS to be associated with the negotiations and should also consider obtainingprofessional financial advice for this purpose.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Minister for IndustrialDevelopment to be guided accordingly.
OverseaAffairsIcelandicFisheriesDisputePreviousReference:CM (72) 31stConclusions,Minute 3SECRET4. The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that,since the Cabinet had authorised the Foreign and commonwealth secretary to make a further attempt to secure an agreement withthe Icelandic Government about interim fishing arrangements forBritish vessels in Icelandic waters after 1 September, the IcelandicFisheries Minister had revealed certain details of the inter-Governmental discussions on 19-20 June. As a result, the press had formed the impression that the British Government were readyto accept the area limitation which the Icelandic Government had proposed. In fact, we had rejected this suggestion; but the british fishing industry were now understandably alarmed and in this situation the further round of discussions contemplated on 1 and3 July could not take place without damaging the Governmentscredibility with the industry. Before renewed discussions could being, therefore, it would be necessary to reach an accommodationwith the industry on area limitations and to convince them that the negotiating position endorsed by the Cabinet was the least damagingwhich could be devised. Moreover, there now seemed a serious risk that on 1 July the Icelandic Fisheries Minister would promulgatefishing regulations establishing new limits. In these circumstances we should inform the Government of Iceland that the FisheriesMinisters action made it necessary for us to reconsider our position.The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that, given goodwill on both sides, a satisfactory interim arrangement should be feasible. But the Icelandic Fisheries Ministerappeared ready to obstruct any agreement which was acceptable toBritish interests; and, if he persisted in promulgating regulationspurporting to establish Icelandic jurisdiction within new limits, itwould be difficult to see what further negotiations might achieve. Ifthe discussions ended in deadlock, however, it was important that theresponsibility should be seen to attach to the Icelandic Governmentand not to ourselves.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that action by the Icelandic Fisheries Minister had created a new situationin which it might be even harder to obtain a satisfactory interimagreement. We might need to defer the next round of inter-Governmental discussions for a time. But we should take care toavoid any action which would make an agreement more difficult; andthe Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food should explain theGovernments position to the industry and seek their agreement toproceed on the lines approved earlier.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food andthe Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office,to proceed accordingly.
SECRETEconomic 5.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in the light situation the decision at the end of the previous week to abandon a fixedExchange parity for sterling for a temporary period, he had discussed theRate Policy situation on the previous day with the Finance Ministers of the Sixmember countries of the European Economic Community (e.c.) in luxembourg. He had initially encountered some criticism on thepart of the French Government that we had not conducted anyprior consultation with the Community before abandoning the fixedparity. But this had disappeared when he had explained why, in thecircumstances, we should have found it impossible to enter into anyrealistic discussion about an appropriate new parity for sterling andhad therefore had no effective alternative to allowing the exchange rate to &quot; float&quot; for a time; and, for the rest, the Finance ministers of the Six had been prepared to accept our action without complaint.They themselves intended both to maintain the parities and marginswhich had been agreed with the United States Government in the&quot; Smithsonian Agreement&quot; and to continue to observe the systemof even narrower margins within the Community itself. special measures of assistance, however, might be required in order toenable the Italian Government to conform to this policy. Of thecountries contemplating accession to the e.c. Norway would faceno problems; Denmark apparently intended to observe theSmithsonian margins but not the narrower margins within theCommunity; while Eire would follow the course which we ourselveshad adopted. In general, the attitude of the meeting had beenco-operative; and the discussion had revealed a substantial degree of understanding and acceptance of the action which we had judged itwise to take.Cabinet Office,27 June, 1972.
