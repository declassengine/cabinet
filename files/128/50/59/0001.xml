The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet were informed that Mrs. Barbara Castle, mp,intended to seek permission under the Ten Minute Rule to introduce,on 19 December, a Bill providing for equivalent payments to bemade to all retirement pensioners who were disqualified fromreceiving payments under the Pensioners and Family Income Supple-ments Payments Act 1972 solely by reason of their non-entitlement to payment of a qualifying benefit. The Bill, which would be likelyto attract public sympathy, would affect only about 7,000 people i.e.those whose earnings during the relevant week had been sufficientto disqualify them from receiving retirement benefit. If the Govern-ment opposed the Motion they would risk losing a good deal of the credit which they had acquired by their decision to make the special 10 payment to retirement pensioners; but acceptance of the Motionwould inevitably lead to the reopening of the cases of other, oftenmore numerous, classes of individuals who, under the terms of theAct, were not entitled to the special payment.The Cabinet 1. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Social Services and theother Ministers principally concerned, to consider theattitude to be adopted by the Government to the projectedaddition to those who would benefit under the pensioners and Family Income Supplements Payments Act 1972.The Cabinet were informed that the Opposition were notprepared to agree to the appointment of a joint ad hoc Select Com-mittee of both Houses of Parliament in order to consider the arrange-ments for the scrutiny of draft instruments of the european community and that discussions about the appointment of a separateSelect Committee in the House of Lords had accordingly been putin hand.Designationof british members ofthe EuropeanParliamentPreviousReference:CM (72) 57thConclusions,Minute 5The Cabinet were also informed that a formal request had nowbeen received from the Crossbench Peers for one of their number to be included in the United Kingdom delegation to the european parliament. /The Cabinet-2. Agreed that a Crossbench Peer might be included in theUnited Kingdom delegation to the European parliament on the understanding that this place might have to bevacated if the Labour Party reversed their decision notto participate in the delegation.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary informed the affairs Cabinet that the President of Uganda, General Amin, had statedUganda that on Monday 18 December he would announce important decisionsPrevious about the British community in Uganda. No indication was yetReference: available about the scope and nature of these decisions or theirCM (72) 51st implications for the future of the British community. They might,Conclusions, however, extend as far as expulsion; and, although our preparationsMinute 2       were as complete as circumstances permitted, it might be necessaryfor Ministers to take urgent decisions in the following week in thelight of the announcement.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.confidential industrial 3.   The Secretary of State for Employment said that branchesAffairs of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, in particular the Case of those in the North West of England and in North and East London,Mr. James had decided to hold one-day strikes in protest against the furtherGoad  50,000 fine imposed on the union by the National IndustrialPrevious Relations Court because of the union&apos;s renewed failure to attendReference: the Courfs hearings in the case concerning Mr. James Goad. the cm (72) 56th members of the union employed by the Lucas Group at their factoriesConclusions, jn the Midlands, however, had voted against industrial action; and minute 3       those who had gone on strike at the Sudbury factory, where Mr.Goad had been employed, had that morning voted to return to work.While the union&apos;s refusal to attend the Court was indefensible the merits of Mr. Goad&apos;s case were not wholly clear-cut.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for employment.The Cabinet took note that a statement would be made in theHouse of Commons that afternoon, appointing 8 March, 1973, as thedate for the plebiscite in Northern Ireland about the Border.
4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, together withthe Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the Secretary of Statefor Employment and the Minister for Industry, he had discussed with Mr. Hetherington, the Chairman of the Gas Council, theattitude to be adopted by the Council towards the request by theunions representing the gas manual workers that negotiations on their pay claim should now go forward. Mr. Hetherington had appreciated the Governmenfs concern that the Council should make no offer to the unions before the guidelines for the second stage of the Govern-ment&apos;s counter-inflationary policy were available; and he had been willing to co-operate to this end, provided that he received from theGovernment an appropriate letter which he could show to the unions in justification. It had been agreed with Mr. Hetherington that a letterof this kind would be preferable to a formal direction to the Councilnot to negotiate, since the latter might create a false impression ofthe relationship between the Government and the Council. Mr.Hetherington, however, had expressed the not unreasonable hopethat, even though the Council could not negotiate on pay, they mightbe allowed to negotiate on other aspects of the union&apos;s claim, i.e.redundancy, holidays, improved shift allowance and shorter hours.In these circumstances it was proposed that the Minister for industry should send Mr. Hetherington two letters. The first, whichwould be intended for publication, would make clear the Govern-ment&apos;s view that, until such time as guidelines were announced,negotiations, whether in the public or the private sector, should not becarried to the point at which offers of improved remuneration weremade. The second, which would be a personal letter not for publica-tion, would emphasise that under the standstill provisions remunera-tion included not only pay but also other improvements in the terms and conditions of employment; and, while indicating that there wouldbe no objection to the Councils negotiating on the items other thanpay, it would specify that any agreement reached on these itemsmust also be subject to the policy for the period after the stand still and that the eventual offer on pay might therefore have to be reduced in order to accommodate the total settlement within the limits of that policy. It would also be desirable, in order to avoid any possiblemisunderstanding, that in the confidential letter the Minister shouldmake clear the Governmenfs expectations about the timing of theannouncement of the guidelines for the policy after the standstill,which had been discussed at the meeting with Mr. Hetherington.While the letter might confirm that the Government hoped to announce the guidelines by the time when Parliament reassembledon 22 January, it should make clear that there could be no guarantee that this target could be met.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet noted with satisfaction that it would not be necessary toissue a direction to the Gas Council not to negotiate on pay. Thiswas particularly important in the light of the further advice from theLaw Officers confirming their view that in the circumstances envisageda direction to the Gas Council alone would not be valid and might
be successfully challenged in the courts, although this risk would bereduced if similar directions were given to all the nationalised industries where there was power to do so. This advice must, ofcourse, be accepted. But it constituted a degree of restraint on the government&apos;s power to determine the policies to be followed by the nationalised industries which it was doubtful if Parliament had intended; and the matter might need further consideration if asimilar case arose in future. Meanwhile, the Cabinet agreed thatthe Minister for Industry should send the Chairman of the gas council letters on the lines which they had approved. It might be advisable to avoid any reference to a specific &quot; requirement&quot;, whichmight be open to challenge when the contents of the letter which wasnot confidential were made public.The Cabinet 1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Minister for Industry to send letters to the Chair-man of the Gas Council on the lines agreed in their discussion.PublicExpenditurePreviousReference:CM (72) 52ndConclusions,Minute 6SECRET5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP (72) 147), to which was attached a draft of the1972 White Paper on Public Expenditure to 1976-77.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the public expend-iture programmes set out in the draft White Paper were rising faster,and from a higher base, than those shown in the White Paper for1971. Part I of the White Paper had been prepared with this con-sideration in mind. It followed precedent in measuring increases inthe programmes from the current year; and, because the level of thecurrent year was high, the rate of increase over the five-year period to 1976-77 was reduced by comparison with the period from 1971-72to 1976-77, on which the Cabinet had concentrated in their own dis-cussions. In straight expenditure terms, the average rate of increase for the period between 1972-73 and 1976-77 was shown as 2-5 percent; the rate of increase in demand terms was given as 3 per cent,if account was taken of the counter-cyclical additions to public expenditure in 1972-73, and as 3-4 per cent without them (paragraph12).The Select Committee on Expenditure had recommended thatthe White Paper should include a medium-term economic assessment;and a number of the Governmenfs supporters in Parliament had strongly advocated this. Moreover, it would be necessary to provide information of this kind to the European Economic Community; andhe had therefore decided to include a new table (table 1.2), illustratingtwo possible growth rates of the economy, at 3 - 5 per cent and 5 percent which the National Economic Development Council had earlieraccepted as appropriate. This was some way short of a full assess-ment; but the use of two illustrative rates should help to avoid
criticism that the Government refused to contemplate the possibility that a 5 per cent rate of growth might prove to be too high andshould demonstrate that even on the lower growth assumption their plans for public expenditure were consistent with prudent manage-ment and that they were pursuing a cautious policy until it should become apparent that a higher level of resources was clearly goingto be available.It was proposed that the White Paper should be published on19 December.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet noted that the matters Outstanding from the previous discussion had been resolved and that total public expenditure nowconformed with the limits which they had laid down in July. Itwould be important to ensure the most favourable public presenta-tion of the White Paper, with particular emphasis on the social andeconomic benefits to be derived from the very considerable outlayinvolved.The Cabinet Approved the publication, on 19 December, of the 1972White Paper on Public Expenditure.LegislativeProgramme1972-73PreviousReference:CM (72) 52ndConclusions,Minute 1SECRET6. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the legislative programme for the 1972-73 Session. They had before them amemorandum by the Lord President of the Council (CP (72) 149).The Lord President of the Council said that the Cabinet had accepted in principle that some reduction in the legislative programme must be secured. The Annex to CP (72) 149 indicated the Bills whichDepartmental Ministers still wished to introduce in the current session, distinguishing between those which probably could not be deferred and those which should now be considered for deferment.Measures to deal with inflation and Northern Ireland, together withthe Finance and Consolidated Fund Bills, must be given first priority in the remainder of the Session; and these, together with the legisla-tion already introduced, would make heavy demands on the availablelegislative time. It would not be possible to accommodate all theother Bills except at the expense of another Session at least asonerous as the fast two Sessions and possibly even more so. Recesseswould again have to be shortened; important Government business would once more have to be taken after 10 o&apos;clock; and manyreasonable and strongly-supported requests for debates on importantsubjects would have tq be refused. The Government would be severely criticised if they inflicted on Parliament a wholly unreason-able burden of legislation; and, unless they lightened the programme,the Bills to which they must give priority would be jeopardised. Fourmajor Bills had not yet been introduced, namely, Training andEmployment,   Water  Reorganisation,   Local   Government   and
Insurance. In consultation with the Chief Whip he had regretfullyconcluded that two of these Bills should be deferred. Although therewas a case for introducing a short money Bill on the Channel Tunnelin July, it would be practicable to defer this until after the summer recess and, possibly, until the next Session. As regards the proposed legislation on Unoccupied Office Properties action was admittedlyrequired in order to deal with the problem of Centre Point; but some method not involving legislation should be found, if possible.Whether or not the Spot-the-Ball Bill would be needed must dependon the decision now awaited from the House of Lords in the relevantappeal. Until recommendations had been received from the speakers Conference on Electoral Law it would not be known whether the Bill on Electoral Registration would be required. Asregards the three Scottish Bills, it had already been agreed that theLord High Commissioner (Church of Scotland) Bill should be deferred, at least for the time being; but, provided that the SecondReading of the other two Bills could be taken in the Scottish GrandCommittee, there need be no objection to their proceeding. It wasto be hoped that it would be possible to defer the Bill to make amend-ments to United Kingdom legislation consequential on changesin Northern Ireland law.In discussion, there was general agreement that the Bill on training and Employment should not be deferred. Its drafting,however, should be completed urgently, in order that it might beintroduced shortly after the Christmas Recess. It was for considera-tion whether, pending the enactment of legislation on Insurance h\a later Session, adequate administrative steps could be taken toprevent the bankruptcy of further insurance companies. On the otherhand, the collapse of the Vehicle and General Insurance company had made a very serious impact on public opinion; and, if anotherlarge insurance company were compelled to cease operations, theGovernment would incur severe criticism for having failed to takeurgent action to remedy the existing deficiencies in the law while thestanding of the Department of Trade and Industry would be seriouslyimpaired. While the Bill might be introduced in the House of Lords,this would not reduce the requirement for time in the House ofCommons; and it might prove impossible to secure the passage ofthe Bill in the latter House in addition to all the other legislation which would be before it at the relevant time. In order to render the Bill on Water Reorganisation less controversial and to meet theobjections of local authorities it was not now proposed to absorb the undertaking of the British Waterways Board in the new organisa-tion; and it was envisaged that local authorities should be given amajority of the seats on the Regional Water Authorities. these changes, however, might be criticised as substantially altering thecharacter of the reorganisation; and it would therefore be necessaryfor the Home and Social Affairs Committee to consider them in more detail as a matter of urgency. Even if these changes were made,however, the Bill would be liable to have little political attraction;and substantial problems would remain in connection with the treat-ment of land drainage. On the other hand the reorganisation wouldbe essential sooner or later; and in terms of administrative efficiency
SECRET9it would be preferable to enact the Bill in the current Session ratherthan in the following one. The Bill on Local Government wouldcomprise a number of measures which would benefit ratepayers;but it could probably be deferred until the following Session, providedthat it was then enacted in time for the relevant provisions to take effect when the local government reorganisation came into operation in April 1974. In the meantime, consideration was being given tothe possibility of introducing substantial changes in the financing oflocal authorities and of relieving the burden of their expenditure.The legislation on Unoccupied Office Properties would be neces-sary unless a satisfactory means could be found to deal with vacantlarge office properties such as Centre Point. While any Bill on thissubject would be highly controversial and thus add substantially tothe burden of legislation, the Government had undertaken a firm commitment to satisfy the criticism evoked by such properties; and action was now urgently needed to discharge this commitment. Asingle clause money Bill on the Channel Tunnel would be needed by November if we were to comply with the terms of the relevantagreements. The Speakers Conference on Electoral Law had notyet been established because the Opposition had, so far failed to nominate individuals to serve as members. This delay was a matterof serious concern. The provisions of the Salmon and freshwater fisheries (Scotland) Bill would not necessarily be certified by the speaker to relate exclusively to Scotland; and, since the Bill mightaccordingly not be referred to the Scottish Standing Committee,it was not now proposed to proceed with it in the current Session.It was not yet known whether a Bill would be required to make changes in United Kingdom legislation consequential on changes inNorthern Ireland law.In further discussion considerable concern was expressed that itwould not be practicable to secure the passage of all the legislation which was contemplated. On the other hand much would depend upon the extent to which the Government could enlist the readysupport of their backbenchers and the Opposition continued to be divided. It would therefore be necessary to keep the progress of theprogramme Under close review.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised that, if some reductions in the legislative pro-gramme were not made, the Government would be likely to incurcriticism for imposing so unreasonable a burden of legislation onParliament. The full support of Government backbenchers wouldbe needed if the passage of all the proposed Bills was to be secured.It was very desirable that the Bills on Training&apos; and Employment and insurance should be introduced in the current Session. The prepara-tion of the former Bill must now be completed as a matter of urgency.It might be convenient to introduce the latter Bill in the House ofLords in order to avoid delay to the Bill dealing with the second stage of the Governmenfs counter-inflationary policies. There were also strong administrative reasons for introducing the Bill on WaterReorganisation this Session; and, subject to the approval of the modified proposals by the Home and Social Affairs Committee andto consideration of the Bill by the Legislation Committee, it should
be introduced before the Christmas Recess. While the Local Govern-ment Bill might be deferred until the following Session, it would benecessary for it to be enacted in time for a number of the changesfor which it would provide to be brought into effect at the sametime as the reorganisation of local government in April 1974. Thequestion whether this Bill should be deferred should accordingly be reviewed in a few months&apos; time. Action must be taken as amatter of urgency to ensure that large office properties such asCentre Point did not continue to remain unoccupied; and, if theproblem could not be dealt with satisfactorily by any other method,it might be necessary to introduce legislation to give effect to the undertakings which had been publicly given by the Government.Further consideration should be given to the arrangements tobe made in Parliament for consideration both of the Channel tunnel project and of the necessary legislative provisions, bearing in mind the terms of the agreements into which the Government had entered.Whether legislation would be needed on Electoral Registration wouldnot be known until recommendations had been received from the speakers Conference on Electoral Law; and it was a matter ofconsiderable concern that the Opposition had so far failed to nomi-nate individuals to serve as members of the Conference. It wouldbe necessary to ensure that the public understood where responsibiltyfor the delay in proceeding with the Conference lay. Further con-sideration should be given to the need for the proposed Bill to make changes in United Kingdom legislation consequential on changes inNorthern Ireland law.The Cabinet 1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.2. Agreed that the Bills on Training and Employment and insurance should be completed urgently and introduced at the earliest possible date.3. Agreed that, subject to the Home and Social Affairs Com-mittee&apos;s endorsement of the proposed policy changes andthe Legislation Committee&apos;s approval of the draft Bill,the legislation on Water Reorganisation should be intro-duced before the Christmas Recess.4. Agreed to review at the end of February the questionwhether the Local Government Bill should be deferred tothe following Session.5. Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment, in con-sultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the HomeSecretary and the Lord President of the Council, to giveurgent consideration to the action which should be takento discharge the Governmenfs commitment in relationto unoccupied office properties and to report their conclu-sions to the Prime Minister at an early date.6. Invited the Lord President of the Council, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for the Environment, theLord Privy Seal, the Parliamentary Secretary, Treasury,and the Captain, Gentlemen-at-Arms, to consider the
arrangements to be made for consideration in Parliamentboth of the Channel Tunnel project and of the relevantlegislative provisions.Invited the Lord President of the Council to arrange withthe Opposition for the names of the individuals to serve as members of the Speakers Conference on electoral law to be provided forthwith, in order that the Confer-ence should be enabled to proceed urgently to considerthe matters referred to it.Invited the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to give further consideration to the question whether a Bill tomake changes in United Kingdom legislation consequen-tial on changes in Northern Ireland law was required.Took note that the proposed Salmon and freshwater fisheries (Scotland) Bill would not be required in thecurrent Session.Heavy LorriesPreviousReference:CM (72) 53rdConclusions,Minute 2CONFIDENTIAL7. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary ofState for the Environment (CP (72) 151) to which was annexed amemorandum by the Minister for Transport Industries, describing the current position in the European negotiations on lorry weights.The Minister for Transport Industries said that he believed it unlikely that the European Community would attempt to forcethrough a decision on the weights and dimensions of commercial vehicles based on the common orientation reached earlier in theyear. Bilateral contacts indicated that the only pressure for adecision came from the French Government; and it seemed that even they might now accept that this subject could not be settledbefore the Community was enlarged by our accession on 1 January,1973. We should need to examine the possibilities of a compromise solution during 1973; but we should avoid undue haste in taking an initiative for this purpose. The Community position in recent dis-cussions had rested largely on the common orientation. But Onceadditional members had acceded this orientation would no longer be valid and the existing members would probably modify their positions. The prospects of a compromise which we could acceptwould then be improved.In discussion it was suggested that, although deferment of thedecision appeared to be the most likely^ outcome of the further meeting of the Council of Ministers to be held in Brussels on 18 and19 December, we might be faced with a situation in which, as a resultof French pressure, the Community either adopted a settlement on the lines of the present proposals or sought our agreement tosome compromise. Both these possibilities would cause us con-siderable difficulty. It would be almost impossible to defend anycompromise solution so soon after the recent Parliamentary debate in which the Community&apos;s attitude had been so sharply criticised;and, if the Six forced through the present draft directive in the face
european community:negotiations in Brusselsof our known opposition, we should have to maintain that we couldnot regard ourselves as bound by it. For the longer term, despite the advantages of securing a considerable period of deferment, itwould be advisable to avoid a situation in which the settlement onheavy lorries might become involved with all the other issues whichwould fall to be settled by the end of the following year.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that we should continue to seek to have the decisiondeferred until after our entry into the Community. But it was clearthat the French authorities were at present insisting on securing animmediate decision; and the other members might weaken underthis pressure. The Minister for Transport Industries should thereforeindicate at the meeting of the Council of Ministers on 18 and 19December that, although we could pot accept an unfavourabledecision before our accession, we would be prepared to negotiateconstructively about the matter in 1973 with the aim of settling it within six months. The Cabinet would wish to consider at a later date the details of the arrangement which we might then be able tonegotiate, bearing in mind the attitude of our Community partnersand the presentational difficulties in this country.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Minister for Trans-port Industries, in his discussions with Community repre-sentatives on 18 and 19 December, to be guided accord-ingly.2. Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment, on theassumption that the Community decision was deferred until after United Kingdom accession, to give furtherconsideration to a possible solution and to circulateproposals at the appropriate point.The Prime Minister reminded the Cabinet that a large numberof important subjects would be under discussion at the combinedCouncil Meetings of the European Community in Brussels on 18and 19 December. These included not only lorries and similarsubjects, where the Community was trying to press business to completion, but also negotiations on agricultural transition whichwere now at a critical stage on the issues of New Zealand dairy products, sugar, and the arrangements for pigmeat, eggs and poultry.Ministers should have in mind the need for their Departments tokeep in close touch with developments in Brussels in. these last days before our accession to the Community. We must be ready to takeprompt decisions when necessary; and efficient interdepartmentalco-ordination would be particularly important.The Cabinet-3.  Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers statement.
Civil LiabilityandCompensationfor PersonalInjuryProposedRoyalCommissionPreviousReference:CM (72) 53rdConclusions,Minute 48. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordChancellor (CP (72) 146), to which was annexed a draft statement about the terms of reference and composition of the Royal Commis-sion which the Cabinet had decided should be established to considerthe basis of liability for personal injury.The Lord Chancellor said that a meeting of the ministers principally concerned had decided to recommend a change in thedraft terms of reference previously considered by the Cabinet (annex to CP (72) 129). This would make it clear that the Royal commission would be required to consider not only in what circumstances andby what means compensation should be payable in respect of deathor personal injury but also the prior question whether compensation should be payable at all. As regards the composition of the RoyalCommission, the Ministers considered that Lord Pearson would bea very suitable Chairman. It had been ascertained informally thathe would be willing to undertake the task if invited to do so; and itwas accordingly suggested that his name should be announced aspart of the statement that a Royal Commission was to be established.The meeting of Ministers had also agreed the terms of the draft statement which was before the Cabinet. The draft omitted any reference to the Governmenfs reservations about a possible Stateinsurance scheme on the grounds that this matter could most effec-tively be dealt with in reply to supplementary Questions. It was proposed that the statement should be made before Parliament rosefor the Christmas Recess.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.The outcome of the Royal Commission might prove to be expensiveand embarrassing. But an inquiry into the issues involved was inevitable at some point; and on balance it would be politicallypreferable to institute it without further delay. It would be impor-tant, however, to arrange appropriate publicity for the announce-ment and, in particular, to emphasise that the Government were not committed in advance either to the payment of compensation in anyof the circumstances referred to in the terms of reference or to ascheme of State insurance.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet approved the terms of reference now proposed. they also agreed that Lord Pearson would be a suitable Chairman and thathis appointment should be announced at the same time as thedecision to establish the Royal Commission. The terms of the draft statement were acceptable, subject to a drafting point which theSecretary of State for Social Services should discuss with the LordChancellor. The statement should be made on Tuesday 19 Decemberby himself in the House of Commons and by the Lord Chancellor inthe House of Lords. The publicity arrangements should be discussed between the Lord Chancellor and the Home Secretary.The Cabinet-1.  Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.2.  Invited the Lord Chancellor and the Home Secretary toproceed accordingly.
Defaults onthe housing finance ActsPreviousReference:CM (72) 54thConclusions,Minute 7CONFIDENTIAL9. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretaryof State for Scotland (CP (72) 148) and the Secretary of State forthe Environment (CP (72) 154) about the action to be taken againstlocal authorities who were failing to implement the provisions of theHousing Finance Acts.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that opposition inScotland was crumbling. The number of authorities in defaultwas now only 14. Others would probably comply shortly; and it seemed likely in the end only two minor authorities would persistin their refusal to implement the Act. Glasgow Corporation hadvoted to continue defiance; and he proposed that the Lord Advocateshould apply to the Court of Session on his behalf for an Orderrequiring the specific performance of the steps specified in thedefault Order which had recently been made. He had ascertainedinformally, however, that the Corporation would comply with anOrder of the Court; and he therefore intended to ask the lord advocate to adopt the most rapid procedure available by applyingfor an interim Order.The Secretary of State for the Environment said that at ClayCross the District Auditor had adjourned his hearing until 4 January1973 and that at Conisbrough the Council might resolve to implement the Act at their next meeting. The most serious difficulty was presented by Camden, where the Council had recently resolved notto comply with the default Order. The Labour majority group on the Council, however, was very evenly divided; and nearly halfits members had abstained from voting. In these circumstancesstrong action afforded the best prospect of persuading the Council tocomply; and he therefore proposed to inform them that he intendedto stop their entitlement to subsidies under the Housing finance act for 1972-73 and, if their default continued, for 1973-74. TheCouncil would be allowed 21 days in which to make representations.He would also ask the Council to repay some  700,000 (equivalent toa 2p rate) which had been paid in June 1972 as an advance paymentof subsidies due under the Act.The Secretary of State for Wales said that two Housing Com-missioners had now been appointed in Wales, as had been agreed by the Cabinet, and that matters were proceeding smoothly.In discussion there was agreement that strong action was neces-sary as the most likely method of securing compliance by Camden.There was some danger, however, that, if too drastic measures were adopted, public opinion might support the Council against theGovernment and that the prospect of ending the default would therefore be reduced.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed generally with the proposals by the secretaries of State for the Environment and for Scotland. The action taken against Camden, however, should not be so drastic as to risk provok-ing a serious public reaction in the CounciTs favour. The Secretaryof State should therefore inform the Council of his intention to
withhold subsidy for 1972-73 and, if necessary, for 1973-74, allowingthem due time in which to make representations; but it would be preferable not at this stage to seek the refund of the advance pay-ment already made.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Non-industrial civil ServiceManpowerPreviousReference:CM (72) 40thConclusions,Minute 8CONFIDENTIAL10. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal (CP (72) 150) about Civil Service manpower.The Lord Privy Seal said that, in accordance with the cabinets decision at their meeting on 8 August, the Parliamentary Secretary,Civil Service Department, had discussed with designated ministers in each Department possible means of reducing forecast staff require-ments for each Department by 1 per cent a year. As a result,forecast total requirements for industrial and non-industrial civilservants at 1 April, 1973, had been reduced by nearly 5,000, and at April, 1974, by over 11,000, equivalent to financial savings in a full year of about  9 million and  20 million respectively. although this would imply that total numbers at 1 April, 1974, would be 15,000higher than in July 1970, and might therefore attract some criticismwhen the figures became known, he intended to approve the 1973-74Estimates on this basis. It was important that Ministers givenresponsibility in Departments for seeking staff savings should havea continuing responsibility in this field, regularly scrutinising demands for staff increases and seeking reductions wherever possible, and thatthey should be involved in the formative stages of policy-makingwhich had significant manpower implications. The parliamentary secretary, Civil Service Department, would continue to keep closely in touch with them. He himself was proceeding with the programmeof manpower reviews approved by the Cabinet at their meeting on16 March and hoped soon to settle which two or three departments should be reviewed after the Scottish Office.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet approved the proposals. The success which had been achieved in checking the rate of growth of Civil Service manpowershowed the value of giving junior Ministers greater responsibilityfor specific fields of work; and the measures which were now in handor proposed should be pressed forward vigorously.
British SteelCorporationDevelopmentStrategy11. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Trade and Industry (CP (72) 152), to which was attached amemorandum by the Minister for Industry about the developmentstrategy of the British Steel Corporation (BSC) to the early 1980s.They also had before them a Note by the Secretary of State for employment (CP (72) 155) on the implications of this strategy formanning and employment.The Prime Minister said that the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy had recently discussed the bsc&apos;s developmentstrategy, which involved difficult questions of industrial, regional and social policy in areas which already suffered from high ratesof male unemployment. The proposal to concentrate on five majorworks would mean scrapping modern equipment elsewhere, dispers-ing skilled manpower and dissipating traditions of good industrial relations in favour of some areas with a less impressive record.These considerations had led the Committee to propose that theChairman and certain members of the Board of BSC should make an oral presentation of their strategy to the Ministers directly concerned on the following day, in order that, when the Cabinetresumed their discussion, they might be more fully informed aboutthe rationale of the bsc&apos;s proposals. Meanwhile, the Cabinet might usefully have a preliminary discussion of the main features of those proposals. The Government were being pressed to make a statement on the subject before the Recess; but it would be unwise to takepremature decisions, on that account alone, on issues Of such major importance.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that, in thelight of past events, there could be legitimate doubts about therealism of the bsc&apos;s development strategy. But extended discussions with the Board had established that all its members were not onlywell aware of these doubts but had also satisfied themselves thattheir proposals could be defended against any criticisms which were likely to be expressed at the presentation on the following day.The bsc&apos;s strategy should be seen in the context of the nation&apos;industrial position and prospects. Between 1964 and 1970 the investment programmes of all our major competitors in terms ofsteel had increased more rapidly, in relative terms, than our own;and in the last two years this trend had probably accelerated. Ifit continued, our industrial base would be heavily outmatched bythat of France and the Federal German Republic. In France, steeloutput was expected to reach a level by 1975 which we were notplanning to attain until the mid-1980s. A major factor in the develop-ment of the steel industry was the reduction in costs which couldbe achieved by the transport of ore in bulk carriers to deep watercoastal sites, of a kind being intensively exploited in France and japan. Inland works were bound to suffer in competition; it hadbeen estimated, for example, that the cost of producing steel atShotton, even when modernised, would still be  4 per tonne higherthan at Port Talbot. Moreover, the Governmenfs decisions mustbe related to our forthcoming membership of the European Coal
and Steel Community (ECSC), whose rules did not allow the industryto be subsidised. If the industry became uncompetitive, therefore,the loss of jobs would be even greater than under the bsc&apos;s proposals.Even so, it must be recognised that the Corporation^ strategy neces-sarily depended on assumptions about world prices which mightbe falsified; and there were therefore risks in proceeding quite as rapidly as they would like. There was little doubt of the eventualneed for a modern complex of the kind proposed for Teesside. Butthe wisdom of commissioning it immediately had been questioned;and the Government could guard against the risks of over-develop^ment by keeping control of the timing both of this project and of theproposed expansion of Port Talbot and establishing year by yearwhether circumstances justified an advance to the next stage.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he recognised theneed to modernise the steel industry; and it was notable that atHunterston Scotland could offer the only berth in Europe whichwould accommodate, without dredging and in proximity to a levelsite, ore carriers of half a million tons. But the bsc&apos;s proposalsenvisaged the closure or under-use of a substantial amount of modernfinishing capacity in Scotland; and it would therefore be preferable to increase the proposed production of liquid steel in Scotland by1-1^ million tonnes a year, partly by expanding production atRavenscraig more quickly than was envisaged and partly by replacing the proposed small electric arc steel works by a larger works basedon the reduction of iron ore and by keeping two existing rollingmills in production. Otherwise, the range of products would be greatly reduced; and under the ECSC &quot; basing-point &quot; price system,users of steel in Scotland would incur higher charges.The Secretary of State for Wales said that the bsc&apos;s strategydid not take sufficient account of the social problems which it would create. Wales was more dependent on steel than any other part ofthe United Kingdom; 11 per cent of the male workforce was employed in the steel industry. The bsc&apos;s proposals would entail a loss of 17,000-18,000 jobs including 4,500 at Ebbw Vale, 6,500 atShotton and 4,000 at Cardiff. The life of such localities would bedevastated. Without prejudice to the case for modernising the steelindustry, the bsc&apos;s estimates had consistently been shown to beoptimistic; and when they had been asked to justify the assumptionsunderlying their strategy they had failed to do so. The expansionof productive capacity in France and Japan must inevitably giverise to considerable doubts about the potential for exports of british steel. In the light of the consequences of over-capacity in the longer,term the case for a new complex on Teesside had not been made out;and it would be preferable to proceed with modernising the five&quot; heritage &quot; works, as well as Shotton.In discussion the need to modernise the steel industry was endorsed in principle and it was accepted that steel technology had made such rapid progress that even comparatively modern works,such as Shotton or Cleveland, would soon become outdated. Butit was more difficult to assess the extent, siting and timing of thenecessary expansion. If the Corporation^ present estimate of demand
was once again too high and the industry was compelled to operate at less than full capacity in the competitive climate of the ECSC,wholesale closures of the older plants would become inevitable.In this connection it was very relevant that the bsc&apos;s assumptions about profitability were based on the most optimistic view of prices for steel, levels of turnover and of exports and costs of production.On the basis of more realistic assumptions the proposed Teessidecomplex showed a negative return, in net present value terms, of between  250 million and  500 million. The Corporation should therefore be pressed to justify their own assumptions at the forth-coming presentation. Even so, the risks entailed by a programmeof modernisation and expansion could be argued to be outweighed by the danger that, if such a programme was not commissionedwithout further delay, the industry would be condemned to inexorabledecline. Resources would be better spent in producing an industrycapable of competing in world markets than in supporting an industryin progressive decay.In further discussion it was suggested that there was a risk of excess world capacity in the manufacture of crude steel and thatthere was therefore a case for placing greater reliance on importsof crude steel and concentrating the manufacturing capacity in thiscountry on processing. This would improve profitability and would diminish the need for capital investment, although it would have an adverse effect on the balance of payments and might put the industry at a disadvantage in competition with foreign plants which bothmade and processed steel. The economic advantages of coastal sites for new complexes should also be weighed against the social costs of abandoning existing works inland. In particular, the phasing ofthe Teesside complex must be considered in relation to its effecton other parts of the North East; an immediate announcement ofthe construction of a new plant which could not be completed for five or six years would give rise to widespread dismay in the areaslikely to be affected by closures. Moreover, experience in the admin-istration of regional policy had shown the danger of an assumptionthat industry which had disappeared from an area could readily bereplaced; and there was already a marked tendency for any newjobs in the areas which would be most affected under the proposedstrategy to be taken by women rather than by men. The scale of change and closures envisaged in the bsc&apos;s strategy entailed notonly economic but also social risks; and the Government must beon their guard against exposing a flank in these areas to subversiveelements as well as to their political opponents.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had had a useful exchange of views. They recognised thatin the face of competition from our partners in the ECSC there werecompelling reasons for the British steel industry to be modernised;and the fact that other countries were already heavily committed to increased investment was not in itself an argument that we should draw back. When the annual output of a single Japanese company was already 35 million tonnes, alternative strategies producing 33million or 36 million tonnes in the 1980s must be seen in perspective.None the less, the Cabinet had recognised that the social and regional
problems involved in the reorganisation of the industry must begiven full weight; and these would be explored further with the BSCin the course of the presentation on the following day. The outcome of that occasion would be reported to the Cabinet when they resumedtheir discussion at the next meeting.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office,14 December, 1972.
