The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Secretary of State for the Environment said that duringthe debate on the following Monday on the Piccadilly, covent garden and other Central London developments, the Governmentwould be criticised for having allowed large office properties, suchas Centre Point, to remain empty for long periods. planning permission for these properties had been obtained by the developersin areas v/here such permission was difficult to obtain; but theyhad found it financially more attractive to leave the propertiesvacant while the level of rents increased, with a resultant large increase in market value and potential capital profit. There hadbeen much adverse comment on this situation; and he had been considering proposals for imposing some form of financial penaltyif large office properties were left vacant for long periods in such circumstances; this penalty might be associated with a threat touse compulsory purchase powers if the properties were not letwithin a specified period. While these possibilities would require futher examination, it might be expedient that he should indicateduring the forthcoming debate that the Government were con-contemplating the introduction of legislation on the matter.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that proposals to deal with this problem must beconsidered urgently. It involved several difficult questions whichit would be necessary to examine thoroughly before any statementof policy, including any decision to introduce legislation, could bemade. The Secretary of State for the Environment should circulateproposals forthwith to the Ministers concerned, including the LordChancellor, and should describe the form of the statement which he might make in the forthcoming debate.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of Statefor the Environment to proceed accordingly.The Cabinet reviewed the arrangements for announcing the government&apos;s acceptance of the Boyle Report on Top Salaries andthe Halsbury Report on the Salaries of Doctors and Dentists and confirmed that this announcement should be made by WrittenParliamentary Answer on Friday, 23 June. Some of the increases,however, although not excessive on a percentage basis, involvedsubstantial sums in absolute terms. This was partly the result ofthe lengthy interval between Reports. The Government did notcontrol the procedures of the Review Bodies; but it was neverthe-less for consideration whether it would be helpful presentationallyif they reported more often and, in order to minimise the numberof separate announcements, at broadly the same time.
SelectCommitteeonProcedureReport onMattersSub Judice2. The Lord President of the Council said that the Select Com-mittee on Procedure had recently published a report on MattersSub Judice, in which they had recommended that, subject always to the discretion of the Chair and the right of the House to legislate,the existing sub judice rule should continue to apply in the Houseof Commons to matters before the criminal courts, courts martialand judicial bodies such as Tribunals under the Tribunals of Enquiry(Evidence) Act 1921 and to proceedings for defamation in civil courts. They had proposed, however, that matters awaiting orunder adjudication in all civil courts, except actions for defamation,might in future be referred to in Questions, Motions or debate unless it appeared to the Chair that this would involve a real and substan-tial danger of prejudice to the legal proceedings in question. Theyhad indicated certain considerations which in their view shouldinfluence the Chair in exercising discretion whether to restrict com-ment in the House in a case in which a Minister had made anapplication to a court or had initiated proceedings on a matter ofnational importance; these included the consideration that comment on the precise issues on which the court had to decide should notbe permitted. The Select Committee had also considered how thechange of approach which they had recommended in relation to civil courts should apply to particular issues arising under theEmergency Procedures of the Industrial Relations Act. They had recommended that, subject to the discretion of the Chair, whichshould be exercised with due regard to the considerations set outin their report, there should normally be no bar to the discussionof &quot; unassailable&quot; Ministerial views expressed to the industrial relations Court under paragraphs (1) (a) and (c) of Sections 138 and141 of the Industrial Relations Act, being views which could only be challenged in the Court on grounds of bad faith, etc.; or to thediscussion of the considerations of the national economy and of danger to persons or livelihoods set out in sub-section (2) of those sections. As regards issues under sub-section (2) of Sections 139and 142, such as the specification of the areas of employment to be covered and the individuals to be bound by &quot; cooling off &quot; orders,the length of the &quot; cooling off &quot; period and the form of the question on which a ballot was to be taken, the Select Committee had recom-mended that the Speaker should be influenced by a consideration ofthe impropriety of allowing Questions, Motions or debate on the precise details which the Court were required to specifyThe Ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedure at their meeting on the previous afternoon had considered these recom-mendations. They had recognised the importance of avoidingprejudice to proceedings before the civil courts and of maintaining the independence of the judiciary. They had also been mindful ofthe substantial additional burden which implementation of the SelectCommittee&apos;s proposals would impose on the Chair. They had concluded, however, that the recommendations were broadly acceptable and that it would be difficult for the Government to putforward proposals which fell short of them. The Opposition hadinformally indicated that they would be prepared to accept theSelect Committee&apos;s Report and that, if the Government also agreed,
they would be content with a debate of no more than two hours onthe following Monday after 10 o&apos;clock.The Lord Chancellor said that he viewed with considerableconcern the proposal to alter the sub judice rule in relation to matters awaiting or under adjudication in all civil courts, a proposal which raised a major constitutional issue. The Select Committeeappeared to have disregarded the damage which could be done bydebate and comment in Parliament. The judges themselves wouldnot be influenced; but the Select Committee had not given sufficientweight to the risk of prejudicing the evidence given by witnessesand the conduct of the parties in the proceedings. If the changerecommended by the Select Committee was made, it was unlikelythat the Chair would in fact be able to afford the necessary degreeof protection against these dangers. Moreover, if Members ofParliament were allowed to discuss the attitude and disposition of individual judges, the basic principle of the independence of the judiciary would be placed in jeopardy. For these reasons he was opposed to the recommendations of the Select Committee in relationto matters before the civil courts generally; and, although he was prepared to accept their specific proposals in relation to the Indus-trial Relations Court, he considered that the Cabinet should not come to a decision on the wider issue, which was not of the sameurgency, until he had been able to consult the judiciary on theimportant issues involved.In discussion there was general recognition of the importanceof the constitutional principle at stake. On the other hand the observance of the sub judice convention by Parliament represented a voluntary act of self-denial by the Legislature in order to avoid prejudicing proceedings in the courts; and it was traditionallysubject to the discretion of the Chair. Moreover, the Select Com-mittee had accepted that prejudice was most likely to occur inrelation to issues tried by jury, such as criminal cases and defamationproceedings; but in view of the evidence given by Mr. Speaker, theyhad considered that there would be no significant departure fromthe present practice, as instanced in the Mersey Docks and HarbourBoard case in 1970, if Mr. Speaker were to be entrusted with theresponsibility for exercising his discretion to exclude matters wherethere was a real and substantial danger of prejudice. In addition,no alteration would be made by the Select Committee&apos;s recom-mendations in the rule that a judge could be criticised only bymeans of a substantive Motion. So far as the specific recommenda-tions relating to the Industrial Relations Court were concerned, theGovernment would be open to criticism if they sought to maintain that Ministers were not accountable to Parliament even on the issueson which they could not be assailed in the Court. On the questionof damage to the national&apos; economy and the other general issues onwhich the Court were required to be satisfied, there might admittedlybe some risk of simultaneous discussion in Parliament and the Court.But a Parliamentary debate on such general matters could not inany event be avoided if the Government found it necessary to seekEmergency Powers during the period when the Court action was proceeding.   Moreover, it would be undesirable to treat the
Industrial Relations Court differently from the civil courts, since this would be regarded as an admission that there was substance in the Opposition^ claim that the Court was different in characterfrom other Courts and was not acting judicially in the normallyaccepted sense.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that decisions on the recommendations made by theSelect Committee could not be taken immediately. While it was essential that there should be no unreasonable restriction ondiscussion in Parliament, the sub judice rule was of long standing and had been applied satisfactorily in the past in relation to matters before the civil, as well as the criminal, courts. It would be unwisefor the Government to agree to a major change in respect of mattersawaiting or under adjudication in the civil courts before the LordChancellor had consulted the judiciary on the extent to which the integrity of the judicial procedure might be affected. The alterna-tive course of accepting that changes should be made in the subjudice rule solely in respect of matters before the Industrial RelationsCourt would be undesirable, since it would appear to endorse theOpposition^ contention that that Court did not have the same status and character as other courts; and it would encourage them intheir attempts to secure public support for the repeal of the wholeof the Industrial Relations Act, including the abolition of theIndustrial Relations Court itself. In view of the Opposition^pressure for an early debate on the Select Committee&apos;s Report, theLord President should inform the House of Commons during thecourse of his Business Statement that afternoon that the Govern-ment realised the importance of the matters dealt with in the Report,including the major recommendation affecting proceedings in civil courts generally, and that they were considering the recommenda-tions urgently with a view to making a substantive announcementas soon as possible. The Cabinet would resume their discussion ofthe matter at an early meeting. For this purpose the Lord Presidentof the Council, in consultation with the Attorney General, should circulate a memorandum setting out the issues more fully for the cabinet&apos;s consideration; and the Lord Chancellor should beprepared to report the result of his discussions with the judiciary.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Ministers concerned: to proceed accordingly.OverseaAffairsIcelandicFisheriesDisputePreviousReference:CM (72) 30thConclusions,Minute 2SECRET3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary ofState for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (CP (72) 63) on theposition reached in the negotiations consequent upon the declaredintention of the Government of Iceland to extend their fisherieslimits to a distance of 50 miles from their coastThe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he did notrate highly the prospects either that the International Court would
grant a standstill order restraining the Icelandic Government fromextending their fisheries limits before the hearing of the case whichhe had submitted to the Court or that that case would eventually be upheld by the Court. It was therefore desirable that we should seek to secure an agreement with the Icelandic Government whichwas acceptable to both Governments and would not prejudicediscussion of fisheries limits at the Law of the Sea Conference in1973. The Icelandic Government would probably try to insist uponexclusion of foreign fishing vessels from at any rate some areaswithin the 50-mile limit. This could perhaps be accepted providedthat they were prepared to place a limit (either in terms of size offish or extent of catch) upon fishing in the areas from which foreignvessels would be excluded and that this agreement was presented as based primarily on principles of conservation rather than nationaldiscrimination. The Icelandic Foreign Minister, who was betterdisposed towards us than was the Fisheries Minister, who was a communist, was examining the possibility of postponing from1 July to 15 July the promulgation of fisheries regulations establish-ing new limits. The Minister of State for Foreign and Common-wealth Affairs, Lady Tweedsmuir, should therefore visit Reykjavikwithin the next two weeks and attempt to secure agreement on thelines which he had indicated. If no agreement could be reached,we should have to seek ail interim order from the international court; but there could be no certainty either that the Court wouldgrant the order or that, even if it did, the Icelandic Governmentwould observe it. We Should then have little alternative to estab-lishing a scheme of naval protection for our fishing vessels, whichwould inevitably lead to a series of acrimonious incidents.The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that it wasespecially important that we should not make any concession whichcould be construed as admitting the principle of discrimination on national grounds. Any such suggestion would be extremely difficult for the fisheries industry to accept; and there were substantialreasons, in terms of employment, food supplies and conservationwithin our own fishing grounds, for resisting our exclusion from our traditional fishing grounds in Icelandic waters. Moreover, if the icelandic Government established a discriminatory precedent, there might well be unfortunate repercussions in Norway, where theNorwegian Government would be seriously embarrassed in rebuttingarguments by the opponents of Norway&apos;s adherence to the european communities that Norway should follow Iceland&apos;s example andshould not put herself in the position of being bound by Communityfisheries regulations. Nevertheless, he agreed with the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary upon the desirability pf reaching an agree-ment with the Icelandic Government, if possible, on the basis of theproposal that we should seek arrangements based essentially oncriteria of conservation, even though they might have the effect of excluding our fishing vessels (which were in general larger thanIcelandic vessels) from certain areas. Before the Minister of Stateentered into fresh negotiations, however, it would be essential toestablish clearly which areas and what criteria we could regard as acceptable. In view of the sensitivity of this question, both withinthe fishing industry and in Parliament, it was essential that we should adopt a robust public posture towards the Icelandic claims.
In discussion it was suggested that on legal grounds there was areasonable chance that we should be able to obtain from the Inter-national Court an interim judgment restraining the icelandic government; but we could not be confident that the Court wouldnot be influenced by political considerations. If this proved to be thecase, or if the Icelandic Government took a unilateral decision, theforce of international law governing fisheries limits would be furthereroded and our position at the Law of the Sea Conference would be prejudiced in advance. These arguments in favour of seekingagreement with the Icelandic Government were reinforced by the dangers, first, that the provision of naval protection to our fishing vessels (which had not in the past proved of great assistance in termsof safeguarding the size of our catch) would be liable to result in aserious deterioration of relations with Iceland and, second, that the icelandic Government might be provoked to denounce the agreementwhereby they provided at Keflavik a strategically important base forNATO maritime surveillance. If an agreement based on conserva-tion criteria was to be sought, this would be better expressed in termsof amount of catch than of size of fish, since Iceland was alreadybound by certain limitations on size of fish prescribed by the NorthEast Atlantic Fisheries Commission.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary shouldbe authorised to resume negotiations with the Icelandic Governmentwith a view to securing an agreement which, although it might havethe effect of excluding British fishing vessels from certain areasbetween 12 and 50 miles from the coast of Iceland, could neverthe-less be represented as based primarily on criteria of conservation andwould also impose certain restrictions upon the activities of Icelandicfishing vessels. The negotiations would be conducted by the Ministerof State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Lady Tweedsmuir,who might wish to be accompanied by a Minister from the Ministryof Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The restrictions which we could accept, and the criteria which we should wish to establish, should be carefully formulated in advance of the negotiations. All possible steps should be taken to enlist support from our allies, particularly from the Federal German Government, whose fishing industry wouldalso be affected by the extension of fisheries limits proposed by the icelandic Government.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion, and invited the Secretary of State forForeign and Commonwealth Affairs and the Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food to be guided accordingly.secret. The Secretary of State For Northern Ireland informed theCabinet of the latest developments in Northern Ireland. their discussion and the conclusions reached were separately recorded and issued only to The Queen, the Prime Minister and those ministers who had to take action.The conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file heldby the Secretary of the Cabinet.
IndustrialAffairsUnemploymentStatisticsPreviousReference:CM (72) 26thConclusions,Minute 6IndustrialAction inthe DocksPreviousReference:CM (72) 30thConclusions,Minute 3PaySettlementsRedundanciesin the SteelIndustryCONFIDENTIAL5. The Secretary of State for Employment informed theCabinet of the monthly unemployment returns to be published that day. Between the May and June counts total unemployment inGreat Britain and Ireland had fallen from 902,000 to 833,000; andthere had been a significant increase in the number of unfilledvacancies.The Secretary of State for Employment said that the industrial court had postponed further action in the case of the dockers whowere picketing the container terminal at Chobham Farm, pendingthe provision of further information and legal opinion about certain aspects of the matter. An application by the Transport and general works Union (TGWU) to the London Dock Labour Board, claim-ing that the work was dock work, was still sub judice under national dock Labour Board procedures. The employer concerned was meeting the unions that day in order to try to find a basis for asettlement. In the meantime it appeared that the National Amalga-mated Stevedores and Dockers (NASD) union would be opposed toany compromise and that &quot; blacking &quot; of containers by militants was becoming more extensive. The Joint Committee reviewing the futureof the dock industry were continuing their work; but Mr. Jones,the General Secretary of the TGWU, was adopting an intransigentattitude and, in particular, was continuing to insist on the abolitionof the Temporarily Unattached Register. It was not yet clear howfar the employers would need to make concessions in order to secureagreed recommendations. He proposed, in conjunction with theMinister for Transport Industries, to circulate to the ministerial committee on Economic Policy a memorandum which would discussthe implications of the issues being studied by the Joint Committeeand their likely recommendations.The Secretary of State for Employment said that, following ameeting of the National Joint Council for Civil Air Transport onthe previous day, agreement had been reached between british european Airways and the British Air Line Pilots&apos; Association on abasis for settlement of the pilots&apos; pay dispute and withdrawal of thestrike notice due to take effect on the following day. Buildingindustry employers were that day meeting union leaders about the threat of strike action in the industry; and there were disturbingreports that a settlement of the dispute was likely on the basis of increases in pay which would be well above the Governments presenttarget rate. There appeared to be little scope, however, for bringing pressure to bear on the employers.The Cabinet-1.  Took note of the statements by the Secretary of State for employment.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that, follow-ing the announcement by the British Steel Corporation (BSC) that between 6,500 and 7,500 jobs would end in Scotland over the next five years as the result of the phasing out of open-hearth furnaces,the Corporation proposed to announce that day further redundancies
at Irlam. It was a matter for concern that they had given virtually no advance warning of these announcements, which would have allowed the Government an opportunity to consider their most appropriate timing. Nevertheless, it had hitherto been accepted thatclosures of plant and the resultant redundancies were matters for theCorporation itself to determine and announce. He had considered whether a Government statement on the matter should be made; buthe had concluded that this would create an undesirable precedent,given the number of further closures expected in, for example, thecoal and steel industries during the next few years.In discussion considerable concern was expressed about theBSCs failure to consult the Government on the timing of theannouncements in question. The unions had been antagonised bythe Corporation^ failure to consult them in advance over the implications of the closures; the Governments defence of the changesin the Iron and Steel Act necessitated by our entry into the european economic Communities, which were to be debated in Parliament inthe following week, had been made more difficult; and some of theMembers of Parliament on both sides of the House of Commons who supported our entry into the e.c. would also be put in a difficult position in their constituencies. Adverse comparisons would bemade between the treatment of Scottish steelworkers and the supportprovided by the Government to preserve jobs at Upper ClydeShipbuilders; and it was unfortunate that the redundancies inScotland should have been announced before the BSC had discussedthem with the Scottish Trades Union Congress, and in advance ofthe corresponding redundancies at steelworks using the open-hearthprocess in other parts of the country, which had still to be announced.It was important that the Government should not appearindifferent to the social problems created by technological change.For these reasons it might be desirable for a statement to be madein the House of Commons that day indicating that the redundanciesfrom these closures, the need for which was generally understood,would be phased over five years and that the Secretary of State wouldbe arranging to discuss their implications, together with possible means of alleviating their social consequences, with all the interested parties.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry should consider urgentlywith the Lord President of the Council what might be said in theHouse of Commons that afternoon to minimise the adverse effect ofthe bsc&apos;s announcements. He should also impress on the Corpora-tion the embarrassment caused by the manner and timing of theirannouncements of impending redundancies at Scottish steelworksand at Irlam; and he should emphasise the need for the corporation in future to recognise the Governments concern with these matters and to agree the timing of similar announcements with Ministerswell in advance.The Cabinet-2. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Lord President ofthe Council and the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry to proceed accordingly..
