secret. The Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs said that the President of Zaire, General Mobutu, intendedto visit Kampala in the next few days in order to urge the Presidentof Uganda, General Amin, to extend the time limit for the expulsionof United Kingdom Passport Holders (UKPH) from Uganda.President Mobutu had asked that in the meantime we should not press our representations in the General Assembly of the united nations; and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, who wasattending the General Assembly, had judged it expedient to complywith this request for the moment on the understanding that PresidentMobutu would also seek to persuade General Amin to withdraw his ruling that UKPH should not be allowed to take their assets withthem. Meanwhile, a few more countries had come forward withoffers to admit Asian UKPH; in particular, the Government of Brazilmight accept about 2,000.The Home Secretary and Lord President of the Council saidthat, while the transport arrangements from Uganda to the UnitedKingdom were now reasonably satisfactory, he was concerned thatthere should be sufficient assurance of transport facilities fromUganda to India to induce those UKPH who elected to go to Indiato proceed there direct rather than via the United Kingdom. Atpresent only about 8,000 places of this kind were available; andthis figure might need to be doubled. The arrangements forreceiving UKPH in the reception centres in this country should nowbe adequate; but a greater effort was needed to persuade individuals and families to move from the centres to more permanent accom-modation. This problem was being examined urgently.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that further consideration should be given to the possibility that General/Amin&apos;s actions could be condemned not only on humanitariangrounds but also because mass expulsion and expropriation without compensation were contrary to international law. It would notnecessarily be in our interest to pursue this argument in public, sincethe matter might then have to be regarded as sub judice at a timewhen we might wish to promote further political action at the united nations. But the strength of our legal case should be examined, as a precaution, by the Law Officers in consultation with the legal advisersof the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The problem of individuals who found themselves stateless as a result of GeneralAmin&apos;s policy also demanded early iaction, especially since thenumber involved might be as high as 15,000. Although the united nations High Commissioner for Refugees had admitted his responsi-bility in this context, vhe appeared to have taken little, if any, action as yet. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should thereforebe invited to bring the matter urgently to the attention of theSecretary-General of the United Nations Dr. Waldheim. Finally,domestic opinion was now showing a more sympathetic under-standing of the Governments policy as regards the acceptance ofAsian UKPH in this country; but it would be advisable for theOverseaAffairsUgandaPreviousReference:CM (72) 42ndConclusions,Minute 2
Cabinet to give further consideration, before the forthcoming party conference, to some of the wider issues involved.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Solicitor-General to give further consideration tothe possibility of challenging the expulsion of AsianUKPH from Uganda on grounds of international law.(3) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign and Common-wealth Affairs to suggest to the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary at the General Assembly of the united nations that he should make urgent representations to theSecretary-General of the United Nations about thoseindividuals who might become stateless as a result of theexpulsion of Asian UKPH from Uganda.northern ireland previous reference:CM (72) 42ndConclusions,Minute 3SECRET2. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland said that theConference of various political parties in Northern Ireland, whichhad been held at Darlington earlier in the week, had not been whollyunproductive in spite of the absence of the Social Democratic andLabour Party. In particular, the representatives of the Alliance party and the Northern Ireland Labour Party had presented their respectiveproposals effectively; and the Conference had provided them withuseful publicity which they were not always able to obtain inNorthern Ireland itself. The Unionist Party, on the other hand, hadneither learned nor forgotten anything; their only purpose was to restore their own political ascendancy at Stormont. But, although their attitude on this issue had been uncompromising during theConference, it remained to be seen whether they would maintainit when the time came for us to announce our own intentions aboutthe future of Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, work was going forward on the preparation of the Green Paper which would represent thefirst stage in the progressive disclosure of our policy; and it would shortly be necessary for Ministers to consider how specific thisinitial statement should be. It might be necessary to avoid someissues at this stage or to give only a broad outline of our proposals;but, where we could give a clear lead, we should do so.Progress had also been made in establishing the Commission of inquiry which was to consider how the methods of counteringterrorism in Northern Ireland in the future might be brought into closer conformity with the normal processes of law. Lord Diplockhad agreed to be the chairman; and it would be helpful if thisappointment, together with the Commission^ terms of reference,which had been agreed with Lord Diplock, could be announced later that day. The Order in Council establishing the special tribunal todeal with cases which could not be heard in open court had nowbeen drafted; and the selection of suitable individuals for appoint-ment to the tribunal was being urgently pursued.
As regards the situation in Northern Ireland, there must neces-sarily be some anxiety about a Loyalist rally to be held at Stormonton the following day, which would be addressed by Mr. Craig, LordBrookeborough and others. The necessary security precautions werebeing taken.In discussion the following main points were made-fa) It was for consideration whether, when the projectedreferendum was held, its scope should not be confined to the issue ofthe Border but should extend to testing public opinion, in addition,on the acceptability of such new constitutional proposals as we put forward. If so, however, the reaction might be adverse; and theGovernment would then find themselves in a position of greatdifficulty and embarrassment. On balance, therefore, it would be preferable to confine the referendum to the specific issue of the border.(b) Problems of violence and intimidation were not peculiar to northern Ireland but were beginning to arise in other parts of theUnited Kingdom. Although it would be inexpedient to expect theCommission of Inquiry to extend their investigations beyond the six Counties, their findings might be relevant in the wider context of Great Britain.(c) The Attorney GeneraFs defence of our security proceduresbefore the Human Rights Commission in Strasbourg had notattracted great attention in Northern Ireland, although his criticisms of the lax attitude of the Government of the Republic of Irelandtowards terrorists had been resented by the Irish Delegation. TheCommission were expected to rule on the admissibility of the itemwithin the next few days. Meanwhile, renewed allegations ofbrutality were being made against the security forces; and ourrelations with the Government of the Republic might come underfresh strain on this account.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that LordDiplock&apos;s appointment and the terms of reference of the Commissionof Inquiry should now be announced. There should be no suggestionthat the Commission were concerned with the United Kingdom apartfrom Northern Ireland; but the Home Secretary should arrange for appropriate consideration to be given to the wider problem of violence and intimidation in Great Britain.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.Public SecurityPreviousReference:CM (72) 42ndConclusions,Minute 5146897-secret. The Prime Minister said that for the past two years we hadbeen intensifying our measures of public security, initially againstthe &quot; hijacking &quot; of aircraft and more recently in a wider context of violence and terrorism.  It was important that all members of the
Government should co-operate fully in ensuring the observance ofthe necessary precautions.The Cabinet-Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.IndustrialAffairsMeeting withtheConfederationof BritishIndustry andthe TradesUnionCongressPreviousReference:CM (72) 42ndConclusions,Minute 4Pay of theIndustrialCivil ServicePreviousReference:CM (72) 42ndConclusions,Minute 4CONFIDENTIAL4. The Prime Minister said that the tripartite meeting between representatives of the Government, the Confederation of BritishIndustry (CBI) and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) on26 September had made significant progress in developing a voluntary prices and incomes policy on the basis of the government&apos;s proposals as outlined in the annex to CP (72) 99. Several of the tuc representatives had clearly been in favour of these proposals;and, although it was regrettable that the TUC Council had subse-quently rejected them, it was encouraging that they had at leastinvited their Economic Committee to prepare alternative proposals.The generally favourable response of public opinion to the proposals should strengthen the Governmenfs hand in the ensuing discussions and should make the TUC more reluctant to attract public criticismby refusing to co-operate in a voluntary tripartite agreement.In discussion there was general agreement that all possible steps should now be taken to consolidate the position which theGovernment had established, largely as a result of the PrimeMinistefs forceful presentation of their case in his recent speeches.Consideration should also be given to the possibility of helping thegeneral public to see the Governmenfs proposals in better perspectiveby publishing information designed to show, e.g. the relatively smallshare of the gross national product attributable to rents and dividendsand the impact of taxation at various levels of income. It shouldalso be made clear that, although the share to be devoted to wagesand salaries under the Governmenfs proposals had been stated tobe 61 per cent, the proportion rose to about 70 per cent if income from self-employment was included.The Lord Privy Seal said that the trade unions representing theIndustrial Civil Service (ICS) had agreed on the previous day thattheir pay claim should be referred to arbitration; and substantial progress had already been made in agreeing the terms of the reference. The unions had asked whether, in the light of the pro-posals which had emerged from the recent tripartite meeting on prices and incomes policy, the Government would still adhere totheir earlier undertaking to accept the award made by the arbitralbody and they had been informed that the Government would do so.There remained the question whether the terms of reference shouldtake specific account of the national interest; and it was intended that at the resumed negotiations that morning officials should makeit Clear that the attention of the arbitrator would be drawn, in the submission of the Governmenfs case, to the proposals for a tripartite agreement and, in particular, to the statement that the Governmentexpected all those concerned with pay and price determination not
to take any action inconsistent with the Governmenfs proposals,including the proposal that pay increases should be limited to amaximum of  2 a week. It was possible, but unlikely, that theunions might now withdraw from arbitration. If, however, arbitra-tion took place, there was admittedly some risk of an embarrassinglyhigh award, which might subsequently be invoked to frustrate the government&apos;s new policy to counter inflation. Nevertheless, it wouldbe right that this risk should be accepted; and any repercussionsshould be resisted on the grounds that the Governmenfs offer ofarbitration had been made some time before the new policy was putforward.In discussion some concern was expressed about the possibility that the Government, after pressing the ICS unions to go to arbitra-tion and undertaking to implement the ensuing award, might subse-quently propose to reject the award of the arbitrator if it exceeded theterms of the proposals which had been made during the tripartite meeting. The Government now had a moral commitment to theICS unions, which they were bound to honour; and it would beless damaging to withdraw from arbitration now and to substitutean offer within the maximum increase of  2 a week than to reject anarbitrator^ award at a later stage. In any event the arbitrationproceedings would not be likely to take place before further trypartite discussions had been held.On the other hand, an award which exceeded the equivalent ofan increase of  2 would have grave implications for the success ofthe Governmenfs new policy. There were other pay negotiations inthe public sector where varying degrees of commitment existed, in theform of undertakings to implement, or of offers of, pay increases which would be greater than the Governmenfs new proposals would permit. These were already under urgent examination;; and this might suggest that in those cases where firm commitments existed orimplementation had been delayed, e.g. Probation Officers, the rele-vant increases should be permitted but in those cases wherenegotiations were still in train, e.g. the Police, the Government would need to be firm in maintaining the limits prescribed by their new policy. In any event it would be very important to ensure that nofurther decisions would be taken without prior consideration of allthe implications.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theMinisters concerned should give urgent consideration both to theposition in relation to the ICS negotiations and to the impact of theother current pay negotiations on the Governmenfs proposals. no opportunity should be given to the more militant unions to under-mine those proposals; and all possible steps should be taken toavoid action which would be inconsistent with them.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
housing finance ActPreviousReference:CM (72) 39thConclusions,Minute 55. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the arrange-ments being made by local authorities for the implementation of thehousing finance legislation and the steps which might be taken to dealwith any authorities who maintained their refusal to give effectto its provisions. They had before them memoranda by the Secre-tary of State for Scotland (CP (72) 92), the Secretary of State forthe Environment (CP (72) 94) and the Secretary of State for Wales(CP (72) 95), reviewing the present position in Scotland, Englandand Wales respectively.The Cabinet were informed that in England fourteen authorities were still refusing to implement the legislation; but the intentions ofa small number of others, including Birmingham, were not yet finallyclear. It would therefore be preferable to defer action until the birmingham authority had made their decision on 3 October; but from 5 October onwards it would probably be necessary to notifyeach of the fourteen authorities that consideration was being given tothe making of a default order against them under the Act. Once thisnotice had been sent, and provided that the attitude and actions ofthe authority seemed likely to justify surcharge by the district auditor,it would be necessary to direct that an extraordinary audit shouldbe held.In Wales only five authorities, including Merthyr, remainedrecalcitrant. It was proposed that corresponding notices should besent to these authorities on 2 October.In Scotland some 50 authorities, including Glasgow, were boundto come in default of the requirements of the legislation; and it wouldbe necessary to consider instituting default proceedings against mostof them. It was therefore proposed to approach all the Scottishauthorities who were defying the Act on 2 October, requiring themto supply specific information on the basis of which a prima faciecase of default could be submitted to the local inquiry which it wouldbe necessary to hold in Scotland before a decision could be madewhether a default had in fact occurred. Initially, some 25 authorities would be approached on this basis on 2 October; and others wouldbe similarly dealt with thereafter.In due course it would be necessary in all three countries todecide whether to make default orders in particular cases and, if theauthority refused to comply with an order, to decide what course ofaction should then be adopted.In discussion there was general agreement that it would benecessary to set in train the initial procedures under the legislation.It would be desirable, however, that this action should besimultaneous in all three countries; and it would be politicallyadvantageous to defer it until 5 October. Experience, e.g. in relationto the similar controversy about school milk had shown that itwould be necessary for the Cabinet to keep the situation under closereview and to refrain from taking decisions about subsequent action until the reactions of the local authorities had been ascertained.In particular, it would be undesirable for any extraordinary auditsto be instituted at this stage.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that no steps should be taken until 5 October. Onthat date, however, the Secretaries of State concerned should set in train the initial procedures which were appropriate in each country, as indicated in the memoranda before the Cabinet. TheCabinet would need to consider the situation again in a month&apos;s time;and in the interim no further formal steps should be taken. Whenthe Cabinet resumed their discussion it would be necessary to decide whether to make default orders and also to consider which of the subsequent courses of action should be adopted if the authorities didnot comply with the orders.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretaries of State for Scotland, for the Environ-ment and for Wales to put in hand the initial proceduresas indicated in the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and to make a further report to the Cabineton the situation towards the end of October.(3) Invited the Secretaries of State for Scotland, for the environment and for Wales, in consultation with theHome Secretary and Lord President of the Council, toarrange for suitable arrangements to be made for thepublic presentation of the Governments decision to take these initial steps.Cabinet Office,29 September, 1972.
