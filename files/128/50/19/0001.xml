ParliamentaryAffairsThe BudgetPreviousReference:CM (72) 17thConclusionsSECRETOversea Affairs 2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that on hisIran way to visit Pakistan he had had a meeting with the Shah of Iran.He had found that the Shah was broadly content with the arrange-ments made in the Gulf following the termination of our specialrelationships there and that his main concern was with the signs ofincreasing Soviet influence in the area. He considered this particu-larly dangerous in Iraq, where the Soviet Government were exploitingdissident Kurdish elements. In this situation the Shah was lookingincreasingly to the West for support and assistance; and, as a result,there were good prospects for the expansion of our trade. Ingeneral our relations with Iran could be regarded as very satisfactory.Pakistan The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he had beenPrevious warmly welcomed during his visit to Pakistan. He had found that reference: President Bhutto had grown in stature following the PakistaniCM (72): 14th defeat and the loss of the former East Wing. The President was conclusions, undoubtedly the only political leader with sufficient authority to minute 2 unite the country; but he would need to be given time to put it on itsfeet again. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister of India, Mrs. Gandhi,was adding to his difficulties by her insistence that any discussions about future relations between India and Pakistan should deal withall outstanding issues, including the very sensitive question ofKashmir. President Bhutto was prepared to go himself to visitMrs. Gandhi for discussions in which, although no agenda need beagreed in advance, he would hope to deal first with immediate prob-lems such as the return of Pakistani prisoners of war. Mrs. Gandhfsinsistence that such discussions could better be handled by a pleni-plenipotentiary created further problems for President Bhutto, since he hadremoved from office most of the senior officials of the former regime and their replacements were insufficiently experienced to provide adequate representation. The Foreign and Commonwealth See-retary recalled that he had sent a message to Mrs. Gandhi stressingthe importance of establishing peace in the sub-continent as quickly as possible and urging her to adopt a more conciliatory attitudetowards President Bhutto. There were also difficulties in the wayof an early meeting between President Bhutto and Sheikh MujiburRahman, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh;, here again, the attitudeof Mrs. Gandhi was crucial and, at the moment, unhelpful.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would wish to tenderto the Chancellor of the Exchequer their warmest congratulations onthe content and presentation of his Budget.
IsraelPreviousReference:CM (72) 16thConclusions,Minute 3The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in the courseof a day of discussions with the Prime Minister of Israel, Mrs. Meir,and the Foreign Minister, Mr. Eban, he had been impressed by thehardness of their attitude towards the settlement of the Arab-Israeldispute. They were still insisting that Egypt must learn the lessons of military defeat and abandon her stipulation that negotiations could only begin on the understanding that a settlement would include a provision for the total withdrawal of Israeli forces. Withregard to the recent proposals of the King of Jordan for the creationof a united Arab Kingdom on a federal basis, the Israeli Ministersregarded it as regrettable that the King had publicly staked a claim to part of Jerusalem, thereby reducing the area of possible negotiation.In these circumstances there appeared to be no unilateral actionwhich we could usefully take at this stage to bring together the partiesto the dispute. It was greatly to be hoped, however, that during theforthcoming visit of the President of the United States to Moscowthe Governments of the United States and the Soviet Union might agree on steps which could be taken towards a settlement.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.northern ireland previous reference:CM (72) 15thConclusions,Minute 1SECRET3. The Cabinet gave further consideration to the situation inNorthern Ireland in the light of the talks the Prime Minister had held on the previous day with the Prime Minister of NorthernIreland. Their discussion and the conclusions reached were separately -ately recorded and issued only to The Queen, the Prime Minister andthose Ministers who had to take action.The conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file heldby the Secretary of the Cabinet.SECRETIndustrial 4.   The Minister for Transport Industries said that, in the courseAffairs of further negotiations with the rail unions, the British RailwaysRailwaymen&apos;s Board had improved their offer to just below 11 per cent increase in pay the wage bill.   Details of the offer were set out in the annex to his negotiations minute of 22 March to the Prime Minister, copies of which hadPrevious been circulated to members of the Cabinet. The Board had alsoReference: tabled a draft agreement for future co-operation on the industry&apos;sCM (72) 16th problems, including progress towards a salaried pay structure. AHConclusions, the three rail unions had rejected the revised offer, and said that minute 4 WOuld not be prepared to continue discussions or to considerthe draft agreement without a promise of higher cash increases.The Board&apos;s negotiator had undertaken to report their views to hisBoard and to get in touch with the unions again when he had obtained the Board&apos;s views.  It was the Board&apos;s intention to take their time in
arranging for discussions to be resumed, so that what they believed to have been a generous offer should meanwhile make its impact onthe union leaders, the railwaymen themselves, and indeed on thegeneral public. Nevertheless, the Chairman judged it on balance tobe unlikely that the unions would settle on the basis of the revisedoffer, and there remained scope for making only a marginalimprovement within the 11 per cent limit on which both the Boardand the Government were resolved. The Chairman had not yetparticipated in the negotiations himself, although he was ready to doso whenever it seemed advantageous; but he did not in any eventintend to agree to meet the unions until after the weekend. Shouldthe negotiations finally break down, the Board planned to mount asubstantial publicity campaign to explain their position and the merits of the offer they had made. But it was now unlikely that theunions would resort to industrial action before Easter.In discussion the following were the main points made (a) The Cabinet were not in a position to judge the Board&apos;shandling of the negotiations and could not dictate their tactics butthe fact that their offer had been raised to within  700,000 of the limitbefore the Chairman himself had intervened in the negotiations might have induced the unions to think that the Board had a gooddeal more in hand. If the relatively marginal further improvementthat the Board could still make failed to persuade the unions tosettle, and a breakdown followed, responsibility for the next movewould inevitably fall to the Government themselves, and it mightbe difficult to resolve the dispute without a further concession. Onthe other hand, there was no indication that the unions had been allowed to think that they could obtain any significant further improvement in the offer, and the fact that the threat of industrial action had so far been averted vindicated the Board&apos;s tactics. TheChairman&apos;s decision to reserve his own intervention until the finalstage might be fully justified if, by doing so, he proposed to make itclear to the unions that they must now make up their minds on thebasis of the offer already made to them.(b) While the facts of the Board&apos;s offer might have been made known to the railwaymen generally, through their union branches,they were not known to the general public and consideration mightbe given to publicising them. However it would probably be unwise to do this by means of a Ministerial speech since it would then appearthat the Government were seeking to intervene while negotiations were in progress and thereby courting a direct confrontation with theunions. The Board felt that even a public statement by themselvesin advance of a settlement or the breakdown of. negotiations would beregarded as provocative. Despite the fact that Ministers wouldnot wish a settlement to be at a higher level than 11 per cent, an agreed settlement remained their primary objective and it would beimpolitic to do anything which might jeopardise this.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thepoints made in the Cabinefs discussion could be considered furtherby the Ministerial Steering Committee on Pay Negotiations, which
should meet urgently to take stock of the position reached in the railwaymen&apos;s pay negotiations and to consider the next steps.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion, and invited the Home Secretary tomake arrangements accordingly for a meeting of the ministerial Steering Committee on Pay Negotiations.Cabinet Office,23 March, 1972.
