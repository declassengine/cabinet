secret parliamentary 1. The Cabinet considered the arrangements for the debate in affairs the House of Commons on Thursday, 20 January, on the opposition motion relating to the signature of the Treaty of Accession to theEuropean Communities. They approved the terms of the GovernmentAmendment to the Motion.2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the decision bythe Colliery Officials Staff Association (COSA) to join the miners&apos;strike, contrary to the advice of the National Union of Mineworkers(NUM), implied that miners would not now be receiving the taxrefunds due to them under the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) systemduring the strike. In consequence, the immediate supplementary benefit payments to miners&apos; families were likely to be correspondinglyincreased, although unmarried miners would not in general be ableto recoup the loss in this way. When an employer was unable toarrange the payment of PAYE refunds, the Board of Inland Revenuewere under some duty to make arrangements to discharge this liabilityby calling in the employees&apos; tax records and making the refundsdirect. In present circumstances, however, the Board could notassume this function without hiring premises for the establishment ofspecial offices in the mining areas and diverting some 400 staff, withthe probable result of jeopardising the fulfilment of the Governmenfsplan for the repayment of Post-War Credits in the current year.There appeared to be general public acceptance of the fact that the colliery clerks&apos; withdrawal of their labour would prevent the paymentof PAYE refunds in the normal way; and a decision that the Boardof Inland Revenue should open special offices would be liable both to revive public interest in the matter and to constitute an invitation to other unions engaged in industrial disputes to seek support fromthe staffs dealing with their members&apos; pay in the hope that by delayingPAYE refunds, they could increase their entitlement to social security benefits. He had therefore concluded that no special arrangements should be made by the Inland Revenue.The Secretary of State for Employment recalled that the NUMhad rejected his invitation to meet officials of the Department ofEmployment shortly before the strike began in order that he mightbe fully informed of the positions of both parties to the dispute.The reaction of the President of the Union to recent Press inquirieswhether he would be willing for the dispute to be referred to arbitration or to a court of inquiry indicated that the NUM wouldnot yet be ready to respond to any initiative which the government might take to institute conciliation. There had also been press reports, however, that the Trades Union&apos; Congress (TUC) were seeking to bring the parties together under TUC chairmanship. after discussion with the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, he saw no ground for seeking to deter the National Coal Board (NCB) fromaccepting such an invitation, if it were made.In discussion there was general agreement with the views expressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for Employment.

confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Ministerof Posts and Telecommunications (CP(72)1) about proposals by theIndependent Television Authority (ITA) for a second service of independent television, together with the question of ministerial control over the number of hours of broadcasting.The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications said that theITA had asked him to approve a second service of independent television for introduction in 1974. The Authority contended that two complementary services would offer a wider choice to theiraudiences; that the existing service did not fully employ the humanand material resources of the programme companies; and that itwas unfair that the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) shouldBroadcastingIndependentTelevision andControl overBroadcastingHoursto promote a settlement of the dispute should not be unsympathetic;but it would be inadvisable for the Government themselves to intervene at present. It was still too early to judge on what termsa settlement might ultimately be possible; and, while it might be doubted whether a resumption of work could be secured without some degree of concession to the miners, it would be very damaging to the Governments policy of achieving a progressive reduction inthe level of pay settlements if any such concession appeared to havebeen won too easily. The Government should therefore remain firmin their present posture that there was as yet no evident scope forinvoking the Department of Employments conciliation services.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Board of Inland Revenue should not openspecial offices or divert staff from other work in order to make PA YErefunds to the strikers. The Secretary of State for Social services should pursue with the Supplementary Benefits Commission thepossibility of making appropriate deductions from supplementary benefit claimed by striking miners or their families when the strikerreceived or benefited from allowances paid by the NUM in respectof his employment on picketing duties. In the Parliamentary debate on the strike that afternoon Ministers should seek to counter thepublic impression, which the NUM had sought to foster, that the pay of many miners was as little as  11 per week; and they should emphasise both the importance of maintaining the effort to haltinflation and the manner in which the strike could aggravate thecurrent problem of unemployment. While the Government shouldnot seek to discourage the NCB from attending any meeting arranged by the TUC to bring together the parties to the dispute under TUCchairmanship, the time was not yet opportune for the Secretary ofState for Employment to offer his Departments services of conciliation.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Ministers concerned tobe guided accordingly.
be allowed to present two programmes while Independent Television(ITV) could offer only one. The ITA proposal, however, was opposed by the national Press, who claimed that they would be seriously endangered by the resultant diversion of advertisingrevenue; by the advertising industry themselves; by many of theGovernment^ supporters, who favoured a competing, rather than acomplementary, second ITV service; and by the workers inindependent television. The proposal would also impede thedevelopment of the programme for extending the three existingtelevision services to less well served areas; and, by reducing theprofits of the independent television companies, it would generatepressure for reduction of the levy. The British public already enjoyedmore television than any other Western European country; and therewas at present no great public demand for a second ITV service.The Ministerial Committee on Broadcasting had accordingly agreedthat the ITA had not made out a case for immediate allocation of asecond ITV service and that it would be preferable to defer a decisionon the issue for the time being in order that there might be a thorough study of the various options open to the government before they had to take decisions on the future of radio and television broadcasting after 1976, when the BBC Charter and the TelevisionAct, 1964, would expire. It would be possible, however, to givesatisfaction to the ITA on their request that the present ministerial control over the hours of broadcasting should be removed. Therewas a strong argument of principle against this kind of detailedGovernment control. If the abolition of the control resulted inbreakfast-time television, there was admittedly a risk that thiswould damage the national Press. But it seemed unlikely that either the BBC or the ITA would in fact wish to introduce breakfast-timetelevision at this juncture; and they were, indeed, prepared to give assurances to this effect. Provided that such assurances could beobtained, the Ministerial Committee had agreed that, if the ITAwere not granted a second programme, the control of hours shouldbe removed. Subject to the agreement of the Cabinet, he proposedto make an early announcement that the Government had decided not to allocate frequency channels for the fourth television programme with a view to its starting before 1976 and that ministerial control would no longer be exercised over the number of hoursof broadcasting.In discussion it was suggested that the Cabinet should perhaps be more sensitive to the needs of the consumer, who might prefertelevision to newspapers. In any case the demand for a fourthtelevision programme would probably prevail eventually. On theother hand the effect in the United States of permitting radio and television broadcasting to exercise increasing competition with thePress was not reassuring. Moreover, it was not clear that in thiscountry there was yet a real consumer demand for a fourthprogramme. If it were to divert engineering resources from theextension of the three existing programmes to outlying areas, itwould be strongly criticised in Scotland and Wales; and its use for independent television would also be resented by the strong bodyof opinion which wished to see it used for transmissions in the welsh language.   If the Government were to authorise the introduction
of a second ITV service now, any failure of a major newspaper there-after would be attributed, rightly or wrongly, to this decision. Therewould need to be overriding reasons to justify a step which would cause serious alarm and resentment among the national Press; andin the absence of strongly expressed consumer demand for a fourthprogramme such overriding reasons did not seem to exist at present.On the other hand there seemed to be a good case for theremoval of Ministerial control over broadcasting hours; and it was questionable whether it was necessary to stipulate that the newfreedom should not be used to permit breakfast-time television.Extension of television to breakfast time might be regarded asdistasteful in some quarters; and it might have an adverse effect onthe advertising revenues of the Press, particularly since commercialradio would also be operating at breakfast-time. This, however,did not seem to be sufficient justification for refusing to meet any demand which there might be for breakfast-time television. there might be a risk that the BBC would seek an increase in the licence fee as a result; but it should be possible to resist this on the grounds that the Corporation were already using their two channels to transmit television programmes for considerably more hours perweek than the ITA could accommodate within their single channel and that they therefore did not need to increase their totaltransmission hours in order to compete with independent television.In further discussion it was noted that no decision had yet beentaken on the manner in which the review of the future of radio and television broadcasting after 1976 should be carried out. Therewere arguments against instituting another major inquiry, whichcould cause disturbance in the industry out of all proportion tothe likely value of its findings. It might be desirable, however, atan appropriate time to set in hand a study of the main criticisms of the present system and the options for its development, as a basis for the decisions which would need to be taken by the Governmentin due course.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Government should not approve at thepresent time the ITA proposal for a second independent television service, although this ban need not be associated with any specifictime limit. The Cabinet also agreed that Ministerial control of broadcasting hours should no longer be exercised, without necessarilylinking this relaxation with a ban on transmissions at breakfast-time.The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, in consultation withthe Lord President, should make an appropriate Parliamentaryannouncement on the following day. Further consideration shouldbe given in due course to the steps which would need to be takenin preparation for the review of the future of radio and television broadcasting after 1976.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Ministerof Posts and Telecommunications to proceed accordingly.
confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (CP(71)151), on publication of programme analysis and Review (PAR) material.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the Cabinet had earlieragreed that it would be undesirable to reveal publicly the fact thatany particular topic was being reviewed under the PAR system.This decision was in accordance with the normal principle that themethods by which Ministers were reviewing any particular subjectwere not disclosed. But PAR had originally been announced as aspecial type of analytical system; and, as the 1971 PAR reportsreached completion, it was appropriate to consider whether Ministers,when announcing a policy decision or publishing analytical material,should be free to say that the decision or material was based on aPAR report. If a decision in this sense were taken, it might provemore difficult to hold to the normal practice in other instances.On the other hand, it should be possible, in public presentation ofa particular decision, to reveal that the relevant programme had been reviewed by means of PAR before the decision was taken, without being obliged, at the same time or subsequently, to reveal what topicswere being or had been reviewed by PAR. It might be easier tomaintain the distinction if PAR was not represented as being aspecial and distinct process.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Governmenfs aim was to improve all the techniques for reviewingpolicy as a basis for better decisions; and it would be preferable that PAR should not be presented as having some special or uniquevalidity in this respect. On balance, therefore, the Cabinet agreedthat no indication should be given that any particular decision orpublished material was specifically attributable to a PAR report.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office,18 January, 1972.Publication ofProgrammeAnalysis andReviewMaterialPreviousReference ;CM(71) 19thConclusions,Minute 8
