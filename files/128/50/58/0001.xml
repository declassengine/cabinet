ImmigrationPolicyPreviousReference:CM (72) 56thConclusions,Minute 5CONFIDENTIALChanges in 2.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the SecretaryAssisted Areas 0f State for the Home Department (CP (72) 145), summarising theviews of the Ministerial Committee on Regional Policy and the environment on a proposal to upgrade the status of Edinburgh,Leith and Portobello from an intermediate area (IA) to a develop-ment area (DA), together with the implications of such a decisionfor other areas.The Home Secretary said that Edinburgh had a long standingclaim to be made a DA, which had been strenuously pressed since1970, when unemployment in the area sharply increased. In the review of regional policy in 1971 the area of Edinburgh, Leith andPortobello was made an IA; even so, it was an isolated pocket ofthis kind, being now the only part of Great Britain north of York-shire which was not a DA. In terms of unemployment, however,the case for upgrading Edinburgh was not conclusive: the rate of male unemployment, at 6 - 2 per cent in November, was substantially below the average for DAs (7-6 per cent). Moreover, if theEdinburgh IA were upgraded, several other areas would expectsimilar treatment. The Ministerial Committee had concluded thatthe strongest all-round claims were those of Cardiff and Newport,while Chesterfield, now a derelict land clearance area, would expect1. *The Prime Minister said that discussion at the cabinet&apos;s previous meeting had shown that many of his colleagues felt that therewere strong arguments against making an early Parliamentary state-ment, on the lines of the draft annexed to CP (72) 143, about the admission to this country of citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies living in other independent countries of the Common-wealth, holding no other citizenship and remaining eligible for theissue of United Kingdom passports. He has subsequently discussed the question further with the Ministers directly concerned and had come to the conclusion that the next step was to extend certaininter-Governmental contacts which had already been established.In the light of the outcome it would be necessary for the Cabinet to resume their earlier discussion in the near future. Meanwhile, itwas essential to maintain complete secrecy about the exchanges withother Governments.In discussion it was suggested that the problem of dealing witha further expulsion of United Kingdom passport holders would be greatly eased if some off-shore area could be found where they couldeither be settled or be lodged in reasonable conditions for long enough to make it possible to settle them elsewhere or to admit themto this country over a period of time under a voucher system. TheCabinet were informed that it had not yet been possible to find asuitable place of this kind; but the search would continue.
to be upgraded to IA. Male unemployment in Chesterfield, at 6- per cent, was marginally higher than in Edinburgh; and it suffered,in addition from being situated between two Intermediate Areas.Cardiff and Newport, although at present showing a lower rate of male unemployment (5-6 per cent), were facing substantialredundancies in steel as well as a rundown in coal in the neigh-bouring Development Area. There were several other areas whichhad strong claims in one or more respects; but the Committee hadtaken the view that to concede all these would be merely to dilutethe benefits of assistance under the Development Area scheme andto create fresh borderline cases. Moreover, although the exchequer cost of including Chesterfield in the IA was not likely to be significant, the cost over a full year of upgrading the Edinburgh iate DA was tentatively estimated at  6- 7 million and of upgradingthe Cardiff and Newport IA to DA at  11- 13 million. Over theperiod of the current public expenditure survey the total cost might amount to  50 million, which would be additional to the programme already agreed, since the Secretary of State for Trade and industry had confirmed that he could not find compensating savings within his own programmes.The Committee had considered three options to make nochange; to upgrade the Edinburgh IA alone; or to upgrade theEdinburgh, Cardiff and Newport IAs and make Chesterfield an IA.The majority considered that the choice lay between making nochange and upgrading all three areas. They had not been able todecide between these options; but they had agreed that, if changes were to be conceded, they should be made before 1 January, 1973,in view of the need to settle the pattern of our assisted areas beforebeginning negotiations within the European Economic Community(e.c.) to determine our &quot; central&quot; and &quot; peripheral&quot; areas forpurposes of the e.c. regional policy. They had also agreed that all further representations must be resisted for some time to come.In discussion it was argued that the Conservative Party in opposition had criticised the previous Administration^ refusal tomake Edinburgh a DA in 1966 and that the area&apos;s anomalousposition had been a cause of grievance ever since. The force of edinburgh^ claim to be given DA status had been recognised inthe last two reviews of regional policy but had been passed overbecause of the likely consequences for other areas. In recent months, however, it had been vigorously pressed again. Leith inparticular, was likely to suffer in competition with other east coast ports which were advantaged by DA benefits in relation too operations connected with the exploitation of North Sea oil. Thesituation at Cardiff and Newport had been transformed by the threatened loss of jobs in steel. The East Moors steel works was due to close by 1975, with a loss of 4,500 jobs; and Newport, which ought to be a source of work for men made redundant in EbbwVale, was itself faced with the loss of a further 1,500 jobs which themini-steelworks proposed for the area and the expansion of PortTalbot together would hardly redress. When these decisions were announced there would be insistent demands for the area to be givenDA status; and, unless the change was made forthwith, the need to
adjust our regional policy to the requirements of the e.c. as from1 January, 1973, might make it impracticable to satisfy these demands for at least a year. As regards Chesterfield, there was strong support in the region for its inclusion in the neighbouring IA;and assurances had been given that its claims would be carefully considered in the next review of assisted areas.On the other hand there were considerable dangers in disturbingthe present pattern of regional assistance in the absence of strong and established reasons, which none of the areas under review could at present display. To make unjustified changes would only provokefurther claims. Moreover, the reserve for contingencies in thecurrent period of the public expenditure survey was fully committed;and the additional  50 million for the proposals now in question could not be accommodated without compensating savings. Thedemands of public expenditure were already creating a formidableborrowing programme, reflected in the current rise in interest rates,which in turn added to the cost of industrial investment and somilitated against the interests of the assisted areas. Moreover, the government&apos;s supporters in Parliament would deprecate additions to public expenditure in the absence of the most pressing reasons;and they would particularly criticise any increased use of the regional Employment Premium. To respond to each new claim for regional assistance would merely dilute the effect of the Govern-menfs economic measures as a whole and would close other optionsin public expenditure, particularly in the social services, which were no less deserving. Selective assistance to the areas in question,particularly Leith, might be provided under the terms of the industry act 1972, without the need for changes in area status. So far asthe negotiations on regional policy within the e.c. were concerned,the arguable anomaly of the Edinburgh IA should not cause anyserious problem in settling the pattern of our peripheral areas; nor wasthe existing pattern of assisted areas likely to be frozen indefinitely,although it would clearly be desirable to avoid changes during thecourse of negotiation.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were concerned about the implications of the proposals for public expenditure and were not persuaded that there was animmediate need, either on merits or in the context of our forthcoming negotiations within the e.c., to make any of the changes in assisted areas which had been canvassed. Moreover, they would be invitedto consider at their next meeting the problems raised by the british steel Corporation^ development strategy, which would involve heavyjob losses and redundancies and would particularly affect some of theareas which they had been considering. Measures of regionalassistance would need to be reviewed in that context; and it wouldbe for consideration whether selective assistance under the industry act, coupled with the deployment of special task forces to providecomprehensive support for areas which suffered a particularly adverseimpact, would be preferable to more indiscriminate action of thekind suggested in CP (72) 145.
The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and agreed to take no immediate action on the proposals canvassed in CP (72) 145.CONFIDENTIALPay of Gas 3.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, when the manual Ministerial Committee on Counter-Inflationary Measures had dis-Workers cussed the pay negotiations for the gas manual workers they had had before them a letter from the Chairman of the Gas Council tothe Minister for Industry about the tactics to be adopted at theNational Joint Industrial Council (NJIC) meeting on 15 December.The Council wished to make an offer at that meeting and to seek toreach the best settlement they could. This would probably involvetheir making, in due course, an offer of an increase of  3 a week in basic rates, together with some concessions on shift pay and holidays.Despite pressure by the Minister for Industry on the Chairman toavoid entering into negotiations, his letter, which was couched inunusually peremptory terms, made it clear that he intended toproceed as he proposed, although it would be made plain to theunions that any settlement reached would be subject to the standstill.The letter relied on the fact that paragraph 18 of the White Paper&quot;A Programme for Controlling Inflation: The First Stage&quot;(Cmnd. 5125) conceded that pay negotiations would not be prohibitedduring the standstill; and the Committee had had to admit that, sincenegotiations, and indeed settlements, were being made in the private sector for implementation after the end of the standstill, the Govern-ment would be bound not only to be criticised by the unions butalso to lose public support if it became clear that workers in thepublic sector were being treated differently from those in the private sector. Moreover, there was force in the claim that industrial relations in the gas industry, a traditionally moderate industry,might be permanently damaged by a complete refusal to allow any negotiations to take place.On the other hand there were very powerful arguments against allowing the Gas Council to adopt the course which they envisaged.The effects could be far-reaching, and certainly would not be confined to the gas industry. The Secretary of State for social services had overcome equally severe difficulties in connection withthe pay negotiations for auxiliary workers in the National health service, maintaining the firm line that no exceptions to the standstillcould be made, that no interim assurances could be given and that negotiations would have to await the guidelines for the period afterthe standstill. The union leaders concerned had accepted this view,as had the dockers, who had also been hoping to negotiate a pay increase; and the Secretary of State&apos;s position would therefore be jeopardised if the Gas Council were now allowed to start nego-tiations. Moreover, if the CounciPs view prevailed, the waterindustry manual workers, whose settlements followed closely thoseof the gas workers, would expect to be allowed to start negotiations;
and the coalminers, the railwaymen and other groups would adoptthe same attitude.The Committee had also agreed that an offer of about  3 a week would be very damaging to the Governmenfs counter-inflationarypolicy, since it would establish a precedent for future pay increases which would be embarrassing in relation to the second stage of that policy. There were already signs that a number of unions would seek to negotiate settlements at excessively high levels before theGovernment were ready to introduce the second stage; and therewere also indications that the attitude of the Gas Council wassymptomatic of a general disposition among the major nationalised industries. The alternatives, therefore, were either to accept thatthe Council should be allowed to negotiate as they wished, on theunderstanding that any settlement would be subject to the policy inoperation at the end of the standstill; or to take whatever steps were appropriate to prevent the Council from making an offer,recognising that there was no power to take similar action withregard to private sector negotiations. A letter to the Chairman ofthe Council, which might if necessary be published, asking them notto make any offer, might not suffice to persuade the Council tomodify their attitude; and the Law Officers had therefore been invited to advise whether it would be possible to issue a directionfor this purpose.In discussion there was agreement that there would be noobjection to the Gas CounciFs holding further discussions of ageneral nature at the NJIC meeting on 15 December. It would be inexpedient, however, to allow the Council at the present time tomake an offer on pay, which was not in any case due to be implemented until 16 January, since the level of increase which theyhad in mind would be likely to prejudice the Governmenfs policy for the period after the standstill, while the Council would regard as provocative an offer sufficiently modest to be consistent with that policy. Any offer made by the Council would be bound to beregarded by the public and the unions as having the approval ofthe Government, who were generally held to be in effect the employer in the public sector. To permit an offer at the level proposed would,therefore, be taken as an indication of the attitude which the Govern-ment were likely to adopt for the second stage of the counter-inflationary policy. In these circumstances it would not be sufficientmerely to ask the Council not to enter into negotiations, even if atthe same time the Government attempted to dissociate themselves from the discussions. The alternatives were either to give the council a direction not to make an offer at the presenftime or to send thema letter which, while not having the same legal force as a direction,would nevertheless convey in forthright terms the Governmenfsexpectation that the Council would comply with their wishes. Since,however, the Council had undertaken at the previous NJIC meeting that they would enter into positive negotiations on 15 December andtherefore felt under an obligation which they would not wish toretract if they were not to damage industrial relations in the industry,the Chairman had made it clear that even a letter in strong terms would be insufficient to deter them from pursuing their preferred
course. It would therefore be wiser to issue at the outset a directionwhich the Chairman had indicated that he would welcome since itwould transfer the responsibility for failure to negotiate from theCouncil to the Government.On the other hand the importance of retaining the presentsupport for the Governmenfs counter-inflationary policies suggestedthat it would be imprudent to alienate public opinion by seeking to prohibit negotiations which the Government had already indicatedcould take place and, in particular, by appearing to discriminate against workers in the public sector. A direction to the Gas council might well be regarded as victimisation of the gas manual workers,which would be likely to increase the risk of a confrontation with theunions; and it would also be liable to be interpreted as a furtherinfringement by the Government of the commercial freedom of judgment of the nationalised industries. It would in any event benecessary to be satisfied that any direction was both in the national interest and of a general character and that, if it were challenged inthe Courts, the Government would be able to demonstrate that ithad not been made with a specific case in mind. The most likelyway of achieving this would be to give similar directions to all the nationalised industries where the power to do so existed; but,although this might have a salutary effect in some cases, it could reactadversely in, for example, the electricity industry, where other pay negotiations which were not regarded as damaging to the counter-inflationary policy were under way. It would not in any event bepossible to give a direction in the case of the negotiations in the waterindustry, where no comparable powers existed. If it were decidedthat a direction or directions should be given, it would be helpfulfor these to indicate that the prohibition on negotiations would endwhen the guidelines for the period after the standstill were announced. It was difficult to believe, however, that the Chairmanof the Gas Council would not respond to a further approach fromthe Government, making clear the importance of the issues at stakeand the consequences if the Council proceeded with their present intention; and it would be wise to make an approach of this kindbefore giving further consideration to the feasibility of a statutorydirection.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were concerned about the danger that pay negotiations inthe gas industry would create a precedent for other negotiationsduring the standstill, which would prejudice the Governmenfsfreedom to determine the level of pay increases during the subsequent period and would &quot;therefore undermine the counter-inflationary policy in advance. The Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the Secretary of Statefor Employment and the Minister for Industry should, as a matterof urgency, meet the Chairman of the Gas Council and, ifnecessary, the other members of the Council, in order to impress on them the gravity of the issues at stake and to seek to persuade themthat they should not make an offer of improvements in pay or other conditions of service before the guidelines for the policy after the standstill were announced. It might also be desirable to make similar
representations to the unions concerned. The Cabinet would wishto hear a report on the outcome at their meeting on 14 December;and in the meantime the Ministers responsible for the nationalised industries, in consultation with the Attorney General, should give further consideration to the advisability of using the powers of direction, in respect both of the Gas Council alone and of all the nationalised industries where such powers existed. The importanceof the Governmenfs being prepared for the possibility of industrial action in support of this and other pay claims was such that, in futurecases in which pay negotiations where there was a danger of suchaction were to be considered by Ministers, the Lord Privy Seal should circulate an assessment of the likelihood of industrial action, its possible consequences and the state of the relevant contingency planning.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary ofState for Trade and Industry, the Secretary of State for employment and the Minister for Industry to seek to persuade the Gas Council not to make any offer of increased pay before the announcement of the guidelinesfor the policy after the standstill.(3) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to circulate a memorandum onthe state of contingency planning in all future cases of pay negotiations involving a danger of industrial action.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment, Scotlandand Trade and Industry, and the Minister of Posts and telecommunications to consider further, in consultationwith the Attorney General, the advisability of issuing a direction to the nationalised industries deferring pay negotiations.EuropeanCommunitiesParliamentaryScrutinyof DraftInstrumentsPreviousReference:CM (72) 36thConclusions,Minute 6SECRET4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (CP (72) 140) about the arrangements for parliamentary scrutiny of draft instruments of the european community.The Lord President of the Council said that it was in theinterests of the Governmenfs relations with Parliament that theyshould, as a matter of principle, keep Parliament as fully informed as possible about the development of proposals for Communitylegislation before decisions were taken by the Council of Ministers.It was uncertain whether the Parliamentary Labour Party would agreeat their meeting on the following day to the establishment of theproposed ad hoc Select Committee to consider the most suitablemethod of ensuring adequate Parliamentary scrutiny of draftinstruments of the European Communities.   If, however, they did
not agree, the Government should announce that they wouldunilaterally propose to Parliament, in any event as a temporary measure and possibly as the longer-term solution, a StandingCommittee to debate draft Community instruments after a pre-liminary appraisal by a &quot; sifting&quot; Select Committee. If theParliamentary Labour Party agreed to co-operate in the ad hoc committee it might be desirable to propose the Standing Committeeand &quot; sifting &quot; Committee as interim arrangements during the period before the ad hoc Committee made its recommendations. Therewas no reason why the &quot; sifting &quot; Select Committee should not be ajoint Committee of both Houses; but there was no precedent for aJoint Standing Committee. It would therefore be necessary to explore whether such a Committee would be acceptable to the Houseof Commons. Otherwise, separate arrangements would have to bemade in each House.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet approved the proposals in CP (72) 140, despite the factthat the &quot; sifting &quot; Committee, which would necessarily be investedwith the full powers of a Select Committee, might prove to be veryexacting in its demands on the Government. A Joint StandingCommittee of both Houses would not be practicable without theOpposition^ agreement. If the proposed ad hoc Select Committeewere agreed by the Parliamentary Labour Party, the opposition should in the first instance be informed of the proposal to introducetemporary arrangements during the period before the ad hoc committee had made its recommendations. If the Opposition didnot agree that the ad hoc Committee itself should be a Committeeof both Houses, it would be necessary for each House to proceedseparately with the consideration of the appropriate arrangements.It would be preferable, in any event, not to make any announcementof the Governmenfs proposal until after the debate on ProcedureMotions had taken place on the following Monday.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Lord President of theCouncil and the Lord Privy Seal to proceed accordingly.Designationof british members ofthe EuropeanParliamentSECRET5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council about the designation of British membersof the European Parliament (CP (72) 139).The Lord President of the Council said that the Treaty of accession to the European Communities gave the United Kingdoman entitlement to 36 seats in the European Parliament. Article 138.1of the Treaty of Rome provided that the Parliament should consistof delegates who were to be designated by the respective nationalParliaments from among their members in accordance with theprocedure laid down by each member State.   If the Opposition
agreed to send delegates, the distribution of places, on a basis of party membership in the House of Commons, would be 18Conservative, 17 Labour and 1 Liberal. The Conservative delegation should preferably be composed of 12 Members of the House ofCommons and 6 Peers. The Parliamentary Labour Party, however,would probably decide at their meeting on the following day not tosend Opposition delegates; and the Government would need todecide whether or not these places should be filled. From the pointof view of our position in Europe it might be preferable not to leavethese places totally unfilled; and the Government could designateeither Labour Members and Peers who were willing to acceptnomination or additional Conservatives, Liberals and CrossbenchPeers. On the other hand, it would be invidious to intervene in theLabour Party&apos;s internal affairs; and visible empty places might encourage the Labour Party to adopt a co-operative attitude towardsEurope rather earlier than they might otherwise have done. on balance, therefore, it might be wiser for the Government not to seek to fill these places. The Liberal Party, however, had asked for 3places; and in view of their consistently co-operative attitude towards our accession to the Communities, it might be desirable to grant them2 places, on the understanding that the extra place might have to beforgone as soon as the Labour Party agreed to send delegates. Inaddition, a suitable Crossbench Peer might appropriately be designated to fill one of the empty places on the same basis. It was desirable that the designation of the British members should beeffected by a Resolution of each House of Parliament. TheResolutions would be debatable and would have to be adopted beforethe Christmas Recess.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet approved the proposals in CP (72) 139. There was probably no legal obligation to designate the full number of dele-gates; and consultations with senior officials of the Bureau of theEuropean Parliament, the Secretariat of the Council of ministers and the European Commission had confirmed that no action was likely to be taken by any of these institutions if we did not designatethe full number at the outset. The proposed Resolutions should betabled in each House as soon as practicable after the parliamentary labour Party had announced their decision. Amendments to theResolutions could be tabled by backbenchers; and in the circum-stances it would not be practicable for the Government to oppose the designation of additional members by way of such amendments,provided that the requisite number from each House was notexceeded. yThe Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Lord President of theCouncil and the Lord Privy Seal to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office,12 December, 1972.
