The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theCabinet would have seen reports of the anti-British remarks made bythe Prime Minister of Libya, Colonel Qadhafi, in a recent speech,including the allegation that Libya was supporting and supplyingarms to the Irish Republican Army. There was no evidence to con-firm this statement; and it was clear that Colonel Qadhafi was becoming increasingly unbalanced. Nevertheless, a formal protesthad been made to the Libyan Ambassador by the Minister of Statefor Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Mr. Godber; and arrange-ments previously made for the sale of a number of automatic weaponsto Libya had been suspended lest they should find their way toIreland. It would be unwise, by taking stronger measures, to put at risk the considerable volume of other business which we were nowdoing with the Libyan Government.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theGovernment of Iceland had announced that they intended, with effect from 1 September, 1972, to extend their fishing rights to the whole area of sea within 50 miles of their coasts. This would be a unilateralact which would be in breach of the agreement with us and in anticipation of the projected international conference on the Law ofthe Sea. They had indicated that they were prepared to make an interim agreement with us governing fishing in the period until theinternational conference had laid down revised general rules; butthe proposals which they had submitted were unacceptable. Never-theless, it would be very desirable, from our point of view, that some form of interim arrangement should be reached. The icelandic government included certain Communist Ministers who were committed to working for the removal of the United States basewhich was of prime importance to the Alantic Alliance. It was relevant, therefore, that a surrender on the point of fishing rights144614--14b*1. The Prime Minister expressed the Cabinefs congratulations to the Leader of the House and the Chief Whip on their success in ensuring a Government majority in the critical division on Clause 2of the European Communities Bill in the House of Commons on theprevious evening.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet agreed that an amendment tabled by the Oppositionto the Government Motion on Rhodesia which was to be considered on 21 June in the House of Lords was unacceptable, particularly inview of its reference to the need to make sanctions more effective, andthat it should therefore be rejected.
would increase the authority of the Communist Minister of Fisheries.Moreover, there was a real risk that, in the absence of an interimagreement, Iceland would take hostile action against our trawlers.It would be far more difficult, given the greater sea area involved,to provide naval protection than at the time of our earlier dispute;and, even in the unlikely event of our being able to provide as many as eight frigates for protection duties, there could be no certainty thatthe size of catches would be more than about 40 per cent of theirpresent level. We had submitted our case to the International Courtof Justice. But the outcome could not be foreseen; and it was by nomeans certain that the Court would be prepared to prescribe interim arrangements which we should find acceptable. We had thereforeembarked on direct discussions with the Icelandic Government; andtheir representatives were expected to visit London again in thefollowing week. At an earlier meeting they had rejected an offer toreduce the British catch by 10 per cent of the recent average; and itwas proposed now to urge them to accept, instead, a reduction of effort in the form of a restriction on the number of trawlers operating in the area.The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that he fully accepted the arguments in favour of trying to reach an interimagreement with Iceland. Nevertheless, it would be politically difficultto make any more substantial concessions at this stage. The fishing industry had so far been co-operative and had been prepared toaccept an imposed reduction of 10 per cent in their catch. But it wasnot certain whether they could accept a further 10 per cent reduction,since this would cause serious problems for them. It would be partic-particularly important to resist any Icelandic pressure for discriminatoryarrangements which would exclude our ships from areas in which their own ships were free to fish. To accept such arrangements would constitute a breach of principle which would have far-reachingresults.In discussion it was recognised that each time an extension of rights was accepted in one part of the world it was followed by claims in others. The law of the sea Was currently very confused; and it was hoped that the forthcoming conference on this subject would dealwith the sea bed as well as with matters such as territorial waters and fishing rights. Our own strong interest in preserving the freedomof the seas would best be served by adhering firmly to the principlethat no unilateral changes should be recognised before the inter-national conference had met. We should expect the Governmentof Iceland, no less than other Governments, to accept and to conform to the decisions of the conference. If our dispute with Iceland, afellow member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, threatened to lead to actual hostilities, Iceland might well leave the alliance and so create a strategic gap which it would be very difficult to fill.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that it was important to make an interim agreementwith the Government of Iceland. It would be appropriate to go to considerable lengths in an attempt to find an acceptable basis for
such an agreement; but it would be necessary to take account bothof the need not to compromise fundamental principles relating to thefreedom of the sea and of the damage to the fishing industry whichwould be caused by acceptance of too rigorous Icelandic restrictions.The Cabinet (2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion. .......The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that theFrench Government seemed to be upholding the interests of theWestern companies in their contacts with the Government of Iraqfollowing the nationalisation of the Iraq Petroleum Company. Itwas not yet possible to forecast the outcome of these contacts.The Cabinet (3) Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for trade and Industry.secret. The Home Secretary said that the Government might face a potential serious situation if the three dockers who were picketinga container terminal in East London implemented their threat to defya ruling, given on the previous day by the Industrial Relations Court,that, if they did not refrain from further picketing, warrants wouldbe signed for their arrest. The men had been granted until 2 p.m.on the following day in which to appeal to the Court of Appeal;but, if they persisted in their intransigence, industrial action in the docks might develop rapidly and on a wide scale. It might bedesirable that preliminary preparations for dealing with an emergencyof this kind should be put in hand forthwith. In discussion there was general agreement with this view. It was essential that the rule oflaw should be upheld; but it was important that, with due regardto the fact that the case would be sub judice until the following afternoon, it should be made clear to public opinion that the matter in dispute was essentially between two groups of workers who were members of the same union, the Transport and General WorkersUnion, and that it did not in itself involve either the government or the employers.secret. The Cabinet considered, in the light of the present situationin Northern Ireland, other proposals made by the Secretary of Statefor Northern Ireland in his memoranda CP (72) 59 and 60. their discussion and the conclusions reached were separately recorded and issued only to The Queen, the Prime Minister and those ministers who had to take action.The conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file heldby the Secretary of the Cabinet.
PakistanandBangladeshPreviousReference :CM (72) 5thConclusions,Minute 2CONFIDENTIAL5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the secretaries of State for the Home Department and for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs (CP (72) 58) on the status of citizens of pakistan and people belonging to Bangladesh.The Home Secretary said that the Commonwealth citizenship of Pakistani citizens was currently governed by the British nationality act, 1948. Those individuals who belonged to Bangladesh (whichwas now a member of the Commonwealth but had as yet no domesticnationality law) were Commonwealth citizens only by virtue of their previous Pakistani citizenship; and, since legislation in Pakistanwould no doubt be enacted sooner or later to deprive them of thatcitizenship, they would lose their Commonwealth citizenship also.In order to protect them against this risk it was desirable now toprepare a short Bill to confer Commonwealth citizenship on indi-viduals belonging to Bangladesh. In the longer term it would benecessary also to prepare legislation to take account of the decisionof Pakistan, assuming that it proved definitive, to leave theCommonwealth. This would be a very complex measure; and itspreparation might be left to the following Parliamentary Session.In discussion there was general agreement that the presentation of a Bill to deal with the consequences of the withdrawal of Pakistanfrom the Commonwealth should not be hurried. It would be difficultto accommodate such a Bill in the present Session in view of theheavy programme of work to which Parliament was already commit-ted; and over-hasty action to deprive Pakistani citizens of privilegeswhich they had hitherto enjoyed as Commonwealth citizens wouldbe unpopular in many quarters and would be liable to provoke anunwelcome revival of public discussion of immigration policy.Although Pakistani recognition of Bangladesh would probably havethe effect of withdrawing Pakistani citizenship from those whobelonged to Bangladesh, there were currently no indications thatthe Government of Pakistan intended to introduce legislation for thispurpose at an early date.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that legislation should now be prepared for introduc-tion if the Government of Pakistan withdrew Pakistani citizenshipfrom indivduals who belonged to Bangladesh but that, unlessdevelopments made earlier action essential, this Bill should not be presented to Parliament in the current Session. The Cabinet also agreed that legislation to deal with the consequences of Pakistaniwithdrawal from the Commonwealth would not be required duringthe current Session.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the preparationof legislation accordingly.Cabinet Office15 June, 1972.
