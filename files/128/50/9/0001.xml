The Secretary of State for employment had called both parties to the dispute to his department at 10 a.m.; and they had remained there, together with Mr. Feather,the General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), andMr. Campbell Adamson, the Director General of the confederation of British Industry (CBI), throughout the day.The Secretary of State for Employment said that, after studying the report, the Executive of the National Union of Mineworkers(NUM) had informed him that they wished to negotiate further with the National Coal Board (NCB) on certain peripheral issues,including the age at which the adult rate should be payable and the pay increase for colliery clerks, which needed to be clarified beforethe Executive could consider consulting the union&apos;s membershipabout the reports recommendations. As a result the NCB had undertaken to consider the union&apos;s requests sympathetically. Atthis stage the President of the union, Mr. Gormley, had indicated that the prospects of a settlement were good and that he would recommend his Executive to call for an end to picketing that night and to consult their members by ballot about acceptance of theCourts recommendations. At the ensuing meeting of the fullExecutive, however, it appeared that the militant members hadprevailed; and the Executive had voted by 14 to 11 to reject theCourts recommendations and to insist that their original claim should be met in full. Mr. Gormley had then let it be known thatthis decision might be reversed if the increases recommended by theWilberforce report for surface workers and underground workers who were not employed at the coal face were further raised by  1in each case. A full meeting of the National Coal Board had considered this proposal and had unanimously concluded that,although they remained willing to negotiate within the generalframework of the Wilberforce recommendations, they could neitheroffer any improvement in the main cash increases which it envisagednor reduce the 16 month period for which they were to apply. Inthe Board&apos;s view, the Wilberforce recommendations represented afair and impartial assessment of the pay increases which werejustified in the special case of the miners; and it would be indefensibleto make further concessions.Mr. Feather had advised the NUM Executive that the rest of thetrade union movement would not regard their attitude as reasonable.He himself had then urged the Executive at least to agree to submit the Courts recommendations to their membership by ballot, even* Previously circulated 4  a Confidential Annex.SECRET
if they felt unable to commend them. But they had refused to doso. They had, however, readily accepted his suggestion that theyshould discuss the issue with the Prime Minister, if he was preparedto receive them.The Prime Minister said that he would certainly be willing tomeet the Executive. But he wished first to ensure that the cabinet were in agreement about the attitude which he should adopt. his first objective should presumably be to influence a sufficient numberof the Executive so to modify their views as to make it possible topromote a ballot on the Courfs findings. But the tactics of themeeting would need to take account also of the views of Mr. Feather,Mr. Adamson and the representatives of the NCB, who wouldaccompany the NUM Executive to No. 10.In discussion it was suggested that it would be necessary to seek to persuade the Executive that, if they maintained theirintransigent attitude, they would be in imminent danger of losingboth public sympathy and the support which they currently enjoyedfrom other trade unions. This should become apparent to them as their obduracy attracted increasingly hostile comment; and theyshould therefore be prevented, so far as possible, from taking a finaldecision until they had been subjected to the full force of publicopinion. If they were allowed to disperse that night, they couldnot easily be reassembled at short notice and the more militantand vocal members would be at liberty to foment further resistance in the coalfields. .It might prove impracticable, however,, to keep the executive in play in this manner; and the Cabinet should accordingly considerthe position which the Prime Minister should be recommended toadopt if he was unable to persuade them to modify their attitudeat least to the extent of agreeing to put the recommendations of theWilberforce report to a ballot of their members. To indicate thatthe Government might apply to the National Industrial RelationsCourt for a ballot order under the provisions of the industrial relations Act would be liable further to alienate the moderatemembers and would therefore be unwise at this stage. If theExecutive remained adamant, therefore, a choice might have to bemade between indicating that the Government were prepared to contemplate the negotiation of concessions going beyond therecommendations of the Wilberforce report or standing firm on those recommendations themselves. The implications of the latter coursecould ultimately be very severe indeed. For example, even if the full weight of public opinion were mobilised against them, the minersmight remain intransigent; and, although Servicemen and volunteerscould in that event be used to gain access to such stocks of coal asexisted, this respite would be exhausted in a few weeks. Nor would the import of coal substantially alleviate this position. But, if work had not been resumed at the coal face within a short time, theGovernment might find themselves unable to sustain the life ofthe community unless they surrendered to the miners; and publicopinion would then censure them even more severely than if they wereto treat with the miners now. On the other hand, it was inconceivablethat, on the very day when the Court of Inquiry had reported, the
Government should acquiesce in concessions going substantiallybeyond the Courfs recommendations. To do so would present themilitant leadership of the miners with so clear a victory that nodemocratically constituted Government could hope to sustain their authority for long without seeking a fresh mandate from a GeneralElection. To fight and to lose would be bad enough; not to fightat all would be even worse. Every effort should therefore be madeto anticipate so drastic a dilemma; but, if matters reached this point,the Cabinet as a whole would wish to be consulted again before any final decision had to be made.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that he should receive both parties to the dispute that night. He would first discuss the situation with Mr. Adamson andMr. Feather, as the representatives of the two sides of industry.Thereafter he would represent to the members of the Executive ofthe NUM that it was in the national interest that they should atonce arrange for pickets to be withdrawn and should conduct a ballot of their members on the basis of a recommendation that theproposals made by the Wilberforce Inquiry should be accepted. Itwas not possible to foresee how the matter would then develop; but,in case immediate decisions were needed, Ministers should remainin readiness for a further meeting.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office,21 February, 1972.
