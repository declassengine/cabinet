The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.*The Lord President of the Council said that, in consultationwith the Chief Whip and after discussion with the Leader of theLiberal Party, he had come to the conclusion that it would not bepossible to avoid tabling a Timetable Motion in respect of theremainder of the Committee Stage of the European CommunitiesBill. The Opposition had rejected generous suggestions about theamount of time which should be allowed for this purpose; and it was now beyond doubt that progress with the Bill would continue to bedeliberately impeded, with the result that, if a Timetable Motionwere much longer deferred, it would not be possible to provide adequate time in which to discuss all the parts of the Bill whichwould still remain. It was for consideration, however, whetherthe Motion should be tabled at the beginning of the following week or deferred for another week thereafter. The former course wouldmake it easier for the Government to ensure a realistic allocation oftime to each of the main parts of the Bill; and for this reason it was likely to obtain the support of the Liberal Party, which would be important in securing the passage of the Motion. Those membersof the Opposition who were in favour of British accession to the communities might prefer a further week&apos;s deferment of a TimetableMotion. But it was unlikely that their difference with their colleagues would be as marked on an issue of parliamentary procedure as on the substance of British accession; and they couldnot therefore be relied on to abstain in the vote on the proposedMotion.In discussion there was general agreement that a TimetableMotion would be necessary if unacceptable disruption of other essential Parliamentary business was to be averted. On balance,there might be advantage in deferring the announcement of the timetable Motion until at least two further days had been devotedto the Committee Stage in the normal manner. This period shouldbe used to make it clear, both in Parliament and among informedpublic opinion, that the dilatory and obstructive tactics of theOpposition had made the Motion unavoidable and, indeed, desirable in order to ensure that reasonable time was available to consider eachof the remaining parts of the Bill. It might be desirable to allocatethree days to the Bill in the forthcoming week and to sit on at least oneof these occasions for the maximum practicable time. On the otherhand, there was pressure for other business to be taken in thefollowing week; and to provide two more days should be adequate to achieve the desired purpose. /The Prime,Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, in view of the failure of the Opposition to acceptthe generous suggestions put to them for the allocation of time to theEuropean Communities Bill, a Timetable Motion should be tabled.This step should not be taken, however, until two further days had* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
been devoted to a further effort to make reasonable progress with theBill in the normal manner. In the meantime all practicable steps should be taken to ensure that the necessity for the Motion was widely understood.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Lord President of theCouncil and the other Ministers concerned to be guided accordingly.secret oversea 2.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the landAffairs election in the State of Baden-Wurttemberg to be held during the germany coming weekend could have a critical impact on the ability of theGovernment of the Federal Republic of Germany to secure rati-fication of the Eastern Treaties. The indications were that theelection would be very close run; and the leaders of the Parties in opposition to Herr Brandfs Coalition Government had expressed their confidence of success. A serious defeat for the GovernmentParties would result in a weakening of their position in the FederalUpper House and could lead to the fall of the Government. Itwould in any event become more difficult for them to pursue theirOstpolitik; and this in turn could well give rise to a sharp reaction from the Soviet Union.VietnamPreviousReference:CM (72) 20thConclusions,Minute 2St. VincentPreviousReference:CM (72) 20thConclusions,Minute 2SeychellesThe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there was little change in the military situation in Vietnam, on which he had reported to the Cabinet in the previous week.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the situationin St. Vincent had now returned to normal following the despatch ofa frigate to the Caribbean.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the situationin the Seychelles had recently given cause for anxiety as a consequenceof strike action by the local trade unions. At the Governorsrequest a frigate had been sent to stand by at a few hours&apos; notice. Butthe situation appeared to have improved; and it was unlikely thatany intervention by British forces would now be required.The Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.
northern ireland previous reference:CM (72) 20thConclusions,Minute 3ShipbuildingIndustryCammellLaird Ltd.previous reference:CM (72) 10thConclusions,Minute 2CONFIDENTIAL4. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that themanagement of Cammell Laird Ltd. had proposed in January thatthe Government should provide funds of about  13 million to thecompany and that orders should also be placed for two additionaldestroyers costing about  40 million. The Ministerial Committee onEconomic Policy had agreed that it would be desirable to avoidclosure of the yard, which employed about 5,500 people. In sub-sequent discussion, however, the Ministry of Defence had indicated that they did not wish to see Cammell Laird retained as a navalshipyard and that they did not wish to place orders for the two additional destroyers. On being informed that they should not regard themselves as having a long-term future as a naval yard, themanagement had put forward revised proposals for a more rapidconversion to merchant shipbuilding, at a total cost of  25 million,of which  3 million would consist of the existing standby facility and 5 million would come from the new shipbuilding production grants.These revised proposals had been accepted by the Committee.Sound management was essential to the company&apos;s future; andhe had full confidence in the recently appointed Chairman, Sir DavidBarritt, and Managing Director, Mr. Day. They were coming underincreasing pressure from the trades unions, however, to show that theywere able to obtain from the Government the financial assistancenecessary to maintain the yard as a viable enterprise. There would bea further meeting between the management and the trades unions onthe following Monday. If the management did not receive assurances about assistance for the yard before that meeting, they wouldprobably resign and it would not then be possible to replace themwith individuals of the necessary calibre. He had considered whether there was any other way in which the company could bemaintained until the Government were ready to announce theirpolicy for the shipbuilding industry as a whole. But the ordering ofnaval ships alone, without any public announcement of assistance towards the conversion of the yard, did hot seem now to be sufficient,since the management had already been informed that their futuredid not lie in naval shipbuilding. Although Government supporters would be dismayed by the announcement of further measures ofad hoc financial assistance to a company in the private sector, theproposals put forward by the management appeared to be inevitable.If so, an announcement should be made to Parliament without delay in the terms of the draft which he had already circulated to thePrime Minister and other members of the Cabinet.3. The Cabinet considered the situation in Northern Ireland.Their discussion and the conclusions reached were separately recorded and issued only to The Queen, the Prime Minister and those ministers who had to take action.The conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file heldby the Secretary of the Cabinet.
The Secretary of State for Defence said that the government&apos;s supporters had already been very disconcerted by the assistance given to Upper Clyde Shipbuilders Ltd. and would be still furtherdisturbed by the announcement of Exchequer support for anothershipbuilding company. The fact that the Cammell Laird yard wasnot seen as a naval shipyard in the long term need not preclude its use in this capacity from time to time if this were judged desirable in the circumstances. An order for two additional destroyers didnot have sufficient priority in defence terms to justify an allocation of funds from the defence budget. But, if it were judged desirable inprinciple to afford financial assistance to the company, it would bemore acceptable to the Governmenfs supporters if this took the formof an order for naval ships, which would at least ensure that theGovernment would acquire a tangible asset in return for their outlay.In discussion it was suggested that in view of its geographicaladvantages the Cammell Laird yard was likely to find a place in any new shipbuilding policy and that, given good management, it shouldbe viable in the long term. If public expenditure was to be kept under control, however, the expenditure of an additional  40 million on naval ships would require compensating savings; and it was questionable whether it was right to reduce other public expenditure programmes if the ships did not enjoy sufficient priority to justifysome contribution from the defence budget. Moreover, it seemeddoubtful whether the Cammell Laird management would accept thenaval orders as an adequate interim solution when they had been told that the yard did not have a future as a naval shipyard. Theordering of the two ships would only postpone the need for substantial assistance towards the modernisation of the yard and its conversionto merchant shipbuilding; and some early financial support would benecessary in any event in order to meet losses on orders already accepted. In view of the risk of industrial action by the trades union, it was not practicable to defer an announcement until theGovernment were ready to announce a new policy on shipbuilding,which could take some months; and it would in any case be very undesirable to defer an announcement to a point when it would seemto be extracted from the Government by the threat of industrial action. If the present proposals of the management were acceptednow, the announcement need not make explicit at this stage the likelihood that this would give the Government a controlling interestin the company.On the other hand the Governmenfs supporters would find it extremely difficult to accept the case for giving ad hoc assistance toanother shipyard after Upper Clyde Shipbuilders Ltd. It could notyet be assumed that the new management would be successful in ensuring the company&apos;s viability; and, if Exchequer assistance of 25 million was provided and announced, it would not be possible inpractice to disguise the fact that the ultimate effect would be to give theGovernment a controlling interest in the company. The placing of orders for two naval ships might at least enable the company to remain in operation for a further period; and any subsequentfinancial contribution towards the conversion and modernisation ofthe yard could then be placed in the context of a more general policy
for the future of British shipbuilding. For these reasons it might bedesirable to make a further effort to persuade the management thatthis would be a preferable course before they met the trades unions on the following Monday.In further discussion it was pointed out that an announcement would be needed in the near future of substantial financial assistance for Harland and Wolff Ltd. in Belfast. This, however, was a commitment inherited from the Northern Ireland Government; and,because of the special importance of the company to the NorthernIreland economy, it should be more acceptable to the government&apos;s supporters than the proposed assistance to Cammell Laird Ltd.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that steps should be taken to avoid the closure ofCammell Laird Ltd. but that further consideration was necessary before a decision could be taken on the method to be adopted.Acceptance of the revised proposals put forward by the company would cause considerable concern among the Governments sup-porters; and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry should therefore arrange for representatives of the company to come toLondon for further urgent discussions in order to explore possible alternative courses of action. He would arrange for these to be examined further by the Ministers directly concerned.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.SECRETIndustrial 5.   The Secretary of State for Employment said that, in the affairs absence of a satisfactory response from the Trades Union CongressRailwaymen&apos;s (TUC) or from the rail unions to his requests of 17th April, applicationPay had been made to the Industrial Court on the previous afternoon for negotiations    a &quot; cooling-off &quot; Order.   Later that evening the Court had granted anPrevious        Order which provided for a &quot; cooling-off&quot; period of 14 days, to runReference:      from the moment when normal railway service was restored, coupledCM (72) 21st  with a requirement that the unions were forthwith to procure the with-Conclusions     drawal of any instructions for industrial action and to take all such other steps as were reasonably necessary to secure the discontinuance of industrial action while the Order remained in force.   The Courthad emphasised that the Order applied to all officers, servants andagents of the unions and that, if any local officer ignored theinstructions of his union leaders to comply with it, the unions shoulddeprive him of his authority.   The Court had also indicated that thepurpose of the &quot;cooling-off&quot; period was to enable further negotiations to take place against the background of normal railway working.This decision should put great pressure on the unions to stoptheir members&apos; industrial action. Until normal working was resumedthe British Railways Board (BRB) need not resume negotiations; andthe Court had placed the primary responsibility upon him, as Secretaryof State for Employment, to certify the point at which normal working
had been resumed. It was not yet clear whether the rail unions would comply with the Courts Order. If they had not done so bymidnight, it might well be necessary to make a further applicationto the Court on the following day. In the meanwhile Mr. Feather,the General Secretary of the TUC, was apparently trying to promotefurther discussions with the BRB about the rail unions&apos; claim beforethe point at which the unions would have to decide whether or not tocomply with the Courts Order. Since the BRB were under nocompulsion to resume negotiations until normal working was resumed and, indeed, felt under some obligation not to do so, they wereresponding cautiously to Mr. Feathefs approaches. Moreover,when they did resume negotiations, it would be open to them to workfor a settlement below the award of the arbitrator, Mr. Jarratt, since they had never formally accepted it and had not themselves offeredmore than an 11 per cent increase from 1st May, 1972, coupled with anundertaking to increase the railwaymen&apos;s basic rate to  20 per week from 1st January, 1973 with a consequential adjustment of differentials.The BRB also wished soon to inform the rail unions that they would need to begin to lay off men who were without work as a result ofindustrial action; but they were prepared to wait until the Governmenthad considered this in the context of a possible declaration of aState of Emergency in the light of the unions&apos; response to the&quot;cooling-off&quot; Order. The Board had also decided to withhold untilthe following day the issue of instructions to their management aboutthe application of normal disciplinary measures in the case of anygross breaches of discipline.The Lord Privy Seal said that rail freight services continued to deteriorate. The movement of oil supplies was a particular cause for concern. Stocks at rail-fed oil terminals were the equivalent oftwo weeks&apos; supplies of light and heavy oils for priority users, whowould also hold some stocks themselves. But stocks at the terminalswould meet only about three to four days&apos; supplies for non-priorityusers, whose own stocks probably averaged the equivalent of seven toten days&apos; oil usage. Road tanker drivers were not co-operating inthe movement of extra supplies of oil by road to the Midlands, whichwas the most seriously affected area. The congestion in marshalling yards was also becoming more serious.In discussion it was suggested that the rail unions might seek toreach an early agreement with the BRB at a level in the region ofMr. Jarratfs award. On the other hand their members might stillreject a settlement on this basis and continue industrial action.Even if they accepted it, militant railwaymen might force the unionswithin two or three months to press the BRB to negotiate a furtherpay increase, backing their demand by a renewed threat of industrial action. In these circumstances the BRB should not enter into further negotiations with the rail unions until the Courts order had been fully complied with. Otherwise, both the Board and theGovernment would forfeit a strong public position; and the unions would use the opportunity to confuse the issues involved, and mightbe enabled to avoid having to decide whether to comply with theCourts Order.SECRET
On the other hand, if the rail unions showed themselves readyto reach an immediate and firm agreement at, or even below, thetotal increase awarded by Mr. Jarratt, it would not be easy to defendto public opinion a refusal by the BRB to consider such a settlement,even though the unions had not yet decided whether to comply withthe Courfs Order. It would be essential, however, that any such agreement, even though it might not be legally enforceable, should provide for the agreed increase in railwaymen&apos;s pay to be conditional on a return to normal working; that it should operate for at least12 months from 1st May, 1972; and that the unions should be publiclycommitted to these conditions. Such an agreement would be seen to be the result of the Governmenfs use of the Industrial relations act; and it would be evidence of a clear victory for the Governmenfspolicies. If a satisfactory agreement were reached with the railunions and the men returned to normal working, application could then be made to the Court for the &quot;cooling-off&quot; Order to be dis-charged. Although there was always a risk that such an agreement might subsequently be repudiated, the rail unions would be in a weakpublic position; and, once the railwaymen had returned to normal working, the unions or unofficial militants should for some time find it difficult to induce them to resume industrial action.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, following the Order granted by the industrial court on the previous day, the BRB would be entitled to refuse tonegotiate further with the rail unions under the duress of continuingindustrial action and that, in the light of their experience of previousdealings with the unions, they would need to be circumspect in theirreaction to any initiative which the unions might take during thecourse of the day to conclude a settlement before they reached thepoint at which they would have to decide whether to recognise or todefy the Courfs authority. The Board would need to be on theirguard against being drawn once again into negotiations which proved to be merely inconclusive. But on balance the Cabinet judged that,if opportunity arose, the Board should be ready to consider concludingwith the rail unions an agreement which, although not legally binding,would be conditional upon a full resumption of work, would be publicly accepted by all the unions concerned as valid for not lessthan 12 months and would provide for pay increases within themaximum earlier determined by the arbitrator, Mr. Jarratt. Min-ministers would need to examine a proposal of this kind with care. Buta public commitment by the unions on these lines would give the BRBsome safeguard against pressure to reopen the agreement in a fewmonths&apos; time on pain of a renewed threat of industrial action, sinceany such move would forfeit the railwaymen all public sympathy.Moreover if, because of continuing unofficial action, the unions were unable to honour such an agreement, it would not come into effect;and the unions and their officials would still be subject to the Order,which would remain enforceable for 14 days from the resumption of normal rail services. The Cabinet recognised that the Secretary ofState for Employment might need to apply again to the Court either for enforcement of the Order if the unions failed to comply with itexpeditiously or for its discharge if a settlement had been concluded
and normal rail services were then resumed. They noted that, until it became clear on the following day whether the rail unions wouldcomply with the Order, the BRB would refrain from dismissingemployees guilty of indiscipline and that they would also refrain fromlaying off employees for whom, as a result of industrial action,there was no work, until the Government had considered these issuesfurther in the context of a possible Proclamation of an Emergency.The Cabinet agreed that the group of Ministers under his chairman-ship (GEN 94) which had been charged to deal with day-to-daydevelopments in the rail dispute should have discretion to advisesuch a Proclamation if and when that became necessary. TheCabinet tendered their congratulations to the Solicitor General onhis effective presentation of the application to the Industrial court for a &quot;cooling-off&quot; Order.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing-up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of State for employment and the Minister for Transport Industries to be guided accordingly.
