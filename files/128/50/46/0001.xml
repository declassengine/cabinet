ParliamentaryAffairsSECRETOversea 2.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary informed the affairs Cabinet that there had been indications that the Icelandic Govern-Icelandic ment were considering a renewal of harassment by Icelandic gunboatsFisheries of British trawlers fishing within the 50-mile limit unilaterally claimedDispute by Iceland. He had sent a message urging restraint from any actionPrevious        which might exacerbate the situation.   It was important that weReference:      should similarly not take any action which the Icelandic government cm (72)44th   might construe as provocative; he proposed, however, to considerConclusions,    urgently, with the Secretary of State for Defence, what measuresMmute l       might be taken to enable the Royal Navy to /enter the 50-mile zoneat fairly short notice should it become necessary to render support toBritish fishing vessels threatened with harassment.  Meanwhile, hewould continue his efforts to reach a settlement of the dispute withthe Icelandic Government.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the statment by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week, before Prorogationon 26 October. These arrangements would depend upon the progress made with the large number of amendments to the Local Govern-ment Bill during the remaining stages in the House of Lords and withthe subsequent consideration of Lords Amendments in the House ofCommons. If it were practicable to do so, Parliament should,however, be prorogued at 11 o&apos;clock in the morning of 26 October.Time would be provided during that week for a division in theHouse of Commons on the remaining Lords Amendment to theNational Health Service (Family Planning) Amendment Bill; but itwas important that this arrangement should not be regarded as constituting a breach of the general principle observed by theGovernment that Government time should not be provided for private Members&apos; business.The Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary and Lord President of theCouncil to consider, in consultation with the Lord privy seal, the Secretary of State for the Environment and theChief Whip, the arrangements which should be made for theremaining stages of the Local Government Bill and inparticular the handling of amendments which were likely togive rise to controversy and therefore to impede progress with the Bill.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that Mr. Slater,the High Commissioner who had been recalled from Kampalafollowing a threat of expulsion, had informed him that the moods ofthe President of Uganda, General Amin, were becoming increasinglyunpredictable, and that there was little prospect of establishingrational communication with him. It was believed that Africans,including Army personnel, were being murdered with the acquies-acquiescence of General Amin. The Ugandan Army was, however, beingrestrained from molesting Asians or Europeans. The number ofBritish citizens still in Uganda with personal or ancestral connections with the United Kingdom (&quot; belongers &quot;) was thought not to be morethan some 4,000. Two United Kingdom &quot; belongers&quot; and oneAustralian had recently been arrested; but it did not at presentappear that the &quot; belongers&quot; were in physical danger. DespiteGeneral Amin&apos;s aberrations, the people of Uganda as a wholeappeared to be still friendly to Britain; and it would be unwise to jeopardise unnecessarily our commercial interests in the country.The Home Secretary and Lord President of the Council said thatthe number of Asian United Kingdom passport holders (UKPH) tobe evacuated from Uganda to the United Kingdom was of the orderof 22,000, all of whom would have left well before the time limitstated by General Amin. Recent reports that entry certificates to theUnited Kingdom were being issued to stateless Asians were incorrect.The facts were that a number of persons-some 600 heads of house-holds whose status was doubtful (for example those whoserenunciation of United Kingdom citizenship might be shown to beinvalid) were being re-examined to see if they should properly beclassified as United Kingdom citizens, in which event they might beissued with entry certificates; and that entry certificates were also being granted to UKPH dependants of non-UKPH heads of families,subject to the clearly stated condition that no right of entry wasthereby granted to the head of family. This latter measure might involve some separation of families; but it was essential to maintainthe principle that we had no direct responsibility for non-UKPHheads of families, although we should in no way discourage thereunion of such families in third countries. Meanwhile any non-UKPH Asians from Uganda who reached the United kingdom without entry certificates were exceptionally being accommodated inthe resettlement centres established by the Uganda ResettlementBoard; but it was made clear that they could not remain in thiscountry as of right, and would be subject to deportation if they left the resettlement centres.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet had taken note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and the Home Secretary and lord president of the Council. The policy of refusing right of entry to non-UKPH Asians should be maintained; but we should seek,wherever possible, to encourage family reunion in third countries,perhaps under the auspices of the United Nations High commission for Refugees. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and theHome Secretary and Lord President of the Council should also
consider whether special arrangements were required to enable mis-leading statements regarding the Governmenfs policy to be quickly and authoritatively denied.The Cabinet (2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion, and invited the Foreign and Corn-wealth Secretary and the Home Secretary and lord president of the Council to be guided accordingly.IndustrialAffairsMeetingswith theConfederationof BritishIndustry andthe TradesUnionCongressPreviousReference:CM (72) 44thConclusions,Minute 3CONFIDENTIAL3. The Prime Minister said that the most significant element inthe published statement of the reactions of the Grand Council of the confederation of British Industries (CBI) to the proposals on deter-mination of pay and prices put forward by the Government at the tripartite discussions on 26 September had been their unwillingness to commit themselves to the restriction of price increases over thefollowing year to an average of 4 per cent. They had, however, been willing to accept &apos;a continuation of the weighted average price increase of 5 per cent, with some freedom on the price of individualproducts and arrangements to reflect major changes in raw materialcosts, as long as companies benefited from the higher growth rate ofthe economy and provided the trade unions accepted the proposedflat-rate pay increase. The General Council of the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) had in their comments challenged the assumptions,about the rate of growth of the economy and the share of the gross national Product (GNP) which could be devoted to wages and salaries, on which the Governmenfs proposal for a  2 increase in pay was based, and had suggested that with a target of a 6 per centgrowth rate instead of 5 per cent and a 62 per cent share of GNPdevoted to wages instead of 61 per cent the average increase in wagescould be  3-40 a week. They had also claimed that a 6 per centgrowth rate would enable unemployment to be reduced, whereas thiswould not be possible with a 5 per cent rate. The TUC had alsobeen concerned about rising prices, claiming that some form ofcontrol was needed. They had suggested a number of measures tohelp in containing prices, as well as making other proposals relatingto incomes on which they wished to see action taken. All these issues had been given detailed consideration in preparation for thefurther tripartite discussions on the previous day. He had begunthese discussions by reminding the representatives of the TUC andthe CBI of the agreed objectives, which included an improvement inthe relative position of the low-paid as well as a faster growth rate and moderation in the rate of cost and price inflation; and he had sought views on how best these might be achieved. Much time hadbeen devoted, without reaching any agreement, to discussions of theeconomic assumptions about the amount which the country could afford to devote to an increase of wages and,salaries; there would befurther tripartite examination of these questions in more detail atofficial level before the next tripartite meeting, which would be on
26 October. On prices the TUC representatives had insisted on theneed for firm assurances that increases could be controlled, whichthey thought could be achieved only by some statutory means. Theyhad, however, said that, if an overall agreement could be reached inthe discussions, they expected that their General Council wouldendorse it. The discussion had convinced the CBI representatives that firmer arrangements on price control would in fact be necessary,and they would be giving further thought, with the retail organisa-tions and as a matter of urgency, to this question and in particular to the difficulties of statutory control. On wages, the TUC representa-tives had been surprisingly forthcoming and had accepted theprinciple of a flat-rate increase; they had enumerated the detailedissues upon which agreement would in consequence be necessary.Although the CBI representatives had said that control of pricesmust be matched by control of incomes and that clear guidelineswould be necessary on how the detailed aspects of a flat-rate increasein pay would be implemented, the expected clash between the CBIand the TUC had not materialised. The other matters to which the tuc representatives appeared to attach importance were increases inpensions, holding down rents and, in the case of Mr. Scanlon, an assurance by the Government that the provisions of the industrial relations Act would not be implemented. The discussions had beenfrank and marked by the desire of both the TUC and the CBIrepresentatives that there should be a successful outcome; the TUCnow recognised the force of public opinion in favour of an agreement,and would not wish to be the cause of failure, and the CBI nowrecognised the value to employers, even at a rather higher cost interms of wages, of ending the present exceptional friction in industrial relations. Further work was now being put in hand on all thematters which were likely to be discussed on 26 October, and inparticular on the level of increase in pay which was justified andon possible ways of dealing with defiance by individual companies orretailers of any voluntary system of price control. There were various possible combinations of elements for the final package upon whichthe Government might stand at the meeting on 26 October, at whichhe hoped a decision on the practicability of any agreement would bereached; and the Cabinet would be invited to consider the proposedpackage on 24 October or 25 October.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister.1973Revaluationfor RatesPreviousReference:CM (72) 44thConclusions,Minute 5CONFIDENTIAL4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Environment (CP (72) 104) about the rating revaluationwhich was due to come into force on 1 April, 1973. They also had before them a note by the Secretary of State (CP (72) 105), covering a preliminary appraisal by officials of the problems which were likely to arise in the forthcoming negotiations over rate support grant for1973-74.
The Secretary of State for the Environment recalled that at their previous meeting (CM (72) 44th Conclusions, Minute 5) the cabinet had agreed to consider further the extent to which, in the context ofthe forthcoming rating revaluation, local authorities could be induced to conform with measures of price restraint; how revaluation shouldbe presented publicly; and what reassurance could be given to rate-payers. There could be no certainty that the rate poundage leviedby some local authorities, or the rate bills received by some rate-payers, might not exceed a specific rate of increase.   It would however be possible to contain the general increase by means of amore generous settlement of rate support grant: the Government hadhalved the percentage increase in grant established by their pre-predecessors, as a result of which domestic rate poundage had risen byas much (25 per cent) in the last two years as it had in the previousfour, and they had urged local authorities to undertake counter-cyclical activities which would still be imposing extra costs next year.A more generous grant settlement would enable him to press localauthorities to restrain the growth in rates, and not to use revaluationas an occasion to increase their income. On the other hand, it wouldbe unrealistic to expect significant savings next year in the expendi-ture of local authorities; substantial changes would require legislation,and could not occur before the reorganisation of local governmentcame into effect in April 1974.  He believed that the Governmentshould then seek to make a large reduction in local authority expenditure, though not by the further removal of services under-taken by local authorities. He therefore invited the Cabinet to agreethat the rating revaluation should proceed, and that in this connectionregulations relating to the electricity industry should now be laid inParliament.   He hoped that this action would give rise to littlepublicity, and he proposed to launch the main publicity campaignabout revaluation when the new valuation lists were published inDecember.  It should then be possible to point to a generous settle-ment of grant and assurances of restraint from local authority associations, as well as to measures for the relief of rates in the LocalGovernment Finance Bill; but if there were comment or speculationin the immediate future, he proposed to explain that revaluation neednot mean increased rate burdens, indicate the Governments intentionto be generous with rate support grant, and adumbrate further measures for the relief of rates. He invited the Cabinet to endorsehis proposals for publicity, and to agree that there should be a more generous rate support grant settlement for 1973-74 and that means should be sought to reduce local authority expenditure from April1974.In discussion it was argued that to put off revaluation wouldprogressively distort the rating system and aggravate inequity to individual ratepayers, notably in the field of landlord and tenantrelationships, where existing rateable values no longer represented a realistic basis for compensation. Higher rateable values would however be politically unpopular, and in the public presentation ofthe Governments decision a concerted and sustained drive wouldbe needed to reassure public opinion. The cost of increasing the level;of rate support grant to ensure that increases in average rate
poundage were kept within the bounds of the Governmenfs price restraint measures might be about  100 million in 1973-74; but anincrease in rate support grant would not have the impact of a directtransfer of services from local to Central Government, and might encourage some local authorities to extravagant expenditure.Though in the forthcoming negotiations with the local authority associations it would be acceptable to hold Out the prospect of amore generous settlement than in previous years, it would be inadvisable to suggest that the level of grant might be adjusted tomeet specific levels of price restraint.In discussion of longer-term measures to relieve the pressure onrates, it was remarked that consideration had already been given tothe possibility of transferring services from local to Central Govern-ment, and agreement had been reached on measures which shouldyield a saving to local government of some  300 million in 1974-75.More extensive transfers would involve a radical reassessment, par-ticularly of education costs; and in this field care must be taken thatCentral Government was committed neither to run services (such asthe supply of teachers) that should belong to local authorities, nor to finance services without an adequate say in their administration.There might however be scope for reviewing the financing of higher education.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that rating revaluation should proceed. They attached great importance to the public presentation of this decision, in termsboth of expounding the Governmenfs measures to contain increases in rate -bills, and of giving reassurance about the problems of individual ratepayers. The Secretary of State for the Environmentshould report to the Cabinet on the immediate arrangements forlaying the electricity industry regulations in Parliament, and should bring his proposals for the public, handling of the general question before the Home and Social Affairs Committee. The Cabinet would wish to consider the level of rate support grant for 1973-74 on anotheroccasion. Meanwhile, in his discussions with local authority associations the Secretary of State should avoid commitment to theprinciple that the level of grant would be fixed to ensure that increases in average rate poundage were consistent with the Governmenfsmeasures of price restraint. For the longer term, the Ministers con-cerned should examine ways in which the burden of local government expenditure might be reduced, including the further transfer ofeducation services from local to Central Government.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the 1973 revaluation for rates should proceed.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment (i) to proceed with the arrangements for laying inParliament the regulations relating to the rating ofthe electricity industry, and to report these to thePrime Minister and members of the Cabinet;(ii) to circulate to the Home and Social. Affairs Com-mittee his detailed proposals for the public
presentation of the Governmenfs decision onrating revaluation and the information to be givento ratepayers;(iii) in his negotiations with local authority associationsover the level of rate support grant for 1973-74,to be guided by the views expressed in their discus-sion, as indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up;(iv) in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Home Secretary and Lord President, and the secretaries of State for Social Services, education and Science, Scotland, and Wales, to circulate tothe Ministerial Committee on Regional Policy andthe Environment a report on longer-term measuresto reduce the cost of local government services.(3) Agreed to consider the level of rate support grant for1973-74 at a future meeting.secret.  The Cabinet had before them notes by the Secretary ofthe State for the Home Department and Lord President of the Council(CP (72) 106 and 107), to which were annexed drafts of The Queen&apos;speeches on the Prorogation and on the Opening of Parliament.The Cabinet considered the draft Speeches paragraph by paragraph.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the drafts, subject to the various amendments which had been suggested and to further consideration of paragraph 2of the Opening Speech after the European Summit meeting and ofparagraph 10 after the next meeting in the tripartite talks. the speeches should be kept under close review in order that accountcould be taken of any modifications made necessary by subsequentdevelopments.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.secret . The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland (CP (72) 108) covering a draft of a paper on the future Of Northern Ireland.The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland said that the paper would be published under the title &quot; The Future of Northern Ireland:a Paper for Discussion &quot;. The draft before the Cabinet incorporatedpassages suggested by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office andthe Ministry of Defence. Officials from the Northern Ireland Office
and the Treasury would be working out a passage describing theextent of our financial assistance to Northern Ireland; he did not expect the drafting of this to give rise to any difficulty.  The paper would certainly attract criticism from both sides in Northern Ireland,where it might also be dismissed as irrelevant in the present circum-stances.   Nevertheless, it was important to go ahead with its publication and he asked his colleagues to agree that this should takeplace by 30 October. He also wished to publish as soon as possible a Bill enabling a plebiscite on the border to be held and he hopedthat this could be taken in Parliament without delay. He would very shortly be announcing the membership of the Diplock Commissionof Inquiry: in addition to Lord Diplock, Professor Rupert Cross,Mr. George Woodcock and Sir Kenneth Younger had agreed to serve.The tribunals to deal with cases which could not be heard in opencourt would shortly come into operation.  Turning to the situationin Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State for Northern ireland said that a new and most serious development was the decision ofProtestant extremists to mount deliberate violence against theSecurity Forces.   They maintained that this was because we had failed to arrange for the plebiscite on the border to be taken inadvance of the local authority elections, and because some of our forces had been behaving badly; but their real objective was toexacerbate the sectarian conflict and to stir up the situation generally.They were in fact throwing down a challenge to the State. On theprevious night they had fired 130 rounds at our forces and 12soldiers had been wounded. There was the further possibility thatif Protestant attacks on Catholics should continue (and they mightwell grow) it would become very difficult to prevent the Catholicsfrom hitting back.   The present force levels were insufficient tocontinue the present supervision of the Catholic areas and to dealwith a rising scale of violence from the Protestants. He might shortly be faced with a decision whether to detain leading Protestants whoengaged in or were behind the campaign of violence. But he would consult his colleagues if it came to this.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe draft should take account of the few further points that had beenmade, including a reduction of the number of references to the levelof Northern Ireland representation in the Westminster Parliament.The draft ruled out, in effect, a solution in which Northern Irelandbecame independent and gave the impression that a solution mustlie in the establishment of some sort of local assembly. discussion had shown that this was acceptable to the Cabinet. The paper should be published by 30 October. As regards the behaviour ofthe Protestant extremists it was important that Parliament and thepublic should be made fully aware of the violence being directed against our forces from the Protestant side, and that we should makeplain our determination not to tolerate violence or a challenge toour authority from any quarter.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of Statefor Northern Ireland to be guided accordingly.
CONFIDENTIALLaw and Order 7. The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he had nowVisit of The received reports on the disturbances caused by students at StirlingQueen to University on the occasion of the visit of The Queen to theStirling University on 12 October, from the Minister of State, ScottishUniversity Office, who had been present, from the Private Secretary toThe Queen, and from the Chief Constable concerned. It was clear that Her Majesty had at no time been in any physicaldanger, nor had there been any physical contact; the schedule forher visit had not been disrupted. There were many new students atthe University and some of those involved had been drinking alcohol.The lesson appeared to be that more adequate numbers of police,both uniformed and plain-clothes, would be needed during futureRoyal visits to Universities. He proposed to submit a further reportto the Prime Minister, of which he would send a copy to the HomeSecretary and Lord President of the Council.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State forScotland.Cabinet Office,17 October, 1972.
