ParliamentaryAffairsSECRET1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Oversea AffairsRhodesiaPreviousReference :CM (71) 62ndConclusions,Minute 3.BangladeshPreviousReference:CM (72) 1stConclusions,Minute 2141569-secret.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the start of the work of the Pearce Commission, which had been appointed to conduct the Test of Acceptability of the proposals for a constitutional settlement  in   Rhodesia,  had  been   accompanied  by   seriousdisturbances on a scale which had not been foreseen by the Rhodesianregime.   The pattern of these disturbances recalled those of the1960s; and their organisation was attributed by the Rhodesianauthorities to agitation by members of the African National Council(ANC).  There was no independent evidence of the involvement ofthe ANC; but on the face of it this appeared not improbable. the disturbances had on the whole been confined to limited areas.Unfortunately, the former Rhodesian Prime Minister, Mr. GarfieldTodd, whose sympathies were known to lie with the Africans, livedin one of these areas; and the Rhodesian authorities had arrestedhim and his daughter on grounds of security and the need to maintainlaw and order. He had asked Mr. Smith, the Rhodesian leader, for full information on the circumstances of these arrests; but he ratherdoubted whether much evidence against Mr. Todd and his daughterwould be produced.    Provided that the disturbances could be contained, he was reasonably hopeful that in other parts of thecountry people would be able to respond to the Pearce Commissionfreely and without intimidation; but it had to be accepted that come degree of intimidation had already occurred and that many Africanswere afraid to express their views, even in private. Only the PearceCommission themselves could judge whether conditions were such that they could carry out their task effectively; and he was in touchwith Lord Pearce on this issue.   He had also sent the Head of rhodesia Political Department of the Foreign and commonwealth office to Salisbury to report on the local situation.   Meanwhile,there had been requests that British Members of Parliament shouldbe allowed facilities to go to Rhodesia in order to observe the workof  the  Commission.    He  had  discussed  the  question  withMr. Denis Healy, m p, the Opposition spokesman on foreign affairs,and had agreed with him that the most suitable arrangement wouldbe that a five-member group should be established for this purposerepresenting all parties. The Labour Party, however, were likely to wish to send, in addition, a group of their own Members.  If theydid so decide, it would be appropriate to transmit their request for facilities to Mr. Smith, without any endorsement by the Government.But it had to be recognised that we had no powers either to prevent any Member of Parliament from going to Rhodesia if he wished orto ensure that he was not denied entry or other facilities by the rhodesian authorities.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary reported that anumber of friendly Powers, including members of the Old Common-wealth and Western European States, were now nearly ready torecognise Bangladesh. But it was important that formal recognitionSECRETa2
should not take place until President Bhutto of West Pakistan hadbeen given a chance to come to terms with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,the Prime Minister of Bangladesh. President Bhutto had indicated that he was working seriously to this end; and we should do nothing which would enable him to claim that we had thwarted his efforts to make peace. But it seemed likely that five or six substantialPowers would be ready to join us in recognising Bangladesh in about a week&apos;s time; and he hoped that, if we proceeded in that way,the reaction in West Pakistan would not be unduly sharp.Ghana The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the regimeof Dr. Busia had been overthrown by a group of young andinexperienced military officers. No opposition had been offered tothe coup; and the new regime appeared to be in effective control ofthe country. We were doing what we could to establish satisfactoryrelations with them; but it would be prudent to withhold formal recognition for a little longer. Widespread dissatisfaction with theway in which the Ghanaian economy had been managed byDr. Busia&apos;s Government seemed to be the cause of the revolt; andthere was a distinct risk that the new regime would repudiate the debts incurred by their predecessors. We stood to lose some 120 million if the Ghanaian debt to us was repudiated.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.IndustrialAffairsCoal Miners&apos;StrikePreviousReference:CM (72) 2ndConclusions,Minute 2SECRET3. The Secretary of State for Employment said that the meeting between the National Coal Board (NCB) and the National Union of mineworkers (NUM) proposed by Mr. Feather, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), had taken place onthe previous day. He understood that the NUM had adopted anunyielding attitude, in the face of which the NCB had refused to change their own position. Subsequently, he had agreed to meet mr. Feather, who had indicated that he was opposed to theappointment of a Court of Inquiry, on the grounds that there was unlikely to be a resumption of work whilst it sat and that there wasno guarantee that its recommendations would be accepted. At thesame time Mr. Feather had urged him to intervene quickly bymeeting both parties to the dispute; and, although it was unrealistic to suppose that any progress would result, the Government would be liable to incur criticism if he failed to make any response toMr. Feather&apos;s suggestion, which had been announced publicly. he therefore sought the Cabinefs agreement, on the understanding thatthere would not be any weakening of the Governmenfs attitude, tohis holding an early meeting with both sides with the object ofexploring the position.In discussion it was reported that there had been little change inthe situation as regards supplies of coal and that, although safetyprecautions in the mines had suffered less than might have been
expected at this stage, a serious problem could soon emerge inthis respect. A shortage of lighting-up oil had developed at a largepower station in Scotland as a result of a refusal by tanker driversto cross picket lines. Although it might be possible to obtainsupplies from a different oil company, the South of scotland electricity Board were also considering the possibility of takinglegal action against those concerned. Before any such action wastaken it was essential that there should be the fullest considerationof the legal issues involved. Whereas peaceful picketing was undoubtedly legal, it might be possible to obtain an interiminjunction if those involved could be identified and it could be demonstrated that they had caused injury to the Board. It was also possible that a threat to &quot; black &quot; the vehicles of a third party mightbe held to constitute intimidation, extending beyond the right tocommunicate information which was comprised within the concept of peaceful picketing. The courts were now tending to take a more restrictive view about the rights of those engaged in a trade dispute.But it would only be possible to decide whether the chance of a civilaction succeeding had been improved by the provisions of theIndustrial Relations Act when there had been some opportunity to test its operation in the courts.In further discussion it was noted that the Service departments would need a week&apos;s notice of any requirement to use troops afterthe introduction of Emergency Powers, which would themselves take some days to bring into force. The employment of troops in aminers&apos; strike, however, would be liable seriously to exacerbate thesituation and should be avoided if possible. In particular, if troops were used to move oil supplies, there would be a risk that tankerdrivers might withdraw their labour completely; and this could leadto a shortage of petrol within a matter of days.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for Employment should meet both parties to the dispute on the basis which he proposed.A close watch should be kept on the activities of pickets; and the attorney-General and the Lord Advocate should be kept in touchwith developments. All necessary contingency planning should bekept under constant review.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Unemployment The Secretary of State for Employment said that the JanuaryPrevious return of unemployment would be published that day. If the reference: statistics for Northern Ireland were included, the total number of cm(71)56th unemployed would be seen to exceed 1 million. This would clearlyConclusions, invite sharp criticism; but he had taken all possible measures to minute 4 ensure that the return would be presented in the context of theGovernments efforts to deal with the situation.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for employment.
Motor andHeating andVentilationIndustriesPreviousReference:CM(71) 19thConclusions,Minute 3The Secretary of State for Employment said that the currentwage negotiations at the Chrysler Motor Corporation^ plant atLinwood were important from the point of view of the control of wage inflation. There was every indication that the Corporation^ability to withstand the demands of the trade unions was impaired bytheir overriding need to maintain an adequate cash flow by avoiding any interruption of production. Many other undertakings in theprivate sector were in the same position. In these circumstances theGovernment could do little more than emphasise the importance of resisting extravagent claims; and the Corporation had been madefully aware of the danger of yielding on this occasion.An exceptionally high pay award to employees in the heatingand ventilation industry, which had been announced on the previous day and followed the settlement for the. electrical contractingindustry to which he had drawn the attention of the Cabinet on1 April, 1971, was bound further to impair the Governments efforts to control wage inflation.The Cabinet-(3) Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for employment.CONFIDENTIALEuropean 4.   The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that economic negotiations for British membership of the European economic community Community had been finally concluded on Tuesday, 18 January, intime for the text of the Treaty of Accession to be prepared for signature on Saturday, 22 January. The two outstanding points of disagreement had been the arrangements for Norway as regards fishand the drafting of the protocol relating to New Zealand dairy products. On the former the Community had finally madeconcessions to Norway-largely of a presentational nature which gave her, in substance, little more than the United Kingdom,Denmark and the Irish Republic had obtained at the last ministerial meeting on 12 December. As regards the New Zealand protocol, wehad secured the agreement of the Community at the ministerial meeting in Luxembourg in the previous June, that there would be: continuing special arrangements for New Zealand butter after 1977but had accepted that the nature of these arrangements would haveto be the subject of unanimous agreement. In order to meet thewishes of the New Zealand Government this agreement had been recorded in the minutes of the Ministerial conference and not in apublished text, although he&apos; had made the position clear to the Houseof Commons at the time. Given that continuity after 1977 had been built into the Treaty, the fact that the terms of the continuingarrangements themselves were to be the subject of a unanimousrather than a majority vote gave the United Kingdom as well as other members the right of veto and would probably, therefore,
SECRET..7CONFIDENTIALprove to be advantageous on balance to.New Zealand&apos;s interests.He had explained the position to Mr. Marshall, the Deputy PrimeMinister of New Zealand in correspondence.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.EuropeanCommunitiesBillPreviousReference:CM(71) 58thConclusions,Minute 4SECRET*5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster (CP (72) 8) to which was annexed a draftof the European Communities Bill.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the draftBill made the legislative changes which were required before theUnited Kingdom joined the European Communities. It had beenprepared in accordance with the principles approved by the cabinet at their meeting on 23 November; and it took account of the points made at a meeting of the Legislation Committee in the previousweek. The draft dealt expressly but concisely with all matters whichhad to be dealt with before our accession to the Communities orshortly afterwards, including the amendment of existing Acts. Hehad considered with the Lord President and the other ministers concerned whether the Bill could be shortened, for example by the omission of the clause on films. But any omission would involveabandoning the principle that the Bill made all the amendments ofexisting Acts which were needed immediately. Moreover, newclauses and other amendments would still be liable to be put down on the Committee Stage to deal with a topic omitted from the Bill.He therefore recommended the adoption of the present draft of theBill.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet approved the draft Bill attached to CP(72) 8,congratulated all those responsible for its preparation and draftingand authorised its introduction in the House of Commons in thefollowing week. Careful attention should be given to the publicityarrangements to accompany its publication. Meanwhile, its scope and content should continue to be subject to stringent security; and ministers should take particular care to prevent any premature disclosure of the Government^ intentions as regards the legislation for our accession to the Communities.The Cabinet- /(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing .up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Lord President, to proceed accordingly and to arrange for the introduction of theBill in the House of Commons during the following week.*Previously circulated*Sfi a Confidential AnnexSECRET
CONFIDENTIALDanger from 6.   The Secretary of State for the Environment informed the maritime Cabinet of the steps being taken to deal with dangerous substancesCargoes which had been washed ashore in containers on the South Westcoast. Certain Press reports which had alleged a lack of co-ordination between Government Departments were founded on a misunderstanding of the situation. In particular, it had beenreported that there had been a failure by the Department of Tradeand Industry to inform his own Department of the loss overboardof part of a cargo of dangerous chemicals from the freighterAtlantic Ocean. In fact the loss of the cargo had been notifiedby the Coastguard to the local authorities likely to be concernedin accordance with the standing procedure. It was well understoodthat local authorities could call upon his Department for assistance if they needed it. The accepted procedure did not involve his department in the collection of information and its disseminationto local authorities, although the Department had immediatelyinformed the local authorities when they received news thatdangerous containers from the wreck of another vessel, theGermania, were being washed ashore on the South West coast.He was arranging for these misunderstandings to be arrested.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that therewas a clear need to improve the effectiveness of international agreements on the notification of wrecks and cargo lost overboard;and the necessary action would be taken in the Inter-GovernmentalMaritime Consultative Organisation. Once information was receivedby the Coastguard of dangerous matter adrift, our domesticprocedure for giving warning of hazards on land appeared to serve the needs of the case adequately. In most instances the localauthorities were able to deal competently with the situations which arose; and to establish a central control agency for this purposemight not necessarily be an improvement.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatit was essential that there should be, and should be seen to be, effective machinery to provide the earliest possible warning of hazards ofthis kind and to enable the necessary resources for dealing withthem to be brought to bear as rapidly as possible. He would arrangefor the domestic procedures to be reviewed. Meanwhile, theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry should press forwardvigorously proposals for more effective international agreements onnotifying the loss of maritime cargoes.The Cabinet &apos; vTook note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of the discussion, and invited the Secretary of State for trade and Industry to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office,20 January, 1972.
