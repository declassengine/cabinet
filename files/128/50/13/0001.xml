SECRETIndustrialAffairsRailway PayNegotiationsPreviousReference :CM (72) 11thConclusions,Minute 3The Cabinet considered Notes by the Secretary of State for the environment (CP (72) 28 and 29) to which was attached memoranda by the Minister for Transport Industries about the railwaymen&apos;spay claim and the effect of industrial action by the railway unions;by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (CP (72) 30) aboutthe.effect of a possible rail strike on electricity supplies and its otherconsequences; by the Secretary of State for Employment (CP (72) 31)about the use of the powers in the Industrial Relations Act; andby the Attorney General (CP (72) 32) about the law relating topicketing in England and Wales.The Minister for Transport Industries said that at a meeting with the British Railways Board (BRB) on 24 February the railway unions had not quantified their request for a substantial increase in pay but had given the impression they were seeking an increase ofthe order of 15 per cent. A clearer idea of the level of settlement which might be practicable would be obtained from the negotiations with were due to start the following day. If these broke down,even though the unions could be expected to give at least seven days&apos; notice of a national strike, members of the Associated society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) would almost certainly start unofficial action, which, if widespread, could cause serious difficulties. The unions would be likely to use the reportof the Wilberforce Court of Inquiry to pursue two main butconflicting objectives. The National Union of Railwaymen (NUR)would seek to raise basic rates at the bottom of the scale, whereasASLEF would seek to restore lost differentials at the higher end.The similarities with the miners.&apos; case on which the unions would draw were the major manpower reductions which had taken place with union co-operation; the substantial proportion of workers whowere low paid; the loss of differentials for the skilled workers,especially the drivers; and onerous working conditions andinadequate rewards for improved productivity. The BRB would start the negotiations at the lowest realistic figures and take them as slowly as possible. But in their judgment a settlement was unlikely to be negotiable at a cost below 10-11 per cent of the wagebill. Paragraph 18 of the memorandum annexed to CP (72) 28outlined the various possible guidelines which the government might give the Board. These took into account the immediate andsevere effects of an early national rail strike; and they reflected the probability that, although public opinion might be opposed toanother strike so soon after the miners&apos; dispute, hostility to the railwaymen would not necessarily be accompanied by sympathy forthe Government. He. therefore supported the recommendation ofthe meeting of Ministers on 1 March that the Chairman of the BRBshould be authorised to seek a settlement within a total cost of10 per cent of the wage bill and that, if a settlement within this limitdid not prove possible in the current week, the negotiations shouldbe adjourned in order to enable the Chairman to consult theGovernment further.
The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that his memorandum (CP (72) 30) set out the effects of a rail strike startingon various possible alternative dates in March and April on thealternative assumptions that supplies of coal and oil would, andwould not, be maintained by road during the strike. Any attemptto transfer normal rail traffic to the roads would probably lead tothe &quot; blacking &quot; of that traffic. The conclusion of this review wasthat, from 20 March onwards, the country should be capable of managing for some weeks so far as electricity supplies were concerned, provided that restrictions at the level in force on14 February were introduced as soon as a rail strike began. the limitations on supplies would involve the disruption of industry, a loss of manufacturing output of about 15 to 20 per cent, a lossof about 1\ million man-days of employment per week and wide-spread and continuous disturbances in commerce and private life.The Secretary of State for Employment said that under theIndustrial Relations Act he could apply to the Industrial Court for either a cooling-off order or a ballot order; in either case the court would need to be satisfied that emergency conditions existed, as defined in the Act. Since the majority of ASLEF members mightwell favour industrial action, a ballot order was unlikely to be of value. But a cooling-off order, restraining named organisations or individuals from taking or threatening to take industrial action for amaximum of 60 days, would buy valuable time in which to build upstocks of coal in power stations. There would be political pressure to use this procedure; and, despite the risk of deliberate defiance byASLEF or spontaneous unofficial action, he was inclined torecommend that it should be invoked in the case of an official strikeonce negotiations had finally broken down. He would need to beable to demonstrate to the Court that the order would be conductive to a settlement; but an application should be abundantly justifiableif the unions broke off negotiations precipitately and called an earlystrike.The Attorney General said that his memorandum (CP (72) 32)described the action which might be taken in both criminal and civil proceedings in relation to picketing. In all cases the ability to bringproceedings depended upon the supply of accurate informationsufficient to constitute evidence in a court. It was thereforeimperative that those wishing to institute proceedings, together withthe Governments advisers, should at once be informed of theorganising activities, orders and precise instructions of union officials and pickets, which could be at variance with the unions&apos; publicannouncements. The Police, however, had na duty to informprospective civil litigants of matters on which civil proceedings couldbe founded. Moreover, it a would not be for the Government todecide whether to bring civil proceedings; and, as in the case of thecoal strike, those concerned would seek their own independentadvice. In the case of criminal proceedings the question of prosecutions was one for the appropriate authority: the duty of thePolice was to enforce the law. It might be useful for the Police tobe informed of the advice about criminal proceedings contained in cp (72) 32.
In discussion, it was suggested that, although there wereelements in the railwaymen&apos;s case which would attract public sympathy, the statistics in CP (72) 28 indicated that railwaymen&apos;saverage earnings did not compare unfavourably with those ofworkers in other industries. Moreover, since 1960 railwaymen&apos;saverage earnings had risen by 145 per cent, those of workers in manufacturing industries by 107 per cent and those of miners beforethe recent settlement by 94 per cent, while the retail price index had risen by only 67 per cent. Only 5,000 out of 270,000 railway workersearned less than  20 a week. It would not therefore be unreasonablefor the basic betterment increase to be limited to, say, 7-8 per cent,which might be augmented by the cost, which should be modest, of concessions to guarantee a reasonable minimum earnings level. Sucha settlement could be presented as conforming with incomes policy,while providing especially generous treatment for those on low ratesof pay.On the other hand, although average earnings on the railways were not unreasonably out of line with those in other industries, thehours of most railwaymen were both longer and more irregular. Theaverage working week was 49 hours, compared with 45-46 in otherindustries; and much of the work was done at night and at weekends.The railwayman^ minimum basic rate of  17-20 was now well below that in most other public sector industries. Moreover, thedifferentials enjoyed by drivers, signalmen and others among thehigher paid railway workers, who had both responsible duties andonerous working conditions, had been eroded in recent years. Over-rigid adherence to pre-determined norms for pay increases in casessuch as this would entail considerable risk and be difficult to defendas being fair. Although it was important to maintain the momentumto reduce the general level of pay settlements and might be necessary,therefore, to stand up to the threat of industrial action, it would bea mistake to fight on weak ground. If the railwaymen&apos;s claim werecountered by too low an offer, an immediate strike might develop;and arbitration or a court of inquiry might become inescapable. Asin the case of the miners, the ultimate settlement might then well be higher than could have been negotiated before the strike; and the damage to incomes policy would be correspondingly greater. If,through unreasonable inflexibility, the Government seemed to havebeen responsible for precipitating a second major strike so soon after the settlement of the miners&apos; dispute, they would be liable tobe blamed as much as the employers or the unions. The Govern-menfs main concern must be to avoid either an early strike or astrike from which major concessions were likely to be won in the end,which would merely reinforce the conviction that industrial actionyielded advantageous results. It would therefore be important notto allow negotiations to break down except on the basis of an offer which was publicly defensible and did reasonable justice to the merits of the railwaymen&apos;s claim. This should be mainly directed to improving the position of the lower paid workers; but it would alsobe desirable to offer some recognition of the claims of drivers andsignalmen, who could attract public sympathy on account of theirawkward hours of work and their special responsibilities. A possiblesettlement might provide a new minimum basic rate of about  19 aB*
week, line with minimum basic pay under the recent settlements inthe gas, electricity and water industries, augmented by a minimumearnings guarantee of about  20 a week. This would raise the basic rate by some 10 per cent; but the increase in the total wage bill would be somewhat lower. Within a total settlement costing no more than 10 per cent on the wage bill there might not be sufficientroom also to improve the gross pay differentials of the higher paid workers; but it should still be possible to provide for some increasein their net differentials. Alternatively, there might be scope to compensate this group of workers by conceding some specialallowance in respect of the burdensome conditions and irregularhours which were peculiar to the railways and were not reflected inother industries. Consideration should also be given to the prospectof persuading the unions to settle at a somewhat lower level thanthey might otherwise be prepared to contemplate, by offeringgenerous compensation to those workers who became redundant and,perhaps, by agreeing to limit the extent of redundancies. In principle,however, it would be undesirable to allow any such arrangement toprevent the necessary modernisation of the railway system. Becauseof the industry&apos;s complex pay structure, the precise construction ofany settlement or offers would need to be left to the discretion of theBRB; and, subject to a total cost of 10 per cent on the wages bill andto the other points which had been made in the discussion, theChairman should be given reasonable negotiating flexibility.In discussion of the action to be taken if the negotiations broke down it was noted that there would be difficulty in seeking a cooling-off injunction to deal with unofficial action. Even if such action were sufficiently extensive as to constitute an emergency as definedunder the Act and it were possible to identify the individualsresponsible, it might continue &quot; spontaneously &quot;; and making theorder might merely aggravate it. Never the less, there was reasonto believe that public opinion would support a cooling-off period andwould, indeed, be critical of the value of the Act if it were not invokedin a rail strike, particularly if the unions acted precipitately. failure by ASLEF to comply with the order would tend to turn publicopinion against the railwaymen.As regards picketing it would be desirable to draw the attentionof the Police to the advice given by the Attorney General on criminal proceedings in the first part of CP (72) 32 and, perhaps, to supplementthis advice orally at the Chief Constables&apos; conference later that week.In Scotland it had been found that in practice the most successful results against picketing had been obtained by preferring charges ofa breach of the peace or mobbing and rioting. It would also bedesirable to make clear to the general public what action was, andwas not, permissible in the context of picketing under the new Act.Certain actions which the unions might take might be held not to bein furtherance of a trade dispute, in which case they might be a tort,in consequence of which damages might be payable. Alternatively,even if they were held to be in furtherance of a trade dispute, theymight be found to constitute an unfair practice under Section 96 ofthe new Act.
In discussion of the action which might be taken in order to mobilise public opinion it was agreed that it would be important toensure that, on this occasion, the unions were not allowed to presentunchallenged the most unfavourable view of their members&apos; wagesand conditions of service. The need for counter publicity might welloccur during the negotiations on 7-8 March. This would be amatter primarily for the BRB, who were in close touch with theDepartment of the Environment. It might be suggested to themthat they should, for example, make full use of the information aboutaverage earnings set out in paragraph 8 of Annex 1 to CP (72) 28and about the relationships between average increases in earningsfor railwaymen, miners and those engaged in manufacturing industry generally. Moreover, it would be essential to explain the outcome of the negotiations clearly to the public, whether in defence of theterms of any settlement or in condemnation of a strike, if one tookplace; and the necessary Government publicity should become-ordinated by the Lord President and the Minister for transport industries.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itmight be unlikely that a settlement could be reached with the railunions within a total cost conforming to the Government^ currentobjective of keeping public sector pay settlements below 8 per centbut that, on balance, it was desirable to secure a negotiated settlementif this were attainable at a defensible and reasonable level. TheCabinet considered that the most important element in such asettlement should be an increase in pay of the lowest paid railway workers, perhaps to provide a new basic minimum of  19 a week,with which there might be combined a minimum earnings guarantee of, say,  20 a week. The burdensome and responsible nature of theduties performed by the more highly paid railwaymen, for exampledrivers and signalmen, whose past differentials had been substantiallyeroded, might be recognised by providing some form of specialcompensation for their adverse working conditions or, if that werenot practicable, by some more direct recognition of their higherresponsibilities. The BRB should also consider whether it wouldpromote the readier acceptance by the unions of a reasonable pay&quot;settlement if they were to offer simultaneously some arrangement,the cost of which might be kept separate from the pay settlement to alleviate the impact of forthcoming redundancies. The cabinet agreed that the Chairman of BRB might be advised to take as hisobjective a negotiated settlement at a cost not exceeding 10 per cent of the wage bill and that, if the opportunity of reaching such asettlement were to occur during the negotiations on 7-8 March, heshould accept it. But, given the importance of gaining time in which to rebuild coal stocks and to prepare in other ways against thepossibility of a rail strike, it should be the Board&apos;s aim to avoid, ifpossible, any breakdown in the negotiations which might lead to early industrial action. In the event either of a breakdown or of asettlement, it would be essential that the offers made by the BRBshould be both publicly defensible and fair to the railwaymen.While the precise construction of the Board&apos;s offers and the manage-ment of the negotiations must be left to the Chairman, it should bemade clear to him that the negotiating limit of 10 per cent on the
wage bill should accommodate both the basic increase and anyspecial recognition for arduous hours and special responsibilitiessuch as the Cabinet had discussed and that the Government would think it undesirable for the basic element in the offer to approach10 per cent, in order to reduce the risk of establishing too high a figure at the opening of any subsequent arbitration or court of inquiry. If it proved impossible to negotiate a settlement on thebasis now authorised, the Cabinet would wish to review the matter again; but the Chairman of BRB should not be allowed to assume that they would necessarily consider any higher level of settlement acceptable.It would be essential for the Secretary of State for employment to be kept closely in touch with the course of the negotiations, inview of his responsibility for any conciliation action at a later stage.He should also be associated with any discussions between theMinister of Transport Industries and the BRB. The Cabinet agreedthat, in the event of early official strike action by the rail unions, theSecretary of State should seek a cooling-off order from the industrial court. They noted the need for information about unfair industrialpractices in the event of a strike to be made available very quicklyboth to those who might be in a position to bring proceedings andto the Law Officers. The Lord Chancellor, the Attorney Generaland the Lord Advocate should as soon as possible consider how thepublic might best be instructed about the legal position as regardspicketing under the Industrial Relations Act. The Home secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland should consider what furtheradvice could be given to the Police about picketing. The Minister for transport Industries should ensure that the Railways Board were ready to counter immediately any adverse publicity about wage rates or conditions of service put out by the unions during the course ofthe negotiations. He should also discuss with the Lord President how the outcome of the negotiations should be presented publicly,whether that outcome was a settlement or a strike. The contingency planning against a strike should continue as a matter of urgency; inparticular, the Cabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for Tradeand Industry might authorise the draft directives to industry for usein controlling the consumption of electricity in the event of a strike tobe sent to the regional offices of the Department of Trade andIndustry for completion in detail.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion. ,(2) Invited the Minister for Transport Industries to authorisethe Chairman of the British Railways Board to conduct the negotiations in accordance with the summing up andto ensure that the Board were ready to present their casepublicly in the most favourable light.(3) Invited the Lord President and the Minister for transport industries to consider further the public presentation ofthe outcome of the negotiations.
(4) Invited the Lord Chancellor, the Attorney General and theLord Advocate to consider ways and means of makingknown publicly the legal position in regard to picketing.(5) Invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland to consider what advice could be given to thePolice about picketing.(6) Invited the Ministers concerned to proceed urgently withcontingency planning against a rail strike.Cabinet Office,6 March, 1972.
