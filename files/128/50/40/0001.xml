Unless an earlierrecall became necessary, the House would reassemble on Tuesday17 October.OverseaAffairsMaltaPreviousReference :CM (72) 7thConclusions,Minute 6EgyptPreviousReference :CM (72) 38thConclusions,Minute 2SECRET2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary informed theCabinet that the Prime Minister of Malta, Mr. Dom Mintoff, had visited London on 27 and 28 July for discussions with himself andother Ministers. The general atmosphere of the meetings had beenfriendly; and, although Mr. Mintoff had laid great stress upon thedifficulties which Malta was facing as a result of our decision toallow the pound to float, he had been given no undertaking that wewere prepared to accept liability to make good such losses as the maltese Government might sustain. It had been agreed, however,that British officials should pay an early visit to Malta to discussexchange control and related financial matters.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the latestassessment of the extent of the Soviet withdrawal from Egyptsuggested that this might be on a larger scale than had at firstseemed probable. The situation was being kept under review; inparticular we were considering how far we might be able to take this opportunity to establish a position of greater influence in Egyptwithout inheriting the responsibility of the Soviet Government as herprincipal supplier of arms. He would shortly be presenting proposals to his colleagues.The Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.northern ireland previous reference :CM (72) 38thConclusionsMinute 3SECRET3. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that, followingtheir decision at their previous meeting that a military operation should be mounted on Monday 31 July, to reoccupy those areas inNorthern Ireland from which extremists sought to exclude thesecurity forces, he had agreed, after discussion with the ministers most directly concerned, that the Secretary of State for NorthernIreland should broadcast on Friday 28 July, a statement of the government&apos;s determination to restore the protection of the security forces to all sections of the community, coupled with an appeal forthe removal of barricades. It had also been agreed that the Secretaryof State should issue a warning on the evening of Sunday 30 July,that military operations were imminent and that innocent persons should, for their own safety, remain indoors. Thereafter, theoperation had been launched at 4.00 a.m. on Monday 31 July, andhad rapidly achieved a complete reoccupation of the areas concerned. There had been very few casualties, either to thesecurity forces or to civilians; but a single bomb explosion had occurred at Claudy, near Londonderry, which had resulted in six
deaths and a number of injuries. It had already proved possible toreintroduce patrolling by the Royal Ulster Constabulary in some ofthe areas previously dominated by extremists. The &quot; Provisional &quot;wing of the Irish Republican Army had offered very little resistance to the operation; but it must be expected that they would continueto mount guerilla attacks. Heads of friendly Governments, includingthe Prime Minister of the Irish Republic, Mr. Lynch, had shown asatisfactory understanding of the reasons which had led the Govern-ment to decide upon this military operation. The Cabinet would wish to congratulate the General Officer Commanding, NorthernIreland, and the forces under his command upon the successfulexecution of the operation with so few casualties.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to convey to theGeneral Officer Commanding, Northern Ireland, and theforces under his command their congratulations upon thesuccessful execution of the operations conducted onMonday 31 July.secret. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he had circulated a Note (CP (72) 84) describing new arrangements to ensuregreater efficiency in planning for, and dealing with, civil emergencieswhether they were occasioned by industrial action or were the resultof major accidents or national disasters. These arrangementsincluded a comprehensive review of the long-term contingency planning which Departments already had in train and the further steps which might usefully be taken to counter other foreseeablecivil emergencies. A Committee of Ministers under his chairmanshipwould be established to consider major issues of industrial policywhich were liable to develop in an emergency; and a group of senior officials of the Departments principally concerned, under the chair-manship of the Lord Privy Seal, would be responsible for co-ordin-ating the action required to ensure an effective response to specificemergencies.The Secretary of State, for Employment said that Lord Aldington,the Chairman of the Port of London Authority, and Mr. Jack Jones,the General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union,whom he would be meeting again later that day, were continuing their efforts to promote acceptance of the recommendations in the interim Report of their Joint Special Committee on the ports industry.Lord Aldington had made it clear that the employers were ready toproceed with both the recommendations in the Interim Report andthe review of job opportunities for dock workers and the other tasksplanned for the second &quot;phase of the Committee&apos;s work. LordAldington would be likely to raise with him the question of theposition of the non-Scheme ports in the present situation in theindustry, although it was unlikely that he would be seeking any government commitment on the matter at this stage. It was too soon to forecast when Mr. Jones might judge the time opportune
to reconvene the Docks Delegate Conference, since he would wishto be reasonably certain in advance that on this occasion he wouldbe able to secure acceptance of the Joint Committee&apos;s report.Although this might be possible after about ten days, it would be wise to plan on the assumption that the dock strike might last for another three weeks. One of the main problems in the meantimewould be to try to ensure that the task of the Joint Committeewould not be made more difficult by the bankruptcy of furtherport employers, particularly at London and Liverpool. The JointCommittee had accepted that cross-subsidisation between companieswithin the industry was an essential part of their proposals; and itmight become difficult for the Government to avoid becoming involved in this plan if the numbers of unemployed dockers tobe reallocated to the remaining firms increased sharply.The Lord Privy Seal said that a review of the situation on theprevious day had shown that there was not, as yet, any substantiveneed for the Proclamation of a State of Emergency that week,although the supply of animal foodstuffs was giving some cause for concern. Emergency Powers would admittedly enable thePort Emergency Committees to be set up in readiness. But therewas little in the way of practical measures which could be donein advance of the introduction of troops to distribute essential supplies; and the need to conserve food stocks was not likely to warrant action of this kind before the following week.On the other hand, public opinion now expected the Governmentto take early action in relation to the dock strike, especially sinceEmergency Powers had been taken after only three days duringthe 1970 strike. Moreover, such Powers would need to be confirmed by Affirmative Resolutions of both Houses of Parliament withinseven days of the laying of the Regulations, if they were to continue in force thereafter. If, therefore, the Powers were not taken duringthe current week, Parliament might have to be recalled in order topass the Resolutions. The Proclamation of a State of Emergencymight not, in itself, be regarded by the dockers as provocative;but there was some risk that, if the Proclamation were madejust before the resumed Docks Delegate Conference, militantelements would seize the opportunity to inflame feeling againstacceptance of the report of the Joint Committee. Lord Aldingtonwas particularly concerned that the Government should avoid creating the impression that they had given up hope of securingacceptance of the Joint Committee&apos;s recommendations. On balance,therefore, it seemed desirable to recommend the Proclamation ofa State of Emergency either on the following day or later that week, and in either case as far in advance as possible of the DocksDelegate Conference. Provisional arrangements had been made fora Privy Council accordingly. The contingency plans for theemployment of Servicemen to unload and distribute essential supplies required seven days&apos; notice before the troops could be fully deployed;but a proportion could be made available after three days. IfServicemen were used, however, the attitude of the dockers mightharden; and there was a risk of sympathetic action by lorry driversand others.
In discussion it was agreed that it would be important to avoid any action which might make it more difficult for the Joint Com-mittee to secure acceptance of their proposals by the dockers. Onthe other hand, a shortage of animal feeding stuffs was beginning to develop and might become acute in some areas by the weekend.The situation in this respect was more serious on this occasion than during the 1970 dock strike, partly because this year&apos;s harvest waslate and partly because the smaller ports, through which stocks hadbeen imported on the earlier occasion, had now been closed by intimidation-dation from dockers at the major ports.In further discussion considerable concern was expressed aboutthe opening of 13 additional offices in dock areas for the payment of social security benefit to dockers&apos; families. This had already given rise to adverse comment on the grounds that strikers shouldnot be entitled to special facilities of this kind. On the other hand the Government were under a statutory obligation to provide staff to enable the Supplementary Benefits Commission to discharge their duties in such circumstances; and the additional offices were required primarily in order to ensure that the existing offices remainedable to cater for the needs of the normal recipients of supplementary benefit, especially the elderly and the infirm. Twelve further officeswould therefore need to be opened in due course.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed to defer a decision on the Proclamation of a Stateof Emergency until they knew the outcome of Lord Aldington^forthcoming meeting with the port employers. The ministers concerned should therefore consider the position again on thefollowing day, when the Minister of Agriculture should report further on the shortage of animal feeding stuffs.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.housing finance ActPreviousReference:CM (72) 33rdConclusionsMinute 5SECRET5. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the steps whichshould be taken if some local authorities failed to implement thehousing finance legislation. They had before them memoranda by theSecretary of State for the Environment and the Secretary of Statefor Wales, reviewing the present position in England and Wales(CP (72) 83) and providing an assessment of the impact of the rent increases (CP (72) 78).The Secretary of State for the Environment said that, while thesituation was still uncertain, there were signs that the measures taken to present the Governments policy effectively were beginning to have the desired effect. The representatives of Labour groups in local authorities who had met at Transport House on 8 July, hadrefrained from resolving to refuse to implement the legislation. Anumber of local authorities would probably be satisfied to obtainhis agreement to their making increases of an average of less than 1 a week in October under Section 62(4) of the Act. Most of the
local authorities who had been contemplating defying the Act wouldprobably not finally make up their minds immediately. A fewsmaller authorities, however, might have committed themselves sofar that a substantial measure of defiance on their part might be inevitable. The Government should therefore continue to present their policy on the lines agreed by the Cabinet on 29 June. Planshad now been made for a national Press and television campaign,starting in September, in order to publicise the rebates and allow-ances which would become available to tenants for the first time. he expected to be in a position to identify towards the end of Augustthose authorities who would probably refuse to implement the Act;and he would then bring before the Cabinet proposals for dealingwith the situation.The Cabinet were informed that a broadly similar situationexisted in Scotland in relation to the Housing (Financial Provisions)(Scotland) Act. The relevant provisions of that Act would comeinto force on 3 August; and the reaction of the local authorities inthe course of the month of August would be closely watched. in wales the number of authorities who had given formal notice thatthey would not implement the Act had risen from three to four,leaving 21 still undecided.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the effective presentation of the Govern-menfs policy in relation to the two Acts must be sustained. the secretaries of State for Scotland, for the Environment and for wales should report to the Cabinet early in September on thearrangements being made by local authorities for the implementionof these Acts and on the steps which might be considered fordealing with any authorities who remained recalcitrant.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion  by  the  Prime   Minister   and  invited  the secretaries of State for Scotland, for the Environment andfor Wales to be guided accordingly.Cabinet office August, 1972.
