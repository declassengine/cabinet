secret oversea 2.   The Prime Minister said that, following the visits of the affairs Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and of officials earlierJapan in the year, he had himself visited Japan from 16-19 September.Previous He had been impressed by the size and strength of the JapaneseReference: economy, which now placed Japan effectively at the centre of cm (72) 34th international monetary and commercial affairs. At the same time,Conclusions, Japan was assuming a more important political role in the PacificMinute 3 area. It was clear that the Government recently formed byMr. Tanaka would work to develop closer relations with China andwould gradually reduce Japanese links with Taiwan. With properencouragement Japan could be helpful to us both economically and politically. Despite the natural concern of the Japanese authorities that the economic benefits of hard work and sound managementshould not be lost, there were signs of a willingness to develop more reasonable export policies. The Japanese Government hoped tomaintain their recent high rate of growth of 10-11 per cent perannum. But they were interested in acquiring advanced technology;and they were ready to co-operate more closely with us in establish-ing new marketing systems. There was great potential for a majoreffort to increase our trade with Japan. The going might at first be hard in the light of language difficulties and differences oftechniques; but an urgent and careful study of the means of over-coming such obstacles should now be put in hand. The rewardscould be very important indeed.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister.Uganda The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thePrevious        problem caused by the demand of the President of Uganda, general reference:      Amin, that all United Kingdom passport holders (UKPH) shouldCM (72) 4lst   leave the country within 90 days had been aggravated by the reportedConclusions    invasion of Ugandan  territory by some  500-1,000 dissidentUgandans from Tanzania and by the attempt, so far frustrated bythe Sudanese Government, of the President of Libya to send forces to Uganda in support of General Amin&apos;s regime.  The insurgentshad apparently now returned to Tanzania. But it was still possiblethat some Libyan troops would succeed in reaching Uganda; and,although they would not amount to a significant military force, their presence would undoubtedly aggravate an already tense situation.The release and return to this country of the representatives of theBritish Press who had been arrested in Uganda would lead to theParliamentary 1. The Cabinet tendered warm congratulations to the LordAffairs Privy Seal on the completion, without amendment, of the last stages of the European Communities Bill in the House of Lords. TheBill now awaited Royal Assent; and its enactment would representa signal success for the Governmenfs European policies.
publication of reports which would be bound to increase anxiety forthe safety of the remaining British &quot; belongers&quot; in Uganda. Thesenumbered some 7,000; and it was difficult to judge what advice theyshould be given. The United Kingdom High Commissioner, sup-ported by such responsible Ugandan opinion as was available, had so far taken the view that to urge them to leave would be regarded by General Amin as a provocative action and would thereforeheighten the dangers to which they were exposed. Moreover, itwould be difficult in both physical and political terms to arrangefor the early evacuation of the United Kingdom community. Anyovert preparations to move them, even by civil transport, could easily provoke the regime to take action against them; and it would create an unfortunate impression if they were given priority intransportation over the Asian UKPH. The United States authorities were known to be concerned for their citizens in Uganda; and it wasto be hoped that some joint arrangement could be made for bothUnited Kingdom expatriate and United States citizens to be evacuated in case of need. In preparation for this eventuality itmight be desirable that the Prime Minister should send a personal message to General Amin, informing him that in view of the sensitiveconditions in the area we intended to advise those of our&quot; belongers &quot; who could leave to do so. But it would be essentialto emphasise that this action was not a preliminary to some military operation against General Amin of the kind which he was accusingus of preparing. In order that the best possible assessment of thelocal situation should be available in London it might be advisable to send a senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office official toKampala for a few days; and this would also provide an opportunityto ensure that the United Kingdom High Commissioner was fully aware of the current views of Ministers.As regards the prospects of finding alternative destinations forthe Asian UKPH the result of recent diplomatic action was encouragement-aging. Several countries, both within the Commonwealth and outside it, had agreed to accept numbers of these individuals. Inparticular, the Government of India had agreed to admit 10,000-15,000 on the understanding that we would remain ready to accept them in the United Kingdom if this subsequently proved to be theirwish; but a large proportion would probably prefer to remain inIndia indefinitely.The Home Secretary and Lord President of the Council saidthat this measure of international support had significantly eased theproblems of reception and resettlement of the Asian UKPH in thiscountry. It now seemed probable that no more than 20,000-30,000would be involved in the first instance. The Resettlement board which had been created to deal with this problem seemed to be working satisfactorily; local authorities had responded favourablyto the Governmenfs willingness to provide them with additionalfinancial assistance where necessary; and the public now seemeddisposed to accept the Asian UKPH as genuine refugees. Theirmovement from Uganda had so far been relatively slow, partly because it had been thought best not to encourage them to leave
until it became possible to offer them a range of options on thedestinations open to them; but they would now be urged to travelas soon as their formalities were completed in order to anticipatecongestion at the last moment.In discussion it was agreed that the likely effect of a message from the Prime Minister to General Amin about the safety ofUnited Kingdom &quot; belongers&quot; needed careful consideration, since in the present tense situation these British subjects, who were widelydispersed throughout Uganda, could easily become targets forhostile action. If it were decided to attempt to evacuate them, thisshould be arranged without the use of force, if possible. Themeasure of international assistance which had been mobilised bydiplomatic action was encouraging; and it would be advisable thatthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should propose, in his speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations in the follow-ing week, a resolution calling upon the Government of Uganda toextend the time limit for the departure of the Asian UKPH onhumanitarian grounds and to facilitate the transfer of their assets.The Cabinet (2) Took note, with approval, of the statements by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Home secretary and Lord President of the Council.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that no reportsof the harassment of our trawlers by Icelandic vessels had beenreceived within the past week. But it remained important that weshould do everything we could to reach an interim agreement withthe Government of Iceland for the period until the United nations conference on the Law of the Sea took place in 1973, since, evenif it proved possible to afford naval protection for our trawlers, theircatch could not be expected to amount to more than some 40 percent of the current rate. He had accordingly attempted, with thefull co-operation of the Government of the Federal german republic, whose problems were comparable to ours, to arrange fortripartite discussions to be held in Bonn. The Icelandic Government,however, had refused an invitation to participate, preferring thatthe discussions should continue on a bilateral basis. The german authorities, for their part, would not be in a position to continue their own bilateral exchanges for some weeks; meanwhile, it wouldprobably be possible to arrange for further Anglo-Icelandic discus-sions at the official level. The prospects for the conclusion of asatisfactory agreement, however, remained slight; and we might wellbe obliged to provide naval protection despite the known difficulties and disadvantages of such a course.The Secretary of State for Defence said that the difficulty ofproviding naval protection at an early date would be aggravated by the industrial action in the Royal Dockyards, which was resulting in a progressive reduction in the number of frigates available for duty at sea.SECRETIcelandPreviousReference:CM (72) 36thConclusions,Minute 2
BahamasMiddle east previous reference:CM (72) 39thConclusions,Minute 2The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that theleaders of the trawler industry had adopted an understandingattitude towards the Governmenfs difficulties, the more so since they were in fact landing very satisfactory quantities of fish.The Cabinet (3) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary, the Secretary of State for Defence andthe Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theParliamentary Elections in the Bahamas had been won easily by the progressive Liberal Party led by Mr. Pindling. This victory appearedto have removed possible causes of disturbance in the islands.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that variousArab leaders had made it clear during recent visits to London thatthey would like to see us play a more active part in the Arab world.In particular, the new Egyptian Foreign Minister, Dr. Zayyat, had said that his Government intended that the withdrawal of the Sovietpersonnel from Egypt should be complete and that he hoped thatthe Western Europeans would take their place. In so far as these developments were relevant to the supply of arms he had toldDr. Zayyat that we were not prepared to sell offensive weapons which might significantly disturb the balance of military power inthe area. But the Egyptian Government were interested in acquiringother arms also; and it ought to be possible for us to deriveconsiderable advantage from this business.The Cabinet (4) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.northern ireland previous reference:CM (72) 39thConclusions,Minute 3SECRET3. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland informed theCabinet that, although casualties among our own troops remainedregrettably high, our various measures to erode the strength of theIrish Republican Army (IRA) were continuing to meet with signifi-cant success. But we continued to face a formidable problem asregards those individuals whom we still held in internment or in detention. In terms of security we could afford to release only someof these; but it was becoming increasingly questionable whether wecould detain individuals indefinitely without bringing them to trialin some sense. We faced an equally serious problem as regardsthose members of the IRA who were still at large, since, although we were morally certain in many cases that they were guilty ofperpetrating or organising outrages against our troops, it wouldoften be impossible to disclose in any normal court of law theevidence which we obtained through intelligence sources to justify our contention. In these circumstances only three courses of action were open to us. We could simply accept the situation and take nofurther steps to apprehend these individuals.  But, if we adopted
this attitude, it would be clear that we had given up hope of defeatingthe IRA; and the impact on the morale of the security forces inNorthern Ireland would be disastrous. Alternatively, we couldrevert to a policy of internment. If so, however, our action wouldbe regarded as a retrograde step; it would probably cost us thebipartisan support for our policies on which we had hitherto reliedin the Parliament at Westminster; and it would represent a severesetback, both in Northern Ireland itself and in the wider inter-national context, to our hopes of making further progress towards an ultimate political solution. The Ministers immediately concerned,after reviewing the situation under the Prime Ministers chairman-ship, had therefore concluded that we must adopt the only remain-ing course of action by instituting in Northern Ireland some kindof quasi-judicial procedure by means of which the individuals whom we detained might be examined in conditions approximating tothose of a trial, even though much of the hearings would have tobe conducted in camera and it would not be possible in many cases to reveal the sources of evidence. The least objectionable form ofsuch a procedure appeared to be an administrative tribunal, someof whose members should be drawn from the legal profession ifpossible; and, in defending this procedure, we should emphasise that it represented only an interim measure, pending a thoroughreview of the extent to which the law dealing with emergencies inNorthern Ireland might be amended in such a way as to removeits more objectionable features for the future. A review of thiskind should help to anticipate the inevitable criticism that admin-istrative tribunals of the kind proposed would differ little in reality from internment; and it might also be helpful in persuading the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) to modify thedecision, which they had hitherto consistently maintained, that theywould not attend the constitutional discussions to be held in thefollowing week unless the British Government brought internmentto an end. There could be no assurance, however, that the SDLPwould in fact change their attitude; and it appeared certain that the protestant faction, led by Mr. Paisley, mp, would maintain their refusal to attend the discussions on the ground that the BritishGovernment had rejected an inquiry into the circumstances in which certain Protestants had been shot during a recent incident in Belfast.There was therefore little prospect that the discussions would produce any positive result.The decision to refuse the inquiry for which Mr. Paisley had pressed had clearly been right; and it had been necessary to adoptan equally firm attitude towards the threat by the extremistProtestant group, the Loyalist Association of Workers, to interruptpower supplies unless the British Government withdrew the para-troops. As a result the threat of industrial action in the power stations had subsided. But renewed outbreaks of Protestantextremism might be expected when some of the Protestants recentlyapprehended by the security forces were brought before the courts;and we could not exclude the possibility that it might become necessary to legislate in order to enable judges to sit without juriesin certain cases.
The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for northern Ireland and authorised him to announce theestablishment of administrative tribunals on the basis whichhe had proposed.IndustrialAffairsMeetingswith theConfederationof BritishIndustry andthe TradesUnionCongressPreviousReference:CM (72) 40thConclusions,Minute pay ofIndustrialCivil ServicePreviousReference:CM (72) 40thConclusions,Minute 3CONFIDENTIAL4. The Prime Minister said that the tripartite meeting withrepresentatives of the Confederation of British Industry and theTrades Union Congress (TUC) on 14 September had been conducted in a more cordial and co-operative spirit than some of the earlierexchanges; and some progress had been made. In particular, the tuc representatives had not referred to the possibility of repealingor amending the Industrial Relations Act; and it had been agreedthat further work should now be concentrated on methods by whichthe pay of low-paid workers could be improved without entailingproportional increases to other workers. The TUC representatives had also pressed for a corresponding improvement in the positionof pensions. The next tripartite meeting on 26 September would be devoted to more detailed consideration of these problems within the framework of proposals that assistance to the low-paid should bebased on a uniform fiat-rate cash pay increase for all workers duringthe coming year. The most difficult problem would be to ensurethat the amount of this increase would not be beyond the capacityof the economy to sustain.The Lord Privy Seal said that the most recent efforts to persuade the industrial Civil Service unions to agree that their pay claim should be submitted to arbitration had so far been unsuccessful inthe face of opposition by the Amalgamated Union of EngineeringWorkers and the Electrical, Electronic and TelecommunicationUnion, despite the agreement in principle of the other unions concerned. Although industrial action in general remained local and sporadic, there was increasing concern about its impact on important defence services. It might be desirable, in the light ofthe outcome of further meetings to be held shortly, to review the government&apos;s position in relation to the negotiations.The Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister and theLord Privy Seal.SECRETPublic 5.  The Cabinet had a brief discussion of the state of public security security in the light of the terrorist outrage during the OlympicGames at Munich, the recent attempts on the lives of members ofthe Israeli Embassy in London by Arab extremists and the growingconcern which was being expressed as a result by members offoreign Missions in the metropolis.
The Home Secretary said that, in consultation with the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, he had recently reviewed the state ofour precautions against activities of this kind and would be sub-mitting certain proposals to the Prime Minister.
