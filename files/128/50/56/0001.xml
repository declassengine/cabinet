Coal PolicyPreviousReference:CM (72) 11thConclusions,Minute 3The Cabinet considered a Note by the Secretary of State for trade and Industry (CP (72) 135), to which was annexed a draft parliamentary Statement about the Governmenfs proposals for support of the coal industry.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that sincethe Cabinet&apos;s last discussion of the problems of the coal industry on 2 March (CM (72) 11th Conclusions, Minute 3) the ministerial committee on Economic Strategy had reviewed the options open tothe Government to moderate the contraction of the industry, toreduce hardship for redundant miners and to maintain supplies ofcoal at a level adequate to meet future uncertainties. They had approved proposals to cancel about  475 million of the debt owedto the Exchequer by the National Coal Board (NCB) and to makerecurrent grants of about  170 million a year over a three-year period,of which the most important were a regional grant of  70 million ayear, redundancy payments of about  30 million a year, and com-pensation (the amount of which was still to be agreed between himself and the Chancellor of the Exchequer) to the electricity generating Boards for burning surplus coal. The Committee had agreed that legislation should now be introduced to give effect tothese proposals; and a draft Bill would be ready for introductionlater that week, in order that it might be given its Second Readingbefore the Christmas Recess. The Committee had also agreed thathe should make a statement in Parliament when the Bill was introduced.These proposals offered the best prospect of mobilising thesupport of moderate opinion within the industry; and they wereconsistent with the hypothesis that continued investment in the coalindustry would remain essential in order to maintain our domesticresources of fuel against a growing world shortage. These argumentsshould be acceptable in principle to the Governmenfs supporters inParliament; and in order to anticipate the objection that the proposals might seem over-generous the statement had been so drafted as toemphasise the importance of the industry&apos;s own contribution to areduction in costs and an increase in productivity.In discussion it was suggested that the proposals might be criticised on the grounds that the very large amounts now proposed for the support of the coal industry must be added to the sumspreviously spent on writing off the industry&apos;s capital debt and fundinga redundancy scheme whose terms could be regarded as extremelygenerous. Moreover, further redundancy was unlikely to releasemen of an age to contribute to the expansion of the national economyby taking new jobs; whereas even a small part of the total amountby which it was now proposed to subsidise the industry might beput to better use in furthering other policies, particularly in the field of the social services. Finally, the argument for supporting the coalindustry as an insurance against future shortages of energy suggestedthat at the present time the rate of new investment should berestrained. On the other hand, it could be argued that the proposed
annual grants, even at the rate of  1-25 a ton, represented a more modest degree of support than was provided in France, Belgium orHolland; and the rate of subsidy per worker was much less than thecost of creating new jobs in assisted areas. The viability of the coalindustry, which offered only limited scope for mechanisation,ultimately depended on the continued existence of the workforce.Although some new investment might be deferred, e.g. the openingof new pits in the profitable areas of the Midlands coalfields,economic pits must be kept in operation; and experience in thecoal strike earlier that year had shown the danger and difficulty ofreactivating mines where work had ceased. The impending shortageof world energy supplies, particularly in oil, must not be underrated.Some producing countries were already limiting their supplies; andthe problem would be exacerbated in the early 1980s when the UnitedStates was likely to be a competitor for fuel in world markets. Theexisting redundancy scheme had halved the industry&apos;s workforce andhad exhausted the relatively simple options for economies. Largelyfor this reason there had now been no pit closures for 2\ years;and the size of the redundancy now expected, although consider-ably smaller than purely economic considerations might indicate,would amount to some 65,000 job losses and 30,000 actual redundancies-dancies by March, 1975. In Scotland a third of the workforcewould become redundant; and, although the exploitation of oil and gas fields would offer some alleviation, it would not compensate for all the job losses from coal.The social aspects of a further run-down of the industry werenext discussed. It was suggested that mining communities presented a unique problem, whose social fabric had for generations beendictated by a single industry. All too often in the next few years the closure of pits would be liable to be accompanied by large-scaleredundancies in neighbouring industries, particularly steel and ship-building. The redundancy provisions already included inducementsto miners to move to new work; but the closures now envisagedwere likely to affect whole areas rather than individual pits. Toencourage the migration of young manpower and to leave only the older workers behind would lead inevitably to the decay of com-munities. On the other hand the provision of generous redundancypay should not be allowed to breed in such communities the atmosphere of the pre-war depression. It should be combined withan imaginative presentation in order to encourage a readiness amongindividuals to seek new work and among communities to enhancetheir environment. Those who would be made redundant constituted a resource of labour for which useful employment, perhaps in thesocial services, should be found. The Secretaries of State for the environment and for Trade and Industry had been discussing thepossibility of using the powers already available to them in order toestablish task forces to regenerate areas whose way of life wasthreatened by closures; and they would welcome the assistance oftheir colleagues in evolving a comprehensive approach to these problems
In further discussion the following points were made (a) About 70 per cent of the nation&apos;s electrical power was stillderived from coal. The Central Electricity Generating Board were considering the use of other fuels; and it was desirable in principlethat this excessive dependence on coal should be reduced. On theother hand the conversion of power stations to dual firing was verycostly; and in such cases the Board would wish to use the cheaperfuel in order to obtain the best economic return. In presentcircumstances this would reduce the amount of coal burnt and might increase the demand for support from the coal industry.(b) The existing redundancy terms for coal miners providedfor a lump sum to be paid to those up to the age of 60 and there-after for the award of a discretionary pension of  1-50 a weekRedundant miners could also be paid up to 90 per cent of their earnings for the first three years of redundancy, after which their income would revert to the level appropriate under supplementary benefit. The terms now proposed (which would apply retrospectivelyfrom the date of the bill&apos;s introduction) did not envisage increasingthe net amount of these benefits; but they would provide for areduction of the qualifying age for pension to 55 and the award ofpension as of right rather than at discretion. These proposals were still considerably less than the mineworkers&apos; unions had demanded;and comparable benefits in the countries of the European economic community (e.c.) were more generous.(c) Workers receiving generous redundancy payments were oftenunwilling to take alternative work; and miners had been known torefuse jobs earning  20- 25 in favour of retaining their redundancypay. Under existing legislation unemployment benefit could not be withheld because a redundant worker was unwilling to change jobs.Means of remedying this anomaly should be explored; and, mean-while, some limitation should be imposed on the recruitment ofworkers from overseas to fill jobs which could be occupied by united Kingdom citizens.(d) The Bill should be introduced as soon as possible in thefollowing week if it was to receive its Second Reading before the recess. Although the terms for redundancy had still to be decided in detail, the Financial and Explanatory Memorandum accompany-ing the Bill would necessarily indicate the upper limit proposed both for redundancy payments and for other measures of assistance to theindustry. In order to avoid misinterpretation of these amounts itwas desirable that an appropriate Government statement should bemade before the Bill was published. The questioii of publicity forthe Governmenfs proposals in the regions should also be considered,particularly in those areas where public attention would be liableto concentrate on the prospect of further pit closures.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the government&apos;s supporters would not easily be convinced of the merits of providing so large a measure of further support for the coalindustry, particularly in the light of the pay increases obtained bythe mining unions earlier in the year. The Cabinet recognised the
need to make provision for a viable coal industry, particularly againstthe prospect of worldwide shortages of energy in the followingdecade; and they appreciated that following the run-down in theindustry in previous years further large-scale redundancies andclosures would merit substantial measures of alleviation. None theless they would wish to examine further the detailed redundancyproposals in the light of the discussions with the industry which wereenvisaged. They would also wish to consider in due course thesuggestion for establishing task forces to regenerate areas affectedby closures. The public presentation of the Governmenfs proposals would require careful attention; and the extent to which they bothreflected practice in the e.c. and would attract financial support from Community funds should be particularly emphasised. TheHome Secretary should co-ordinate with the Secretary of State for trade and Industry and other Ministers concerned arrangementsfor the public presentation of the Governmenfs proposals. TheSecretary of State should discuss further with the Lord President thequestion of a statement in Parliament when the Bill was presented,and circulate a revised draft of the statement to the Cabinet at their next meeting.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals in CP (72) 135 for the cancellation of part of the National Coal Board&apos;s debt to the Exchequer and the provision of annual grants tothe coal industry.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (i) in consultation with the Lord President, to arrangefor early introduction of the legislation to give effect to theseproposals;(ii) in consultation with the Home Secretary and the lord president, to consider the content and timing of the Parlia-mentary statement which was to accompany the introductionof the legislation and to circulate a further draft to the cabinet before their next meeting;(iii) to circulate to the Cabinet detailed proposals onredundancy payments to mineworkers;(iv) in consultation with the Secretaries of State for social services, Education and Science, the Environment, Scotland andWales and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to consider measures torehabilitate areas affected by the run-down in the coal and steel industries and to circulate proposals to the Ministerial Com-mittee on Regional Policy and the Environment.(3) Invited the Home Secretary-(i) in consultation with the Lord President of the Counciland the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland,Trade and Industry and Wales to co-ordinate arrangements forthe public presentation of the Governmenfs decision on support for the coal industry;
(ii) to arrange for a review of the present arrangementsfor granting work permits with a view to limiting the scope forfirms to recruit from overseas to fill vacancies for which labourreserves already existed in the United Kingdom.Cabinet Office,5 December, 1972.
