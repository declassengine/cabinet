The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.They also considered the arrangements for debating theEuropean Communities Bill, which had been published on theprevious day.SECRETRhodesiaPreviousReference :CM (72) 3rdConclusions,Minute 2Oversea 2.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary referred toAffairs persistent rumours that the Government of Guatemala were british planning shortly to invade British Honduras.  For many years theyHonduras       had been pressing their claim to the territory of British Honduras;and we had been trying to solve this problem within the context of granting independence to the colony. Although we had no clearconfirmation of Guatemalan intentions, steps were being taken to reinforce our troops in British Honduras as a precaution. It was hoped that these moves, together with diplomatic action wouldpersuade the Government of Guatemala to refrain from provocativeaction.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the debate on Rhodesia in the House of Commons on 26 January had been not unsatisfactory. The Government would continue to be embarrassed,however, by the detention of the former Rhodesian Prime Minister,Mr. Garfield Todd, by the Rhodesian authorities. It seemed probable that Mr. Smith, the Rhodesian leader, had taken this actionbecause he believed Mr. Todd to be a focus for the type of disaffectionwhich had recently found expression during the Test of Acceptabilityof the constitutional settlement. Despite the disturbances which had attended the Test, however, the Chairman of the Commissionresponsible for conducting it, Lord Pearce, had decided that thesituation had now been sufficiently brought under control to justifythe Commission in continuing with their task; and this was clearlyright.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary. /Bangla Desh The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thePrevious Government of Bangla Desh now fulfilled practically all our normalReference: criteria for recognitidn. In particular, the Indian Army had begun toCM (72) 3rd leave; and those elements which remained did so at the request of theConclusions, Prime Minister of Bangla Desh, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. PresidentMinute 2 Bhutto of Pakistan, however, was still trying to establish someconstitutional link between West Pakistan and Bangla Desh, despite149569-4a 2
the fact that this proposal had been rejected by Sheikh Mujibur. Hehad asked for further time to pursue this objective before BanglaDesh was accorded recognition; and he had broken off diplomatic relations with some Governments who had already taken this step.It had to be accepted, therefore, that, if we now recognised BanglaDesh, President Bhutto might sever diplomatic relations with us and,perhaps, withdraw from the Commonwealth as well. In the hope ofestablishing reasonable relations between West Pakistan and BanglaDesh, we had suggested to Sheikh Mujibur that he should offer tomeet President Bhutto, possibly in London. But, whatever the outcome, we could not delay recognition of Bangla Desh much longer. Provided that we acted in concert with a reasonable numberof other Governments (which would probably include those ofCanada, Australia, New Zealand and some countries of western europe, including France) we should be prepared to make the act of recognition on or about 4 February.In the course of a short discussion it was agreed that the UnitedKingdom could not expect to exercise much influence with PresidentBhutto through the provision cof aid; the German and JapaneseGovernments were Pakistani main aid donors. It would benecessary to try to develop a European approach to the problems of aid and reconstruction as regards Bangla Desh.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary and approved his proposals on the recognition of Bangla Desh.Sharjah The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the Rulerof Sharjah, Sheikh Khalid bin Mohammed, had been assassinatedas a result of a family feud. The reaction of the Union Defence force against the assassins had been swift and decisive; and Sheikh Khalid&apos;sbrother Sultan bin Mohammed, had succeeded to the throne.The Cabinet (3) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.secret. The Secretary of State for Defence said that he was shortlyvisiting Rome for what he hoped would be the final ssession of negotiations with the Maltese Prime Minister, Mr. Mintoff, about anew Defence Agreement between the United Kingdom and Malta.The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) appeared to beadhering to their offer of  14 million for a financial settlement.

under pressure from our NATO allies to modify those conditions:and, if so, it might be for consideration whether we should suggest to NATO that the Organisation should take over the responsibilityfor negotiating a new Agreement, to which we would contribute no more than our fair share on normal NATO principles.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Secretaryof State for Defence.IndustrialAffairsCoalminers&apos;StrikePreviousReference:CM (72) 3rdConclusions,Minute 3SECRET*4. The Secretary of State for Employment said that he had now held separate meetings with the National Coal Board (NCB)and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), as agreed by theCabinet at their last meeting, in order to explore the possibility of resolving the strike in the coalmining industry. Neither party to thedispute, however, had shown any disposition to compromise. TheNCB had maintained a firm attitude towards the strike and werein no mind to propose major concessions to the mineworkers. Theleaders of the NUM had said that neither a court of inquiry norany other independent means of settling the dispute would be acceptable to them; that they would not be prepared to pledgethemselves to accept the findings of such an inquiry or to call off thestrike if one were appointed; and that they would not resume negotiations without a prior assurance that an increased pay offer would be made. This intransigent attitude on the part of the NUMExecutive reflected the strong feeling among many miners that theyhad steadily lost ground by comparison with workers in other occupations over many years; and it was, indeed, true that the ending of piece-work in the industry had left the more highly paid face-workers with lower earnings today than they had enjoyed 10 yearspreviously. Some miners therefore argued that they would preferadditional collieries to be closed and the industry to be furthercontracted, but more highly paid, than to continue as at present.The clear division within the NUM Executive between the militantfaction, led by the General Secretary, Mr. Daly, and the more moderate faction, led by the President, Mr. Gormley, increased thedifficulty of promoting new negotiations; in particular, Mr. Gormleywould probably be concerned to avoid a further rebuff such as he had suffered when his Executive rejected his advice that they should accept the NCB&apos;s latest pay offer. Nevertheless, it was clear that inthe course of the next three to four weeks the effects of the strike would become increasingly serious. An initiative to conciliate might therefore have the best chance of succeeding if it was taken towardsthe end of the following week, since by that juncture the miners mightbe more disposed to contemplate moves to settle the dispute while themore serious effects of the strike on supplies for industry and thepublic should not yet have fully manifested themselves. Moreover, ifthe pay negotiations in the electricity supply industry that day led toa settlement on the lines of that which had been achieved earlier* Previously circulated in a Confidential Annex.
in the week in the gas industry, the miners would be in a moreisolated position. Any solution to the dispute, however, would depend largely on the ability of the NCB to make any new proposalappear significantly different from the earlier offers; and considera-tion was already being given, therefore, to the form of a possiblenew proposal which, though not exceeding in total value the latestoffer made by the NCB, might appear sufficiently attractive to induce the NUM Executive to submit it to their membership. This mightentail conceding higher immediate cash benefits in return for a pay agreement which would last for more than 12 months, an arrange-ment which would have the incidental advantage of changing thenormal autumn date of negotiations to the spring or summer, whenthe NUM&apos;s bargaining position would normally be weaker.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that it was now likely that the first major impact of the strike would be felt at the power stations. The picketing of coal-fired power stations in order toimpede the delivery of other materials essential to their operation,such as lighting-up oil, had been effective; and total generating outputhad been reduced. Although the scale and imminence of possibleload-shedding was difficult to assess, some power cuts might become necessary within days; and their severity would increase in thefollowing week, particularly if a breakdown of the electricity pay negotiations resulted in the overtime ban already threatened by theelectricity unions or a withdrawal of their co-operation. The Govern-ment might then be obliged to invoke emergency powers; and theuse of such powers to restrict electricity supplies would in any eventneed to be further considered towards the end of the following weekif power station coal stocks were to be made to outlast a miners&apos;strike which might extend for several weeks beyond that. It would benecessary, however, to consider carefully the timing of anyimplementation of emergency powers. If they were invoked beforethe Secretary of State for Employment had sought to conciliate inthe dispute, the miners might conclude that they were prevailingagainst the Government and could afford to continue to beintransigent. Were the attempt at conciliation to fail, however, theuse of emergency powers would then be both necessary and more clearly justified; and it would be taken as a sign of the Governmenfsdetermination to deal firmly with the threat of continued industrial action.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) The Trades Union Congress (TUC) had publicly argued theminers&apos; case for especially favourable pay treatment. If it were decided, exceptionally, to offer a settlement providing greater cash benefits than the latest offer by the NCB in return for a settlementextending over a longer period than 12 months, the TUC might be persuaded to accept thatvthis did not justify similar concessions toother groups of workers. On the other hand, the Government wouldthen be seen to have changed the position which they had taken up before the strike; and any proposal to increase the offer which Hadbeen made to the miners at that earlier stage or even to assure them of the same percentage improvement for a period longer than 12
months would represent a departure from the Governments policy of seeking a continuous reduction in the level of pay settlements. Itwould therefore need very careful consideration.(b) The Governments failure to invoke the Industrial relations act in relation to the strike was not generally understood. But, asthe Cabinet had agreed earlier (CM (72) 1st Conclusions, Minute 3),there had been no grounds justifying an application for a restraintorder to defer the strike; and, although consideration might in due course need to be given to the question of applying to the national industrial Relations Court for a ballot order to test support of thestrike, particularly if a proposal emerged from conciliation which the num were disinclined to put to their membership themselves, therewould be particular objection to invoking this provision of the Act forthe first time in the special circumstances of a mining dispute. Itwould therefore be preferable that the NUM should be persuaded toarrange a ballot themselves on any offer emerging from conciliationwhich needed to be submitted to their members. The existence of thepower under the Act to apply for ballot orders, however, might be helpful in obtaining their agreement.(c) The provisions of the Industrial Relations Act which related tosecondary boycotts, to the &quot; blacking &quot; of supplies and to the induce-ment of other workers to take action resulting in the frustration of acommercial contract, would not come into force until 28 February.Under present law picketing to prevent the delivery of materials, forexample, to a power station, was immune from legal action even if itfrustrated a commercial contract, unless it could be established thatthe inducement to break the contract was direct or that unlawfulmeans had been employed. Moreover, in the light of Lord Denning&apos;sjudgments in the Torquay Hotels case it was generally held thatinducing workers to break their contracts of employment the formof indirect inducement now being used to disrupt supplies to power stations did not constitute &quot; unlawful&quot; means. There mightnevertheless be value in present circumstances in bringing a suitablecase before the courts; and early consideration should be given to thedesirability of so advising one of the generating Boards or some other party who had suffered damage from the frustration of a contractthrough the action of pickets.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thesuggestion at (c) above should be further examined by the ministerial Committee on Emergencies. The Committee should alsocontinue to maintain a close watch on developments in the strike,particularly in relation to electricity supplies, in order to assess at what stage the Cabinet might need to recommend the declaration ofan Emergency. The Secretary of State for Employment should arrange for the Ministerial Steering Committee on Pay negotiations to give early consideration to the terms which might be put forward in negotiations with the NUM when he judged it timely to initiateconciliation.
Non-industrial civil Service:Central PayIncreasePreviousReference :CM (71) 28thConclusions,Minute 1The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Ministers concerned to be guided accordingly.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Civil Service National staff side had rejected the central pay increase which the ministerial sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations had felt to be the maximumwhich they could authorise him to offer; and it was likely that theStaff Side would decide on the following day to seek arbitration.If so, that would be the first occasion since 1962 on which therehad been a failure to achieve an agreed settlement in negotiations fora central pay increase. Ministers would be reviewing their decisionagain in the light of the outcome of the pay negotiations in theelectricity supply industry that afternoon.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statement by the Lord Privy Seal.CONFIDENTIALStatement on 5.  The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary ofthe Defence state for Defence (CP (72) 10), to which was annexed the text of theEstimates, 1972 proposed Statement on the Defence Estimates, 1972.The Cabinet Approved the text of the White Paper and invited theSecretary of State for Defence to arrange for its publicationon 16 February.confidential. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretaryof State for Trade and Industry (CP (72) 9) and by the LordChancellor (CP (72) 11) discussing the question whether the forth-coming Bill on Competition Policy should provide for the extensionof the restrictive trade practices legislation to include restrictive practices in the supply of professional services.The Prime Minister said that, since there was inadequate timeto consider this subject fully at the present meeting, he would discuss it with the Home Secretary, the Lord Chancellor, the Lord president and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in the hope thatit could be resolved without further reference to the Cabinet.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the statement by the PrimeMinister. *restrictive practices inthe Supply ofProfessionalServicesCabinet Office,27 January, 1972.
