The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons in the following week.secret. The Secretary of State for Employment said that he had called representatives of the British Railways Board (BRB) and thethree railway unions to a joint meeting under his chairmanship onthe previous evening. The objectives agreed in advance by ministers had been, first, to ascertain whether there was any variation of theaward made by the arbitrator, Mr. Jarratt, within the same overallcost of 12-1 Per cent on tne wage bill which the unions might accept and, in particular, to explore a proposal that payment of a  20minimum rate to those railwaymen whose rates of pay were lessthan  20 should begin on 1 May while pay increases for otherrailwaymen should take effect from 5 June; and, second, to establish,if the unions continued to insist that their demands must be met in full from 1 May, that they would not in fact have reduced their14 per cent claim to 12^ per cent, as they had publicly claimed. Theunions, however, had shown little readiness to discuss any proposal which would not increase the total cost of the arbitrator^ award.In particular, Mr. Buckton, the General Secretary of the associated society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF), had made it clear that, contrary to the impression which he had given in a broadcast that morning, his union was not prepared to accept anincrease of less than 14 per cent. Sir Sidney Greene, the general secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR), had maintained that the &quot; cooling off &quot; period had been wasted by theGovernment and the BRB, who had failed to negotiate during thebreathing space which it had provided; and in subsequent discussionhe had appeared aggrieved that he had been given insufficient credit for achieving agreement between the NUR and ASLEF on a more moderate claim than the more militant elements of ASLEF hadbeen advocating.After the unions had rejected outright the proposal to pay the 20 basic minimum to the lower-paid men from 1 May and the fullincreases to other railwaymen from 5 June he had suggested thatthe minimum earnings guarantee should also be raised to  20-50from 1 May. The Chairman of the BRB, however, had said thatthe unions had already rejected these proposals, which the Boardthemselves regarded as practicable only if the co-operation of theunions was assured; and Sir Sidney Greene had not only maintained that the proposals were unrealistic and unacceptable to the NURbut had also argued that, since the most militant action had been urged by the higher-paid railwaymen, the Governments main taskmust be to satisfy these men.As a result of these exchanges it was now clear that the totalextent of compromise by the unions had been a reduction in their demand for an increased basic rate from  20-05 to  20 and thatthey had had no intention of accepting 5 June as the effective dateof the increases. The alternatives now facing the Government,therefore, were to acquiesce in the BRB&apos;s meeting the unions&apos;
demands in full; to apply to the Industrial Court for a ballot Order;or to take no further action and to face the ensuing industrial action. If it were now decided to apply for a ballot Order,it would be necessary to set out fairly the positions of both sides and to formulate a question to the railwaymen which the Courtmight consider adopting as a basis for the ballot. The questionitself should ask whether railwaymen favoured accepting the latestoffer or renewing industrial action in support of the unions&apos; claim;but it should be supplemented by footnotes indicating the precise form of the BRB offer and the details of the unions&apos; claim, bringingout the difference between the parties about the operative date and,possibly, giving examples of the proposed increases for selectedgrades from the alternative dates of 1 May or 5 June. Before makingapplication for a ballot Order he would have to discharge his stautory obligation to consult the employers and the one registered unionconcerned, the Transport Salaried Staffs Association.In discussion some doubt was expressed about the wisdom of applying for a ballot Order under the Industrial Relations Act.The BRB&apos;s area managers had formed the view that railwaymenwere more likely to vote in support of their union leaders than onthe merits of the proposal put to them. But if, as a result, the response to the ballot was unfavourable, this might not onlydiscredit the Act but also make it difficult for the Government andthe BRB to continue resisting the concession of the unions&apos; demands in full. On the other hand the vote could not now be taken until about 5 June; and the Secretary of State for Employments proposalenvisaged that railwaymen should be invited to vote on an offer which, whilst benefiting only the lower-paid men from 1 May,would give other railwaymen the full benefit from 5 June of therates which, under the arbitrator^ award, would only have beenpayable from 1 January 1973. Even if railwaymen were persuaded to vote in favour of resumed industrial action rather than acceptanceof this offer, the BRB might then announce that on 5 June theywould begin to pay the new rates, on the ground that these wererates which the unions had said that they would accept and thatlt wasno longer reasonable to withhold the increases. The unions might then find it difficult to reinstate industrial action on no better groundsthan that their members wished to stand out for back pay from 1May. Moreover, since it was clear that there was no willingness bythe unions to compromise and that at this juncture it would be wrong to concede their demands in full, the only alternative to a ballot would be to refrain from any further intervention and to face the threatened industrial action.But that course could rapidly result in a dislocation of therailways system, which would inflict severe damage on the economywithout offering any final solution. The Government could not easily defend either inaction or a failure to apply for a ballot Orderunless the Secretary of State judged that the requirements prescribed by the Act as the conditions of an application could not be satisfied.Moreover, failure to apply would be taken as a sign that theGovernment were afraid to invoke the Act since they feared thatthe result of the ballot would be adverse. Although the economy was now stronger than at the time of the earlier wbrk-to-rule, thereSECRET
could be little doubt that the Court would find that a resumptionof industrial action would constitute a threat to the life of the nation;and the Secretary of State for Employment was satisfied that hehad adequate reason for concluding that there was doubt, in termsof section 141 (1) (c) of the Act, whether railwaymen fully supported the renewal of industrial action and whether they had had anadequate opportunity to express their views. On balance, therefore,the application for a ballot Order should be made and shouldpreferably be lodged before the industrial action started that night.It should not necessarily be assumed that the outcome of the ballotwas a foregone conclusion; and if, as was possible, the Court orderedthat members of each of the three unions should be ballotedseparately, this might improve the chances that the result on balance would be favourable. But the more specifically the question couldbe framed, the better would be the prospect of a favourable answer;and in this respect there were two difficulties about the Secretaryof State&apos;s proposal. It was not based on any offer which the BRBhad put formally to the unions but merely reflected a suggestion which had emerged in the course of his final attempt on the previous day to conciliate between the parties. And it would arguably besimpler and more straightforward, as well as better calculated toprovide the Government with surer ground on which to stand, to invite railwaymen to vote on the arbitrator^ original award which,although accepted by the BRB, had been rejected out of hand by theunions, rather than on any of the variations discussed subsequentlywhich were less clearly defined. On the other hand this proposal by itself might both attract less public support and be less likelyto secure the favourable vote of railwaymen; and it would alsoforeclose the option of arranging for the BRB to pay the full ratesfrom 5 June in the hope of forestalling renewed industrial action if the result of the ballot were adverse. It would accordingly be preferable to arrange for the BRB forthwith to make to the unions,in writing, a formal offer on the basis of the discussion between theSecretary of State for Employment and the two parties on theprevious evening &quot; namely to increase the minimum basic rate&quot;for railwaymen to  20 from 1 May without consequential increases in differentials or to implement a minimum earnings guarantee of 20-50 from the same date; and to pay the rest of the arbitrator^award in full from 5 June.&quot; This offer would need to be made beforethe Government applied to the Industrial Court for a ballot Order.It must be accepted that, if the unions then claimed time in which toconsider it, it might not be possible to lodge the application that day.When the application was made, however^ the Court should be recommended to order that the question on which the railwaymenshould be balloted should be whether they favoured acceptance ofthe BRB&apos;s revised offer or the renewal of industrial action. TheCourt would be concerned to ensure not only that the question should be framed objectively but also that the ballot should besecretly and properly conducted, free of interference or constraint;and it might therefore be helpful to seek the Courfs guidance aboutthe forms of publicity and advocacy which it would consider fairin the presentation of the issues to railwaymen and to the public in general.
In further discussion the following main points were made (a) The BRB intended to take disciplinary action against thestaff concerned as soon as there was any evidence that the unions&apos;work-to-rule instruction was being abused in order to increase the disruption of services. The Board would proceed carefully in thismatter, taking account of the lessons of the earlier work-to-rule; butthere was no doubt that disruption might become severe very rapidly.The BRB had been surprised at the speed with which major difficulties had arisen on the last occasion; and services were likely to be reducedto a minimum within a few days.(b) It would not have been possible for the Board easily to haveavoided the disruptive effects of working to rule. The BRB&apos;s ruleshad been agreed in negotiation with the unions; and it was not simplya question of their paying the unions to agree to abandon the rulebook. There were many procedures outside the rule book whichcould be applied in such a way to cause disruption by those mindedto do so.(c) The unions were still taking the attitude that there shouldbe no compulsory redundancies; but they were also arguing thatthe Board could afford to increase their pay offer because redundancies-dancies would reduce the cost. The BRB, however, claimed thatallowance had already been made for such savings in theircalculations. Although the Board had always been mindful of theemployment implications of their policies, from their viewpointnecessary redundancies had been postponed for too long. the apparent paradox of excessive overtime working and a simultaneousshortage of staff was confined to particular grades, such as signalmen,and to the lowest-paid workers, who were not always available inthe places where they were needed.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for Employment should now invite the Chairman of the BRB to make to the unions formally,in writing, a revised offer on the lines which had been discussed athis meeting with the two parties on the previous day; and that,failing acceptance of this offer by the unions, he should apply to theIndustrial Court for a ballot Order. It was for the Court to determine the question on which the ballot would be held; but the advice tobe tendered to the Court on behalf of the Government should bethat the question should pose railwaymen the choice betweenaccepting the BRB&apos;s latest revised offer or renewing industrial action.The Cabinet- /Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of the discussion and invited the Secretary of State for employment to be guided accordingly.
