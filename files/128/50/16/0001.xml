The Minister for Transport Industries said that further negotiations between the British Railways Board (BRB) and therailway unions had been arranged for the following Monday, 20March. The attitude of the Associated Society of locomotive engineers and Firemen seemed likely to be determined at a meetingof their Executive to be held on 15 March. In the meantime, theBRB were endeavouring to ascertain informally whether there was any redistribution of the elements of the present offer of increasescosting 9-84 per cent on the wage bill which the unions might beprepared to accept and, if not, whether there was a prospect of achieving a negotiated settlement in some other way. The Board,who understood clearly the Governments position, would not wishto increase their present offer unless they were satisfied that to do so would secure a settlement; and they were not in any event preparedto offer more than an increase costing 11 per cent in total.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister for transport industries and agreed to resume their discussion onThursday, 16 March.Cabinet Office,   \14 March, 1972.1.
