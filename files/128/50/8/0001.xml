The Cabinet discussed the arrangements for the criticalvote on the Second Reading of the European Communities Bill that evening.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he had advisedGovernment supporters in the House of Commons who might be disposed to vote against the Second Reading of the european communities Bill that evening that the policy exemplified by theBill had the support of the whole Cabinet and that the Governmentwould therefore regard the issue as one of confidence, on which theycould not sustain a defeat. The Government must stand or falltogether.The Home Secretary said that the entire Cabinet would endorsethis view.The Cabinet-Took note,statement.with approval,  of the Prime MinistersSECRET3. The Cabinet discussed certain developments in relation tothe situation in Northern Ireland; the conclusions reached wereseparately recorded and issued only to The Queen, the Prime Ministerand those Ministers who had to take action.The conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file heldby the Secretary of the Cabinet.SECRETf 4. The Cabinet considered the latest developments in relationto Rhodesia.The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that the latest reports from Salisbury made it clear that therewas now virtually no prospect that the Pearce Commission would beable to say that they were satisfied that the terms of the proposed settlement were acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole.Lord Harlech, one of the Deputy Chairmen pf the Commission, whohad visited London briefly for private reasons, had confirmed this impression. The Commission^ present intention was to continueworking in Rhodesia until about 15 March and then to return toLondon to write their report. It was unlikely to be ready before late in April. Meanwhile, it would be necessary to consider carefullywhat out future policies should be.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.&quot;1* Previously circulated as a Confidential Annex.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons the following week.
As regards the proposal that an all-Party group of Members ofParliament should visit Rhodesia in order to observe the work of theCommission, the latest reply from the regime in Salisbury to our request that they should provide facilities for this purpose wasequivocal. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had thereforesent a further message inviting the regime to say clearly whether a group with the membership proposed would be acceptable or not.No reply to this message had yet been received. Meanwhile,Parliamentary interest in the matter had diminished; and it might bepossible to allow the proposal to be abandoned.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the proposal for a Parliamentary delegationmight well be allowed to lapse. It would be necessary, however, togive urgent and serious consideration to the steps to be taken afterthe presentation of the Pearce Commission^ report. Our legalresponsibilities towards the United Nations Organisation, as well asdomestic Parliamentary considerations, placed serious constraintsupon our freedom of action in the matter. But it was now clearthat, in refusing to accept the proposals for a settlement, many of the rhodesian Africans were casting a vote not against Britain but against the regime in Salisbury; and this fact, together with theevidence of an increasing understanding that we were in no positioneffectively to exercise responsibility in Rhodesia, should be given full weight in working out our future policies.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Oversea AffairsCyprusPreviousReference:CM (71) 52ndConclusions,Minute 2mSECRET5. The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that a potentially dangerous situation was developing in Cyprusfollowing the importation by President Makarios of a large quantityof arms from Czechoslovakia and an intemperate demand by theGreek Government, who were probably seeking to end the Presidentsrule, that these should be surrendered to the United Nations Forcein Cyprus. There was now an increasing risk that PresidentMakarios would be drawn further to the left in his policies by thisill-judged action on the part of the Greek Government. We were doing all we could, as were the Government of the United States, toreduce the tension; and so far the Turkish Government had adopted a responsible and generally calm attitude. But the prospects ofsuccess for the intercommunal discussions which we had beenencouraging in order to reduce the danger of hostilities breaking out between Greek and Turkish Cypriots would inevitably have beendiminished by the current crisis. Meanwhile our main concernmust be for the security of the Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus; andthese should be physically able to defend themselves.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Minister of State forForeign and Commonwealth Affairs.
MaltaPreviousReference:CM (72) 6thConclusions,Minute 2IndustrialAffairsCoahniners&apos;Pay DisputePreviousReference:CM (72) 6thConclusions,Minute confidential*7. The Cabinet considered developments in connection withthe present industrial situation.The Secretary of State for Employment said that the Court of inquiry under Lord Wilberforce had now heard the evidence of theNational Coal Board (NCB) and the National Union of Mineworkers(NUM) and were considering their report. He hoped that thiswould be available late that evening and would be published earlythe next morning. He had invited both parties to the dispute tomeet him as soon as the report was ready for publication. He didnot yet know what recommendations the Court of Inquiry were likely to make; but he was not optimistic that the Executive of the num would themselves decide to recommend acceptance to their members. It was customary for the Executive to seek the view ofthe membership as a whole; and it was likely that they would do soon this occasion, probably without themselves making a recom-mendation. A full ballot of the members of the NUM normallytook 3 weeks; but this period could probably be reduced to 8-10 daysby accelerating the procedures. This, however, could only be done if the NUM desired to co-operate. If a ballot were held, the earliestlikely date for a return to work would be 6 March. The alternative would be for the Executive to put the matter to a branch vote, whichwould take only 3 or 4 days. Although this might appear a valuablesaving of time, it involved the risk that the more extreme elements inthe NUM might be able to secure a rejection of the recommendations.The prospect of securing a favourable decision by the miners could thus be less under a branch vote than under a full ballot. It wasimpossible, however, to form a view about the attitude which theunion would adopt until the Court&apos;s recommendations became known. *The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that therehad been no significant change in the situation as regards the supplyof coal and electricity.  There had, however, been an increase in the* Previously circulated as a Confidential Annex.secret . The Secretary of State for Defence said that messages hadbeen received from the Prime Minister of Malta, Mr. Mintoff, to theeffect that he would like to be invited to London for personaldiscussion with the Prime Minister. By giving Mr. Mintoff theopportunity to save his face a meeting of this kind might in the endprovide the only means of concluding a satisfactory Defence Agree-ment with the Government of Malta. But as a first step it wouldbe necessary to make sure, so far as possible, that Mr. Mintoff reallyintended that any discussions with the Prime Minister should lead toa final settlement; and this would need to be the subject of a carefulassessment which was currently in hand.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for defence.
picketing of oil supplies to power stations by rail. It would pose aserious threat to electricity supplies if the Transport and general works Union followed the railwaymen&apos;s example and advised their members not to deal with oil supplies by pipeline. If the generalsituation continued as at present, the Central Electricity GeneratingBoard (CEGB) would, towards the end of the following week, haveto restrict supply to the 20-25 per cent of the normal demandobtainable from nuclear and oil stations; and this would suffice only for essential services. Such services in this context were thoseneeded to make the minimum provision for the life of the community,including hospitals, fire services, sewerage, water supplies and sometransport services, including food distribution, but not food processingor newspapers. Non-essential industry and the domestic userwould in general no longer be supplied. If, as a result of therecommendations of the Court of Inquiry, the picketing of oil and coal supplies ceased, this situation might be postponed by 7-10 days;but there would in any case be severe problems in moving the coal which was at present made unavailable by picketing; and perhapsonly about J million tons a week could be moved at the outset.In these circumstances it was essential to introduce further restrictionson domestic and industrial electricity consumption as soon as possible;and he was engaged in consultations with the major industrial organisations and the largest industrial companies about the measureswhich would need to be taken. He proposed to make a statement inthe House of Commons later that day about the need for these further measures.In discussion, concern was expressed about the length of time which could be taken by a ballot, should the NUM decide to holdone. A further delay of 8-10 days before the NUM decided whetheror not to resume work could not be tolerated; and some special arrangements ought to be made to reduce the period, for example,by arranging for the immediate holding of a simplified ballot once the Court of Inquiry&apos;s recommendations were known. It should bepossible, with the help of the NCB, to conduct such a ballot in 2 or3 days. On the other hand it would not be possible to hold a ballotwithout the full co-operation of the NUM; and it was in any casedoubtful whether an effective ballot could be carried out in 3 days.In discussion of the measures which could be taken to secure themovement of coal and oil supplies and the need for adequate advancecontingency planning in this respect the Cabinet were informed that plans had been made for various contingencies, including thearrangements which would be necessary if electricity supply had tobe reduced to 20-25 per cent of normal demand, the scope for usingServicemen to move stocks of Coal and oil and the arrangements to requisition or hire vehicles for this purpose. The use of troops,however, was regarded as a measure to be taken only in the last resort in view of the difficulty of escorting unarmed troops throughpicket lines, the reactions which their use might provoke from other unions and the possibility that the CEGB staff, in particular, would refuse to make use of such supplies. On the other hand, the use of volunteers might be a much more realistic method of assisting themovement of stocks.   It should involve less likelihood of the
&quot; blacking &quot; of the stocks by other unions, and it seemed likely that,in view of the extent to which public opinion was moving against theminers, there would be little difficulty in recruiting sufficient volunteers to drive the available vehicles, and to help in other ways. It wouldbe necessary, however, to establish a large-scale central organisation to co-ordinate their activities; and, it might be unrealistic to suppose that volunteers could postpone, any more than Servicemen, the point when supply would have to be confined to essential services by morethan a few days. The most helpful way of easing the present difficulties would be to secure the withdrawal of the pickets or tocurb their ability to prevent supplies from reaching power stations.Although Police action at Longannet had been successful in re-establishing access to the power station, the steps taken elsewhere hadbeen inadequate to prevent obstruction by pickets, which wasunlawful, whether conducted peacefully or not. The main reason forthe pickets&apos; success, however, lay in the instructions which other unions had given that their members should not cross picket lines.Once the strike had ended it would be possible to supplement coal supplies by imports; orders had already been placed overseas and stocks were being accumulated at Rotterdam. A limiting factor was likely to be the capacity of the docks in this country to deal withthe imports.In further discussion it was urged that public opinion should be fully informed of the extent to which the situation was deterioratingand of the outlook, even if the strike ended quickly. electricity supplies both for industry and the home would have to be restrictedfor some time. Without minimising the seriousness of the position,however, it should not be implied that the prospect was hopeless, lest the NUM should be further reinforced in their professed determination-ation to adhere to their demands. It was also important to make itclear that the Government were taking all appropriate steps to dealwith the situation. If the miners did not accept the Courtsrecommendations, there might be advantage in a broadcast by thePrime Minister for this purpose. There would be a further oppor-tunity for the Governments position to be made clear early in thefollowing week, if there were not by then a settlement of the strike,since the Opposition were pressing for a debate on industrial affairs to replace the business of the House of Commons already planned for the following Monday. It should be to the Governmentsadvantage to have the issue debated as soon as possible after thereport of the Court of Inquiry was published.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion said that theCabinet agreed that further restrictions on electricity supply would need to be imposed during the following week; and the ministerial committee on Emergencies should consider forthwith the form whichthese restrictions should take. The Committee should also consider urgently the action which would be needed if and when electricity supplies were confined to essential supplies only. The Committeeshould prepare plans for the possible use of volunteers; but theCabinet agreed that neither volunteers nor Servicemen should beemployed to move coal or oil whilst the possibility of an early settlement of the strike remained.   There should be no public
reference to their possible use. The Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry should make his statement in the House of Commons that afternoon, as he proposed; and the Lord President and the chief whip should give further consideration to the timing of a debate on industrial affairs in the following week. He would consider further whether he should himself broadcast to the nation. In view of thepossible need to take important decisions at short notice he asked that his colleagues should hold themselves ready to attend any meeting which might be called over the ensuing weekend.The Cabinet-1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the ministerial committee on Emergencies to consider the form and extent of further restrictions on electricity supply, both inthe interim period and when supply might be confined toessential services; and to consider the role which volun-teers might play in distributing coal and oil supplies.3. Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry tomake a statement that day in the House of Commons, ashe proposed.4. Invited the Lord President of the Council and the chief whip to consider further the timing of a House ofCommons debate on industrial affairs.Cabinet Office18 February 1972
