The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons in the following week.The Legislative The Cabinet reviewed the current Session&apos;s legislative Pro-Programme gramme. There was general agreement on the need to regulate1971-72 Session the progress of Bills in the light of the obstacles still to be overcomein ensuring the enactment of the European Communities Bill. Itwas recognised that, as a result, other legislation might be delayedto some extent; and particular concern was expressed about thedifficulties which were likely to be encountered in the House of lords in view of the late arrival of Bills from the House of Commons.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President of the Council to circulate, forthe information of the Cabinet, the programme of legislativebusiness for the remainder of the Session as foreseen at thepresent time.northern ireland previous reference :CM (72) 23rdConclusions,Minute 3SECRET2. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland informed theCabinet that in the last few days there had been a reduction in thelevel of violence in the Province; but it must still be feared that the&quot; Provisional&quot; wing of the Irish Republican Army would seek to provoke some fresh major incident in the hope of frustrating themovement towards reconciliation which was gradually gainingstrength. The efforts of the terrorists were likely to take the formprincipally of shooting at members of the security forces and causingexplosions in industrial premises. It was the more satisfactory, there-fore, that prompt action had been taken to ensure that the recentexplosion at a Courtaulds factory would not lead to any loss ofemployment and that it had now been agreed that we should providea substantial measure of continuing assistance to Messrs. Harlandand Wolff in Belfast.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for northern Ireland.secret oversea 3.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the affairs military situation in Vietnam continued to deteriorate.  It was stillVietnam        possible that, although the South Vietnamese Army had suffered a previous        serious setback in the northern part of the territory and had been reference:     obliged to give ground to the Communists, it would be able to avoidCM (72) 23rd  a complete defeat.  But these developments in Vietnam would be conclusions,    bound to have an adverse effect on the atmosphere for the forth-Minute 2        coming discussions in Moscow between the President of the UnitedStates, Mr. Nixon, and the Soviet leaders.   The United states secretary of State, Mr. Rogers, whom he had met that day, had indicated that President Nixon nevertheless intended to carry outthe programme for his visit as planned and remained hopeful ofmaking progress on certain aspects of United States/Soviet relations.
India/PakistanPreviousReference :CM (72) 18thConclusions,Minute 2GermanyPreviousReference :CM (72) 23rdConclusions,Minute 2The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theemissaries of the Prime Minister of India, Mrs. Gandhi, and of president Bhutto of Pakistan appeared to have been successful in reaching agreement that their principals should meet, probably on26 May, on the basis that the immediate issues of the return of thePakistani prisoners of war and of the frontier between the states would take priority over long-standing contentious issues such assovereignty over Kashmir. In this event, some progress might bemade at the discussions, although the insistence of the Governmentof Bangladesh on bringing alleged war criminals to trial might yetmake impossible the early establishment of reasonable relationsbetween the three countries of the subcontinent.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the federal german Chancellor, Herr Brandt, was in a difficult Parliamentaryposition following the narrow margin by which he had avoideddefeat on a &quot; constructive motion of no confidence &quot; and his ownfailure to secure a majority in the Lower House for the Federalbudget. Discussions between Herr Brandt and the leader of the christian Democratic Union, Herr Barzel, had been arranged in thehope that agreement could be reached on a joint declaration aboutthe future of the Federal Governmenfs Ostpolitik. But, althoughthe Ostpolitik enjoyed a wide measure of support in Germany, these discussions had proved abortive; and it was by no means certain that herr Brandt would be able to sustain his Administration. In this event the ratification of the Eastern Treaties, the signature of the finalQuadripartite Protocol on Berlin and the prospects for a Conferenceon Security and Co-operation in Europe would all be jeopardised.It would be unrealistic to expect that the Soviet and Polish Govern-ments would be prepared to entertain any proposal for renegotiationof the Treaties.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.rhodesia previous reference:CM (72) 20thConclusions,Minute secret*4. The Cabinet considered the probable conclusions of LordPearce&apos;s report on the outcome of the Test of Acceptability of theproposed constitutional settlement in Rhodesia.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary informed the Cabinetthat he expected to receive that day Lord Pearce&apos;s report on the out-come of the Test of Acceptability of the proposed constitutional settlement in Rhodesia. The report would probably find that theterms were not acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole; butthis conclusion would be qualified in such a way. as to indicate thatthe settlement, or one broadly similar to it, might become acceptableat a later stage. In that event he proposed to take all possible stepsto dissuade Mr. Ian Smith, the Rhodesian leader, from any actionwhich would make a later settlement impossible. Mr. Smith, how-ever, might well not be prepared to wait any longer; and his reactionmight be very intransigent.* Previously circulated in a Confidential Annex.
The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that there could be no question of imposing asettlement in the immediate aftermath of a negative report from lord Pearce, however much its findings might be qualified. Thereport would need very serious consideration by the Government;and the policy options which it presented would have to be examinedclosely. Meanwhile, great care should be taken to prevent thepremature disclosure of its terms. At the same time arrangements should be made for an adequate number of copies to be availablefor distribution in Rhodesia at the appropriate point, in order toensure widespread understanding of its contents.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.IndustrialAffairsRailwaymen&apos;sPayNegotiationsPreviousReference:CM (72) 23rdConclusions,Minute 4IndustrialAction inthe DocksCONFIDENTIAL5. The Minister for Transport Industries said that in the continuing negotiations between the British Railways Board (BRB)and the rail unions neither side had yet moved from the positionswhich they had adopted before the award of the arbitrator,Mr. Jarratt. But at a further meeting which was taking place that morning the BRB intended, after emphasising that their own earlieroffer of an 11 per cent increase from 1 May, 1972, represented themost which they considered that they were justified in offering, toindicate that they were now prepared to reach a settlement inaccordance with Mr. Jarratt&apos;s award, although they could not go further. If, however, the unions maintained that they could not settleon that basis, the Board would offer to consider any variation of theaward which did not increase its cost or the corresponding percentage increase in the wage bill during the year beginning 1 May, 1972. Itwould be for the unions to make proposals accordingly; and theBoard would expect them to undertake that any agreement thenreached would be commended by them for the acceptance of their members. BRB thereby hoped to avoid tabling any further proposalswhich would not finally secure a settlement. As a result of informal soundings, they believed that a settlement might be possible on thebasis of deferring any pay increase for 4-5 weeks after 1 May andthen implementing both stages of Mr. Jarratfs award from 29 Mayor 5 June. Over the 12-month period from 1 May, 1972, the cost ofsuch an adjustment would be broadly similar to that of the originalaward. BRB&apos;s proposal had been approved by the group of ministers under the Prime Minister^ chairmanship which had been consideringthe railway pay dispute. He had subsequently ,made it clear to theChairman of BRB that it was essential that the formal initiative fora settlement on this basis should come from the unions and not fromthe Board.The Secretary of State for Employment said that, together withthe Minister for Transport Industries, he had had a preliminary discussion on the previous evening with Mr. Jack Jones, the general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU),and Mr. 0&apos;Leary, the union&apos;s National Docks Officer, about employ-
ment problems in the docks stemming from the world-wide trend towards shipment of goods ready-packed in conta;ners. The union leaders had apparently felt that an urgent approach to ministers would help them to placate their members and to counter the pressure on the union to call a national dock strike. He had told the union leaders that he would now arrange to discuss the matter further withthe port employers and would then meet them again. It was thepresent campaign by dockworkers at Liverpool and other ports to&quot; black &quot; container deliveries by certain road hauliers and warehousecompanies which had led to the recent cases before the industrial court, as a result of which the Court had imposed substantial fineson the TGWU. The campaign was directed to preventing the loadingand unloading of goods into and from containers being undertaken by workers other than registered dockworkers; and it reflected the wide-spread fear among dockworkers of losing a traditional field of work.The Minister for Transport Industries said that the union leadershad made two suggestions. First, that a levy should be imposed oncontainer traffic. This, however, would not prevent the greater useof containers but would merely increase costs. Second, that thoseports now excluded from the National Dock Labour Scheme shouldbe brought within it. In reply, he had pointed out that this couldonly be achieved by Order of Parliament, which would need to be preceded by a full review of the Scheme. Such a review would belikely to show that some dockworkers to whom the Scheme nowapplied would prefer to be excluded from it; and it was thereforeunlikely to be welcome to the TGWU. Moreover, adoption of theTGWU&apos;s suggestions would be liable to have effects opposite to thosewhich the union favoured, since it would place the major British portsat a competitive disadvantage and would direct bulk traffic to european ports, whence the containers would be trans-shipped insmaller vessels for unloading at minor British coastal ports andesturial terminals. Instead, a solution should be sought through aco-operative understanding between the employers and the unions concerned; and it was this which he would now be working topromote. Both sides of the port industry bore a share of responsi-bility for the present difficulties; but the problems faced bydockworkers were more likely to win the sympathy of the public.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Secretary of State for employment and the Minister for Transport Industries.confidential. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of,,a memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (CP (72) 42) about thelong-term review of the British Steel Corporation (BSC).The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that at their previous meeting the Cabinet had deferred a decision on the proposal in cp (72) 42 that a Parliamentary statement should be made accepting the finding of the Joint Steering Group that the BSC should aim toestablish a productive capacity in 1980 within the range of 28-36million ingot tons. The Cabinet had been concerned in particularabout the adequacy of the recommended capacity target in relationSteelIndustryBritish steel corporation:Long-TermReviewPreviousReference:CM (72) 23rdConclusions,Minute 6
to the increase in the rate of economic expansion which the Govern-ment hoped to achieve in the future; and they had also been exercised by the comparison with the rate at which the steel industries of other countries would be expanding. A group of the ministers primarily concerned, under his chairmanship, had therefore examinedthese questions further.. They were satisfied that the adoption of theproposed target capacity range would be consistent with the achieve-ment of a sustained rapid rate of economic expansion, given thescope for deferring the closure of plant which would otherwise beretired over the period to 1980 and for bringing forward new capacitywithin that period, which together provided a large measure of flexibility in addition to the target capacity range. Moreover, theadoption of a higher target capacity would involve a large additional public expenditure commitment. An objective of 28-36 million tonscapacity by 1980 should therefore be accepted. The Minister for industry had been invited to prepare a revised version of theproposed Parliamentary statement in the light of this conclusion andto consider further both the best means of dealing with supple-mentary questions about the compatibility of the steel capacitytarget and the Governments recent statements on future economic growth and about the relationship between the proposed rate of expansion of the steel industry in this country and the correspond-ing rate in the countries of the European Coal and Steel Communities(ECSC). It appeared that the Government could appropriately claim that the assumptions underlying the proposed capacity target wereconsistent in the medium term with an increase in gross domestic product (gdp) of 5 per cent per annum, as had been foreshadowed inthe Budget speech; and it could also be maintained that in the longer term they were consistent with a rate of growth in gdp substantially higher than that achieved at any time since 1945.The Minister for Industry said that, for the reasons mentioned by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, together with the flexibility inthe assumed range of export sales, the adoption of the planning target of 28-36 million tons would allow the retention of sufficient steel-making capacity to supply the foreseen demand even if a 5 per centannual rate of economic growth were sustained throughout theperiod to 1980. Published information about the expected expan-sion of steelmaking in ECSC countries related only to the period1970-74, during which capacity, which had recently fallen behind the growth of steel demand in those countries, was forecast to riseby 6 -1 per cent per annum. A revised version of his proposedParliamentary statement, taking account of these considerations, hadbeen circulated to members of the Cabinet under cover of his minute of 3 May to the Prime Minister. /The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet endorsed *the conclusions reached by the group ofMinisters under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Exchequerand agreed that the Minister for Industry should make a Parliamen-tary statement on the lines which he proposed on 8 May. Thestatement should indicate, however, that the BSC, like the Govern-ment, agreed with the capacity target of 28-36 million tons
recommended by the Joint Steering Group, rather than that theymerely accepted it.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Minister for Industryto proceed accordingly.SECRETLegislative 7.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by Lord PresidentProgramme Qf the Council (CP (72) 47) on the legislative programme for the1972-73 1972-73 Session.session the Lord President said that the Ministerial Committee on future Legislation had concluded that it was desirable to plan for asignificantly lighter programme in the following Session. RecentSessions had been exceedingly heavy; the present Session mightfinish later than usual with the result that the 1972-73 Session wouldbe correspondingly curtailed; and there were several Bills in thepresent Sessioms programme which might have to be carried over.Nevertheless, the proposed programme was by no means a light one.There were eight major Bills of 50 clauses or more; and theprogramme would place a heavy burden on the draftsmen. It hadnot been possible to find a place for a number of important Bills. he particularly regretted that the Bill on Insurance did not have a place.In discussion it was suggested that the management of theprogramme could be eased by introducing more Bills in the Houseof Lords. The aim should be to introduce one major Bill in theHouse of Lords at the beginning of the Session and a second soon after Christmas. Other less important Bills might also be launched in the House of Lords; and it would be desirable to identify allthe Bills which might be dealt with in this way as soon as possible.The list might include the Bills on National Insurance and Occupa-tional Pensions, National Health Service Reorganisation and atomic energy Authority (Weapons Group).In further discussion there was general acceptance of theproposals. The following main points were made (a) The case for including the Bill on Insurance in the main programme was becoming increasingly compelling. It might bepossible to reduce the size of the Bill on Consumer Credit to com-compensate for this addition. /(b) Further consideration should be given to the possibility of finding a place for the Cinematograph Acts (Amendment) Bill.(c) A place might be found in the Scottish programme for theLord High Commissioner (Church of Scotland) Bill. The need forthe Bill was to be discussed at the forthcoming meeting of the Homeand Social Affairs Committee.(d) It was likely that the Salary and Allowances of the governor of Northern Ireland Bill would not now be needed.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet accepted the proposals in CP (72) 47, subject to the points which had been made. The burden on the legislative capacity ofParliament in the current and the preceding Sessions had been verygreat; and the Cabinet agreed that a significantly lighter programme was desirable in the 1972-73 Session. Further consideration shouldbe given to the practicability of making provision for the Bill onInsurance if the Bill on Consumer Credit could be considerably reduced in size. It would be advantageous if at least two of the major Bills and a number of other Bills were introduced in theHouse of Lords; and early consideration should be given to thenecessary decisions on this point. It was important that policy decisions and drafting instructions should be completed in good time. The convention that the Governmenfs legislative intentionsshould not be announced in advance of The Queen&apos;s Speech shouldbe observed; and the Lord President should be consulted if it werefelt necessary to depart from this convention in any particular case.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in CP (72) 47, subject to the points made in discussion.(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, toconsider whether provision could be made for the incor-poration of a Bill on Insurance in the programme if theBill on Consumer Credit were considerably reduced in size.(3) Invited the Lord President of the Council in consultationwith the Lord Privy Seal and the Ministers concerned, toprepare a list of the Bills which might be introduced inthe House of Lords.(4) Invited the Ministers concerned to keep the Lord Presidentof the Council informed of the progress made in preparation of Bills and to acquaint him with any difficul-ties encountered which might delay their introduction.(5) Invited Ministers to consult the Lord President of theCouncil if they considered it necessary to announce anyof the Governmenfs legislative intentions in advance ofThe Queen&apos;s Speech.Cabinet Office,4 May, 1972.
