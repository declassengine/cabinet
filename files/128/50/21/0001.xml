OverseaAffairsSt. VincentVietnamTanzaniaRhodesiaPreviousReference:CM (72) 16thConclusions,Minute 3SECRET2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary informed theCabinet that, following elections in St. Vincent which had left thetwo main political Parties with equal representation after a contestin which there had been suspicions of considerable corruption, theGovernor had asked for the presence of one of Her Majesty&apos;s shipsas a precaution against the possible outbreak of civil disorder. Afrigate, HMS Phoebe, had accordingly been despatched to St. Vincentto provide any necessary protection for United Kingdom citizens;but any request for assistance in the general maintenance of order would be a matter for separate consideration.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the recentincursions by North Vietnamese regular formations into the northern part of the Republic of Vietnam constituted a military operation ofconsiderable magnitude, involving nearly 50,000 troops. The army of the Republic now appeared to be restraining the invaders in theNorth and to have mounted a counter-attack near the Cambodianborder. If they could continue to hold the position, they would gaina substantial political as well as military success, which might induce the North Vietnamese to participate once again in the negotiations in Paris. It was still possible, however, that a further attack wouldbe launched in the Central Highlands; and this would represent a potentially more serious threat than either of the incursions already in progress.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, following the recent murder of Sheikh Karume, the Zanzibar leader and FirstVice-President of Tanzania, we had confined ourselves to making itclear that we condemned recourse to assassination as a politicalweapon in any circumstances.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that Mr. Smith,the Rhodesian leader, had originally indicated that, if the PearceCommission reported that the proposed constitutional settlement was not acceptable to African opinion, he might seek to consolidate the position of his regime by intensifying repressive measures againstthe African population. More recently, however, he had shown some desire to adopt a more moderate position; and it might bepossible to verify whether this was so. It was not yet clear, forexample, whether he intended to break off discussions with theBritish Government in the event of a verdict from the PearceCommission adverse to the proposed settlement or whether he wouldbe prepared at least to keep open the possibility that a settlement acceptable to all the interests concerned might still be negotiated.It was to be hoped that he would adopt the latter course; and itwould be especially helpful if Lord Pearce and his colleagues didSECRETParliamentary 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons in the following week.
IranPreviousReference:CM (72) 18thConclusions,Minute 2not confine themselves to a simple finding upon the acceptabilityor otherwise of the proposed settlement but were able to indicatepossible fields for initiatives which might in their view promote thepossibility of an agreed settlement.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the Shah of Iran continued to show anxiety about the spread of Soviet influence in Afghanistan and Iraq. A particular cause for concern was thetreaty recently concluded between the Soviet Union and Iraq,Article 9 of which imposed a mutual obligation to co-operate in the strengthening of the defence capabilities of the two countries. Sucha provision was unprecedented in a treaty of this kind between theSoviet Union and a client state; and, if it implied that the SovietGovernment were likely to seek military facilities for their forces inIraq, it would be a serious additional development of their policy of extending their military and political influence in the Middle East.Whether or not the treaty was designed to facilitate such a step, itunderlined the desirability of maintaining our own political positionin the area of the Gulf, where it was satisfactory that the extent of consultation between the local rulers and British representativesappeared to be no less frequent than before the withdrawal of our military garrisons.In the course of a brief discussion it was agreed that these developments increased the importance of taking all possible stepsto promote an early settlement of the Arab/Israeli dispute and ensuring that our economy was not unduly dependent upon oil from the Gulf States.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.northern ireland previous reference:CM (72) 19thConclusions,Minute 3IndustrialAffairsRailwaymen&apos;sPayNegotiationsPreviousReference:CM (72) 19thConclusions,Minute 4SECRET3. The Cabinet considered the situation in Northern Ireland.Their discussion and the conclusions reached were separately recorded and issued only to The Queen, the Prime Minister and those ministers who had to take action.The conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file held by the Secretary of the Cabinet.secret. The Secretary of State for the Environment said that on tuesday, 11 April the British Railways Board (BRB) had informed the rail unions that they were not prepared to improve their latestpay offer, which involved an increase of 11 per cent in the wage bill.On the following day the rail unions had decided to reject this offer and to order a national go-slow by their members from midnight on sunday, 16 April. In the light of these decisions the Secretary ofState for Employment had asked representatives of the rail unions todiscuss the situation with him that afternoon.
In discussion it was agreed that, when the Secretary of State for employment met the rail unions, he should press them strongly to agree to arbitration under the railway industry&apos;s negotiatingprocedures. Although arbitration might result in a settlementat a higher level than might be achieved by direct conciliation by theDepartment of Employment, a slightly higher settlement achieved by arbitration was arguably preferable to a lower settlement whichnevertheless entailed the Government^ direct involvement in thenegotiations leading to an inflationary pay increase. Under therailway industry&apos;s negotiating procedures, while either the manage-ment Or the unions could insist on arbitration, the findings werebinding on both parties only if both of them had agreed to arbitration.The BRB had formally proposed arbitration at the meeting with theunions on 11 April; but the unions had not then agreed to it, although there were reports that at the union meetings on 12 April the associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF)had been in favour of arbitration. The unions were unlikely to agreeto arbitration when they saw the Secretary of State for Employmentthat afternoon; but they should be asked to reflect further on theproposal and to report back to him urgently.It was suggested that the chances of settling the current dispute with an increase of less than the 16 per cent claimed by the unions would be seriously reduced once official industrial action had begun atmidnight on the following Sunday. From that point militancy was likely to increase and attitudes to harden. It would in any event be difficult to defend refusing to concede the National Union of railwaymen&apos;s claim for a basic wage of  20 per week instead of the 19*50 per week offered by the BRB so far, especially since theadditional cost was likely to be no more than  100,000. If therail unions did not agree to arbitration when they saw the Secretaryof State for Employment that afternoon, officials might therefore seek to ascertain from the union representatives the terms on whichthey might be prepared to reach a settlement, including the hypothesis that the railwaymen&apos;s basic wage might be increased to  20 a weekbut without any consequential adjustment in differentials. On theother hand it was suggested that a go-slow following a refusal ofarbitration by the unions would expose the railwaymen to consider-able public criticism and might not be maintained. There was considerable public support for arbitration; and it was therefore important to avoid creating any impression at this stage that, withoutarbitration, the Government were prepared to contemplate some improvement in the BRB&apos;s generous 11 per cent offer, which already provided railwaymen with a minimum earnings guarantee of  20 * 50per week. Moreover, ASLEF in particular would be concerned toensure that differentials above the basic wage would in fact hepreserved; and it was unlikely, therefore, that an agreed settlement with all the unions could be secured simply by increasing the basicwage to  20 per week without maintaining differentials.In further discussion the following main points were made (a) Under the Industrial Relations Act the Industrial RelationsCourt could order a &quot;cooling-off&quot; period only if there was actual or threatened breach of contracts of employment.   It was not clear whether the industrial action now proposed by the rail unions would
in itself involve such a breach; but it seemed likely that, if this action was at all effective, contracts of employment would be breached inpractice once the action began. The purpose of a &quot;cooling-off&quot;period, however, was to allow time for a dispute to be settled and notmerely to postpone the effects of industrial action. It would there-fore be permissible to apply for a &quot;cooling-off&quot; period only if it wereenvisaged as providing an opportunity to promote some form of conciliation; it would not be appropriate if it was proposed simply to stand firm on the BRB&apos;s 11 per cent offer. Moreover, if a &quot; cooling-off&quot; order was obtained and the unions withdrew their instructionsprovoking breaches of contract, the railwaymen might neverthelesspersist unofficially with damaging industrial action. Even so, thepossibility of securing a &quot; cooling-off&quot; period in the face of the unions&apos;latest decisions should be considered urgently.(b) A ballot could be called for under the Industrial relations act even if contracts of employment were not breached. A postal ballot of railwaymen, however, would be difficult to organise becausethe BRB had no central record of the names and addresses of their employees; and the results of a ballot at workplaces was unlikely to favour acceptance of the BRB offer. It might be possible, however,to organise a ballot on the question whether the dispute should betaken to arbitration; and such a ballot might be more likely to resultin arbitration, especially in the light of Press publicity in favour ofthis course. Contingency arrangements for a ballot, if possible by post, should therefore be pursued urgently with the BRB.(c) It was essential that the fairness of the BRB 11 per cent offer should be made clear to public opinion, together with the fact that under the railway industry&apos;s negotiating procedures the three-manarbitration tribunal would include two individuals, including theChairman, who had been nominated by the rail unions. It was theresponsibility of the BRB to justify to public opinion the details oftheir offer; but, given the latest developments and the insufficienteffort made by the BRB so far to secure favourable publicity for their case, the Government would need to ensure that satisfactory arrangements were made to present it more effectively. It would be helpful if the Chancellor of the Exchequer took occasion in a publicspeech that evening to relate the dispute to the Governments general policies to contain inflation, to emphasise the fair and generousnature of the offers already made to the rail unions and to remind thepublic of the available arbitration procedures.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that at his meeting with the rail unions that afternoonthe Secretary of State for Employment should press them strongly toagree that the dispute should be resolved under the industry&apos;s standingarbitration arrangements. In any ensuing discussions Departmentof Employment officials should explore the unions&apos; intentions abouta conciliated settlement without arbitration by seeking to ascertainwhy they had rejected the Board&apos;s obviously generous offer ratherthan by exploring the acceptability of possible improvements in its terms. In order to reinforce the Secretary of State for Employmentsintervention the Government and the BRB should henceforward bringmaximum pressure to bear on the rail unions, both directly and
through the force of public opinion, to induce them to call off the threatened industrial action before it took effect at midnight on sunday, 16 April. The Secretary of State for the Environmentshould ensure that the BRB now launched a vigorous campaign topublicise the facts of their offer and its benefits for railwaymen,stressing in particular the minimum earnings guarantee of  20*50for all adult railwaymen. While the detailed exposition of the offermust remain the responsibility of the BRB, the Secretary of State forthe Environment should now also arrange for the salient facts aboutrailwaymen&apos;s pay to be made available to Conservative Members ofParliament and Conservative Parliamentery candidates. The Chan-cellor of the Exchequer should make a public speech that evening,in which he would bring out these salient facts and put them in the context of the national interest by re-emphasising the dangers of continuing inflation. The Secretary of State for the Environment, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Employment and the solicitor General, should obtain from the BRB full details of theindustry&apos;s procedural agreements on arbitration, the terms of rail-waymen&apos;s contracts of employment and the industry&apos;s working rules;and, in the light of the Board&apos;s advice about the likely scope andeffects of the threatened industrial action, the Solicitor general should assess whether it would be justifiable to make application tothe Industrial Court for a cooling-off order or, alternatively, for a ballot order under which members of the unions would be ballotedon their willingness to accept reference of the dispute to arbitration.In order to keep developments under review and to adjust theGovernments response accordingly he would establish a small group of Ministers under his own chairmanship.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion, and invited the Ministers concerned to be guided accordingly.Report ofthe review body onArmed forces pay andAllowancesSECRET5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Defence (CP (72) 41), to which was attached the report ofthe Review Body on Armed Forces Pay and Allowances.The Secretary of State for Defence said that the Armed forces pay Review Body had been set up in September 1971 to advise thePrime Minister on the pay and allowances of-Servicemen up to the rank of Brigadier and had been asked to relate its first review to1 April 1972. Its report, based on detailed job evaluation andcomparison with civilian analogues, recommended increases averagingabout 18J per cent from the level of 1 April 1970 when Service paywas last reviewed by the National Board for Prices and Incomes.This average represented about 9 per cent a year compound over thetwo-year period; but, since the Armed Forces had received a flat rateinterim increase of 7 per cent in August 1971, the average increaseremaining due from 1 April 1972 was between 10 and 11 per cent,
although individual increases ranged more widely. The report also recommended increased charges for food and accommodation; and, ifthese were taken into account, the average net increase in pay wouldbe rather less than 9 per cent a year. The Government had under-taken to accept reports of Pay Review Bodies unless there were clear and compelling reasons for not doing so. The recommendations in the present instance were modest; and the Ministerial steering committee on Pay Negotiations had agreed that they should beaccepted and that the report, together with the Governmenfsacceptance of it, should be made public on 20 April. He would agree the terms of his announcement with the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Secretary of State for Employment and the lord privy Seal.In the course of a brief discussion it was agreed that the recom-mendations of the report should be accepted. Provided that itwas made sufficiently clear that the average net increase in pay wouldbe below 9 per cent, the Governmenfs endorsement of the proposals should not constitute any embarrassment in relation to the currentdispute about the pay of railwaymen and might, indeed, be helpful in that context.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet agreed that the report,together with the Governmenfs acceptance of it, should be made public on 20 April and need not await announcement of the Govern-ment s decisions on the report of the Top Salaries Review Body,which would have to be separately considered by the Cabinet at alater meeting.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministefs summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of State for defence to proceed accordingly.GovernmentStrategy,the Work ofthe central policy review staff andthe EarlyWarningSystemSECRET6. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Central policy review Staff (CPRS) about Government strategy (CP (72) 17); a review of the first years work of the CPRS and their proposals for1972-73 (CP (72) 18); and the Early Warning System (CP (72) 16).The Prime Minister said that the Ministerial Committee on theCentral Capability had generally endorsed the outline programme forfurther work and discussion set out in paragraphs 4-6 of CP (72) 17.The next discussion of the Governmenfs general strategy might appropriately take place in mid-May, by which time it would bepossible to take account of the initial impact of the Budget. Thepurpose of the review would be to provide the impetus for work onoutstanding areas of difficulty to be pressed forward during the summer in time for proposals for necessary action to be embodied inThe Queen&apos;s Speech at the opening of the next Parliamentary Session.In addition to considering the Governmenfs broad programme ofaction for the remaining years of the present Parliament in relation
to their strategic objectives Ministers would need to give particular attention to the question of resource allocation.The CPRS&apos; programme of work and proposals for extramuralstudy for 1972-73, as indicated in Annexes B and C of CP (72) 18, had also been generally endorsed by the Committee, subject to priordiscussion of the individual items with the Departments concerned.Items 2 and 5 of Annex C, dealing with measures to protect thelosers from inflation and marginal rates of taxation at low income levels, had already been dealt with by discussion with the Chancellorof the Exchequer. In CP (72) 16 the CPRS had developed the early warning System along the lines agreed by the Cabinet at their meeting on 21 September 1971; and the Committee had approved the proposals in principle.In discussion it was suggested that it was in principle undesirable to establish ad hoc Ministerial groups to consider matters whichwere within the competence of established Committees and that thediscussion of some of the specific aspects of Government strategyproposed in the latter part of CP (72) 17 might more suitably beundertaken by the appropriate Standing Committees. It was recognised, however, that the work of these Committees might usefully be supplemented, on occasion, by more free-rangingdiscussions of the kind envisaged.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the broad conclusions of the Ministerial Com-mittee on the Central Capability on CP (72) 17, CP (72) 18 and cp (72) 16, subject to the point made in discussion.Notwithstanding the general discussion of the Governmentsstrategy which it was proposed to arrange in mid-May, currentwork on the legislative programme for 1972-73 should be pressed forward without delay.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
