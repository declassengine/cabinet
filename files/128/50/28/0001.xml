Mr. Smith had not dismissedour suggestion that he might gradually bring the African community to adopt a more constructive view of our proposals; and, if this couldbe achieved, the situation in Rhodesia might develop in such a way that at a later stage we might be able to conclude that a settlementbased broadly upon those proposals could be made. But the chances of such a development were small; and our wisest course for the timebeing would be to leave all options open.In discussion it was agreed that sanctions formed an integral part of the status quo and that, so long as no new situation had arisen, they would have to be maintained. Nevertheless, it was tobe expected that their continuation would be criticised, particularly since the United States Government had acquiesced in a breach ofthe policy of international sanctions by perrnitting the import ofRhodesian chrome. If necessary, it could be announced that wewere prepared to consider some relaxation of sanctions on purelyhumanitarian grounds. It was recognised that, despite Mr. Smith&apos;srelatively moderate initial reactions to the Pearce Report, he might feel obliged, under pressure from his more extreme supporters, toreassert his authority by taking measures against the Africancommunity which would be regarded by international opinion as* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET*The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary (CP (72) 55), to which was appended thedraft of a Parliamentary Statement on the Pearce Report about the outcome of the Test of Acceptability of the proposed constitutional settlement in Rhodesia.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there were two possible policies which his statement could propound. He could make it clear that, in the view of the British Government, time wouldbe required for the Pearce Report to be studied and discussed bothin the United Kingdom and in Rhodesia and that meanwhile ourrelations with the regime in Salisbury would remain unchanged, withthe consequence that sanctions would have to be maintained.Alternatively, he could indicate that we had done our best to achieve a settlement which was in conformity with the Five Principles butthat, since this had proved impossible, we were proposing to renounceour responsibilities in Rhodesia and to make no further proposals for political progress in that country. He favoured the former course,which accordingly formed the basis of the draft appended to cp (72) 55. It was necessary, however, to decide whether or notexplicit reference should be made in the Parliamentary Statement tothe fact that maintenance of the status quo would involve the renewal in the following November of the Order imposing sanctionsunless a new situation had arisen before then.
discriminatory and repressive. Time would therefore be required ifwe were to be able to gauge how the situation developed and to what extent the Africans, many of whom appeared not yet to haveunderstood the full import of the proposals, came to believe that asettlement would be in their interest.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary shouldmake a statement indicating that we accepted the finding of thePearce Commission that a settlement based on the proposals agreed with Mr. Smith would not be acceptable to the people of rhodesia  a whole; that in our view the Pearce Report nevertheless meriteddetailed study; and that an interval should now be permitted forfurther reflection by all sections of the Rhodesian population.Meanwhile, unless a new situation arose our relations with the rhodesian regime would remain on their existing basis, which would naturally involve the continuation of sanctions. The parliamentary statement need not specify at this stage, however, that the Orderimposing sanctions would necessarily be renewed in the followingNovember; nor need it commit the Government about the courseof action which they might find it expedient to adopt if our efforts to achieve an acceptable settlement ended in failure.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion, and invited the Secretary of Statefor Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office,22 May, 1972.
