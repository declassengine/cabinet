SECRET AND PERSONALONE COPY ONLYMOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORDTOCC(81) 34th CONCLUSIONSThursday 29 October 1981CONFIDENTIALITYOF CABINETPROCEEDINGSPreviousReference;CC(81) 24thConclusionsBefore the Cabinet proceeded to the order of the day,  THE PRIMEMINISTER drew attention to the reports in the previous week&apos;sPress and broadcasting media about the proceedings at the meetingof the Cabinet held on Tuesday 20 October.    She recalled that atthe conclusion of the previous week&apos;s discussion of the economicsituation and public expenditure it had been agreed that nothingshould be said to the Press other than that discussions would con-tinue (including bilateral discussions between DepartmentalMinisters and the Treasury) on levels of public expenditure for1982-83 and subsequent years.    It had been pointed out that anyunauthorised disclosure of the proceedings in more detail couldaffect financial markets - as in the event it had - and the outcomeof the by-election in Croydon.    Despite that agreement, full reportshad appeared, in the first instance in Independent Television Newson the evening of the day on which the meeting had been held, thenin The Times the following morning, and subsequently in othernewspapers.     Certain aspects of what had been published couldhave come only from someone who was present at the meeting.This was not the first occasion on which there had been damagingbreaches of the confidentiality of Cabinet proceedings.     The Cabinetshould understand the implications.    If what was said inside theCabinet Room was to be systematically disclosed outside it, thetime would come when members of Cabinet would not feel able tospeak their minds freely; the Cabinet would cease to be a gatheringin which major issues of policy could be discussed, and more resortwould have to be had to discussion in smaller groups.    If anymember of the Cabinet was knowingly engaged in activities whichcould result in such disclosures to the Press, the only honourablecourse was for him to resign.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, supportingthe Prime Minister,  said that Ministers must be able to disagreein Cabinet and reach compromises among themselves without havingto be concerned about the risk that the proceedings would be widelyreported in public.     If that could not be the case, it put all membersof the Cabinet in an impossible position, and undermined the con-fidence which should subsist among Cabinet colleagues.    He recallethat at the previous meeting he had specifically suggested thatMinisters should not even tell people in their own Departments orPrivate Offices what had passed.1SECRET AND PERSONAL
SECRET AND PERSONALIn discussion there was general support for what had been said bythe reports that had appeared.    It was impossible to exaggerate thedamage done in markets, in the Croydon by-election and to themorale of the Government&apos;s supporters in the House of Commons.There was no doubt that the reports of dissension and division in theCabinet had had a damaging effect on the morale of Party workers inthe Croydon by-election and of the Government&apos;s supporters up anddown the country.     The Cabinet faced the prospect of difficultdiscussions and decisions in the coming months, particularly in theeconomic field;   they must be free to discuss these matters and toreach conclusions, without the risk of unauthorised disclosures whichwould diminish the effects which the decisions were intended to have.The danger was not just of direct disclosures to the Press.     It wasclear that members of the Press talked around widely, with a view togleaning information not only from members of the Cabinet themselvesbut also from others to whom members of the Cabinet had talked aboutthe proceedings, as they thought in confidence.    As a result of thisprocess, much of what was reported was at third or fourth hand, andthe stories which appeared in the Press were not only damaging butalso distorted.THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion,  said that it mustbe the general hope and wish of the Cabinet that the kind of thing whichhad happened after the previous meeting should not happen again. Ifit recurred, the consequences for the future conduct of businesswould be both considerable and regrettable.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office4 November 1981-2-SECRET AND PERSONAL
