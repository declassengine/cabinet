Copy No. I of 5 CopiesMOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORDTOCC(81) 20th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 4Thursday 21 May 1981CIVILSERVICEPAYPreviousReference:CC(81) 19thCollusions,Mfmite 4THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that at the mainconferences of the Civil Service unions motions had been passed at themwhich would enable the unions to step up the severity of their action ifthe leadership so decided.     Decisions on whether there should in factbe an intensification of action were reserved to the Council of CivilService Unions (CCSU) who would be meeting early in the following weekto decide the course of action to follow.     The conference resolutionsenvisaged the possibility of a full-scale strike lasting for five days; onbalance he judged it improbable that the unions would follow this coursebecause only a minority of civil servants might actually comply withsuch a decision.     An all-out strike for a shorter period or intensifica-tion of selected action on present lines was more likely.    The fact thatthere was a gap of a few days between the ending of the unionconferences and the implementation of any decision to intensify actionmight be thought to offer an early opportunity to open discussions, butthis might not prove to be feasible, given the attitude adopted at theunion conferences and the CCSU&apos;s internal arrangements (whereby allthe unions had to be represented at any talks with Government).     It wastherefore now likely that the situation would get worse before it gotbetter, and the dispute would probably last for some time yet. Therewas little alternative for Government but to sit matters out and awaitdevelopments.     In the meantime contingency plans to mitigate theeffects of the strike were operating well, and thought was being given toa number of possibilities for action by Government when the momentseemed opportune.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY reported that there was littlechange in the situation in the revenue Departments.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE reported that the air trafficcontrollers&apos; action in the dispute had settled down to a pattern.Heathrow Airport was regularly disrupted but Gatwick Airport wasworking normally for most of the time.     The dispute was causingfinancial loss to the airlines and one American airline was seekingcompensation from the Government.    Subject to legal advice, it wasunlikely that they had a substantive case for this.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thesituation at the Passport Office was deteriorating, particularly inrelation to applications for new passports.Saca\txs a
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that his mainproblems concerned the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Centre atSwansea.    Mail was now getting in and out, but it had not yet beenpossible to get in new supplies of nitrogen.     For the public the mainproblem was that new drivers were unable to get provisional drivinglie ences.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said thathis Department&apos;s computer at Guildford was now affected.     The actionthere was preventing the payment of grants to farmers and the paymentof Monetary Compensation Amounts to the trade.     Farmers were alsobeing deprived of Value Added Tax refunds.    While the action had onlyjust started, the sums of money were significant in relation to farmers&apos;incomes.There was some discussion both of the measures which the Governmentmight take in response to further escalation and of the basis on which theGovernment should seek to settle the dispute, but no conclusions werereached or required.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that no further steps should be taken by theGovernment in the present dispute until the scale and nature of any actionto be taken by the Civil Service unions following the meeting of the CCSUnext week were known.     The Cabinet would revert to the issues asnecessary after the Recess.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office26 May 19812
