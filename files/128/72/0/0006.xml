Copy No 1 of 2 copiesSECRETMOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORDTOCC(81) 24th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTEThursday 18 June 1981CONFIDENTIALITY      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY drew attentionOF CABINET to the reports in the Press and broadcasting media the previousPROCEEDINGS afternoon and that morning on the Cabinet&apos;s discussion of economicstrategy on 17 June.    If the proceedings of the Cabinet were tocontinue to be divulged in that degree of detail, the confidentialitywhich was necessary to sustain confidence and trust among colleaguescould no longer be sustained.     This could have a serious effect uponthe readiness of members of the Cabinet to disclose confidentialinformation and to speak their minds at meetings of the Cabinet.In discussion there was much support for what the Foreign andCommonwealth Secretary had said.    It was not just that the accountsin the newspapers had put a gloss on the proceedings, in terms ofreports that the views of one group had prevailed against those ofanother, but there had also been factual accounts of the nature of theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s paper, the order in which Ministershad spoken and the content of what they had said.    No doubt membersof the Parliamentary Lobby acted like a team of sleuths, piecingtogether information from different sources.    It would be unwise tosuppose that Press Officers were to blame, and the stories appearedin the Press long before the minutes were circulated.    The sourcesof the information must be among those who were present at themeeting, and the channels by which the information reached the Pressmust be assumed to be primarily political.    It was suggested thatmembers of the Cabinet needed to brief their junior Ministers andParliamentary Private Secretaries about the outcome of meetings ofthe Cabinet, in order that they should be able to defend Governmentpolicies;  but briefings of this kind needed to be undertaken with greatcaution, if they were not to become sources of unauthorised andunwanted disclosures to the Press.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that, inview of the interest taken by the Press in the meeting of the previousday&apos;s Cabinet, it had been necessary for her Press Secretary to giveguidance to the Lobby after the meeting.    She had told the Cabinetat the meeting the nature of the guidance to be given;   and the guidancewhich he had actually given followed what she had said, going beyondit only to the extent of emphasising the need for keeping publicexpenditure under control.    While it was necessary for the conductof Government that decisions taken by the Cabinet should be1SECRET
SECRETdisseminated to those required to take action upon them, and while itwas no doubt on occasion desirable that some indication of the reasonsfor the Cabinet&apos;s decisions should be given to Ministerial colleaguesor senior officials before the minutes were circulated, the generalrule should be,   as it had been in the past, that junior Ministers andsenior officials should rely upon the circulated minutes for theirknowledge of Cabinet decisions and the reasons for them. Membersof the Cabinet should be extremely cautious about divulging detailsof proceedings in Cabinet, even to Ministerial colleagues in theirown Departments, and should not in any circumstances disclosethem to journalists.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office19 June 19812SECRET
