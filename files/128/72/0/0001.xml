Copy No. /  of 3 copiesSECRETMOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORDTOCC(81) 7th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 4Thursday, 19 February 1981INDUSTRIAL        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the NationalAFFAIRS Coal Board&apos;s (NCB) recent announcement of a programme of pitclosures had been seized on by militants in the National Union ofMineworkers (NUM) as an excuse for confrontation with theCoal Government.     There had been much distortion and misrepresentationof the NCB proposals and consequently much fear and concern amongordinary mineworkers.     Unofficial strikes had occurred and it hadrapidly become apparent that a full-scale de facto national coal strikewould have begun on the following Monday, 23 February, if steps hadnot been taken to defuse the situation.    Consequently after consultingthe Prime Minister and other senior colleagues he had taken part theprevious evening in joint talks with the NCB and the three miningunions.    His remit had been to make the minimum concessionsnecessary to avoid a national coal strike.    In the event he had felt itnecessary to make two statements.    First that, while coal importswould in any case fall from l\ million tonnes in 1980 to b\ milliontonnes in 1981, the Government would be prepared to look, with aview to movement, at what could be done to reduce this figuretowards its irreducible minimum, ie those qualities of coal notproduced domestically;   and second that the NCB and the unions shouldstand back from the Government&apos;s financial constraints and discuss apattern of proposals for closures consistent with Plan for Coal and thesevere economic realities.     In this event the Government would beprepared to discuss the financial constraints with an open mind andalso with a view to movement.    Under continued pressure from theunion side, Sir Derek Ezra had then said that in the light of theGovernment&apos;s willingness to review the financial constraints on theindustry the NCB would withdraw their closure proposals and re- .Jexamine the position in consultation with the unions.     The Secretaryof State for Energy concluded that, while he could not be certain thatthese concessions would avert a national strike, he was sure thatnothing less would have done so.     It had been agreed that the threeparties should meet again on the following Wednesday, 25 February.In discussion there was unanimous support for the decisions takenand the actions of the Secretary of State for Energy.     A national coalstrike at this juncture would have been very damaging, not least toprivate firms struggling to cope with the recession.     Thus, while theposition reached could have unfortunate repercussions, the alternativewould have been far worse.1SECRET
SECRETIn further discussion the following main points were made:-a. The Government had been seriously misled by priorassurances from the NCB that an accelerated closureprogramme would be accepted, albeit reluctantly, by theminers.     The reality was that the NCB had gambled andlost.b. It was important to recognise that the NCB had notpromised to halt pit closures but to discuss them with theNUM against the background of Plan for Coal.    This hadenvisaged closures and Mr Gormley, the President of theNUM, had publicly acknowledged that some closures werenecessary.c. The present settlement could have repercussionselsewhere.     The fishing industry, for example, mightseize on the Government&apos;s willingness to take action oncoal imports as a precedent for the action they wanted onimports of fish.     Moreover, although pay and closureswere different matters,  some unions, eg in the water industry,might be encouraged to adopt a more militant approach totheir current pay negotiations.THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion,  said thatCabinet endorsed the action taken by the Secretary of State for EnergyIt had been reported during the meeting of the Cabinet that the NUMExecutive had rejected that morning a proposal to ballot the mine-workers seeking endorsement for an all-out strike and this news waswelcome.     Nevertheless the situation would remain delicate for sometime and unofficial action might be continued in some areas.    It wasthus necessary for the Government to be very circumspect in publiccomment, even though this might mean that, for the time being, theycould not deploy a full response to critics among their own supporters.The best course would be to stick closely to the words used by theSecretary of State for Energy and to avoid gloss or interpretation.A robust defence of the Government&apos;s actions at this time might wellundermine elements in the NUM who were doing their best to controlthe situation.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.2SECRET
SECRETTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT saidthat the indications were that the General and Municipal &quot;WorkersUnion - the largest in the water industry - would reject thecurrent pay offer of 10 per cent, though opinion in the other twomain unions involved was more evenly balanced.     The NationalWater Council (NWC) would be meeting the unions formally on2 5 February, and Sir Robert Marshall, Chairman of the NWC,would aim to achieve a negotiated settlement at that meeting,without giving the union side an option for a further protractedround of consultation with their members.   Sir Robert Marshallhad indicated that it might be necessary for the NWC to offer11 per cent, or even 12 per cent to achieve a settlement, andhad been left in no doubt that the Government attached greatimportance to achieving the lowest practicable figure.    It wasdesirable that the gas industry negotiating meeting on 24 Februarshould not result in an enhanced offer which would encourage thesame unions, representing the water workers, to attempt toleapfrog it at their meeting with the NWC on the following day.In discussion, it was suggested that in spite of the resultsemerging from the union consultation, the mass of water workersmight be unwilling to face the consequences of an all-out strike.The Government should do more to mobilise publicity about theconsequences of a strike for the public, and the reasonablenessof the pay increase now offered in comparison with that availableto many other workers who, moreover, did not enjoycomparable security of employment.    It was noted that theattitude of supervisory staff, whose co-operation would be vitalin maintaining supplies if the manuals withdrew their labour,was still uncertain and difficult to predict.    In Scotland, howeverthe supervisors were local authority employees and in some casesubject to a closed shop.    It might be particularly difficult forthem to co-operate with the Government even if they wanted to.The Cabinet -PRIVATE THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY reported that theSECTOR STEEL British Steel Corporation (BSC) and Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds,had now reached agreement on a joint company to rationalisetheir rod, bar and wire interests, and an announcement wouldbe made on 20 February.     The new company would be of asubstantial size and would be in the private sector.    The BSCwas also engaged in discussions of other possibilities forcollaboration with the private sector, but these were not yet3NEGOTATIONSIN THE WATERINDUSTRYPreviousReference:CC(81) 1stConclusions,Minute 5SECRET
SECRETfinalised.     The agreement reached and those which might followwould reduce the level of complaints about unfair competition fromthe BSC,  some of which were in any case misconceived becausemuch of the real competition came from imports. Neverthelessthe BSC were very conscious of the need to avoid charges of unfaircompetition and Mr MacGregor had undertaken to look personallyat any complaints raised by Members of Parliament.Finally,-   the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY stressed thatthe information which he had given Cabinet was commerciallysensitive and should be rigorously safeguarded until announcementswere made.The Cabinet -3.
