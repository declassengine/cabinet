Copy No. I    of 4 CopiesSECRETMOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORDTOCC(81) Zlst CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 5Thursday 4 June 1981CIVILSERVICEPAYPreviousReference:0;(81) 20thConclusions,Minute 4THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Council ofCivil Service Unions had given notice on 26 May that, unlessnegotiations took place or arbitration was agreed by 8 June, they wouldextend their present selective industrial action to areas of work whichhad not hitherto been affected.     They had, however, asked for talkswith the Civil Service Department with a view to seeing whether thedispute could be resolved without resort to such further action.     In thelight of those talks, he judged that a majority of the leaders of the9 Civil Service Unions were genuine in their wish to bring the dispute toan end and that they had not asked for a resumption of discussions simplyto try to regain some public support for their ca.se.    Although the detailswere still for discussion, it was likely that agreement could be reachedon wide-ranging terms of reference for an inquiry into the longer termarrangements for determining Civil Service pay.     The unions wouldexpect that arbitration would be again available to them in 1982 but theyappeared to recognise that the Government had to retain ultimate controlof Civil Service pay a.nd, therefore, to have a power to override, subjectto Parliament approval, an arbitral award.    He judged that from 1981they might be willing to recommend their members to accept an increaseof l\ per cent, but not the 7 per cent which the Government had so faroffered.     After careful examination of the figures, he was satisfied thata l\ per cent increase could be accommodated within a cash limit of6 per cent without further planned reductions in Civil Service staffnumbers;   this was now possible because the run down of numbers hadproved to be faster than had been assumed earlier in the year. Theadditional \ per cent would cost about  25 million for the industrial andnon-industrial Service together.    He would offer an increase ofl\ per cent only if, following prior soundings, he was satisfied that unionleaders would be willing to put it to their members, albeit without arecommendation, and that this was likely to lead to an end to the dispute.He invited the Cabinet to give him authority for this course of action. If,on the other hand, he could offer no further concessions he saw no chanceof a settlement being reached and the certainty of an escalation in theindustrial action.     After a few months it might well be that this actionwould collapse and the Government could impose a settlement, but thiswould be at the expense of increasing costs to the Government and ofincreasing criticism from the public.1SECRET
SECRETIn discussion of the increase to be offered for 1981 the following werethe main points made in support of increasing the offer to l\ per cent:-a. The resumed talks between the unions and the CivilService Department had offered a possibility, which wasopen until 8 June, of bringing the dispute to an end. Whileindustrial opinion would obviously prefer a settlement of7 per cent it was likely that they would find a settlement ofless than 8 per cent acceptable, particularly if this couldbe accommodated within the 6 per cent cash limit on CivilService pay which the Government had always made clearwas the primary discipline on the Civil Service pay bill.A settlement of l\ per cent would be the same as that reachedfor local authority manual workers and for the teachers. Ifits award was effective in bringing the present dispute to anend, it would be widely regarded as a very successful outcomefor the Government.b. If no concessions were made, the present, relativelymoderate, Civil Service Union leaders would lose the supportof their membership.    The Government would then riskfacing, both in the present dispute and in later years, a muchmore hostile and militant union leadership.    It could bedamaging to the Government if, as a result of a protracteddispute, its relationship with its employees was soured andembittered.c. If the industrial action were to be escalated the costs,and the disruptions to services, would increase sharply.Failures to record national insurance contributions werealready making it impossible to determine the level of pensionsto be paid.    Short term benefits could not be calculatedaccurately and, while under-payments would have to be madegood, it would be very difficult to claw back over-payments,with the result that net public expenditure would increase.If action were to be escalated in Department of Employmentand Social Security offices, it might become impossible tointroduce from April 1982 the taxation of unemployment benefit;and the uprating of social security benefits and the payment ofchild benefit could be affected.    Farmers&apos; cash flow wasalready suffering from delays in payments due to them.Contracts for work to be carried out by private sector firmswere not being issued, and some firms could go out of businessas a result.    Industrial action by the air traffic controllerswas continuing and the airlines had already lost  20 millionrevenue which would increase to  45 million if the action wereto continue for another four weeks.    Emergency legislationwould be necessary to deal with the delays in processing casesin the Scottish courts.2SECRET
SECRETThe main arguments in support of making no increase beyond thepresent offer of 7 per cent were:-d. Even if l\ per cent could be accommodated within a6 per cent cash limit, the Government was firmly committedto its offer of 7 per cent.    A further increase now would bewidely criticised as unnecessary and as weak.    Although theshort-fall on revenue,  resulting from action by the staff ofthe Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise, was now in theorder of  3 - 2&gt;\ billion, most of this would be recoupedlater in the year when the action was over;   the monetaryfigures which were due to be published shortly were likelyto strike commentators as being surprisingly good, andwould undermine the unions&apos; claims that their action wasdamaging the Government&apos;s economic policies.     The unions&apos;morale was declining and their confidence weakened by therealisation that public opinion generally supported theGovernment and that this support could be reinforced if theaction were to be escalated.    Against this background,industrial, financial and Conservative Party back-benchopinion was likely to be highly critical of any increase inthe present offer of 7 per cent.    Local authorities, whichhad conformed with the Government&apos;s objective that theyshould reach pay settlements within their cash limits, wouldbe critical if the Government were now to go back on itsdeclared intention of giving no more than 7 per cent to itsown employees.    Any increase beyond 7 per cent would addconsiderably to the present difficulties of reaching a settle-ment of 6 per cent for the National Health Service groups.e. Even if the union leadership were to recommend theirmembers to accept l\ per cent, there was no guarantee thatthis would be accepted.     The Government would then be facedwith the prospect of either continuing industrial action or yetfurther concessions.     It was, moreover, questionable whethera l\ per cent increase could be accommodated within a6 per cent cash limit.    The present assumptions could provewrong if later in the year new demands - for example, forthe payment of unemployment benefit - were to check the fallin staff numbers.f. In standing firm on the present offer the Governmentcould continue to point out that two substantial concessions hadalready been offered to the unions.    It had been agreed thatthere should be greater flexibility in 1982 in the operation ofcash limits.    A wide ranging and independent inquiry had beenoffered with a view to introducing new arrangements for thelonger term.    (Although it was noted that the unions could wellregard this as more likely to bring benefits to the Governmentrather than to themselves. )3SECRET
SECRET\In further discussion the following were the main points made:-g. Consideration should now be given to imposing, witheffect from April 1981, the proposed 7 per cent increasefor the non-industrial Civil Service.    It was likely thatindustrial civil servants would then also accept 7 per centfrom July 1981.     The risk of this course was that civilservants would receive increased pay but many of them mightcontinue to support industrial action for more concessions.The alternative of imposing a 7 per cent settlement on thosewho were working at a specified date would lead to the drawingof invidious and unsatisfactory distinctions;   many of thosewho were purporting to work were in practice supportingcontinuing industrial action.h. There were considerable disadvantages in offeringarbitration,  subject to Parliamentary override, in 1982.In practice it could be very difficult for the Government tosecure Parliamentary approval for the overriding of anarbitral award which was higher than the Government wouldwish but not so much higher as to be patently unacceptable.If as a result the Civil Service were to receive increases in1982 higher than those for which the Government had planned,public expenditure would increase (or other public expenditureprogrammes would have to be cut back) and there would be anadverse effect on other pay settlements, both in the publicsector and the private. ;THE PRIME MINISTER summing up the discussion said that the Cabinetagreed on balance that there should be no increase in the present offer,to which the Government was firmly and publicly committed, of7 per cent for the non-industrial Civil Service from April 1981. Theyfurther agreed that there should be no commitment to arbitration on payin 1982;   such a commitment, even if it were subject to Parliamentaryoverride, could prove to be extremely costly both in terms of the CivilService pay bill and the consequences for other pay settlements. Inexplaining its decision to s tand firm on the present offer, the Governmenthad an excellent case to deploy:  in addition to offering a 7 per cent payincrease in 1981, it had accepted greater flexibility in the operation ofthe cash limit system in 1982, and proposed an independent and wide-ranging inquiry into the arrangements for the longer term. Moreoverit was the case that civil servants enjoyed greater job security thanprivate sector employees, had the benefit of inflation proofed pensionsand benefitted in : many cases from the system of annual increments.It was also relevant that the 7 per cent pay increase on offer to themrepresented something nearer to a 10 per cent increase in annual paycompared with last year when the agreed increase had been staged. Ifthe dispute continued it would be necessary to consider further the casefor imposing the settlement of 7 per cent with effect from 1 April 1981.4SECRET
SECRETThe Cabinet -Agreed:-1. That there should be no increase in the offerof 7 per cent on the pay of non-industrial civilservants from April 1981.2. That no undertaking should be given to allowarbitration on Civil Service pay in 1982.Cabinet Office4 June 19815SECRET
