Copy No. V of 4 CopiesMOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORDTOCC(81) 12th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 4Thursday 19 March 1981CIVILSERVICEDISPUTEPreviousReference:CC(81) 11thConclusions,Minute 4THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the contingencyarrangements to deal with the current industrial action in the CivilService were generally working satisfactorily, with Departmentson notice to consult the Civil Service Department on any unexpectedor major difficulties.    An interdepartmental group of officials wouldbe putting forward recommendations in early April for an ordered andagreed system of pay determination in the longer term and, ifnecessary, for interim arrangements in 1982.     Pending considerationof these proposals, which could form a basis for resolving the presentdispute, he recommended that so far as possible the Governmentshould avoid doing anything which might provoke the unions toescalate their industrial action.     A problem had, however, arisen inthe Inland Revenue which could call for action which might lead toescalation.     Under the contingency arrangements now in force 80 percent of Pay As You Earn (PAYE) revenue was still flowing and,provided that the banking unions did not succeed in making good theirthreat to take action in sympathy with the Civil Service unions, thesearrangements should continue to work.     They did not, however,provide for dealing with the remaining 20 per cent of revenue whichwas made up of relatively small cheques sent in a total of around900, 000 separate letters a month.     The Inland Revenue judged thataction should now be taken to deal with these receipts, if those staffcurrently helping under the contingency arrangements were not to losemorale.     They recommended that the letters should be diverted to250 local offices where a total of 9, 000 staff would be asked onFriday 20 March to deal with them.     If they refused to do so, theywould be issued with Temporary Relief from Duty (TRD) notices onMonday 23 March and, if necessary,  sent home under the TRDprocedures on the following day.     It was uncertain how the staffconcerned would respond and there was undoubtedly a risk that such amove would lead to escalation of industrial action both within theInland Revenue and elsewhere.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that of the normalPAYE receipts of about 2\ billion a month approximately 425 million were not being dealt with.     Those grades co-operatingunder the contingency arrangements were already facing criticismfrom the unions, and there had been a demonstration outside theInland Revenue&apos;s Bush House office that morning.     There was a risk
that their morale and their readiness to continue to co-operate withthe management would suffer if action were not taken to deal with the20 per cent of revenue outstanding.     If the measures proposed wereto lead to the suspension of 9, 000 staff, this would cost the unionsabout  750, 000 a week in supporting those suspended; thispressure on their funds could be helpful in bringing industrial actionto an end.THE ATTORNEY GENERAL said that it would be in order toimplement TRD arrangements for staff refusing to take on work of atype which they might normally be expected to carry out, providedthat they were not required to undertake an unreasonable amount ofovertime in order to do so.In discussion it was pointed out that it was a substantial achievementthat under the contingency arrangements 80 per cent of PAYE -revenue was unaffected.     It was unclear that the further actionproposed would have any useful effect;   if the 250 offices were alreadyfully occupied with their present workload, the staff could reasonablyclaim that they did not have time to deal with any extra work, theTRD procedures could not be operated, and extra receipts would notbe secured.     The Government&apos;s attempt to introduce the proposedarrangements, and any suspensions which did result, could howeverprovoke an escalation of industrial action before the Government wereready to come forward with the proposals for determining pay infuture years which might bring the present dispute to an end. Anypremature escalation of the dispute would add to the difficulties ofnegotiating the introduction of a revised system.     Rather than takeaction which might escalate the dispute at this stage, it would bebetter for the Government to emphasise its intention to put forwardproposals in April for new arrangements and to argue that thisjustified a reduction of industrial action in the meantime.In further discussion it was pointed out that the British BroadcastingCorporation&apos;s (BBC&apos;s) radio report of the demonstration that dayoutside Bush House had been biased in tone and unhelpful inrevealing how the envelopes containing high value cheques werecoded.     If the transcript of the broadcast bore out the impression ofbias, consideration should be given to complaining to the BBC.THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that for the time being the Inland Revenue should notattempt to introduce any special arrangements to deal with the 2 0 percent of PAYE payments which were not being handled during thepresent industrial action.2
The Cabinet -Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theLord President of the Council:i. To keep under review the InlandRevenue&apos;s arrangements for dealing withPay As You Earn receipts during the presentCivil Service industrial dispute and to reportfurther in the week beginning 23 March.ii. To consider whether the transcript ofthe British Broadcasting Corporation&apos;s radiobroadcast on the demonstration outside theInland Revenue&apos;s Bush House offices thatmorning justified complaints to theCorporation of bias in reporting.Cabinet Office20 March 19813
