CONFIDENTIALONE COPY ONLYMOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORDTOCC(81) 15th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 5Thursday 9 April 1981PAY OF MPs,MINISTERSAND JUNIORMINISTERS INTHE HOUSEOF LORDSPreviousReferences:CC(81) 2ndConclusions,Minute 7 andCC(81) 6thConclusions,Minute 1THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER ANDPAYMASTER GENERAL said that the Chairman of the TopSalaries Review Body (TSRB) had recently asked whether theGovernment still wished the Body to carry out a review ofMembers&apos; of Parliament (MPs&apos;) and Ministers&apos; pay for 1981.The House of Commons would expect there to be such a reviewin accordance with the Government&apos;s undertaking.    The bestoutcome in present circumstances would be for the TSRB not toput forward new salary levels but to recommend, as they haddone for other groups and would be willing to do for MPs, thefull implementation of their 1980 recommendations as soon aspossible.    The Review Body should, however, be asked to adviseon the updating of Parliamentary allowances.    It would then befor the Government to decide what recommendations, if any, tomake for MPs&apos; pay this year, bearing in mind that the resolutionpassed by the House of Commons last year meant that an MP&apos;ssalary would be increased from  11, 750 to  13,150 in June. Thiswould be an increase of 12 per cent but had to be compared withthe  13, 7 50 recommended in 1980 by the TSRB for the third stageof the implementation of their recommendations of the previousyear.    In their memorandum he and the Lord President had setout a number of options.    The House of Commons would expect afurther increase beyond that due to come into effect in June, andit was his considered judgment, with which the Chief Whip agreed,that the minimum acceptable increase would be a further increaseof 6 per cent on the third stage salary of  13,150 already due tocome into effect on 13 June, to  13,950.    If similar increaseswere given to Ministers, the resulting salaries would be thosedescribed in option D of his paper.In discussion it was argued, in support of an increase to  13, 950,that MPs still believed that they had been unfairly penalised bythe decision of the Government in 1979 to implement therecommendations then made by the TSRB in three annual stages.The Government had to be mindful of feelings in the House. Theyneeded the goodwill of their supporters in Parliament, and afurther prolonged dispute about MPs&apos; pay, in the course of whichthe Government might well be defeated, would be very damaging.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALOn the other hand it was argued that the Government ought not topropose any increase in MPs&apos; pay above the figure of  13, 150already agreed for next June (option B).    This would representan increase of about 12 per cent.    To propose any higher figurewould be seen to be quite out of line with other pay settlementsin both the public and the private sectors.    Any early announce-ment of such a proposed figure would make it more difficult toachieve satisfactory settlements in coming negotiations. Ifoption D were adopted MPs would receive  200 more than theTSRB had recommended in their 1980 report, while the pay ofsenior civil servants,  senior officers in the armed forces andthe judiciary, who were likely to receive a further increase ofonly about 6 per cent, would remain well below the figurerecommended by the TSRB for 1980.    The Government shouldnot be seen to envisage worse treatment for its own employeesthan for MPs.    Option B had the additional advantages of notrequiring any overt action by the Government and not producingfigures exactly corresponding, as option C would have done, withthose recommended by the TSRB.In further discussion, it was suggested that, before the Cabinettook a final decision, some informal and confidential soundingsshould be made of opinion in the House of Commons.    It wasobjected to this that to do so might lead to a renewed campaignfor much higher increases of the scale illustrated in option E,and any indication that MPs might receive increases of between15 per cent and 20 per cent would be a grave embarrassment toGovernment in current negotiations.    It might therefore be betterfor the Government to announce its decision, without consultation,at the appropriate time.THE PRIME MINISTER summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet agreed that the TSRB should be invited toproduce a new report on the pay of MPs and Ministers on the basisuggested in C(81) 13.    The Cabinet had had a useful preliminarydiscussion of the difficult problem of the pay of MPsfor 1981, andrecognised the importance of not being defeated in the House ofCommons on the issue.    The Cabinet were not yet in a positionto reach any decision and, since the matter could be deferreduntil some current negotiations had been completed, they agreedthat they would resume their discussion at a later date. Theycould not usefully give further consideration to the pay ofMinisters for 1981 until they had reached decisions on the pay ofMPs.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Cabinethad previously decided that an increase of about  3, 500 shouldbe made in the remuneration of Junior Ministers in the House ofLords, who did not receive any Parliamentary salary, and someof whom were in considerable financial difficulties.    In theirmemorandum he and the Chancellor of the Duchy had been ableto make proposals for achieving the Cabinet&apos;s objective which,unlike earlier proposals, did not require primary legislation.The Ministerial and Other Salaries Act 197 5 gave the PrimeMinister discretion to fix the salaries of certain Ministers,including Ministers of State, within a range.    It was now proposedthat all Ministers of State should in future be paid at the top of therange, while Ministers of State in the Commons should receive afigure at the bottom of the range.    The rates of salary presentedin the 1975 Act were maxima, and the Act allowed for the paymentof salaries lower than the maxima specified in the Act; it wastherefore proposed that in future the maximum salary forParliamentary Secretaries would be fixed at the level consideredappropriate for those in the Lords, with ParliamentarySecretaries in the Commons being paid  3, 500 less.    He proposedthat these changes should be made when other Ministerial salarieswere next increased.    Parallel.increases would be given by Orderin Council to office-holders and Whips in the Lords.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet were glad to note that a way had been found to makethe agreed increases for Junior Ministers in the Lords withoutprimary legislation and agreed the proposals in paragraph 13 ofC(81) 13.    Care should be taken that this decision remainedconfidential until decisions had been taken about Ministerialsalaries generally.The Cabinet -1. Took note that the Prime Minister wouldarrange for the Chairman of the Top Salaries ReviewBody to be informed that the Government would becontent for the Review Body to report on the pay ofMembers of Parliament and Ministers in 1981 withoutrecommending new salary rates, but to urge insteadfull implementation of their earlier recommendationsas soon as possible.    The Review Body wouldhowever be asked to advise on the up-dating ofParliamentary allowances in the usual way.2. Agreed to resume their discussion of thepay of Members of Parliament and Ministers ata future meeting.3CONFIDENTIAL
