SECRET(Qv^ ce,^-*j &lt;^ULja^&apos;MOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORDTOCC(81) 26th CONCLUSIONSThursday 2 July 1981NORTHERNIRELANDPreviousReference;CC(81) 25thConclusions,Minute 4At the end of the Cabinet&apos;s meeting on 2 July (CC(81) 26thConclusions) there was an informal discussion of the situationrelating to Northern Ireland, during which the following pointswere made:-a. There were increasingly disturbing signs of anerosion of international confidence in British policy inthe light of the continuing hunger strike at the MazePrison.    The difficulties which this would cause for theGovernment when further hunger strikers began to dieshould not be underestimated; they would compound whatwould in any case be an extremely serious situation interms of security and public order.    The problem was nolonger solely one of ensuring that the Government&apos;s stancewas properly understood.    There was a real need to avoidthat stance being condemned, however unfairly, asinflexible.    On the other hand, any gesture to reduce theappearance of inflexibility was liable to be interpreted,both by the Protestant community and by the IrishRepublican Army (IRA), as a prelude to capitulation. Itwas in any case not easy to see what gesture might bepossible.    Ideally some independent body should be invitedto satisfy itself, and certify publicly, that the Government&apos;sattitude on the prison regime was both humane andreasonable.    But the European Commission for HumanRights had made clear that they were not willing to playany role in the absence of any specific complaint. TheGovernment could not of course make such a complaintagainst themselves; the prisoners were not prepared todo so; and though another Government could in theory fillthe gap it was questionable whether it would be wise totry to stimulate this.    It was encouraging that the IrishCommission for Justice and Peace (ICJP) had welcomedthe Secretary of State for Northern Ireland&apos;s recent state-ment on the prison regime.    Their continuing involvementmight prove helpful, though it would be undesirable thatthey should be allowed to assume the role of intermediarybetween the strikers and the Government.    But it couldnot alter the underlying problem, which was becomingincreasingly clear: the hunger strikers&apos; real aim was notto alter prison conditions but to bring about a Britishwithdrawal from the Province and the unification of Ireland.1SECRET
SECRETb. The difficulty of the Government&apos;s position seemedcertain to be increased by the evolving Opposition attitudetowards Irish unity as an ultimate objective.    The expectedspeech by Mr James Callaghan in the Northern Irelanddebate later that day might prove to be a watershed. Asa former Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition hisviews would carry special weight.    He had alreadyindicated privately that he thought the British &quot;guarantee&quot;should apply not to Northern Ireland as a territory but toits inhabitants; the territory should become independent,with transitional arrangements under which British troopsand British financial assistance would remain availablefor a limited period; but those of its inhabitants who wantedto remain citizens of the United Kingdom should beguaranteed the right to do so.    It was not certain that hewould be as explicit as this in his forthcoming speech.But the whole context of the current British debate aboutNorthern Ireland would be altered if the question headdressed was not whether British policy was winning orlosing in the struggle there, but whether it was a strugglein which Britain ought any longer to be involved at all.His views might well receive massive support from publicopinion in Britain, where there was already a widespreadfeeling in favour of British withdrawal.    It could beargued, indeed, that the watershed was already passed.The decisive moment had been the Fermanagh by-election,and the choice of an imprisoned terrorist hunger strikerto represent a Northern Irish constituency at Westminster.Many people in Britain now believed that a settlement ofthe complex problems of the area would be more easilyreached by the Irish on their own and that continuedBritish involvement could only mean the futile sacrificeof further British lives.c. Whatever the state of British opinion, withdrawalwould not be an easy propositon for any Government.Civil war and massive bloodshed were likely to be theimmediate result in Northern Ireland, and the troublecould easily spread to the large Irish communities in somemajor cities in Great Britain.    In any case, the presentguarantee to the Province was enshrined in statute andcould only be modified by new legislation.    The passageof this would be an occasion for turbulence as well ascontroversy.    Even the suggestion of a withdrawal couldlead to serious unrest in Western Scotland.2SECRET
SECRETd. Since the immediate problem was how to avoid anew series of deaths of hunger strikers, it was forconsideration whether they could not be kept alive bycompulsory feeding.    If done intravenously by modernmethods this should not involve the violent scenesassociated with the forcible feeding of hunger strikingprisoners in the past.    On the other hand, it was uncertainwhether the prison doctors would be willing to co-operate;and if intravenous feeding led to all the protestingprisoners coming out on hunger strike the authoritieswould be faced with the enormous task of sustaining themby such methods indefinitely.    In any case, the implicationsfor the running of prisons elsewhere in the United Kingdomwould need to be carefully weighed.    The decision by theLabour Government of the day to abandon forcible feedinghad been taken with the full support of the ConservativeOpposition.    The step had been widely welcomed by publicopinion both at home and abroad, and had been emulatedby a number of other Governments in Europe. Neverthe-less the possibility of intravenous feeding deserved seriousstudy.    More generally, there was no doubt of theimportance of avoiding further hunger strike deaths if atall possible.THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said thatfurther thought would need to be given to all possible courses ofaction in regard to Northern Ireland, however difficult orunpalatable.    But it would first be necessary to await the outcomeof the forthcoming debate in Parliament, and the meeting whichthe Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr Alison) was tohave with her on 3 July.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office7 July 19813SECRET
