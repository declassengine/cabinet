The present burdenof tax was one of the main factors hindering the growth of newemployment opportunities.     To widen the gap between the incomes ofthose in and out of work, to improve incentives for the lower-paid andto ease the poverty trap, a priority should be to raise substantially thestarting point for income tax;  in particular, it would be essential in thenext Budget to avoid again withholding nRooker-Wise&quot; increases inpersonal tax thresholds, but he was not proposing at this stage anyfurther reductions in income tax.    It was also necessary to reduce thetax burden on business, probably by a reduction in the NationalInsurance Surcharge.     Tax reductions of this kind were a better way ofstimulating real employment, and with better long-term consequences,than additional public expenditure.    To bring inflation down well intosingle figures and to permit a fall in interest rates over the mediumterm, it was necessary to keep to the medium-term financial strategy,and progressively to reduce the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement(PSBR) as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). If,however, the financial markets were to take the view that theGovernment&apos;s determination was weakening, the economic strategy, andthe reduction of inflation, would be increasingly vulnerable to the effectsof high interest rates in the United States of America.     The key to taxreductions lay in reducing the prospective totals of public expenditure.There were, however,  serious problems in reducing the totals even tothose in the 1981 Public Expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 8175). Thepresent returns showed additional bids in 1982-83 of  6-| billion in cash,of which about  2-| billion was for additions to the nationalisedindustries&apos; External Financing Limits (EFLs) and nearly  l|- billion formeasures to reduce unemployment.     Against this background, hesecret
secretinvited the Cabinet to endorse the general approach to the 1981 PublicExpenditure Survey indicated in C(81) 37, and in particular the over-riding aim of getting the overall expenditure totals below those derivedfrom Cmnd 8175 so as to make possible, within the overall economicstrategy, the tax reductions necessary for fulfilling the Government&apos;seconomic and employment objectives.In discussion the following were the main points made -a. The Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s paper was inadequate,because it did not provide the Cabinet with the figures whichwould be the only sensible basis for discussion:   such figures as(for example) the expected outturn for 1981-82, and theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s forecasts and assumptions on theproportion of public expenditure to GDP.b. The approach recommended by the Chancellor of theExchequer did not offer a sufficiently imaginative andpracticable response to the acute social and political problemsnow confronting the Government.    A strategy centred onreductions of taxation and public expenditure would beirrelevant to the problems of Northern Ireland, or to those ofMerseyside and other areas of urban dereliction and deprivation.Merseyside in particular was a community which was visiblyfalling apart, its hopelessness and despair compounded by thelack of commitment to the area of any of the wealth-creatinginstitutions in the country.     With unemployment totals rising to3 million later in the year, and following the recent rioting in anumber of cities, the tolerance of society was now stretched.  near to its limit.     To give people renewed hope and confidencefor the future, it was essential to take new and constructiveaction urgently.c. Such action could build on the many substantial improve-ments which the Government had achieved in the  last two yearsand which provided a sound base from which to respond to arevival in growth, as the present world-wide recession came toan end:   for example, improvements in management methods, inproductivity, in competitiveness, and in the structure ofbusiness taxes, particularly those affecting small firms. Toconsolidate these achievements and reap the benefits of themrequired the continuance in office of the Government through thenext Parliament;   without that the achievements would be thrownaway.     If action were delayed for too long, it would then be seenas a panic reaction to mounting problems;   if it came too late, itwould risk wasting the improvements which the Government hadmade.2secrei
d. Many people were now far more worried by the problemsof unemployment than by levels of tax.     Priority should now begiven to measures to reduce unemployment, on the lines of thoseproposed by the Secretary of State for Employment and others;further jobs should be generated, and useful assets created, byincreasing capital investment in the public sector and byexpenditure to stimulate investment in the private sector. Ifpeople were convinced that the Government was taking a majorand constructive initiative to tackle these problems, they mightwell be prepared to accept some sacrifices to ensure that theobjectives were achieved.e. It was suggested that people might be prepared to accept asevere limitation, or even a freeze, on pay increases, if it couldbe shown to provide resources for increased investment andspecial employment measures.     If there were any question oflimiting the uprating of social benefits, that would surely need tobe accompanied by some such limitations on incomes.     On theother hand, while it was clearly desirable to aim for andencourage low pay increases, it was unrealistic to think in termsof a wage freeze or of increases limited to 1 or 2 percentagepoints.    Indeed, such limitations could be positively damagingif they were to depress demand for goods and services or to leadto any sharp escalation of bids for pay increases eitherimmediately before or after the period of pay limitation.     It wasvery doubtful whether the approach, discussed in the Annex toC(81) 37, whereby some particular groups might accept a trade-off between pay and capital investment in their sector, wasrealistic.     There was no reason, for example, why doctors ornurses should accept relatively low pay awards in order tofinance the construction of hospitals.f. In addition to implementing in full in the next BudgetRooker-Wise increases in personal tax thresholds, there was alsoa case for restoring the benefits lost from the abatement of suchincreases in previous Budgets.    On the other hand, it was forquestion whether priority should be given to tax reductions to theextent proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Theassertion that tax reductions were a better way of stimulatingemployment than additional public expenditure was open toquestion.    As the CPRS had suggested, the Cabinet needed moreinformation on the employment implications of particular tax andexpenditure options, if they were to select the approach whichoffered the best prospects of dealing with unemployment.g. Given the present estimate of additional bids of  6-| billionin 1982-83, it would be a herculean task to contain publicexpenditure totals to the levels in Cmnd 8175, let alone to reduce3d  mm      r&apos; ,     *m
them further.     It was unrealistic to look for yet further cuts onthose programmes which had already borne the brunt of thesuccession of previous exercises to cut expenditure;   the defencebudget had already been decided in volume terms;   there would bemajor political difficulties in any attempt to limit upratings insocial security and unemployment benefits;   and there were strongpressures for further expenditure on the law and orderprogrammes, particularly the prison service, and to deal v/iththe aftermath of the recent riots.     It would be important toreduce the major overrun of S.2jr billion on the nationalisedindustries&apos; EFLs, but at a time of recession some overrun was tobe expected.     It had generally to be recognised that further cutsin public expenditure would be damaging to employment prospectsand to private sector industry.     It seemed unrealistic to look fora declining PSBR, as a proportion of GDP, at a time of economicrec es sion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that, beforereaching a view on the balance between taxation and public expenditureobjectives, the Cabinet wished the Chancellor of the Exchequer topresent them with a fuller evaluation of the options than in C(81) 37. Inparticular, they wanted more information on the employment implica-tions of particular tax and expenditure options;  a fuller assessment ofthe realism of looking for reductions in public expenditure to the levelsassumed in Cmnd 8175, or below;  more information on the make-up ofthe present additional bids in 1982-83 of  6-| billion;  and an indication ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s present assumptions on the level ofthe PSBR in relation to GDP this year and next.    In further discussion,it would be necessary to weigh the possible benefits of furtherexpenditure on capital investment, and the consequences of not reducingpublic expenditure totals to at least Cmnd 8175 levels, against the risksand consequences, not only to the Government&apos;s broad objectives but alsoto confidence in the currency, of any departure from the medium-termfinancial strategy;   in particular, it was essential to recognise theimpact of any further increase in inflation on those whose savings andincome were not protected by index-linking.The Cabinet -1. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer tocirculate a further memorandum on the factorsrelevant to decisions about public expenditure in1982-83 and later years.2. Agreed to resume their discussion of the 1981Public Expenditure Survey when that memorandumwas available.4
