f^LJAMENTARY   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theFAIRS House of Commons during the following week.In discussion of the Supply Day debate on 18 May, on an opposition motion on the sale of Council and New Town houses to tenants, it wasnoted that the Ministers concerned were giving consideration to proposals which would give those living in council houses a statuscomparable to that of an owner-occupier but without the permanentownership passing from the Council.    No changes in government policy would be announced in the debate on 18 May; but it was important that the Government speakers should hold the presentposition in such a way as not to rule out the possibility of future developments of this Hnd in the Governments policy on council houses.1
2.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat there had been no external sign of tension visible during his visit to China,    Everyone to whom he had spoken had been wordperfect In expounding the new line on Teng and internal policies.Nevertheless under the surface there must be a great deal of tension.Chairman Mao was now 82 and a desperate struggle for the succession to him must be expected.    The Soviet Union might be tempted in such circumstances to try to influence events.     His own belief was thatthe moderates would come out on top; if they did not there would be aserious risk of disintegration.    He had found the new Chinese PrimeMinister, Hua Kuo-Feng, deliberate and shrewd, but his previous experience had been entirely with domestic policy.    On foreignaffairs he had stuck very closely to a brief, repeating almost wordfor word what had already been said by the Chinese Foreign Minister,Ch&apos;iao Kuan-Hua.    There had been no change whatsoever in theChinese exposition of foreign affairs themes.    They regarded war as inevitable, though perhaps after a little delay, and saw the soviet union as the source of that war.    They had stressed the Soviet threat to Western Europe and had recommended a &quot;tit for tat&quot; response byWestern Europe to Soviet pressures, though it had never become clear what they meant by that phrase.   He had tried to reassure them aboutBritain&apos;s commitment to Western Europe and about the solidarity ofthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.    On foreign trade they had said that there would be no change of policy, only certain minor adjustments such as on the allocation of oil for domestic consumption.They had denied that there was any risk of invasion of South Korea bythe North Koreans,    On Indo-China they were clearly nervous aboutSoviet intentions and worried by the degree of Soviet influence.    Hejudged that the visit had been successful: the local experts, includingHer Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, rated the cordiality of his reception as above average.    His hosts had expressed the hope that the PrimeMinister would visit China soon.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that relations between the United Kingdom and Japan were very good.    Theonly sensitive item in the discussions he had had there had been on japanese exports, especially of cars.   He had said repeatedly that theJapanese motor industry must reach agreement with the Britishindustry on an orderly policy for the British market and had found all his hearers sympathetic on the point.    The Japanese too had said thatthey would welcome a visit from the Prime Minister.    Clearly thatwas not possible the year, but he thought that at a later date a visit by the Prime Minister to both China and Japan would be valuable.
The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary,3,        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (CP(76) 9) and a memorandum by the Central policy review Staff (CP(76) W) on cutting Civil Service manpower.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that since the Government took office inMarch 1974 there had been an increase of almost 50,000 in thenumber of civil servants, and on current projections by 1978 theincrease would have risen to over 90,000, representing a rise of13 per cent in four years.    This upward trend showed no signs offlattening.    The Cabinet had agreed the previous December, as partof the public expenditure cuts, that  140 million should be saved in1978-79 by a reduction In the Civil Service; and he had been invitedto consult his colleagues on how this might be done.    His paper setout the results of his consultations.    The figure of  140 million hadbeen adopted as being a reduction of 5 por cent on the forecastexpenditure In 1978-79; bat since December large new manpowerrequirements, totalling  63 million, had arisen, partly from new policy commitments - eg in the Department of Employment and as aresult of devolution - and partly from increasing work - eg in the inland Revenue, where over the next two years an increase of 21 percent would be needed.    Unless offsetting savings could be found, this additional cost would be a charge on the contingency reserve.    Thequestion which Cabinet had to consider first was whether their targetshould be a saving of  140 million, or  200 million, or some figurebetween,A saving of  140 million would mean that by 1978-79 the Civil service would be no smaller than it was today.    If the aim were to get theCivil Service down to the level of the preceding summer (around730, 000) then the target would need to be  200 million.    Even toobtain savings of  140 million was a formidable task.    The omission of the Ministry of Defence, and the fact that some civil servants were paid from fees charged for their services, so that cutting their numbers saved little money, meant that in practice a cut, not of 5 percent, but of something closer to 9 per cent was needed over theremainder of the field.    For Departments who had already borne the brunt of the formula&quot; cuts of the 1975 exercise, this would be particularly severe - for the Civil Service Department it would mean a total cut of 13 per cent.   Even If all the proposals In Annexes A, Band C to his paper were adopted they would only save  180 million,and given the policy difficulties attaching to some of the proposals hewas clear that to go above  140 million would make It essential to look
for a further contribution from the Ministry of Defence, and fromother Departments who were not planning to reduce staff below theirpresent levels.    The Central Policy Review Staff had suggested thathe should undertake bilateral discussions with individual spendingMinisters; but he feared that these might well prove fruitless, sincethe proposals had already been fully discussed in correspondence andat official level,       hi8 view such discussions should be based onfirm acceptance in principle by Cabinet of the proposals in Annexes Aand B, which between them would save  125 million, or 38, 000 staff,which, together with assumed savings of  7 million from theForeign and Commonwealth Office and savings from fringe bodies,certain Post Office charges, and such consequential costs asaccommodation, would make up the balance of the  140 million.    Thishowever assumed that Vehicle Excise Duty would be abolished,saving some 3,000 posts and  12 million, a proposal to which theChancellor of the Exchequer took grave exception.    If, nevertheless,the proposals in Annexes A and B could be agreed in principle, the bilateral discussions could concentrate on how individual ministers might make good any particular savings in Annexes A and B to whichthey were opposed.In the longer term it should be possible to look closely at admlnis-tration, particularly in areas where manpower was uBed intensively,but that was no substitute for early decisions on the make up of savings of  140 million, a number of which would require legislation in the next year.    In his view  140 million was the minimum targetCabinet should adopt in view of the public commitment which had beengiven and he recommended the acceptance of this target and of theproposals in Annexes A and B to his paper,, with discretion for ministers to replace proposals there by alternative savings of equivalent value in the required time scale.In discussion of the target which should be accepted, it was observedthat Cabinet were well aware, when they accepted the figure of 140 million In December, that it was not a soft option and could onlybe obtained by making policy changes.    Ministers now faced thedifficulty of giving substance to this decision, and the Government&apos;scredibility would turn upon being able to stand by what was now apublic commitment.    There were pressures for even larger cuts in public expenditure, but these could be warded off as long as theGovernment could demonstrate that It was successfully keeping within its own planned limits.    It was Important to keep a sense ofperspective about the growth of the Civil Service which had taken, andwas still taking, place.    There was a long-term secular trend towards growth in the public sector, and in many ways this was something which a Labour Government should welcome.    On occasionsthe growth might be too rapid and would need to be slowed down; butthere was little doubt that for a variety of reasons - eg the
implications for Goverment of increasing international obligations innumerous fields - there would In ten years&apos; time be a larger CivilService than now.    It would be interesting in this respect to comparethe experience of other advanced countries.    The Government had accepted that it would make a cut of  140 million in manpower costs,but there could be no question of going higher than that figure, whichhad the advantage that it would involve practically no compulsoryredundancy, and could largely be achieved by natural wastage.In discussion it was argued that Annexes A and B to the Lord privy seal&apos;s paper could not be accepted as they stood.    Quite apart fromDepartmental objections to particular proposals - eg the abolition ofVehicle Excise Duty - it would be necessary to consider carefully thelegislative consequences of the proposals listed.    Annex A wouldrequire seven separate legislative provisions, and Annex B neededmuch the same, some of the requirements being highly controversial.It was most important, before the Government accepted the proposalsen bbtc, that the legislative implications should be drawn up andcarefully considered.    It was arguable that some of the proposals would have an adverse effect on the Government&apos;e relations with theTrades Union Congress, which would make them very difficult toaccept.    More broadly, it was argued that the proposals needed to be examined to see how far, taken together, they fitted Into theGovernments wider priorities - would they, for example, reflect theextent to which the Government wished to give priority to industrialstrategy over social policy?   Furthermore, a distinction needed tobe made between savings to be had from changes in policy, and thosewhich could be obtained through continuing to administer existing policies, but at lower standards of service,In further discussion, it was suggested that there should be scope for savings in the reform of some of the working methods of the CivilService.    There was a marked tendency to spend too much time ondrafting and writing where telephone calls would suffice; ministers were heavily over-briefed; too masy people at too many levels in a department expressed their views on paper when it would be more efficient for a discussion to be held and a single view to be putforward; and papers originating lower down in a Department went through too many hands on the way to Ministers. Nor was missolely a matter of servicing Ministers - where in fact no large savingswere likely to be had - but was to be found also in lower levels of theadministrative machine.    One problem was that there had in recentyears been a considerable increase in the service which GovernmentDepartments were expected to give to the House of Commons - egthrough the increase In Parliamentary Quest ions, including priorityWritten Questions asking for detailed statistical information at short notice, and through the practice of Members of Parliament in sending constituents1 letters and expecting a detailed statement of5
policy from the Department on the question at issue.    Gratuitous workfor other civil servants was often created by the practice of sendingcopies of such letters to other Departments when the questions raisedimpinged, even if only marginally, upon the latter&apos;s responsibilities.It was suggested that there was no reason why, without sacrificingMinisterial accountability to Parliament, Members of parliament should not have easy access by telephone to Departments to obtain information they needed, without going through the elaborateprocedure of writing to the Minister,       was further noted that thepreparation of legislation and seeing it through all stages In bothHouses of Parliament took up considerable Civil Service manpower,and savings might be achieved by legislative reforms which wouldobviate the need to put all minor legislative matters through the fullset of Parliamentary hoops.In the course of continued discussion, the following main points weremade -a. More attention should be paid at the time when ministers were considering a draft Bill to the implications it had for civil Service manpower.   Arrangements already existed todraw ministers attention to these implications, but too littleaccount had been taken of them.    It might be valuable toexamine the legislation of the last two years to see where theadditional requirements had been created, and Indeed to look atthe Labour Party&apos;s own most recent programme wttfe an eye tothe additional manpower needs it would involve.   Ao an example of existing difficulties, it was noted that there waspressure from the Labour Party for greater progress with the implementation of planning agreements; but such greaterprogress would inevitably involve increased staff,b. If savings of  140 million were to be found, thenchanges both in policy and in administration would benecessary.    Savings in administration were difficult to pindown, were to some extent already allowed for in the figures which had been given by the Lord Privy Seal, and would be particularly difficult to obtain within the required time scale.However, if any administrative savings were to be achieved by1978-79* the necessary action - eg thinning out the messen-gerial and lower clerical grades - needed to be started withoutdelay.c. Of all the policy changes that had been proposed by far the most effective was the abolition of Vehicle Excise Duty: itwas difficult to see how the required savings could beachieved without this change of policy.6
d. While it would be a matter of importance to consult theStaff Side as closely as possible on the exercise, at least oneMinister had found his Departmental Staff Side to be whollyunrealistic in their approach and unco-operative in theirattitude to the achievement of cuts of the kind needed.e. If lower standards of administration were to be adopted,involving a poorer service to the public - eg more delays in planning appeals - it would be necessary to explain toParliament what was involved and the reason why such a lowering of service was necessary.f. The reason for the forecast increase in Inland Revenuestaff was that, whereas it had previously been assumed thattax allowances would be fully revalorised, that assumption had now been changed.   As a result, more people were expectedto be liable to tax, and more people liable to higher rate tax,than previously.    All of this involved more staff.    there might however be some degree of revalorisation over the next two years, so that the forecast increase in staff might be morepessimistic than was justified.    The truth was that the only way to obtain major savings in Departments like the InlandRevenue and the Department of Health and Social Security wasto consider whether the job could be done in some totally different way from that now prevailing.    This would require aconsiderable study and would be unlikely to save any money by1978.g. It eould be argued that the increase in the size of theCivil Service was part of a long-term secular trend associatedwith an increasing amount of intervention by Governments.There were obvious risks in trying to reverse that trendparticularly when, as in the present exercise, what had started as a reasonably modest target of a 5 per cent reduction had now moved to 9 per cent.h. While the level of efficiency within the Civil Servicemight not be as high as it could be, there was no reason tothink that it was any worse than the standard prevailing in theprivate sector.    It would be important, therefore, not tosingle out the Civil Service when what was needed was animprovement in efficiency in public and private sectors.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that the target should be the saving of 140 million which had been agreed the previous December andsubsequently published in the Public Expenditure White Paper.    Thiswas not a commitment from which the Government could resile.    The
proposals in Annexes A, B and C of CP(76) 9 needed further and more detailed consideration however.    The Lord Privy Seal, reinforced bythe reaffirmation by Cabinet that they must achieve savings of 140 million in 1978-79, should therefore have bilateral discussions with each of the spending Ministers and should establish what eachMinister would agree from Annexes A, B or C as a contribution tothe collectively reaffirmed target.   Members of the Cabinet should give this their personal consideration and be as forthcoming aspossible.    In addition the Lord Privy Seal, in the light of these discussions, should prepare a list of disagreed items which cabinet would need to consider further to make up the full savings.    Whenthey next considered the matter the Cabinet should also have beforethem an agreed statement of the legislative implications of all of the agreed and disagreed proposals so that the Parliamentary difficultiescould be properly weighed.    There was general agreement that itwould be important to involve the National Staff Side and Depart -mental Whitley Councils in consideration of the reductions; and atsome point it might be desirable for him to see the National Staff Sidehimself.    The Cabinet would also need to consider further thequestion of improving working methods In the Civil Service: this was something which Ministers might be able themselves to set in hand,perhaps by deputing a junior Minister to lead a study in each department, but first they needed the advice of the Lord Privy Sealon the best approach to the problem.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.        Reaffirmed their decision of the previousDecember that there should be a reduction in the forecast number of civil servants in 1978-79sufficient to secure savings of  140 million.3.        Invited the Lord Privy Seal to undertakebilateral discussions with the spending ministers concerned with a view to securing the maximum possible agreement based on the proposals in annexes A, B and C to CP(76) 9; and to report backto Cabinet urgently showing how far agreement hadbeen reached and indicating the disagreedproposals which would need to be considered further by Cabinet to achieve the required totalsaving.
4.        Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultationwith the Lord President of the Council, at the sametime as he reported on the results of his bilateral discussions, to circulate to Cabinet a note on thelegislative implications of the proposals, both agreed and disagreed, for making up the  140 million saving.5.        Invited the Lord Privy Seal to circulateguidance on the way in which an exercise designed toimprove working methods in the Civil Service might best be handled.9
fifth*ound ofAshoreSfcODUCTlONMtlshVonal Oil^tpoxation.c*w4rfoutionCoats4.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Energy (CP(76) 12) about the manner in which the british national Oil Corporation (BNOC) should finance its participation in the exploration and development arising from the next round of offshorepetroleum production licences.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FORENERGY said that he would in thevery near future have to put before Parliament the regulationsauthorising the fifth round of North Sea oil licensing if they were to be approved before the Summer Recess.    It was important that the roundshould be a success: if it were not, It would call in question the credibility of the Governments oil policy, which had been designed to remedy the defects of the fourth round conducted by the conservative administration.    All those interested in the subject would be watchingvery carefully to see how effectively this had been done.    The fifthround was needed to give a new impetus to and preserve employmentin the supporting industry, and if oil could be found off the coast of wales and South West England it would help to counteract the ScottishNationalist problem.The Government had already announced that BNOC would be aparticipant in future licences from the outset.    The issue on which hewas seeking a decision from the Cabinet was: should BNOC investmoney in exploration and development under these licences from thebeginning, or defer its financial contribution until this could be met from the revenues arising from oil produced?   He felt strongly thatthe former course was the right one.    If the Corporation refu3ed toput in its share of the costs, it would become simply a sleepingpartner, and its credibility as a State oil company would be destroyed.By taking a financial stake on the other hand, it would get all theinformation it needed and in addition would be able to influence the placing of orders with the supplying industry.    The British GasCorporation (BGC) and the National Coal Board (NCB) had alreadycontributed their share under existing licences on this basis.    he feared that if BNOC did not follow the same course, companies mightbe deterred from applying for licences and the round would be a failure.    It seemed anomalous that British Petroleum Ltd wouldborrow abroad to finance investment in the North Sea, but BNOCcould not do likewise simply because its borrowings would increasethe public sector borrowing requirement.    It was important to distinguish between the two categories of investment in prospect.The first was exploration, for which the sum involved was estimatedat only  50 million in the period 1977-83, and only  12 million in1976-79.    The really large expenditure would not be incurred untildevelopment was undertaken, which as Appendix 3 to his paper showedwould not be before 1980.     Ideally he would have liked to obtain agreement that BNOC would normally contribute its 51 per cent shareof investment under the fifth round licences.    The argument had been10CONFIDENTIAL
advanced that this was unnecessary, and that a seat on the operatingcommittee and the right terms of contract (including a &quot;carriedinterest&quot; provision under which investment would be deferred to bemet from eventual production revenues) would give BNOC all theinformation it needed.    He did not accept this, but was prepared to compromise and agree that the contribution to development costs shouldbe decided for each case on its merits.    But he felt that if BNOCwere to preserve its credibility, it must contribute its  12 million toexploration costs over the following three years.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said he agreed that it was important that the fifth round should be a success.    But he did not accept that deferring BNCOs financial contribution would put theGovernment in a weak position.    The negotiation of participation in existing licences for BNOC had started with the expectation that theCorporation would contribute financially, but now this was not proposed and it had not prevented the negotiation of satisfactory terms.In the next round the Corporation would not be trying to break into an existing licence, but companies would be required to accept itsparticipation from the outset.    No commercial company which founditself in such a strong negotiating position would expect to investmoney earlier than necessary.    He agreed that it was unfortunate thatborrowing abroad by BNOC scored as part of the public sectorborrowing requirement, but it would be impossible to change theexisting conventions until the counters financial position as a whole was stronger.    If the Government gave the Impression at the presenttime that they might be ready to contribute their share of the hugecosts which would eventually arise on development, as they arose,the knowledge of these potential obligations would create very serious problems for Britain&apos;s credit abroad.   He therefore opposed thesuggestion that the Government should normally expect to pay its share of development costs, and believed they should not contribute toexploration since the sums involved would not really enhance BNOC&apos;sstanding, and it would be difficult to contribute to exploration withoutimplying that such contributions might continue once the developmentstage was reached.In discussion it was argued that BNOC&apos;s credibility would not be improved by an announcement that it would contribute to the relatively email costs of exploration, but thereafter would have only acarried interest in development.    The BNOC were in a strong position and should drive as hard a bargain as they could.    the concept of a &quot;round &quot;oreAted an impression that all the blocks offeredwere homogeneous,    hi fact they would be a mixture - as previousrounds had been - of some which were virtual goldmines and veryattractive to the companies and others which were thought to have very poor prospects.    Hence it might be better to negotiate thesharing of exploration costs as well as development, case by case.
On the other hand it was argued that a contribution to explorationcosts would stimulate drilling in new areas and yield worthwhilepolitical benefits.    The BNOC had been set up with the idea ofmaking it eventually a fully integrated oil company, and 9t would bedifficult to sustain this impression if in its initial negotiations it was put into an inferior position to that of the BGC and NCB.    Moreover,the view of Lord Kearton must carry weight.    The cost had to beseen against the background of the balance of payments benefitsexpected from North Sea oil: in the current year they were expectedto amount te  900 million and by 1980 to  3, 000 million.    Onceexploration had revealed the presence of oil, companies would find itmuch easier to raise finance for development of the fields.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thedecision was the more difficult because of the magnitude of the public sector deficit.    However, the majority of the Cabinet felt that the compromise proposed by the Secretary of State for Energy was theright course to adopt   They agreed therefore that the BNOC shouldbe authorised; as necessary, to meet its share of exploration costs as they arose, but that it should be left open for decision case by casewhether the Corporation should do the same for development costs ordefer them to be met out of revenue with an appropriate rate ofinterest.    The Secretary of State for Energy should draft a statementannouncing this decision, in consultation with the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and the Chief Secretary, Treasury.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Energy to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office13 May 197612CONFIDENTIAL
