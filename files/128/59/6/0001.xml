^JU-IAMENTARY       1.        The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inFAIRS the House of Commons during the following week.I0&apos; Committee THE PRIME MINISTER said that consideration would need to be&apos;egypt*us given to the Government&apos;s reaction to the recently publishedreport of the Select Committee on Cyprus.    This report wasmisleading and biased, and in a number of respects Inaccurate,It might therefore be beet not to resist pressure for a debatebut to take advantage of one to rebut the report.In discussion general agreement waB expressed with the need fora debate.    The selection for this Committee of members open tostrong constttutency pressures was a matter of some concern.A debate would also help to establish the right relationship betweenSelect Committees and the House of Commons as a whole.THE PRIME MINISTER, Bumming up a brief discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed mat tune should be found for a shortdebate after the Recess.    A Government motion should be tabledin terms which would ensure that it was carried.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.1
?*TCATION OF 2.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the^TERNATIONAL   Home Secretary (CP(76) 14) on the question whether the UnitedHants onrights:PENCE nt&quot; *LSKingdom, on ratifying the International Covenants on human rights, should make a reservation retaining the option of abolishing independent schools.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Home Affairs Committeehad agreed that the United Kingdom should now ratify theseCovenants.    There were strong policy grounds for this course,despite the difficulties which would be caused for someDepartments.    The Committee had not been able to agreewhether the Government should make a specific reservation tosafeguard the right at some time in the future completely to abolish private education.    Paragraph 3 of Article 13 of theCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights requiredStates Parties to have respect for the liberty of parents to choosefor their children schools other than those established by thepublic authorities; and paragraph 4 said that no part of the Articleshould be construed so as to interfere with the liberty of individuals and bodies to establish and direct educational institutions.    It was proposed that the reservation, if made, should read: &quot;TheGovernment of the United Kingdom reserve the right to restrictto the public authorities the power to establish and conductschools&quot;.   In his view such a reservation would be ill-advised andwould undo much of the presentational advantage of ratification.Moreover Article 2 of the First Protocol to the EuropeanConvention on Human Rights, which the United Kingdom hadratified in 1952, already required us to &quot;respect the right ofparents to ensure ... education and teaching in conformity withtheir own religious and philosophical convictions&quot;.  ratification of the Covenants without a reservation would not prevent theGovernment from squeezing private education, only from totallyabolishing it.   A reservation would stir up a great deal of troubleto no benefit.    No other country had made or was known to becontemplating such a reservation.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCEsaid that private education was a subject which aroused strongemotions in the Labour Party, and many members of the party were seriously concerned about the public schools.   He had foundgreat difficulty in trying to moderate the views on this subject ofthe Education Committee of the National Executive Committee,and there would be a strong reaction if it appeared that theGovernment were giving up their objective of ending independentschools, especially as the current phase of the Government ispolicy had increased the number of such schools.    In his view the reservation should be made.2
In discussion it was argued, against making a reservation, that itmight place the United Kingdom in a peculiar light in relation toother countries which had ratified the Covenants.    The issue was not confined to public schools.    There were other independentschools of a kind which no-one would wish to abolish, and it waadoubtful whether it would ever prove possible to legislate the publis schools out of existence as distinct from making life increasingly-difficult for them.   The right in question was the right of parentsto choose other man State schools, and there was no Partydocument which sought to deny this right.    The Government wouldhave no satisfactory answer to the question what plans they had inmind which necessitated a reservation.    There was concernamong the churches about the possible effect of Labour Partyeducation policy on church schools, and paragraph 3 of Article 13of the Covenant Included also the right of parents to ensure the religious upbringing of their children in conformity with their ownconvictions.    The reservation would be bound to arouse fearsthat church schools would be abolished or compelsorily integratedinto the State system.    It was suggested that, if at some futuretime a Labour government were in a position to abolish allprivate education, that would be the time to make a reservation,although the usual course was to make reservations at the timeof ratification.In favour of making a reservation it was argued that it was essential to preserve the Government&apos;s freedom of action to dealwith the public schools, which many people saw as among themost unfortunate features of British life.    Failure to make a reservation would lead the party to believe that this aim had been abandoned, and this would be damaging.    The issue in question was not one of human rights, or of religion, but of educationalpolicy.   Article 13 set out an educational policy, which wasproperly for Parliament to determine, to be interpreted and enforced by courts, and the appropriate form of reservation wouldbe that this Article would not be allowed to interfere with theGovernment1 s educational policy.    The Labour Party would not accept the International Covenants or any charter of human rightsif an Article which entrenched a non-Labour view on educationwas accepted without reservation.    Moat church schools were already within the State system, and most Roman Catholics didnot aspire to private education.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthere was a difference of opinion on whether a reservation shouldbe made, but a majority of the Cabinet were against doing so.It was however clear that, whether or not there were a reserva-tion, questions would be raised following ratification about theGovernments intentions relating to Independent schools, and theGovernment would have to explain their position.    In the attorney General&apos;s view, which the Lord Chancellor shared,3
the broad terms of Article 13 would not restrict the Governmentsright to confine to public authorities the power to establish andconduct schools, and there was much doubt whether the EuropeanConvention on Human Rights embodied a right to fee-payingeducation.   Accordingly the Cabinet agreed that there should not bea reservation, but that, on ratification of the Covenants, theGovernment should give an explanation, probably in Parliament,that it did not find it necessary to enter a reservation in regardto Article 13 because it saw no incompatibility between that article and Government policy.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion, and invited theMinisters concerned to proceed accordingly.4
Ucio-ua7*) 2nd^ions,48*cound3.        THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that theCabinet faced difficult decisions on a number of public expenditurematters which had to be taken against the background of unremittingpressure on sterling.    Large scale intervention by the authorities had not prevented a 10 per cent depreciation and the reserves were at a dangerously low level.    We had already drawn the first credittranche from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).    The new pay agreement which the Government had concluded with the TradesUnion Congress (TUC) had impressed many overseas governments and central bankers, and as a result of this agreement our wage settlements should be lower than many of our competitors.Nevertheless sterling remained disappointingly vulnerable to any badnews and the rate had dipped temporarily below $1. 80 on 17 May and again that morning.    There was no need for desperate measures atthe moment and in his view the oil rich states still thought that wewould succeed.    They were not therefore removing their deposits.If however the sterling rate declined further there was a serious riskof dislodging these deposits.     This would involve us in havingrecourse to short-term swap arrangements which we would only get on condition that we went to the IMF for longer term arrangements:and this in turn would require acceptance of conditions which would cause the greatest political difficulty.   His personal judgment wasthat this situation need not arise provided the Cabinet retained a firmcontrol over public expenditure.    Foreign opinion was now increasinglyconcentrating upon the size of the public sector borrowing requirement.In the light of the new pay deal it would be impossible to reduce theburden of debt by large tax increases in the next year.    Any action would have to be directly on public expenditure.    He had resistedpressure for excessive cuts at a time of recession but the public expenditure White Paper, despite political criticism at home, hadbeen reasonably well received abroad.    The avoidance of further cutsdepended absolutely however on not exceeding the limits which theCabinet had set.    This would involve very difficult decisions,particularly since some of the potential over-spending was bound tobecome public knowledge fairly soon.    It was therefore essential toshow that the Government had public expenditure under control withinthe White Paper figures.    The Cabinet should bear this background inmind in their subsequent discussion of the child benefit scheme, the forecast of substantial over-spend by the local authorities and thestate of the Contingency Reserve.OefitThe Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Secretary of State for Social Services CP(76) 18), covering amemorandum by officials, and a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Prices and Consumer Protection and Paymaster Generaland the Secretary of State for Social Services (CP(76) 21) on the child Benefit (CB) Scheme.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that attheir last discussion the Cabinet had been concerned by the extent ofthe transfer of resources from husband to wife which the CB scheme would involve, by the implications of this for the Governments paypolicy next year and by the size of the claim on the contingency reserve which a CB rate at the level he had proposed would entail.In their memorandum (CP(76) 21) he and the Secretary of State for prices and Consumer Protection and Paymaster General therefore proposed the introduction, from next April, of a modified version of the CB scheme for which the rate could be fixed at either  1. 50for all children, including the first, or at  1.20 for the first childand  1. 50 for remaining children, and which would retain Child tax allowances (CTAs), but at a substantially lower level.    The modifiedscheme would attract criticism for providing too little for families in the way of net cash gains and, from the women&apos;b lobby, for failing to transfer all the benefit to the mother, but it could be justified on grounds of public expenditure and the need to restrain inflation, andwould go a long way to meet the specific points of concern which theCabinet had expressed.   The net cost, which would be of the same order as had been accepted by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, inrelation to the full CB scheme, could, if necessary, be further reduced by allowing partial, instead of full, CTAs to the parents ofnon-resident children.    He felt strongly that a modified scheme onthese lines would attract far less criticism, particularly from government supporters, than a decision to defer the scheme against all the public commitments which had been made in the Manifesto andin Parliament.    Moreover, deferment would be attended by additionalcosts of the kind described in CP(76) 18; the administrative wastagealone of deferment would amount to  4 or  5 million.    He thereforeurged the Cabinet to adopt the proposals for a modified CB scheme,which would represent a modest start to the full scheme and, in his view, be understood by the Government&apos;s supporters as a necessarymeasure of economy.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR PRICES AND consumer protection AND PAYMASTER GENERAL said that she agreed thatthe modified CB scheme offered the best available compromise, by introducing a payment on the first child and by transferring resources from husband to wife without, however, having a drastic effect ontake -home pay.    To defer the CB scheme entirely would impose a severe strain on the ability of the TUC leadership to hold the unions to the terms of the recent pay agreement, since there was no doubtthat the TUC attached considerable importance to the introduction ofthe CB scheme.   So far as non-resident children were concerned, shebelieved that the parents of these children would have to be allowed a transitional period for the phasing out of their CTAs.
In discussion, there was substantial support for the view that theintroduction of the CB scheme should be deferred for 3 years.    the major threat to the Government was the unparalleled difficulty of theeconomic situation.    H this reached the point of obliging theGovernment to seek help from the IMF on conditions which the TUCwould find totally unacceptable, this would cause far greater damage to the Governments relations with the TUC than the deferment of theCB scheme.    The introduction of a modified CB scheme, whilefailing to achieve the same public expenditure savings as deferment,would still be open to considerable criticism for not providing enough,help to families and would entail significantly higher manpower costs.Because of the incidence of taxation on low incomes the net benefit tobe derived from any CB scheme was bound to be lower than originallyconceived; and this was a point which the TUC would be likely to take if it were fully explained to them.    In favour of the introduction of a modified CB scheme it was argued that in accepting pay restraint the tuc had consistently relied on the fact that the Government were carrying out their Manifesto commitments in other fields;   indeed the document being prepared for the TUC General Council meetingon 16 June specifically welcomed the introduction of the CB scheme.Failure to introduce it could prejudice implementation of the paypolicy agreement.    On the other hand It was very doubtful whetherthe TUC were fully aware of the effect on take-home pay of the CBscheme and of its political implications.    Moreover they could be relied upon to take a responsible view of the beneficial effect of adeferment on overseas confidence in sterling.       In order to maintainthe trust of the TUC, which was vital to the Governments strategy, itwould be essential to discuss the problem fully with them on the basisof genuine consultations and not merely to explain a decision already taken.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the weight of opinion within the Cabinet was substantially in favourof deferment of the CB scheme for 3 years, which, subject to furtherconsideration, might be combined with one or two anti-povertymeasures, for example an increase in Child Interim Benefit.    It would however be wrong to proceed to a final decision without explaining theposition fully to the TUC.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer, theSecretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection and paymaster general, the Secretary of State for Employment and the Secretary ofState for Social Services should therefore see the TUC urgently andreport tha outcome to the Cabinet on Tuesday 25 May when a finaldecision would be taken.    These consultations should be held on thebasis of the full CB scheme and the serious objections which theGovernment saw to its introduction next year.    It would be open to theMinisters concerned to indicate the possibility of a modified schemebut, in so doing, they should explain the strong arguments against itand keep In mind that the weight of the Cabinet view had been in favourof deferment.    The question whether an announcement of a government decision on the CB scheme should include a statement to the effect thatthe TUC had been consulted was one which the Cabinet would wish toconsider in the light of the tuc&apos;s own wishes.
The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of this part of their discussion.2.      Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, togetherwith the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer protection and Paymaster General, the Secretary ofState for Employment and the Secretary of State for social Services, to arrange early consultations with the tuc on the lines indicated in the summing up, and toreport the outcome to the Cabinet at their next meeting.3.      Agreed to resume their discussion on Tuesday25 May.Authority        THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the prospective** over-spend of  300 to  500 million in local authority currenttu*e expenditure in 1976-77, revealed in CP(76) 15 and 16, presented the Government with an extremely serious situation.    The ministers concerned were due to meet the local authority representatives on26 May at the next meeting of the Consultative Council on LocalGovernment Finance, and it was quite possible that knowledge of thenew figures would become public shortly after that meeting.    Theeffect of such news upon overseas confidence could be grave.    Hehad therefore discussed the situation with the Ministers responsiblefor local authority spending.    The Government exereised no direct control over local authority current expenditure, and there was noeasy answer to the problem of getting them to keep their expenditure within the planned limits.    It might be possible to say that theGovernment would withhold the further grant which would normally bepaid later in the year under a Cost Increase Order, leaving localauthorities to trim their spending accordingly- but this was a veryblunt weapon; it would affect all local authorities indiscriminatelyincluding those who had done all they could to constrain their expenditure; and It ran the danger of destroying the present degree ofco-operation between Government and local authorities.    The ministers concerned had therefore concluded that, at the meeting of the consultative Council on 26 May, the local authorities should be toldquite firmly that the prospective over-spend was totally unacceptable to the Government and that the local authorities must find ways of avoiding it.    They would be asked to make a further return in twomonths&apos; time of their expenditure forecasts showing, it was to be hopedreduced figures reflecting the steps they proposed to take to this end.The Department of the Environment would, shortly after the meeting,issue a circular giving guidance on how local authorities could reduce expenditure this year.    They would also be told on 26 May that theGovernment had already decided that the Rate Support Grant for
1977-78 would be baaed upon the figures in the Public expenditure white Paper of last February (Croud 6393) and not upon any later and higher forecast.    The Secretary of State for the Environment would seek agreement at the meeting of the Council to the issue of a Pressstatement as soon as the meeting ended, which would indicate the over-spend implied by the recent returns, the Government1 s refusal to contemplate any such over-spend, and the action being taken to correct the situation.He recommended to Cabinet that this line should be adopted at themeeting of the Consultative Council.    He added that Cabinet shouldnot, in his view, rule out the possibility that at a later stage in theyear they might wish to withhold the whole or part of the further grantunder a Cost Increase Order, Bince a final decision on this must turnupon the picture which would be revealed by the further returns from local authorities in July.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that part of the 1976-77 prospective excesB had arisen because expenditurein 1975-76 was now thought to be  150 million higher man had been assumed when the last Rate Support Grant settlement had been made.The 1976-77 excess was only prospective, and not yet actual, and nodoubt some of the figures were based upon assumptions which might be unduly pessimistic - e. g. about the likely rate of inflation through theyear - so that the further information which would be available in Julymight well show a much better prospect.    In his view it would be a mistake to decline to give any grant under a Cost Increase Order thisyear, since this could rapidly bring local authority services to a halt.The proposed statement of the Government&apos;s intention in respect of1977-78 would in his view provide a very real discipline.    the circular to local authorities on how to make reductions would be clearedin draft with other Ministers concerned.    He would consider whether totable the circular at the meeting of the Consultative Council or merelyrefer to it orally and send a draft to the Local Authority Associationslater.    He regarded the issue of a Press Notice at the end of themeeting as essential.    He would in addition wish to consult the moreimportant trade unions in the local authority field - particularly theNational and Local Government Officers Association and the NationalUnion of Public Employees - and he proposed to call in theirrepresentatives for an informal and confidential warning of thedifficulties which had arisen in advance of the Press statement.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat it was accepted in Cabinet that the best course would be to proceed by co-operation and agreement with the local authorities as far aspossible.    Arrangements should be made to obtain a further return in two months time from local authorities of their prospective current expenditure in 1976-77, and there seemed every reason to hope thatthis might well show an improvement.   At the meeting of the consultative Council on 26 May, the Government representatives should
make it quite clear that the prospective over-spend in 1976-77 wastotally unacceptable, and that steps must be taken to eliminate it.They should also inform the local authorities that the Governmenthad decided that the Rate Support Grant for 1977-78 would be basedon the figures in the last Public Expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 6393)and not upon some higher estimate of next year&apos;s local authorityspending.    In the meantime the Secretary of State for the Environmentshould, as he suggested, prepare to issue a circular giving guidance on how expenditure in 1976-77 might be reduced.    He should alsoconsult informally with the representatives of the trade unions most closely involved and there should be similar informal consultationwith the teachers1 representative on the General Council of the TUC.The Secretary of State for the Environment would consider whetherthe Public Services Committee of the TUC should be consulted, butit would be important to keep the consultations informal and confidential.    Comparable action in all respects would need to betaken in Scotland.The Cabinet -4. Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.5.      Invited the Secretary of State for the environment, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, to be guided accordinglyat the meeting of the Consultative Council on local Government Finance on 26 May.6.      Invited the Secretary of State for the environment, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, to arrange for a furtherreturn of expenditure from local authorities intwo month a1 time.7.      Invited the Secretary of State for the environment, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, to prepare a draft of a circular to local authorities giving guidance onthe way in which expenditure reductions might bemade, such a circular to be issued after 26 May.8.      Invited the Secretary of State for scotland to take parallel action in respect of scottish local authorities.10
THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the prospectiveexcess in 1976-77 on housing had been  200 million; but in discussion with the Secretary of State for the Environmentsavings - of  30 million on housing improvements, and  30 million on municipalisation, both arising from estimating changes - had beenagreed as offsets, so that the net excess now in prospect was 140 million.    Under the Governments present policy, local authority housing investment was totally uncontrolled, and the commitment it involved was therefore open-ended.    By agreement with theSecretary of State for the Environment, officials were now doing aquick study of ways in which this expenditure might be brought under control if Ministers so decided.    That, however, would not affectthe immediate position and he recommended that further ways of off-Betting the 1976-77 exceBS should be sought.    Of the planned figureof  250 million for local authority mortgage lending, 40 per cent oraround  100 million had been held back for later in the year, and itwould be possible, by a moratorium on further new lending by localauthorities to save the whole of this sum.    He recognised thepolitical difficulties of such a course but felt compelled to recommend it to Cabinet.    He did not know how far the Building Societies mightbe able to bridge the resultant gap.    He also suggested that a further 40 million of saving b should be made on housing improvement andmunicipalisation.    He reminded the meeting that the potential claims on the Contingency Reserve were already far above what could possibly be accommodated, and the alternatives to the proposals hehad put forward were unlikely to be any more acceptable.    Thus,some  250 million could be saved by a total moratorium on all newnon-housing building projects; but such a course would have a severeeffect upon the construction industries.    Again,  150 million mightbe saved if there were an across-the-board cut of 2 per cent in allcurrent expenditure other than pay; but thiB would hardly commend itself to his colleagues.   Similarly the idea of cutting transfer payments presented enormous difficulties.    For these reasons be felt compelled to rest upon the proposals he had made.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT pointed outthat half of the excess in prospect was the result of quickercompletions of houses which were in process of being built, aspeeding up which was the direct result of the slack in the buildingindustry.    In his view, when Cabinet decided that public sectorhousebuilding should be left uncontrolled, it meant that Cabinet had accepted the need, should the situation arise which had now come about, to accept the extra expenditure as a legitimate claim on the contingency Reserve.    It might be that the Housing Finance Reviewwould reveal ways of improving the present position, but he was anxious to avoid chaos in housing or political damage for theGovernment.    The recent local authority elections had led to anincrease in the number of Conservative-controlled councils, who were opposed to large-scale housebuilding programmes and who favoured the sale of council houses.    This fact alone might itself soon produce
a reduction in the housing figures.    An indication from theGovernment that they wished housing expenditure to be cut would be welcomed by every Conservative Council and would puzzle every LabourCouncil.    As for municipalisation, he pointed out mat a circularencouraging just this had been issued by his Department only some twomonths earlier.    He had, in discussion with the Chief Secretary,volunteered the  60 million of savings to which the Chief Secretary had referred; and, if left discretion as to where he might find it, hewould be prepared to find a further  40 million.    He did not feel hecould go further than that.In discussion it was observed that in Scotland there should be nodifficulty about keeping within the planned housing expenditure figureseven without withdrawing from the open-ended commitment on housinginvestment.    On occasion there was not enough money available for water and sewerage projects to keep pace with housing and there wouldbe advantage in some increased degree of flexibility over these areas.On local authority mortgage lending, it was suggested that theGovernment should explore the possibility of getting the building societies to make loans to borrowers, and in respect of houses, atpresent covered by the local authorities.    One possibility would be totell the local authorities that they must stop lending in those caseswhere Building Societies were willing and able to lend, else therewould have to be a total moratorium on their lending.    Anotherpossibility would be to find ways of refinancing existing loans,perhaps through the banks.    The practice of treating guarantees as public expenditure, thus swelling the public expenditure figures,should be reconsidered.    It was, however, pointed out that guaranteeswould not induce Building Societies to lend money to borrowers or inrespect of properties which they would not normally touch, and inScotland the guarantee system had been a failure.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the possibility of making further savings on housing expenditure to offset the prospective  140 million excess should be considered further by the Ministers concerned.    In the course of this they should consider the possibility of persuading the Building Societies, throughguarantees or refinancing, to take over some part of the lending atpresent done by local authorities.    For the moment the Cabinet didnot agree either that the  140 million could be accepted as a claim on the Contingency Reserve, or that the 40 per cent of local authoritymortgage lending money at present reserved should be released.These matters would have to be considered again on the basis of afurther report.The Cabinet -9. Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.
10.    Invited the Secretary of State for the environment, in consultation with the Secretaryof State for Scotland, the Secretary of State for wales, the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to consider urgently ways of reducing the prospective excesson housing expenditure In 1976-77, including the role the banks and the Building Societies might play,and to report back urgently.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that, in view of thedemands on the Contingency Reserve, it would be important matevery Minister responsible for a nationalised industry shouldscrutinise with a very critical eye any requests for additionalfinance.    In particular the requirement for the coal stockpile shouldbe kept to a minimum.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that ithad been suggested that the coal stockpile arose because of a lack of demand, attributable in part to the high prices which the consumercould not afford, while another nationalised industry - the central electricity Generating Board - was buying coal overseas and stock-piling it both here and abroad.    Whether there should be a reversion to the earlier arrangement whereby only the National Coal Board wereempowered to import coal was a complex question and not one for settlement at that meeting.    AH Ministers responsible for the nationalised industries should think further about how far they couldcut down claims by their industries on the Contingency Reserve for additional expenditure, including working capital, and should write tothe Chief Secretary, Treasury, indicating the outcome of their consideration.The Cabinet -11.     Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.finalisedtryQditures THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that it&quot;** was now thought that the reduction in the cost of educating overseasstudents would only total  21 million instead of  42 million; butthe Secretary of State for Education and Science had indicated thathe was willing to find the other  21 million from other expenditure under his control.    Clearly it would be necessary to identify thissaving, and officials of the Department should consult with theTreasury to this end.13
The Cabinet -12.     Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discus si on, said thatthe Cabinet had agreed to save  15 million on social securitypayments to students; but the way of doing this would need furtherconsideration in the light of their discussion on child benefits andthis would need to be discussed by the Departments concerned.The Cabinet -13.    Took note, with approval, of the prime minister s summing up of this part of their discussion.14.    Invited the Secretary of State for social services, in consultation with the Secretary ofState for Education and Science and the chief secretary, Treasury, to consider how theproposed savings might be made.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in the last public expenditureprogress report which had been put to the Cabinet (CP(76) 6) therehad been listed (at Items 11-16 of Section A 2 of Table 1 appended to the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper) certain recommended claimstotalling  26 million in 1976-77.    No objection had been raised tothese, but they had not been formally approved, and   he proposedthat this should now be done.The Cabinet -15.
