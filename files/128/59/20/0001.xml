MENTARY  1, The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theS House of Commons during the following week,THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that it was not yetpossible to decide whether there should be a debate on public expenditure before the Recess,    JBt was, however, his aim to stick tonext week&apos;s business, so as to ensure that the Commons stages of theAircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill were completed this month;anrl this would mean holding any debate on public expenditure in thefirst week of August.In a brief discussion it was pointed out that the Second Reading debate on the Finance Bill in the House of Lords on 27 July would take theform of a general economic debate and would inevitably cover public expenditure, before the Commons had had an opportunity to debatethis subject.The Cabinet -Took note.2.

The Secretary of State for Energycirculated at the meeting a note commenting on the proposals in cp(76) 56.^ployerei**tionalJ***ance^ributionTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, as a result oftheir discussions so far, there was a unanimous view in Cabinetthat whatever was to be done must be sufficient to attain theGovernmeufs objectives, which were to steady the pound, enablethe reserves to be rebuilt, repay any drawings on the standby, and avoid the necessity of seeking further assistance from theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF).    To do this it was necessary toreduce the prospective Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR)in 1977-78 to about  9, 000 million;  and after the improvement whichwould take place as a result of increasing economic activity, therewas a gap of some  1,600 million to fill.    The cuts on public expenditure which they had agreed would 1 educe the PSBR by  900- 1, 000 million;  and this left  600-1700 million to be met from increased taxation.    Unless the situation improved more than atpresent forecast, this would mean that tax increases of about 1, 000 million would be needed to bridge the final gap.    If, in thestatement proposed for the following day, this gap were left unclosed,there was a danger that opinion, both at home and overseas, woulddoubt the firmness of the Government1 s intention to take the requiredaction on taxation, since it was known that any increase in direct taxation would be a contravention of the existing agreement with theTrades Union Congress (TUC) on pay, while increases in indirect
taxation would raise the Retail Price Index (RPI) to an unacceptablelevel.    For these reasons it appeared to him mat there would be great advantage in acting now, rather than leaving the tax change to be made in the 1977 Budget.    If legislation could be passed, itwould be possible to include in the National Insurance contributionpaid by employers a surcharge of 2 percentage points.    In a full year this would raise just over  Lt)00 million of revenue, and would reduce the PSBR by about  680 million.    It would add 1 per cent to the RPI twelve months after the start of the scheme, which heenvisaged for 1 January 1977.    The unemployment effect, by thefourth quarter after the change, would be an addition of some12, 000.    He had mentioned the possibility both to Mr Murray of the tuc and to Mr Methven of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI)in confidence; Mr Murray&apos;s view was that the TUC would probably not find such a move objectionable; but Mr Methven1 s reaction wasvery negative.    It would probably make the proposal more acceptable to industry if, at the same time as the surcharge was announced, the investment relief under the Price Code could beraised to 50 per cent - a change which the TUC would probably beprepared to tolerate if it were linked with the taxation proposal.He pointed out that, compared with most other West european countries, the employers1 social security contribution in theUnited Kingdom was very low - 8,8 per cent, compared with20 per cent in Belgium, over 20 per cent in Germany, over 31 per centin France and over 33 per cent in Italy.    In his judgment this wouldbe the least painful way of bridging the residual gap and attaining thePSBR target.    It would not only make the public expenditure cutsmore acceptable to the Government&apos;s supporters, it would also makethe whole package a great deal more credible.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that in bis view the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s proposal completely transformedthe context in which the Cabinet had discussed the proposals forcuts in public expenditure.    The addition of the taxation proposal toraise  1, 000 million would double the deflationary effect of the package,and it would lead to increased unemployment and reduced investment.The Cabinet were being asked to adopt an undiscunsed strategywhich would pre-empt options for the Government to the end of thepresent Parliament.    Both the TUC and the Labour Party had beenprepared for a  L&apos;000 million package.    Now they were suddenly to learn that the Government&apos;s package was twice as big - and thiswas to be announced only 48 hours after the publication of the highestunemployment figures since the war.    The effects of the surchargewould go through into prices and would do grave damage to theGovernment1 s relations with the trade unions.    There was analternative protectionist strategy which he accepted that the cabinet would not discuss further at the present time; but he urged hiscolleagues to agree either to the expenditure cuts or to the new2
taxation proposal, but not to both.    The two together would wipeout the value of all the lesser packages which the Government had announced to assist the employment situation over the last year.What was now proposed was the action which the government thought they might have to take if in the end they were compelledto seek further assistance from the IMF; but there was still thedanger mat even this action might not make such an approachunnecessary.    He therefore strongly opposed the taxation proposal.In discussion it was argued that the new proposal created a differentsituation and altered the whole scale of the Cabinet1 s discussion.It was not clear why the Chancellor, v/ho at an earlier stage hadresisted suggestions that the package should include some taxationchanges, had now decided to make the proposal in CP(76) 56.    Ifthe Cabinet had known that such a proposal might form part of the package, they might well have argued for a very different selection of public expenditure cuts, and they might well have wished to usesome money for the purposes of industrial regeneration.    Theyhad not been able to consider the package as a whole, and neededmore time to give thought to it.    To announce the  2, 000 million of proposals now before the Cabinet would create major difficulty with industry, would rupture the Governmenfs relations with the tuc and would overturn the pay policy.    If this happened, the Governmentwould be wrecking its most precious asset.   At the least theannouncement should be delayed until the following week so that theCabinet had an opportunity to reshape a more acceptable package.There was a danger that, as at present composed, the packagewould be interpreted as directed against the interests of industry,which would undo all the advantage which had been gained in building up a good relationship on the industrial strategy.    Over one-quarterof the cuts fell on the Trade, Industry and Employment block (andthey were all real and not cosmetic).    The addition of an imposton industry would make nonsense of the Governments claim thatthe package was designed to shift resources into industry, althoughit might be possible to mitigate the situation by using part of the proceeds of the surcharge to put more funds into industrial support.The proposed package would be taken as a signal that the Governmenthad chosen to go down the deflationary path, against which they hadstruggled for so long.    It was true that some other countries weredeflating; but none was deflating with a rising level of unemployment.The Chancellor hoped, by striking the right note of confidence, to beable to repay drawings on the standby and avoid recourse to theIMF; but in fact there was no prospect of achieving this, and theIMF were likely to seek to subject the United Kingdom to the discipline of a PSBR lower even than  9, 000 million.    For these reasons the announcement of the proposed package would damage the morale of the Governmenfs supporters very seriously.   At the least thereshould-be associated with the announcement some act of the governments own will, such as the imposition of import quotas, or an Importsurcharge, in order to ensure that the package got the required backing.
Against this it was argued that a large package was needed forconfidence reasons, and that the addition of the proposed surchargewas welcome since a number of Ministers had pressed earlier forsome tax element.    It was however suggested that, while a packageof  L 000 million public expenditure cuts might be inadequate, a surchargeof 2 per cent, producing a further  1 000 million, might go too far theother way.    It had to be remembered that in addition to the1 per cent which the surcharge would add to the RPI and the^ per cent which would be added by the other elements in the package there would be something more - perhaps 0.3 per cent -from the raising of the investment relief under the Price Code to50 per cent; and this imposed on a situation in which inflationmight still be in double figures to the end of 1977,    If the surchargewere imposed at 1 per cent instead of 2 per cent, it would stillprovide a package of  1,300 million which should be adequate.    A2 per cent surcharge would impose an unacceptable burden on industry - who would also have to carry part of the cost of the accident insurance scheme which had been agreed as part of thepublic expenditure package.   Against this, 2 per cent was favouredbecause of the effect this would have on overseas confidence.    Itwas not thought that the CBI attitude towards 2 per cent would bevery different from its attitude towards 1 per cent; while the tradeunions were unlikely to react badly to 2 per cent, since they would see it as a tax on employers.    It was, however, argued that, while2 p?r cent was desirable for overseas opinion, it would be helpful to obtaining acceptance of that figure by home opinion if the packagecould bo sweetened by the allocation of some part of the surchargeproceeds to the National Enterprise Board, and to the scottish and Welsh Development Agencies, although this was hardly likelyto be welcome to the CBI.In continuing discussion, it was contended that the unemploymentconsequences of the package would greatly strain relations with thetrade unions.    When the Chancellor had talked to the TUCinformally, he had indicated that the Governments measures mightadd 70, 000 to the unemployed total.    The effect of the public expenditure cutB was estimated to be an addition of about 60, 000to the unemployed, so that the further 12, 000 which would arise from the taxation change would take the total beyond - but only justbeyond - what the TUC had been told - although some scepticismwas expressed about the likely accuracy of these forecasts.hi reply to those who favoured reopening the expenditure packageso far agreed it was argued that time was now crucial.    There wasa general public expectation of a statement the following day, withthe likelihood of a debate before the Recess, and it simply was notpossible now to go back again over all the ground which theGovernment had covered in tho last four meetings on this subject.If the total of the package represented some degree of over-insurance,that was no bad thing given the inherent uncertainty of the situation.4
On the question of import restrictions, it was recognised that theproposed package would be more acceptable to the Labour party ifsomething could be said about import deposits or other import restrictions;  and in terms of mechanics it would be possible toimpose import deposits by means of a Ways and Means Resolution,relying upon the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act until the substantive legislation could be passed.    However, to seek tointroduce such deposits without prior consultation with both theEuropean Community and the Commonwealth would be fatal; andsuch consultations could not be carried out in less than a week.It might be possible to annour.ce that the Government proposed totake an initiative with the TUC and CBI to consider the possibility of imposing import controls on come industries; but the danger ofsuch a course was that an advance announcement of this kind could lead to uncertainty and to forestalling action on a massive scale.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up mis part of the discussion, saidthat there was no doubt that the proposals as a whole would create a great deal of opposition.    The question was: would they strainrelations with the Trades Union Congress to breaking point?    Hethought they would not, although they would certainly strain relationsvery heavily.    The majority of Ministers appeared to agree that, ifaction were to be taken, it should be on a large enough scale toavoid any likelihood of further trouble in the autumn, and therewac therefore a balance of opinion in favour of imposing the surchange on employers1 national insurance contributions at per cent.    It was true that this would have a deflationary effect,but it would take some considerable time to work its way throughthe economy and the hope was that by the time it did unemployment would in fact be moving down.    If, after taking the action on whichthey were now agreed, the Government were unable to repaydrawings from the standby and were thus compelled, by theirunderstanding with the countries who had advanced the standby, togo to the IMF for further assistance, it should be possible to resistproposals for any further deflationary action,    hi his view theproposals went to the limit which the Government should be preparedto tolerate in this respect.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.2.        Authorised the Chancellor of the exchequer in his statement the following day, to announce theimposition from 1 January 1977 of a surcharge of2 per cent on employers1 national insurance contribution s.5
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatat their meeting earlier in the day, the Cabinet had agreed total public expenditure savings of  952 million.   It now appeared thata further  75 million of saving would arise on debt interest as aresult of the reduction of  1.60.0 million in the PSBR which the Cabinet,by its public expenditure and taxation decisions, had brought about.Debt interest was outside the public expenditure programmes but was part of the public expenditure total, and it was therefore quitelegitimate to count the real saving this  75 million represented.The total of public expenditure savings would thus rise to 1, 027 million and no further cuts were necessary.    On the questionof additional funds for industrial support, no figure could be givenin the statement to be made the following day.    However, it shouldbe made clear that the intention was that a significant sum shouldbe available for more selective support for industry, in particularthrough the National Enterprise Board and the Scottish and WelshDevelopment Agencies.    The figures would then not need to be givenuntil the publication of the annual White Paper on Public Expenditurelater in the year.    Officials should now proceed with the preparationof the figures for 1978- 79 and later years in the light of thedecisions on 1977-78, and Cabinet would consider the expenditurein those years after the Recess.The Cabinet -3.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER said that a provisional draft of the following day&apos;s statement had been circulated, but in his view it would need agood deal of redrafting.    This would be done in the course of the evening and a further version would be circulated to all membersof Cabinet the following morning.    He proposed to see all junior ministers at noon the following day in order to inform them of the contents of the package; and he would be speaking on the telephoneto President Ford, Chancellor Schmidt and possibly alsoPresident Giscard.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer would makethe statement in the House the following day, and he would himselfconsider whether he should make a Ministerial broadcast in the evening.    It seemed likely that the Government would be pressed to have a debate before the House rose for the Recess; but it wasnot possible at present to see when this could most easily be accomodated.    If it were to take place in the week beginning26 July, it would mean mat eseential legislation requiring severewhipping would have to be moved into the week beginning 2 August.6
On the other hand, if the debate on the package took place in theweek of 2 August it would be important for the Government to beable to muster full support.    It would be sensible to avoid entering into any commitments about this in the House of Commons thefollowing afternoon, and, if the Opposition pressed the point, tosay that the Government would take note of it and discuss it throughthe usual channels.The Cabinet -4.        Took note, with approval, of the prime minister s statement.Cabinet Office22 July 19767
