1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.It was noted in discussion that the Opposition had asked for a debate on the Governments agreement on pay with the Trades UnionCongress (TUC), and the question of arranging a debate would needconsideration.    It might be difficult to justify not arranging anyParliamentary debate on this subject until after the TUC special conference in June, although there was no spare Government time available; but It was always open to the Opposition to choose thissubject for a Supply Day, although in fact they were probably not verykeen on a debate.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that an agreement had been reached with the Conservative Party, and he hoped that agreement would also be reached with the other Parties in the courseof the day.    A Motion would then be put down which would go a longway towards giving the Opposition what they wanted but would still leave the Committee of Selection with considerable flexibility.    Thenew arrangements would apply to Standing Committees now being setup, including that on the Health Services Bill.    The Opposition would now have no case for going back on the agreement they had made aboutthe time by which Bills at present in Standing Committee should be reported.In discussion, the suggestion was made that consideration should begiven to changing Standing Orders to embody the principle that theStanding Committee on each Bill should reflect the majority for that bill on Second Reading rather than the composition of the House.This would insure against a Bill which had received a majority in theHouse being cut to ribbons in Standing Committee.    On the other hand it was pointed out that such a change would give the Opposition greaterincentive to vote against the Second Readings of Bills; and opposition parties which had voted for Bills on Second Reading might claimplaces on the Government side in Standing Committee, but would notnecessarily support the Government when voting on amendments.    Inany event the Opposition Parties would not favour such a change, and could not be forced to accept It in present Parliamentary circums-tances.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that the motion proposed by the Lord President of the Council was well wordedand should be supported.1
The Cabinet -L. Took note, with approval, of thePrime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.SelectCommitteeon DirectElectionsPreviousReference:Conclusions *Minute 1THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL reported thatobjections had been raised by some leading opponents of directelections to the terms of reference which had been approved bythe Cabinet at their meeting on 29 April.    They wished the termsof reference to refer to &quot;proposals&quot; for direct elections as well as&quot;arrangements&quot;; and to &quot;any&quot; commitment rather than &quot;the&quot;commitment to proceed to such elections, since this was in their view a commitment of the Government and not of the House.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Government had intended to allow the Committee to considerthe &quot;proposals&quot; as well as the &quot;arrangements&quot; for direct elections and there was no objection to making this clear.    But there couldbe no going back on the commitment to direct elections which hadbeen accepted by the Government and by most Members ofParliament.   There seemed little advantage in a reference to theobligation in Article 138 of the Treaty of Rome, but the lord president could offer a reference to &quot;the Government&apos;s commitment&quot;.It was not certain mis would avoid a debate which might be pxessedto a vote but the Select Committee was after all intended to helpParliament and a decision whether to appoint it could be left to theHouse.The Cabinet -2.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited the Lord President of the Council toproceed accordingly.2
j^SS 2.        THE PRIME MINISTER said that the was much concerned byAK the appearance in The Times that morning of an account of theCaMnefs previous discussion of the Child Benefit rate and tran-sitioaal arrangements for non-resident children.   The article showed a depth of knowledge which could scarcely have been obtained bycasual questioning or intelligent guess-work on the part of the writer.He was not disposed to ascribe this leak to a deliberate attempt tobring pressure to bear on the Cabinet in their further discussion ofthese issues, but there had at the minimum been looseness in the observance of the instructions set out In paragraphs 28-30 of the note on Questions of Procedure for Ministers (C(PR)(76) l).   Theseemphasised the damaging effect of leaks of this kind on the reputation of the Government and on the efficiency of administration; and it was important to ensure that there was no recurrence.    He asked all members of the Cabinet to see that the circulation of cabinet memoranda and minutes did not extend beyond junior Ministers and advisers with a genuine need to know and to impress on all concerned the prime importance of avoiding premature or unauthorised disclosure of their proceedings.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^statement.BjXjjP 3.

4.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELANDinformed the Cabinet that in the early hours of the morning eight menof the Special Air Service in three cars had accidentally entered theIrish Republic near the village of Clontygota.   Two of the men weredressed in the uniform of a Parachute Regiment and the remainingsix were in civilian clothes.    All were armed.    The men had beenapprehended by Irish Republic police and were being heW in the custody of the Garda at Dundalk.   Efforts were being made to secure their early release.    They had been on their way to man anobservation post and their entry into the Republic had been accidental.Nevertheless the incident was an embarrassing one and if the menwere not quickly released It could give rise to considerable contro-versy and possibly to damage to cross-Border co-operation.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would speak to the Taoiseach by telephone in order to put the matter in perspective and try to   securethe early release of the men.The Cabinet -Took note.NORTHERNICELANDCabinet Office6 May 19764
&quot;^HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAjESTY*S government copy NO 35CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(76) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday 6 May 1976 at 11. 00 am the Cabinet had before them a further memorandum by theSecretary of State for Social Services (CP(76) 7) and a note by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP(76) 8), covering a further memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury on the ChildBenefit (CB) rate; and a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Social Services (CP(76) 3) on transitional arrangements fornon-resident children.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinefs last discussion hadbeen useful in identifying the main political and other issues involved.    He had since received an excellent report from theWhip&apos;s Office which had created fresh doubts in his own mindabout the political implications of the timing of the introduction ofthe CB scheme and on which he would ask the Chief Whip to reportto the Cabinet.THE CHIEF WHIP said that the advice given in the report by theWhips was that to introduce the CB scheme in April 1977 would havegrave political consequences which were not foreseen when the BUIwent through the House of Commons.   A basic effect of the schemewas to increase the amount of tax which people would pay, in returnfor a tax-free benefit for the mothers of families.    The point hadbeen made at the Cabinet&apos;s last discussion that the public might need to be educated to accept the merits of this transfer of cashfrom husband to wife; there was little doubt of this and considerable doubt whether the process of education would be successful, at anyrate in the time now available.    The scheme would therefore belikely to increase the Government&apos;a difficulties in the implementation of their economic strategy! it would be introduced, and the increasein liability to tax would begin, in the middle of the next round of pay negotiations and against the background of a successful negotiation of pay policy for the current year which rested heavily, in terms ofCHILDBENEFITPreviousReference:QM(76) 2ndConclusions,Minute 31
its public acceptability, on agreed tax cuts.    It would, in his view,be wrong to allow anticipated criticism by pressure groups toprevent the Government from deferring the scheme if the interestsof their economic strategy as a whole suggested that this was desirable.In discussion, there was considerable support for the view that thepublic were ill-prepared for the distributional effects of the CBschemes as between husband and wife and that these would be likelyto arouse particularly strong opposition amongst miners and similar sections of the working community.    This would be particularly unfortunate if the scheme were introduced during thenext round of the renegotiation of pay agreements.   Any deferment,however, would probably have to be for two years in order to avoid a situation in which the CB scheme, with its higher liability to tax,was introduced at the same time as the new pension scheme, withits higher rates of contribution for employees.    The point wasalso made that a deferment of the scheme and, consequentially,the general retention of Child Tax Allowances (CTAs) for a further period, would avoid some of the political difficulties which wouldbe inherent in the retention of CTAb, for a transitional period, inrespect of non-resident children only.    On the other hand, it was argued that mere would be great administrative and operationalcomplications about such a late decision to defer the introductionof the CB scheme- the printing of new order books was nowcomplete except for the rate and the same books would have to be over-printed and used for any extension of the Family Allowances(FAM) scheme; the process of recruiting extra staff to handle the transition to the CB scheme was already under way and there mightbe considerable political and local employment difficulties inreversing this.    More importantly, given the commitments madein two general elections and the specific assurances which had beengiven in Parliament last summer by the then Secretary of State for social Services, which were carried through in the public expenditure White Paper published in February, the Government&apos;scredibility would be severely damaged by a decision to defer.    Theintroduction of the scheme had effectively been postponed oncealready, and mere would be growing doubts whether the government intended to proceed with it at all.   Against this it was argued that a postponement of the scheme, if carefully pre Bented, would enhancethe Government&apos;s credibility in terms of their determination to restrain public expenditure and tackle the problems of inflation.It would, however, be necessary to consider possible measureswhich might be taken to soften the criticisms which would inevitably be made.    These might include a decision to extend FAM to firstchildren and some action on school meal charges; it would in anycase be necessary to arrange for the continuation of the ChildInterim Benefit Scheme (CHTB) for one-parent families.    The full
implications and costs of possible measures of this kind shouldbe examined as a matter of urgency.    The suggestion was also made that before the Government reached any decision to defer the CB scheme, there would be a case for full and frank discussions with the trades unions and other interests concerned about its implications in terms of the Government^ economic strategy.    Onthe other hand, it was argued that the Government would lose agood deal of credibility if they were seen to be unable to reach adecision on a matter which had been under consideration for solong; full discussions with all the interests concerned wouldcertainly be necessary, but as part of the Government&apos;spresentation of their decision.    Some doubt was expressedwhether a decision to extend FAM to first children, apart fromthe cost involved (which would be as much as  150 million unlessthe concession were to be made at the expense of the existing ratesfor other children^ would in fact be likely to help in reducingcriticism of a decision to defer the CB scheme; it might, on thecontrary, strengthen the belief that the Government were discardingthe scheme altogether.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that there was, regrettably, little real publicunderstanding as yet of the consequences of the CB scheme andthat there might be a sharp political reaction against it.    It wastherefore clearly necessary to weigh very carefully the political disadvantages of introducing the scheme at the present timeagainst the tangible benefits which it would be likely to providefor families as a whole.    These benefits would be relatively smallon any scale of public expenditure which the Cabinet would belikely to regard, in present circumstances, as a reasonable claim on the Contingency Reserve.   A decision to defer introduction ofthe CB scheme, however, would require very careful presentation;and before reaching a final decision, the Cabinet would wish to be fully informed of the financial, administrative and operationalimplications of a deferment, including the implications for CivilService manpower.    Officials should therefore urgently prepare a paper, for circulation to the Cabinet, which would cover thesematters and also examine, on the lines indicated in the Cabinet&apos;a discussion, possible compensating measures, and their cost, whichmight be combined with any decision to defer the introduction of theCB scheme.    The paper should also set out the relative advantages and disadvantages of a one-year and a two-year postponement.The Cabinet would resume their discussion at the first convenient opportunity.
The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the prime minister s Bumming up of their discussion,2, Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet toarrange for the urgent preparation of a paper by officials on the lines indicated in the summing up.Cabinet office May 1976
