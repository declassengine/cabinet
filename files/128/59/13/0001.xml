*Hls DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NOCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(76) X3th conclusions tuesday 6 July 1976 at 10,00 am^UBLIC The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chancellor ofEXPENDITURE    the Exchequer (CP(76) 42) proposing reductions in public expenditurein 1977-78; a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Energy(CP(76) 43) proposing an alternative course of action; and a note bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP(76) 40) covering the 1976report by the Public Expenditure Survey Committee (PESC).THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that it was essentialto keep both the economy and the social contract afloat.    He hadresisted pressure for unjustified cuts in public expenditure in1976-77; but in his view the prospect of economic growth in 1977-78and 1978-79 could be threatened by excessive domestic consumption,both private and public.    The provisional Short Term EconomicForecast, showed that the economy was growing faster than had previously been assumed; Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was likelyto grow by 5 per cent between mid-1976 and mid-1977 with a growth of 9 per cent in manufacturing output. These rates werehigh by past standards, but it would be necessary to maintain themfor three years if the Governments employment target was to beachieved.    Manufacturing investment in 1976-77 was likely to be15 per cent higher than in the preceding year; and unemployment was unlikely to rise above its present level.    The improved growthprospects were based on exports, which were expected to grow by11 per cent in volume in 1976 and 12 per cent in 1977, mainly becauseBritish products were now very competitive.    On the external side,however, the change in the terms of trade, and the J-curve effectof devaluation, meant a deterioration in the balance of payments.Commodity prices were rising higher and faster than had been expected, and invisible earnings were likely to be lower next year than this.     The balance of payments deficit in 1976 was now expected to beabout  500 million, while in 1977 it would be up to  2, 000 million on present policies, and there was no sign of any improvement thereafter.
In resource terms the problem was whether industry would havethe capacity to cope with the extra demand for exports and import-substitution without the development of bottlenecks.    The danger was that domestic demand might be excessive, particularly if theprivate savings ratio were to fall.    The main problem, however,was one of financing the country&apos;s external deficit over the next two years.    If overseas lenders were to allow us to borrow 3, 500 million, they would need to be satisfied about the viability ofthe country&apos;s economic strategy.    They - the international monetary Fund (IMF) and the individual countries from whom we might borrow - were concerned about the growth of the moneysupply with a high public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR).It was true that, as economic activity revived, the PSBR should fallfrom  11, 500 million in 1976-77 to  10, 500 million in 1977-78 on present policies (and assuming no revalorisation next year of tax allowances); but no other country was planning to continue with as higha Government borrowing requirement.    Indeed the United States,France and Germany were all planning to cut or eliminate theirdeficits.It would be no solution to raise interest rates since this wouldchoke off economic recovery, or to allow the money supply to growand feed inflation.    It was in his view essential to reduce the prospective PSBR next year by a further  1, 000 million.   This could bedone in theory either through taxation or through public expenditure,but it would not be safe to make the whole of the required reductionby taxation.    This would require an increase of 3p in the standard rate of income tax, which would cost the single man  1, 38p a week from his pay at a time when real take home pay would be fallingand would be likely to wreck the pay policy.    If, instead, the sum required were raised through indirect taxes, that would add some.7 per cent to the Retail Price Index.    It was therefore necessaryto do as much as possible by public expenditure reductions.    his memorandum suggested cuts of  1,250 million in the programmeslisted in Cmnd 6393, which would reduce the PSBR by   1, 000 million;but he was prepared tc settle for cuts of   1, 000 million, which wouldtake   700 million off the PSBR.    In announcing cuts of this magnitude, he would have to make clear what the Governmentsobjective for the PSBR was in 1977-78 and also to announce that steps were being taken to limit the money supply,    hi addition tothe resources and financing arguments for this course, he had toemphasise the precarious nature of the external confidence problem.The slide in the exchange rate at the end of May would have led tocatastrophe had not the $5,300 million standby been made available -and even so further money had had to be spent subsequently to keepthe rate steady.    If the PSBR next year were not reduced, therewas a serious risk of a run on the pound of a magnitude which using the whole of the standby credit could not stem.   After the last2
drawing from the IMF, some foreign borrowings, and somedrawing from the standby, the United Kingdom reserves stood ataround $5, 000 million.    The remaining credits available from the IMFwould not in fact be sufficient to repay the whole of the standby -and there was still the problem of financing the deficit for theremainder of 1976 and 1977,    Early action was therefore essential if a sterling crisis in August, which could necessitate even morepainful decisions in an emergency situation, was to be avoided.He therefore recommended the cut of  1, 000 million in public expenditure proposed in his paper.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that he was opposedto the expenditure cuts which the Chancellor of the Exchequer wasrecommending; and he very much regretted the publicity given tothis recommendation since it meant mat if the Cabinet did not agreethey might well precipitate the crisis of confidence which the cutswere designed to avert.    He noted that the cuts required were of theorder of   1, 000- 1,250 million, plus the reabaorption of the additionalbids of some  1, 600 million listed in the PESC report, making a total reduction of nearly  3, 000 million.   The Cabinet had seen no specificfinancial forecast of the likely size of the public sector borrowing requirement, and no quantitative forecast of the extent to which itwould fall as economic recovery proceeded.    Nor were any taxoptions set out in the Chancellor&apos;s paper.    He did not deny thatthere were very real problems to be dealt with.    On the politicalplane, the Opposition had aligned themselves with the market toshake confidence in the Government,    The trade unions and theLabour Party had been told that wage claims led to inflation, andin response to this they had now agreed to a restrictive wages policy.    They had been told that strikes caused industrialdisruption, and industrial disputes were now at a very low level.Having gone so far to meet the Government, were they now to be told that there would have to be further public expenditure cuts?This could only lead to a fatal erosion of the Governmentsrelationship with the trade unions.    In economic terms, the PSBRwould fall as economic growth built up.    The industrial and resourcearguments which had been put forward were weak - the country wasnot in a raging boom, but was at the bottom of a slump, and therewas certainly no need to reduce demand to make room for industrial investment and exports.    On the international monetary front, thecountry waB very vulnerable as a result of the  7, 000 million of short-term sterling holdings in London, which meant that the confidencearguments had to be taken seriously; but the Government should consider possible ways of funding this short term debt and winningthe support of the international monetary community for doing so.In his view it was essential to retain the confidence both of theTrades Union Congress (TUC) and the IMF, and therefore to havediscussions with both.    Public expenditure should be reviewed in
accordance with the normal timetable, and no doubt in the processthere would be some scope for savings, but drastic public expenditure cuts would not touch the real problems of the country which were touse and expand industrial capacity by concentrating imports on industrial re-equipment and restraining imports for consumption.Taxation on goods with a high imported content could be increased;and Bteps should be taken to ensure that the higher profits arisingfrom the relaxations in the Price Code were in fact devoted to industrial investment,   A long and searching discussion with theIMF was possible because the IMF did not wish to bring about a fallin sterling and knew that the maintenance of the social contract was essential to continued good government in this country.    only through discussion with the IMF could appropriate financial targetsbe identified.hi discussion, a good deal of doubt was cast on the validity of theresource arguments for cutting public expenditure in 1977-78.Retail sales were not buoyant, and the effect of the pay limit wouldsurely be to keep private consumption fairly flat.    Some of theproposed cuts - in housing and subsidies - would in fact have effectsin 1976-77, when recovery was certainly not under way.    TheTreasury forecasts were more optimistic than those of the NationalInstitute for Economic and Social Research.    If the cuts proposed were made they could add some 30-40, 000 or more to the total ofunemployed in 1976-77, rising perhaps to 70, 000 by mld-1978 -although by the latter period unemployment as a whole would ofcourse be falling.    There might well be growth in output from an export-led boom; but it did not follow that unemployment would fall correspondingly quickly, since it was well known that employmentlagged behind output.    Industry would, in the early stages of the recovery, increase production by the more efficient use of theirexisting resources.    It would be important for Cabinet to have detailed information on the unemployment implications of both the   1, 000 million of cuts now proposed, and of the   1, 600 million of additionalbids which had to be eliminated or offset.    One possibility would beto state firmly that the Government would not exceed the publishedpublic expenditure figures but would certainly not take further steps which would add to unemployment,    hideed there was a good case for preparing an unemployment package to put more money into areas of high unemployment.    Unless something of this kind were done, theGovemmenfs relationship with the trade unions would be eroded.The concept of shifting resources into the balance of payments andindustrial investment could be highly relevant to 1978-79, but not to1977-78; and the argument that insufficient savings would beavailable in 1977-78 to meet all needs was weak, since industry was already more liquid than last year and would be getting the benefits of the changes in the Price Code,   Against this it was argued thatthe resources argument was even more important than had been4
suggested,    if large sums had to be borrowed abroad, this would inevitably force up interest rates - and United Kingdom rates were already higher than those of our trading competitors - and thushold back the industrial investment needed.    Even if the resourcesargument related more to 1978-79 than to the previous year, itwas hard to believe that economic forecasting could be so preciseabout particular periods.    If action were left for a further year, itmight well be too late to exploit the enormous opportunities of theeconomic upturn.    In 1976, even though the United Kingdom was more competitive than it had been for a long time, its share of world trade was likely to drop.    If that share were to be maintained,there would certainly be capacity problems in some parts of Britishindustry (eg motor car production), and if private savings were reduced, there could well be an increased demand for consumerdurables.    The resources problem was therefore a real one.On the question of confidence, it was argued that any measures to cutpublic expenditure by   1, 000 million would jeopardise the maintenanceof the pay policy, not just because of the addition of one-quarter of aper cent to the Retail Price Index, but because of the political andtrade union consequences of cutting such services as housing and education.    This in turn could damage international confidence asmuch as the PSBR which the cuts were designed to reduce.Furthermore the damage would not be confined to the relationship with the trade unions, but would spread to the Governmentsrelations with the Parliamentary Party and with Labour localauthorities, from whom the cuts would evoke a bitter response.On the other hand, it was argued that the real question was whether areduction of  1,000 million in the PSBR next year would be enough.There had been pressure for a cut of  2, 000 million in the borrowing requirement; and for this reason it might - depending on how far the situation improved as a result of economic recovery - benecessary to make some tax increases next year in addition to expenditure cuts this year.    It was noted that, but for the standbycredit at the beginning of June, the rate could have dropped to, say,$1.50, which would have added 7 per cent to the Retail Price Indexand have produced cataclysmic financing problems.    The standbycredit was obtained only on condition that the United Kingdom went to the IMF if, at the end of the 6 months, it was unable to repayany drawings; and it was noted that not all the contributors to thestandby believed that it would provide sufficient stability to last for months.    The truth was that the situation had been extremely serious when the credit was negotiated, and the Cabinet could easily have found themselves having to conduct the present discussions against the background of a plunging rate.    The riskswere highly asymmetrical: the potential dangers flowing from takingno action were far greater than any which could possibly flow fromthe kind of action now proposed.    The problems were real, and were5
known to our creditors, who could see our large balance ofpayments deficit, the likelihood of it increasing, the rate of inflation still higher than that of otter countries and the highaccumulation of debt.   All these considerations made action of thekind proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer essential.On the que stion of what action should be taken, it was argued thatit was unnecessary to take the whole of the burden of reducing thePSBR in the form of cuts in expenditure.    Such cuts would begin to bite in the spring of 1977, when settlements under the secondround of tho social contract were being made, and when discussions would be in train about what might succeed Round 2.    The selection of cuts proposed was highly regressive in its social impact; cutsin housing expenditure and subsidies would hit those less well-off and would be very unwelcome to the trade unions.    The cabinet should be given material to enable it to consider tax increases asan alternative to some expenditure cuts, so that a mixed packagemight be evolved.    It was true that taxes on alcohol and tobaccoincreased the Retail Price Index, but this would be more defensiblethan increasing the cost of essentials by reducing food subsidies.Not only should some tax increases be included, but the possibilityof actually increasing expenditure on some programmes - urbandeprivation and employment - so as to present the package as areordering of priorities, should be considered.    It was also argued that it would be important, if any package were to be sold to thetrade unions, that the investment programmes of the public sector of industry should go ahead and that the National Enterprise board should not be starved of resources.On the question of consultation, mere was a wide measure ofagreement that it would be essential, preferably before theGovernment had taken any final decisions, to consult both theParliamentary labour Party and the TUC.    In the latter case thedifficulties of the position of the TUC representatives On the national economic Development Council and the inadequate extent to which theyreflected the views of the public sector unions, had to be borne inmind.    The aim would be to explain fully and frankly the difficultieswhich the Government faced, and to invite views on the action which,in this situation, the Government should take.    The exercise would need to be presented to the trade unions as an essential step to the strengthening of our industrial base.    It must be genuineconsultation, and it was for consideration whether it should not alsoextend to the Labour local authorities and perhaps also to a jointmeeting between the Cabinet and the National Executive Committeeof the Labour Party.
In the course of further discussion the following additional points were made -a. While there was much to be said for making arrange-ments to fund the existing  7, 000 million of short-term debt if this could be done, there was no prospect of doing so without a gooddeal of help from other countries, help which would not be forthcoming unless they were completely satisfied with theUnited Kingdom&apos;s position and policies.b. To open up a dialogue with the IMF before taking decisions on public expenditure could be disastrous.   The IMF would demand changes in policy more severe than those proposed bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer; and such demands would leakand be very damaging for the Government, both politically andin relation to external confidence.    Indeed in the normal annualconsultation with the Fund staff in May, the IMF had taken theview that the United Kingdom should cut the PSBR by  2,000 million and should face higher unemployment.    Nor could too much bemade of the argument that the United Kingdom could rely uponthe IMF &apos;s unwillingness to see sterling drop heavily.    The Fundmight prefer not to see it drop, but sterling was no longer thelynch-pin in the world monetary system which it had once been.c. The United Kingdom presented its public sector borrow-ing requirement figures in a manner which was disadvantageousto its interests.    It was appreciated that it was not possible to change the presentation immediately, but it was a matter whichcalled for later consideration.    It was noted that arrangements were already being made to publish a figure for the generalGovernment deficit, which would exclude the borrowing onaccount of the nationalised industries investment needs.d.        Finally it was pointed out that the public expenditurereductions proposed in the paper by the Chief Secretary attachedto the Chancellor of the Exchequers memorandum representedhis assessment of what was technically and administrativelyfeasible.    It would be for Cabinet to judge how far they werepolitically possible also.    Because of the time constraint, itwould be necessary for the Chief Secretary to proceed forthwith to conduct bilateral discussions with the spending Ministers,but the nature of such discussions made it difficult to considerthe overall effect of the proposed changes on the Governmentspriorities.    It would be desirable for Cabinet to have anopportunity to discuss the general shape of the emergingpackage after there had been a discussion with the parliamentary labour Party.   At the same time it would be necessary to take into account the employment implications of the proposals,including the action to eliminate or provide savincs in place ofthe  1,600 million of additional bids shown in the PESC report.7
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that inthe course of discussion a range of views had been expressed, but,whether on resource grounds or for confidence reasons, there seemed to be a majority in the Cabinet which favoured an early statement by the Government of action to reduce next year&apos;s public sector borrowing requirement.    No final decisions were howeverbeing taken at the present meeting.    Whether any action takenshould consist wholly, or only partly, of reductions in public expenditure was a matter which would need to be discussed further,as would the composition of any particular package of cuts.    Therewas widespread agreement that it would be essential, if theGovernment were to maintain the confidence of its supporters inParliament and not damage its relations with the trade unions, for there to be early consultation both with the parliamentary LabourParty - which should take place the following week - and with theTrades Union Congress.    There was a general feeling that thisshould be genuine consultation, to be held before the Governmenthad reached any final decisions on what they should do; but at thesame time it was recognised that the Governmext could not put thedecisions into commission, and that having listened to the reactions of and advice from the Party and the TUC, they would then have todecide themselves the content and timing of any public announcement.The Cabinet would consider the issues further at a meeting in themiddle of July, at which the general shape of a possible package,and the possibility of including some taxation adjustments as wellas some possible increases in certain expenditures, particularly onunemployment and urban deprivation could be considered.    In themeantime, the Chief Secretary, Treaoury ohould proceed tohave bilateral discussions with the spending Ministers on a contingent basis with a view to identifying as far as possible those areas on which it might be possible to agree that, if Cabineteventually decided that expenditure cuts were essential, such cutsmight fall,    hi making this selection, it would be important tohave regard to the effects upon employment of particular cuts, andthis information should as far as possible be made available to cabinet, who would also need information on the tax changes whichmight form part of the package, including their likely effect uponthe Retail Price Index.    The bilateral discussions should also cover the handling of the additional bids of  1,600 million shown in the PESCreport which the Cabinet were agreed must either be eliminated orreplaced by other savings,    Ih a difficult situation it was essentialto preserve both solidarity in the Cabinet and also completeconfidentiality about their discussion.    This had been a useful one,but the decisions remained to be taken.The Cabinet -1. Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.8
2,        Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, tohold bilateral discussions on a contingent basis withthe spending Ministers to identify those areas inwhich public expenditure reductions might be made if,in due course, the Cabinet decided that such reductionswere necessary; to determine how the additional bidsof  1? 600 million should be handled;  and to report backby 15 July.3.        Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate information about the estimated employmenteffects of possible expenditure reductions, and information about possible tax adjustments and theirlikely effect upon the Retail Price Index.4.        Agreed to resume their discussion at alater date.Cabinet office July 19769
