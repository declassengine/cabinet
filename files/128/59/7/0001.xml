1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the week beginning 7 June,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY reported that twoamendments which had been put down by Labour Members for theReport Stage of the Aircraft and Shipbuilding industries Bill were likely to be supported by the Conservatives and could causes considerable difficulty.    The first amendment, byMr Frederick Willey, would alter the reference period for the calculation of compensation; if it were carried the additional costmight be  80 million, the Bill would need extensive redrafting and third Reading might have to be deferred.    The amendment mightattract some support from other Labour Members in the erroneousbelief that the additional money would help shipbuilding companies in their areas.    The other amendment, by a group of labour members, would exclude Bristol Channel Ship Repairers from theBill, contrary to the Government&apos;s clear commitment to nationaliseship repairers*THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said theCabinet noted that efforts were being made to dissuade the Membersconcerned from pressing their amendments.    It was important thatall Ministers should be present to vote on them.The Cabinet -1. Took note.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that it was nowthought that it would be possible to get this Bill through Parliamentduring the current Session, and it was proposed to proceed with theBill in the House of Lords before the House of Commons, by introducing a Weights and Measures (No 2) Bill in the Lords beforethe Whitsun Recess.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a very brief discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed with this proposal.The Cabinet -2.        Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.1
2, THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY slidthat the North Atlantic Council meeting in Oslo had given him theopportunity to hold useful private discussions with the IcelandicForeign Minister, Mr Agustsson, and with the Icelandic PrimeMinister, Mr Halgrlmmson, who had flown to Oslo to join the talks.    It now seemed that, perhaps for the first time, both sidesgenuinely wanted to reach an agreement, and they were quitenear to an agreed text which could form the basis for a very briefnegotiation.    He had been expecting to fly to Oslo the following day to conduct this negotiation in the hope that it would be concluded intime for a statement to parliament before the Whitsun Recess, butthe latest news from the Icelandic side showed that this timetablewas likely to slip by a day or two.    The agreement now in prospectwould no doubt be criticised by the fishing industry, but the moreintelligent members of that industry would know that it was in fact the best agreement available.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary,2
^MENTARY 3.        The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord PresidentCEMENT ON    of the Council (CP(76) ?2) to which was attached a draftT0LUTION Parliamentary statement together with a revised version of thedraft statement prepared after discussion in the ministerial committee on Devolution Strategy on 24 May.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that it was important that the Government should announce their intentions ona number of important procedural matters concerning theforthcoming Devolution Bill and also on certain devolution policy issues in advance of the Conference of the Scottish National Partylater in the week.    His proposed statement built on consensuswithin the Labour movement in Scotland and on increasing consensusin Wales and would serve to recruit essential support for theGovernment&apos;a policies.   All the matters dealt with had been fully discussed in the Ministerial Committees on Devolution Policy (DVP)and Devolution Strategy (DVY).    Conclusions had still to be reached by these Committees on a number of other important issues whichwould, he hoped, form the substance of a further statement to bemade before the Summer Recess.In discussion of the revised draft statement the following points were made -a. The omission of a r&amp;affirmation of the Government1 intentions for the universities was without prejudice tofurther collective consideration of the issue.b. While the possibility of a referendum on theGovernments present devolution proposals should be rejected, the terms in which this was done should notcompletely rule out the possibility of a later referendumon eg Scottish separatism should this become expedient.c. The proposals for a further measure of devolution inrespect of the Scottish and Welsh Development Agenciesinvolved crossing a boundary previously drawn to exclude the devolved administrations from economic matters.There was some risk that this concession would encouragepressure for further advances in this field and thus imperil the economic unity of the United Kingdom,    On the other hand it was clear that the changes proposed would do more than anything else to rally the support of the Labour movement inScotland and the Scottish Trade Union Congress; whereasrefusal to make them would alienate moderate opinion andthreaten the Governments whole strategy.   It should bepossible to protect the United Kingdom interest both by theproposed guidelines and by making it clear from the outset thatthere could be no question of devolving responsibility for regional or other selective assistance under the Industry Act.3
d.        The definition (paragraph 13) of the roles of theterritorial Secretaries of State should not refer to, even to repudiate, the allegation that they might act as&quot;autocratic supervisors&quot; of the devolved administrations.A number of drafting amendments were agreed.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the draft statement as revised in discussion and agreed that it should be made in both Houses of Parliament that afternoon.    The framing of the Governmenfs proposals hadinvolved a number of difficult decisions but it was of the utmost importance that all Ministers should show whole-hearted support for them in order to reap the maximum political advantage.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.4.        THE PRIME MINISTER said that the further embarrassingarticle by the Social Services correspondent of The Times whichhad appeared in that newspaper on the morning following theCabinetfs last discussion of Child Benefit had been written beforethe Cabinet minutes were circulated: it must therefore trace itsorigin, directly or indirectly,     to  someone who had been present at the discussion,    It was a serious matter that the Cabinet&apos;decisions and the subsequent presentation of them should be prejudiced in this way.    The recent Motion on the Order Paper,which had attracted a substantial number of signatures, was clearly a direct result of the Press leaks which had attended the discussions on Child Benefit.    He appealed once more to all his colleagues toexercise a proper sense of responsibility by restricting knowledgeof sensitive Cabinet proceedings to those in Government immediately concerned.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement.4
5.        THE PRIME MINISTER Invited the Chancellor of theExchequer to report the outcome of the consultations which he,together with the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer protection and Paymaster General, the Secretary of State for employment and the Secretary of State for Social Services, had held with representatives of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) inpursuance of the conclusion reached at the Cabinet1 s discussionof me Child Benefit (CB) scheme on 20 May,THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he and theother Ministers concerned had met representatives of the TUCthe previous afternoon.    He had explained the problem to them on the basis that it was necessary, in view of the present restraintson public expenditure, to limit the net Exchequer cost of any CBscheme to  100 million.    He had said that, having reviewed allthe possibilities, a majority of the Cabinet favoured a defermentof the introduction of the scheme for 3 years but the Cabinet wished the TUC to be consulted before reaching a final decision.    On beinginformed of the reductions in take-home pay which the CB scheme would involve, the TUC representatives had reacted immediately and violently against its implementation, irrespective of the levelof benefits which would accompany the reductions in take-home pay.They had also argued very strongly against any cut in child tax allowances(CTAs) on the grounds that this would appear to reverse the action taken by the Government in the recent Budget and wouldbe damaging to the success of the next round of pay negotiations.On the other hand, they felt that it would impose a great strain on thesocial contract if nothing were done for first children since therewas a widespread public expectation that payments for thesechildren would be introduced next year.    They had therefore pressedvery strongly for the existing family allowances (FAM), with the normalprovisions for tax and clawback, to be extended to the first childin every family.    If the FAM rate of  1. 50 were extended to thefirst child, however, this would involve a net Exchequer cost of well over  100 million.    He had therefore suggested to the TUCthat 75p might be an appropriate rate for first children but this theyhad regarded as too low.    In the light of the discussions, whichhad been conducted throughout in a friendly atmosphere and in whichthe TUC representatives had fully accepted that the decision whether to defer the CB scheme or introduce a payment for the firstchild was entirely one for the Cabinet to take, his own view was thatit would be unwise to do nothing for the first child.    On the otherhand, he did not consider that the country could afford a rate of payment of  1.50.    He therefore proposed that the payment on first children would be  1, with a 5Op premium for one-parent families, and that the appropriate arrangements for tax and clawbackshould apply.    The net  Exchequer cost would be  80 million at1975 prices and  95- 100 million at current prices.    TheSecretary of State for Social Services saw great administrative5BENEFIT
difficulty in extending the FAM allowance scheme, which in itself would involve legislation, since the scheme was in the process ofbeing abolished.    But the payments on first children, althoughrepresented to the TUC as a virtual extension of the FAM allowance scheme, could be made under the new CB legislation; and this mighthave presentational advantages in relation to the parliamentary labour Party,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that he agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ proposals except on one point: he wculd prefer a small reduction in CTAs, on the linesof the proposals for phasing in CB which had been considered atthe Cabinet1 s last meeting, to the application of tax and clawbackarrangements; the net Exchequer cost would be the same in eithercaae.    The advantage of this change was that the measure wouldappear as a first step towards the implementation of the CB scheme as conceived.In discussion, there was a wide measure of support for the proposalswhich the Chancellor had put forward.   Against the modificationproposed by the Secretary of State for Social Services, it was argued that the machinery of tax and clawback was familiar whereas areduction in CTAs would be seen as a new development resulting inreduced take-home pay, and this might have unfortunate consequences for the next round of pay negotiations.    Moreover, to retain theexisting level of CTAb would avoid the political difficulty, whichthe consultations with the TUC had amply confirmed, of having to differentiate in favour of the parents of non-resident children if,as the Cabinet had provisionally agreed, these parents were to beleft no worse off.    The reduction of tax and clawback provisions would however make it more inevitable that the Government wouldbe asked what their intentions were for the introduction of the CBscheme as conceived.    In the light of the tuc&apos;s views the reply would have to be in guarded terms, on the lines that the questionsof level of benefit and of eventual adjustment of CTAs would be kept under review in the light of the resources available.    The leaksabout the Cabinets discussions and the possibility that further delaymight attract many more signatures to the relevant motion on theOrder Paper, were compelling arguments for announcing theGovernments decision in the House of Commons that afternoon.It would however be desirable for the decision to be explained to ameeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party immediately after astatement was made.    The statement should bring out the public expenditure constraints which had determined the low rate of payment for first children.    It would also be necessary to informthe TUC in advance of the reasons why the Government could not extend the FAM allowance scheme as such to first children.6
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, as from 1 April 1977, a payment should beintroduced for first children at the rate of  1, with a 5Op premiumfor one-parent families, and that tax and clawback provisions should apply ss they did to FAM allowances.    These measures would be introduced under the new CB legislation and the Secretaryof State for Social Services should announce them that afternoon in the House of Commons, having previously informed the TUC ofthe reasons why the Government could not adopt the suggestion of extending the FAM allowance scheme as such to the first child.The Secretary of State for Social Services should agree the termsof his statement with the Chief Secretary, Treasury and, after it was made, should explain the reasons for the Government&apos;decision at the meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party whichhad been arranged to discuss other matters later that afternoon.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Social Services to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office25 May 19767
