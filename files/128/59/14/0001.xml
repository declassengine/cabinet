1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.The Cabinet were also informed of the arrangements made for consultation with the Trades Union Congress and with theParliamentary Labour Party about the economic situation.2.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (CP(76) 46)on direct elections to the European Assembly,THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AND commonwealth affairs recalled that in a Green Paper published in February theGovernment had accepted a commitment under Article 138 of theTreaty of Rome to direct elections and at the recent meeting of theEuropean Council the Prime Minister had said that we hoped to beready for direct elections at the same time as other Member Statessubject to the approval of Parliament and to our overcoming theadministrative difficulties.   In the course of a two day debate in theHouse in March the Government had offered to set up a SelectCommittee which had now produced an interim report on theCommunity aspects of direct elections that might be decided at themeeting of the European Council in Brussels on 12-13 July,    Thereport of the Select Committee, which was broadly in line with theviews expressed by the Government in the Green Paper, was due tobe debated in the House of Commons on the following day.   On the size and composition of the Assembly the Select Committee had recommended in favour of an Assembly of between 350 and 425,This was consistent with the Prime Ministers statement in the debate on direct elections in March that we favoured an Assemblyof 350 or more members, and with the variants which the EuropeanCouncil would have before them including in particular a variant wehad put forward for 390 seats.    The latter would give us a total of78 and for example enable us to allocate 9 seats to Scotland, 4 to wales and 2 to Northern Ireland,   As regards the date for electionsthe Committee were in favour of elections being held in May or June1978 but the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary thought we should keep open the possibility of nominating United Kingdom members for1978 in case this should prove necessary.    The Select Committeehad expressed a preference for the Assembly being elected for fourrather than five years but had not advanced any substantive arguments against the five-year period on which there was a broad consensus inthe Community.    On the Btatus of members of the Assembly theSelect Committee had recommended in favour of an optional dualmandate; this had been the view taken by the Government in the green Paper and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary1 s1
recommendation was that we should stick to this.    It was right to remind the Cabinet that the General Secretary of the Labour party had recommended that no decision should be taken by theGovernment until after the Party Conference in the autumn.   Ifthis were not possible the National Executive Committee of theLabour Party made two recommendations, one in favour of a dualmandate, the second in favour of elections to the Assembly being held simultaneously in the United Kingdom with General Elections.He was bound to say that he was opposed to these recommendations on both administrative and political grounds.In discussion of the size and composition of the Assembly it was argued that the working hypothesis which we had put forward in negotiation would result in an allocation of seats for both NorthernIreland and Wales which would attract severe criticism.    the under-representation of Northern Ireland at Westminster was expected to be raised in the context of devolution and the IrishForeign Minister, Dr Fitzgerald, had urged that in the interestsof the Catholic minority Northern Ireland should get more than thetwo seats envisaged by our working hypothesis.   Any settlementof the constitutional problem in Northern Ireland would have torecognise its special position.   Furthermore any seeminglyfavourable treatment for Scotland would lead to pressure for similar treatment for Wales.    The question of the distribution of seats to the component parts of the United Kingdom was bound tobecome tangled up with the debate on devolution.    There wastherefore a strong case for Parliament deciding at the same timeboth the details of devolution and the distribution of seats withinthe United Kingdom for the European Assembly.    This pointed toexplaining that it would not be possible, given the devolutionproblem, for us to enter into any final commitment at this stageas to our share of the size of the Assembly.    On the other hand itwas pointed out that the distribution of seats for the european assembly within the United Kingdom was a matter entirely for theBritish Government and Parliament to decide.    The figures of seatsfor Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland which had been discussedwere solely illustrative figures which had been used to achieve atotal allocation for the United Kingdom large enough to providerepresentation for its component parts not significantly out of proportion to those of the smaller Member States.    From this pointof view our variant would suit us best, and if we were to say at thislate stage that we could not give our agreement to any particulartotal figure this would cast doubt upon our good faith and adversely affect the attainment of our other objectives in the Community.In discussion of the date for elections it was argued that the national executive Committee of the Labour Party had put forward argumentsboth in relation to timing and to the desirability of our retaining the ability to nominate members which it would be most unwise to brush2
aaide.    We were in a quite different position from other member states not only because we had entered the Community much later than most of our partners but because devolution faced us in the next session with a mass of  complex and controversial legislation.    to add to this the legislation which would be necessary for us to havedirect elections to the European Assembly by 1978 would multiply thelegislative difficulties and damage relations with the  Labour Party.We should therefore explain this difficulty frankly to our partners.From this point of view direct elections in 1979 would suit us better.On the other hand it was argued that those opposed to direct electionswould be likely to regard 1979 with almost as much distaste as 1978,We had made it absolutely clear that, while the United Kingdom hoped to be ready for direct elections to the European Assembly as soon as any other Member State this was subject both to parliamentary approval of the necessary legislation and to our overcoming theadministrative difficulties involved.    The sensible course would be to review the legislative position in the autumn.    If the devolutionlegislation progressed satisfactorily it could be followed by a bill dealing with direct elections.    J  on the other hand this did not prove possible, this would be the time to warn our partners.    Since ourreservation had been made in clear and unmistakable terms, we would only cast doubts on our own intentions if we sought to make too muchof these difficulties next week.As regards the period for which the Assembly Bhould be elected It waBsuggested that there would be considerable advantage in meeting the wish expressed by the National Executive Committee of the LabourParty that elections in the United Kingdom should coincide withGeneral Elections; elections to the European Assembly between general Elections could produce anomalous and damaging results.On the other hand, it was argued that there were advantages in having a clear fixed term, that it hardly seemed worth opposing ageneral consensus in the European Council in favour of five years andthat the Government had already recorded its agreement in the green paper with the Assembly^ proposal that it should be elected for fiveyears.On the status of members of the Assembly it was argued that given the uncertainty of the relationship which would exist between the LabourParty and British Labour Members of the European Parliament itwould be desirable to specify clearly that only Members ofParliament in this country should be able to become Members of theEuropean Assembly,    On the other hand, it was pointed out matapart from Denmark there was a general consensus among otherGovernments that the dual mandate should be optional, that this was what the Select Committee had recommended, that the Government haditself endorsed this view in its Green Paper and that the majority ofopinion in Parliament was likely to be in favour of an optional dualmandate given the strain which in practice a dual mandate would impose on Member b,
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that on the size and composition of the Assembly the majority view of the cabinet was that he could reach a settlement within the range recommendedby the Select Committee which should be as near as possible to thevariant which we had put forward.     This was of course on the clear understanding that the distribution of seats between the component parts of the United Kingdom would be a matter for Cabinet and parliament later to decide.    In agreeing on a best endeavour basis toany date for direct elections in May or June 1978 which commandedgeneral acceptance he should avoid a specific commitment to carry thenecessary legislation In time and would mention devolution as an illustration of the difficulties facing us.    It would however be undesirable to throw doubt on our previous constructive stance by making too much publicly of our difficulties.    On the period for whichthe Assembly should be elected and the question of a dual mandate,we should stick to the views which the Government had expressed inthe Green Paper.    The Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs in the debate on the following day should be guided by the sense of their discussion.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion.3.        The Cabinet considered the question of Ministerial salsrles.Their discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.4
CUTTINGTHE COSTor THECIVILSERVICEdeviousReference:CM(7b) 4thConclusions.Minute 34.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (CP(76) 39) about cutting the cost of the Civil Service; and memoranda    by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for Industry (CP(76) 45) and by the Secretary ofState far the Environment and the Lord Privy Seal (CP(76) 41),dealing with the proposal to abolish Vehicle Excise Duty (VED).THE LORD PRIVY SEAL recalled that on 13 May the Cabinet had confirmed their previous decision to cut expenditure in 1978-79 by 140 million by reductions In the cost of manpower and administration.He had been invited to conduct bilateral discussions with the&quot; other ministers concerned to establish how this might be achieved, and his memorandum, CP(76) 39, set out the results of those discussions.Annex V to the paper set out a series of reductions which would save25, 000 staff and  95 million.   These had been agreed by theMinisters concerned; they raised no legislative problems; and he therefore recommended to his colleagues that they should be approved.   Annex W set out ways of saving almost the whole of thebalance of  45 million; but these had not been agreed by the responsible Ministers, and their reasons for disagreeing were set outin the Annex,    hi preparing Annex W he had drawn upon theinformation provided by Departments on ways in which they could, ifnecessary, make cuts of 5 per cent, 10 per cent and 15 per cent intheir staff expenditure.    He noted that the original intention - to cut the Civil Service by 5 per cent - meant that, because the Ministry ofDefence and part of the Inland Revenue had been excluded from theexercise, the remaining Departments would need to cut staff on average by 9 per cent.    H his colleagues were unable to agree theproposals Bet out In Annex W, then the only alternative appeared tobe to turn to the further proposals in Annex X, which were on thewhole even less acceptable.   He drew particular attention to two proposals in Annex W.    One was the suggestion that the size ofjuries should be reduced from 12 to 10, saving  700,000.   This hadbeen considered by the Home Affairs Committee and rejected.    Theother was the abolition of the VED.   This was a crucial Item in the list, and If it were not agreed a further  12 million would be required from Annex X,    If however the duty were abolished, and a  2registration fee imposed, a total saving of  34 million could beachieved, so that the amount to be obtained from the proposal in annex W would then only be some  10 million instead of  45 million.On the proposals as a whole he reminded Cabinet that an urgentdecision was needed because the Staff Side were becoming restive atthe lack of Information.    He was due to see them the following day,and shortly thereafter they were hoping to see the Prime Minister.He therefore recommended to Cabinet that they should agree all theproposals in Annexes V and W to CP(76) 39.
&amp;UtyJ*UcIe THE CHANCELLOR OF THE exchequer UER said that Ministerb had^cise discussed the proposal to abolish VED before the last Budget, and had done so against the same background as prevailed now, since the commitment to save  140 million on Civil Service manpower had been announced In February.   He had made it clear in his budget statement that the Government had considered the abolition of the duty and had decided against it, largely for industrial reasons.    In view ofthis, he did not see how the Government could possibly change itsview so rapidly.    In his opinion the saving to be scored could not inany case be more than  12 million, since the further  22 million would come from the  2 charge which would be a new kind of tax, andthey were engaged upon a staff-cutting, not a tax-raising, exercise.Only the previous day the Government had reached agreement with both the Trades Union Congress and the Confederation of BritishIndustry at the meeting of the National Economic development council on giving priority to the needs of manufacturing industry; andin the course of that discussion both sides of industry had applaudedthe decision not to abolish VED.    This too made it impos slble to contemplate abolition now.    Britain was not alone in taxing motoringin three different ways - purchase tax on the vehicle, vehicle licenceduty, and tax on petrol - since this was in fact a common arrangement all Western European countries.    To abolish the duty meant losing  650 million of revenue, which would have to be recouped by anincrease of 15p a gallon on petrol.    To do this now would pre-emptthe scope for tax increases which might be needed for other reasons(eg transport policy), since the Government could hardly contemplateincreasing the rate of petrol tax twice in a short period of time.   Hewas therefore strongly opposed to the abolition of VED.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY supported theChancellor of the Exchequer in his view that it was not possible to go back on the Budget statement.   To do so would prejudice theGovernment&apos;s industrial strategy and destroy the credibility of the tripartite group on the motor industry.    The Import penetration of thesmall car section of the market had already reached 50 per cent, and both sides of the industry took the view that if VED were abolished itwould add a further 10 per cent to import penetration.   Any early announcement, even for a change in 1978, would mean that the market would begin to react by a shift towards smaller cars; and Britishindustry was not at present in a posture to meet increased demand -the new Mini from British Leyland would not be ready until 1980.   Ithad been suggested that the higher petrol tax would lead to a reductionin oil imports, but he regarded this as highly speculative.   What was more certain was that such a move would seriously undermine the very heavy capital investment which the Government had already put into british Leyland and Chrysler, not to mention the further tranche of support for the former which would shortly be considered. &apos; Even If itwere agreed to score the saving from a  2 registration fee, he did not
believe this would carry any credibility with the public who wouldsuspect that the charge would rapidly be increased.    He was there-fore strongly opposed to abolition.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the alternatives to the abolition of VED would be both disagreeable and damaging.    The Central Policy Review Staff had reckoned that theeffect of abolishing VED on the car market would be so small as to be virtually unidentifiable.   He pointed out that in recent years the priceof petrol had doubled, and that the addltinal petrol tax now coutem-plated was small by comparison with that.    In hiB view people werebuying small cars, not primarily because of the reduced running costs, but because the capital cost was lower.   If the British carindustry could not meet the need, perhaps other steps should be takento regulate the demand.   In his view the increased petrol tax would lead to a saving of some  25- 35 million on the import bill.   He saw no reason why the  22 million which would arise from a  2 registra-tlon fee should not be quite properly scored as a saving for thepurposes of the present exercise.    The office at Swansea still had  , 000 jobs not yet filled, so the redundancy problem would not besevere.    H a date were set for abolishing the duty In the spring of1978 this should give the British car industry a chance to boost itsproduction of smaller cars to meet any increased demand that might arise.    He therefore favoured abolition.In discussion it was argued in favour of abolition of the duty that theCabinet should not shirk from going back on the decision announced inthe Budget statement, since the other expenditure cuts which theywould need to make would themselves mean going back on other decisions also.    The alternatives to the abolition of VED were Infact worse.   VED was an Inequitable tax, since the motorist had topay the same sum regardless of the extent to which he used his car,and, unless a tax were introduced on tyres, an addition to petrol taxwas the best alternative, releasing the staff In Swansea and leaving the petrol stations to collect it for the Government.    VED was In anycase an unpopular tax, and abolition would be welcome.   Furthermore,It was frequently evaded - perhaps to the extent of 5 per cent,thereby losing some  40 million of revenue which could (if thesubstituted addition to petrol tax were pitched high enough) berecouped.    On the argument that higher petrol tax would cause afurther drift to smaller cars, to the disadvantage of the British carIndustry, it was noted that business users were unlikely to be influenced to any appreciable extent, and that other buyers paid more attention to their initial outlay than to their running costs.Against abolition, it was argued that the effects in Swansea, and thence upon the Welsh political scene, could be serious.   The staff side had been greatly relieved by the decision announced in the Budget,
but were much disturbed now they had learnt that abolition was againunder consideration.    The setting up of the vehicle centre had been animportant part of the Government&apos;s dispersal policy, as a result ofwhich there were now 5,200 staff in post In Swansea which would riseto 5,700 on present intentions.    The abolition of VED would causethis to dtop to 4, 500, a loss of 1, 200 jobs from a very recentlyestablished office.    This would seriously damage the Labour Partycause in Wales, where over 20 seats were held by government supporters.    Less drastic steps - eg altering the basis of collectionfrom four months to six months, and having licences end at varyingdates and not all on the last day of the month - were possibilities, but were unlikely to save more than about  2 million.In continuing discussion it was suggested that one way out of thepresent difficulty would be to decide not to fulfil the earlier decision to save  140 million.    Thus, It would be possible to announce that savings of  95 million had been Identified, and that theGovernment would pursue the possibility of making more.   against this, It was observed that the   140 million was a public commitment in the White Paper of the previous February (Cmnd 6393); and thatIf the Government did not fulfil that undertaking they were In noposition to press staff cuts upon local authorities.    One possibility would be to substitute for the proposals in Annex W a 3 per cent cuton all Departmental staffs, perhaps using the cash limits system to implement It; but against this it was argued that such savings rarelymaterialised unless one could identify in advance what activities werebeing cut to bring them about.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the reductions listed In Annex V to CP(76) 39.    Onthe question of the abolition of VED there were strong arguments on both sides, but the majority of the Cabinet clearly favoured abolition.However, the question of timing would need to be given furtherconsideration by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who would also be free to put forward any alternative proposal he wished to cope withthe difficulty that, whether with or without the abolition of VED, theCabinet had not yet succeeded in agreeing the full  140 million of savings to which they were committed.    They noted that one possibility the Chancellor of the Exchequer was considering was that,while the total expenditure figure for 1978-79 in Cmnd 6393 could notbe exceeded, there might be some feed-through Into that year from thepossible reductions in 1977-78 which the Cabinet would be consideringfurther the following week; and this might help to bridge the presentgap.   For the present, therefore, there should be no announcement ofany kind about VED.    On the question of consultation with staff, the
Lord Privy Seal would be seeing the National Staff Side the following day and could Indicate to them in general terms the reductions on whichthe Cabinet were agreed, making it clear that further options were still being examined.   Thereafter it would be possible for consul-tations to be held with Departmental Staff Sides about the implications for individual Departments of the cuts which had been agreed, although in doing this care would need to be taken where the unions concerned had an interest in both the agreed cuts and those on which decisions had yet to be reached.The Cabinet -L Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theLord Privy Seal to be guided accordingly.2.        Agreed to the proposals listed in Annex to CP(76) 39.3.        Agreed to resume consideration of thesubject the following week.Cabinet Office8 July 1976
T*QS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NOCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(76) 14th Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday 8 July 1976 at 10.30 am the Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord President of theCouncil (CP(76) 44) on the report by the Top Salaries Review Body(TSRB) on ministers and Office Holders1 salaries and pensions, andthe pensions and certain allowances and facilities for Members ofParliament,THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the previous year the TSRB had reported on the pay and allowances of Members ofParliament.   Their present report completed their review ofMembers1 allowances and facilities, and also covered Members&apos;pensions and the salaries of Ministers and Office Holders.   Theywould shortly be issuing a further report on peers ExpensesAllowance.   Before the TSRB report had been submitted he had written to the members of the Cabinet inviting agreement to anincrease In the salaries for Members of  6 per week, subject to earnings from all sources not exceeding  8, 500 a year, and to acorresponding increase in the  3,200 a year maximum of thesecretarial allowance within which expenditure on secretarial assistance could be reimbursed.   There had been general agreement to those proposals.    The Prime Minister, as an act of courtesy, had informed the TSRB of the Governments intentions.    Its Chairman,Lord Boyle, had however expressed some surprise over the decisionto increase Members1 salaries by the full  6 permitted under the incomes policy rather than to make Improvements In pensions and had invited the Prime Minister to reconsider the decision about increasingthe secretarial allowance.    hi his view, however, the government&apos;s decision was right on both counts.    Many Members badly needed the 6 Increase and those earning over  8, 500 would not be entitled toany increases so could not qualify for Improvement In pensions.Members&apos; secretaries were naturally expecting a pay Increase butMembers were in no position to finance Increases out of their ownpockets.   The Increase In the secretarial allowance would, however,need careful presentation.1
If Members1 salaries were increased by  6 per week incomes policy would effectively preclude the implementation of the recommenda-tions in the TSRBS report about Members1 pensions as improvements in pensions counted against the pay limit.    The current pay limitsruled out the increases recommended in ministers salaries.    Thereport had only just been submitted and could not rank as a commit-ment predating the incomes policy,    ft was to be hoped that theintroduction of the new State pensions scheme in partnership with private occupational pensions in 1978 would enable the recommendedimprovements in Members1 pensions to be implemented after theforthcoming round of pay policy.    Thus only MPs retiring during thenext year or so would stand to lose as a   result of the delay.    he sought his colleagues agreement to a reply being sent from thePrime Minister to Lord Boyle in the course of the week; a statementbeing made to Parliament on Monday 12 July to be followed by theearly tabling of the necessary resolutions; and to the publication ofthe TSRB report before the Summer Recess together with astatement that the Government had considered Its contents but didnot propose to take any further action on It until incomes policypermitted.In discussion importance was attached to its being made clear in thestatement to Parliament mat the Government was not accepting any commitment to implement the recommendations in the TSRB reportwhen incomes policy made this possible.   The Government had in thepast discouraged other groups from negotiating increases for implementation when the incomes policy permitted and It should not itself undertake any such commitment,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discus sion, said that theCabinet agreed with the Lord President of the Councilsrecommendations.    He would himself write to Lord Boyle to reaffirm the Governments decision.    The Lord President of theCouncil should Inform Parliament of the Governments intention torecommend an increase in Members1 salaries of  6 per week, subjectto earnings from all sources not exceeding  8, 500 and a correspon-dlng increase in the  3, 200 maximum of the secretarial allowance.In doing so he might indicate that the TSRB had recommendedsubstantial increases in Ministers&apos; salaries but that these recommen-datlons could not be accepted because they were inconsistent with the incomes policy.    The statement should also make clear that whilethe TSRBS report would be considered when the Incomes policypermitted the Government was in no way committed to implement its recommendations,
The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;e summing up of their discussion.2,        Invited the Lord President of the Council toinform Parliament on 12 July of the Government^decision to increase Members1 salaries by  6 perweek as from 13 June 1976 subject to earnings fromall sources not exceeding  8, 500 a year and tomake a corresponding increase in the secretarialallowance.3.        Invited the Lord President of the Council toarrange for publication of the report by the top salaries Review Body before the Summer recess and to indicate that the Government would not wishto take any further action on the report untilincomes policy permitted.Cabinet Office8 July 19763
