Iuamentary?AlRS1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he recognisedthat timetable motions would probably be needed on several Bills.Discussions were, however, still taking place with the Oppositionon the restoration of the usual channels, which was theGovernments first priority.   He was not proposing to take anytimetable motions next week in view of their possible harmfuleffect on relations with the Opposition; and any such motionswould have to be taken at a time when the Government could besure of the necessary majorities.THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet of the statement which he intended to make in the House of Commons that afternoonabout investigations into the disclosure of information to the author of the article on child benefit which had appeared in new Society,The Cabinet -Took note.Uc2,        THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had little to add to thestatement he had already made to the House of Commons,    He had had very useful bilateral talks with the President of the United States,Mr Ford, whom he regarded as an underrated man and who had shown himself extremely friendly to the United Kingdom,    He had made clear to the Japanese Ministers our views about the growth of Japanese exports.The Cabinet -1. Took note of the statement by thePrime Minister.BonnTHE PRIME MINISTER said that he and the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary had visited Bonn the previous day fortalks with the Federal German Chancellor and the Foreign Minister,Herr Genscher.    The talks had gone very well.    On the morning oftheir arrival Herr Schmidt had paid a tribute in the Bundestag to
the success of our incomes policy and it was evident in thediscussions with German Ministers that there was clearly now agreater understanding of the success of our efforts to deal with inflation.    The talks had been frank and useful and had been markedby one interesting innovation.    British and German Ministers hadbeen joined for over an hour by members of the Bullock Committeeon Industrial Democracy who were visiting Germany and by anumber of German trade union and employer representatives.    Jnthe course of a frank and useful discussion Herr Schmidt had stressed that code termination had played an indispensable role in the development of the German economy.    Herr Schmidt hadshowed mat he shared our dislike for aspects of the common agricultural Policy (CAP) although he had to bear in mind that his minister of Agriculture, Herr Ertl, belonged to the other Party inthe coalition.    The Federal Government faced the growing problemthat Article 115 of the Basic German Law allowed the federal government to run a budgetary deficit only when the economy was out of balance.    Herr Schmidt thought it likely that after the federal german elections in October, which he expected to win althoughpossibly with a reduced majority, the Opposition would make playwith this constitutional provision in order to eliminate the budgetdeficit.    This would mean stringent limitations on Germancontributions not only to the CAP but also to aid to non-associatesand would not ease discussion of the problem of offset.    It would benecessary to take account of the development of German thinking inour next review in October/November of British aims in next yearfsCAP price review.    Herr Schmidt had expressed a preference forour former system of price support but it was necessary to bear inmind that he would probably not wish to press this view to the pointof a major quarrel with President Giscard.The Cabinet -2.        Took note.^J^KERis 3.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Homeojj^ERENCE      Secretary (CP(76) 37) dealing with the question of electoral reformj-^LECTORAL  and distribution of seats in relation to the terms of reference of the speaker&apos;s Conference on Electoral Law and also with the composition of the Conference.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Cabinet at their meeting on18 November 1975 had decided that the Government should not take any initiative to refer electoral reform to the Speaker&apos;s Conference.The Liberals and, less strongly. Plaid Cymru had now, in response to the Prime Minister&apos;s letter of 13 April to the Leaders of the other
Parties, asked for its inclusion in the terms of reference.    Thequestion was whether the Cabinet, in the light of these requests,wished to alter their earlier view.   Although he himself hadfavoured its inclusion at the earlier discussion, he was notinclined to press this.The Leader of the Opposition had asked for the inclusion of Rule 1in Schedule 2 to the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats)Act 1949 on the grounds mat this had led to serious under-representation of England in the United Kingdom Parliamentrelative to Scotland and Wales.    The Secretary of State for northern Ireland was opposed to any review of the number of seats in Northern Ireland at the present time; and there were grounds for thinking that a review would also be premature in relation tothe Government1 s devolution proposals for Scotland and Wales.    he therefore proposed mat the Government should decline to accede tothe Leader of the Opposition^ request.On the composition of the Conference, the Speaker himself had asked whether it would be possible to reduce the number of thelarger Parties in order to accommodate all the smaller groups.The composition at present proposed was 15 Labour, 12 Conservatives,1 Liberal and 1 Scottish National Party (SNP).    The Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland had indicated that he would like to seeUlster Unionist representation and he himself considered that, onthe whole, it would be sensible to re spond sympathetically to thesuggestion that the representation should be somewhat widened,particularly since the Speaker himself had made it.    To dootherwise might get the Conference off to a bad start.    But thematter was primarily one for the Lord President and the Chief Whip,in consultation with the other Parties.hi discussion, the view was expressed that the Conservatives were as much opposed to electoral reform as the Labour Party, and,given public interest in the subject which had been furtherstimulated by the recent report of the Hansard Society Commission,mere might be much to be said for disposing of the issue, whichwas likely to become more difficult with the passage of time, byreferring it to the Speaker&apos;s Conference.    On the other hand, itwas argued mat there were grave risks in putting to the Speaker&apos;conference a major issue of policy which ought properly to besettled by the Government.   All the indications were that theOpposition, and in particular the Leader of the Opposition, would not hesitate to seek political advantage by paying lip service to the ideaof electoral reform, particularly in the context of a GeneralElection, without actually committing themselves to it; and the scope for mis would be increased if the matter had been referred to the speaker&apos;s Conference.3
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet reaffirmed their earlier view that electoral reform should be excluded from the terms of reference of the speaker&apos;s Conference.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.^tribution THE LORD PRESIDENT said mat he agreed with the Home SecretarySeats that it would be premature at this stage to refer this matter to the speaker&apos;s Conference, though there might be a case for doing solater since, at some stage in the progress of the Governmentsdevolution proposals for Scotland and Wales, the logic of increasingEnglish representation at Westminster relative to that of otherparts of the United Kingdom might become overwhelming.    the timing of any initiative to alter the distribution of Beats would,however, be very important; and it was essential that the decisionon this should rest with the Government and not with the Speaker&apos;conference, particularly because of the possible repercussions onthe situation in Northern Ireland.hi discussion, the view was expressed that increased representation at Westminster for England was probably the major trade-off whichcould secure English acceptance for the devolution proposals.    Forthis reason, and because there were other matters, for example,the rural weighting of Parliamentary seats, which merited review in the light of modern transport communications, there could wellbe a case for referring the distribution of seats to the Speaker&apos;eConference from the outset.   Against this, there was generalagreement with the Lord Presidents view that the matter was onewhich ought to be decided in the context of the progress of theGovernments devolution proposals; and the point was made that,while there was likely to be great difficulty in defending theGovernment1 s commitment not to reduce the present cdmplementof Scottish and Welsh MPs, it would be politically disastrous to depart from that commitment.THE PRIME MINSTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet: agreed that, given the continued uncertainty inNorthern Ireland and the proposed far-reaching changes in Scotlandand Wales, the time was not ripe for the distribution of seats to bereferred to the Speaker1 s Conference.    The reply to the Leader of4
the Opposition^ request should, however, be so framed as not to preclude its later addition to the terms of reference if the cabinet should decide, in the context of the devolution proposals, that thiswould be desirable.The Cabinet -2.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.imposition THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatJ^tae the Cabinet agreed with the suggestion which had been made by the^ference Lord President that, although the Governments majority in &quot;dieHouse of Commons had temporarily disappeared since the composition of the Speakers Conference was first considered bythe Cabinet, it would be desirable to try and secure the agreementof the other Parties to a majority of Government members.    Itwould in any case seem impracticable to provide for representationof all the minority groups, as the Speaker appeared to have in mind,without unacceptably enlarging the Conference.    The Lord President,in consultation with the Chief Whip and, as necessary, the HomeSecretary, should therefore initiate discussions with the opposition and possibly other Parties with a view to obtaining agreement on amajority of Government members but if, as might happen, thatproved impossible, he should report the outcome to him and make proposals which the Cabinet could, if necessary, consider.The Cabinet -3.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion, and invited the Lord President ofthe Council to proceed accordingly.5
^OUGHT 4.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerfor Planning and Local Government (CP(76J 38) proposing theintroduction of a Bill to give extra powers for dealing with the drought.THE MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT saidthat in the spring he had set up special liaison machinery with thewater authorities and he had been receiving weekly reports on thewater situation.    The latest appraisal showed that shortages inBorne parts of the country leading to inconvenience and somehardship wore virtually certain in late summer and the autumn,and in some areas there was a real risk of local breakdown ofsupplies.    The worst affected areas were parts of East Anglia,the East Midlands, the South-West and West, and South Wales.Ground water was at historically low levels and mere was an increasing risk of pollution.    The present law gave no power to prohibit non-essential and even ostentatious uses of water duringthe period before more severe restrictions became necessary,and there were limits to what could be achieved by exhortation.If water rationing became necessary, the present law only allowed the limitation of domestic use in areas where standpipes were operating.    He therefore proposed a short and urgent Bill whichwould provide for restrictions on unnecessary useB in the build-upperiod when public support for economy was essential, and a framework for a rationing system for industrial, agricultural and domestic use which did not depend on the operation of standpipes.During the build-up period compensation would be payable forrestrictions as at present, but if rationing became necessary thiswould affect everyone in the local communities concerned andthere would be no compensation.In discussion there was general agreement on the need for actionbefore the Summer Recess to provide more effective legal powersto conserve water supplies, and that the risk of leaving action untilthe autumn would not be acceptable.    It was, however, alreadydoubtful whether the existing Parliamentary business could becompleted by the end of July, and the addition of a Bill on watersupplie s, which might be of some complexity and which it might notbe possible to get through quickly, would add to the difficulties.There was considerable pressure to rise for the Summer Recesson 30 July, but with the addition of this Bill it seemed virtuallyunavoidable that the House should sit into the first week of August.There should be consultations with the other Parties with a view to ensuring as smooth as possible a passage for the BUI, and there might be advantage in introducing it in the House of Lords, whichwould be able to take the Bill as soon as it was ready.    The ScottishNational Party were in the habit of objecting to legislation whichcovered the whole of Great Britain, and the Bill could be confined toEngland and Wales if that would help its passage through Parliament.6
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the proposals by the Minister for Planning andLocal Government for the introduction of legislation to provide more adequate powers to control the use of water, with a view to itsenactment by the Summer Recess, and noted that it might well benecessary for Parliament to sit in the first week of August.    TheMinister would make an early announcement in Parliament of theGovernment1 s intentions.    The Minister for Planning and LocalGovernment would give further consideration, in consultation withthe Lord President, the Lord Privy Seal and the two Chief Whips,to the plans for and timing of the Bill&apos;s introduction, and would arrange for discussions with the other Parties at an appropriate time with a view to obtaining their co-operation.    It might be advantageous to introduce the Bill in the House of Lords and to limit its application to England and Wales.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;esumming up of their discussion, and invited theMinisters concerned to proceed accordingly.Cabinet office July 19767
