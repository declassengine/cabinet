Therewas circulated at the meeting a list prepared by the Secretariat of the changes in individual programmes which had been agreed at theearlier meetings.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the total reductions agreed so farcame to  867 million -  133 million short of the target of 1, 000 million.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discus sion, said mat theCabinet confirmed their previous view that there should be no cuts inthis programme.The Cabinet -Hertous**fcreace:^176) 18thinclusionsi1,        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister &apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.Q^T THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theL**as Cabinet had previously agreed to a reduction of  10 million on thisea programme; but it was now thought that, pending the receipt of theBerriU report, that might be an unduly severe cut to make, and thatconsequently only   5 million should be shown as a saving.The Cabinet -2.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister 1s summing up of this part of their discussion.
e, THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatwhen the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food had agreed to aestry net cut of  25 million, he had been under the impression thatdeferring capital grants by three months would save  20 million,whereas it was now thought that only  11 million could be saved in thisway.    This would cut the saving to  16 million, and the Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food was prepared to offer a further 4 million making  20 million.    Nevertheless, the general view ofthe Cabinet was that it should be possible - perhaps by delaying thepayment of the capital grants by a further month - to make up thebalance of the saving, and that they should continue to score 25 million against this programme.The Cabinet -3.        Took note, with approval, of the  PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that,while there was some reluctance In Cabinet to cut food subsidies at all,they had previously decided on a reduction of   75 million.    Thegeneral view now was that the effects, in terms of the date andfrequency of price increases, of a marginal further cut were sominimal that they would be justified In making a cut of  80 millioninstead of  75 million.The Cabinet -4,        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister *s summing up of this part of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theSecretary of State for Energy was prepared to make three additions tothe savings of  79 million which had been agreed the previous day.These were:  3 million from the elimination of an additional bid for civil defence oil stocks;   7 million from selective assistance underSection 8 of the Industry Act for new technology for North S*aoperations; and  4 million (including the  2 million which he hadalready offered) from slowing down the development of the fast breederreactor.    This would give total savings under this head of 91 million.
mIn discussion it was argued that a good deal of the expenditure on industrial support, particularly of an indiscriminate character, wasnot fully justified, and would be even less necessary in 1977-78 whenit was likely that the private sector would be making large profits.It should be possible to make savings in this field, eg by reducing therate of Regional Development Grant, where a reduction of 5 per cent would save  80 million.   Against this it was argued that, while there might be some unnecessary expenditure here, sizable reductions on both energy and industry had already been agreed - totalling betweenthem more than one-quarter of the target - and that there was a danger that this might be seen as contrary to the main thruBt of theGovernments strategy for industrial expansion.   Indeed, theCabinet should consider whether there should not be some additional funds provided for the National Enterprise Board, which was theGovernments chosen instrument for selective Intervention in the economy; but it was argued from this that the right course was toreduce automatic and unselective assistance and concentrateresources on the National Enterprise Board,    The system of planning Agreements should be used to channel assistance to industry,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat on balance the Cabinet did not favour a further reduction in this programme, although it was an area which might need to beconsidered further at the Cabinet meeting later in the day.   For thefuture the Secretary of State for Industry should consider howindustrial assistance could be made more selective, for example bychannelling more of it through the National Enterprise Board; and itmight be desirable to make it clear In the statement that this review was being undertaken.The Cabinet -6.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that at!   Uatries their previous meetings they had noted miscellaneous nationalised industry bids of  45 million and a saving, in respect of Scotland, of 1 million under Surface Transport Industries.    It was now under-stood that the latter item should be deleted, but there should addi-tionally be shown a saving on Scottish nationalised industries of 10 million.The Cabinet -7.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.**on In discussion the following points were made -a. The savings - a net  30 million - agreed so far underthis head related to capital equipment at universities and in further education institutions, and expenditure on science andarts partly offset by the additional bid of  15 million on school meals.    There was no cut on school expenditure, and ft was arguable that the general view in the Labour Party would be togive higher priority to housing - where the Government wascontemplating a heavy cut - than to schools.    On the otherhand, it was noted that on the last round of cuts the capitalexpenditure on schools had been cut right back to basic needs,b. The capital programme for nursery provision was very low compared with that for schools, and it was likely that therewould be no room for new starts for nursery accommodation in1977-76.    The possibility of switching to nursery accommoda-tion dome of the provision of schools was mooted, but since thelatter was confined to basic needs there was unlikely to be any money to spare for this purpose.c.  25 million was spent by the Foreign and *Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence, and afurther  25 million by local authorities, on sending children to independent schools.    It was argued that this expenditure should be phased out.   There was sympathy in principle forthis view, although it was observed that without some such provision it would be difficult for middle-ranking diplomatsposted overseas to ensure proper education for their children.One possibility might be to give lower allowances when theofficer concerned was posted in the United Kingdom.    Jt was
agreed that no saving could be made on this for the purposes ofthe present exercise, but that there was scope for an examination of the present arrangements.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that the saving on education should remain at 30 million (net of school meals).    It was however felt that thepayment by the public sector of the cost of educating children in theprivate sector was a matter which required further study.The Cabinet -8.        Took note, with approval, of the  PrimeMinister^ summing up of this part of their discussion.In discussion it was observed that one of the difficulties about localauthority current expenditure was, not only that it was not directlycontrolled by the Government, but that the way in which the systemiture worked was such that It was never possible to pinpoint precisely whereoverspending had taken place.    Figures of relevant expenditure were agreed, programme by programme, with the local authorityrepresentatives; and Rate Support Grant was then given on the resultant total.    It was, however, entirely within the competence of individual local authorities to decide how they would use their grant and how they would allocate their total current expenditure.    The cashlimit system applied only to the element of Rate Support Grant - localauthorities were given advance warning that the amount they would getlater in the year under the Increase Order in respect of price increases would be limited to a previously stated amount.   Although the rate support Grant was a strong influence on local authority spending, theauthorities were still free, either by raising increased rates or byspending their balances, to run their current expenditure at a higher level than the Government might wish.    In the current year, althoughthe Government had been pressing the local authorities hard to cuttheir expenditure back to the planned level, it was still likely thatsome  Z00- 300 million of overspend was In prospect.    TheGovernment had no powers to prevent this.    It was suggested that insome authorities the number of social workers employed was completely out of proportion to the need.    A general manpower watchhad been Instituted, In co-operation with the local authorities, and joint committees were examining the problems of manpower inconjunction with the unions.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that, while no saving on local authority current expenditure could be counted inthe  1,-000 million package, there was a serious need to get some grip onthe problem of local authority manpower and the Cabinet would need to have this aspect in mind when they came to consider the LayfieldReport.The Cabinet -9.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of mis part of their discussion.j^*h and In discussion it was argued that a great deal of the money spent on-Sana! personal social service work was wasted, consisting of too manyill-equipped and inadequate people trying to deal with problems which^ceb were beyond them.   Against this it was suggested that in fact thebulk of the expenditure under this head went on such things as old people&apos;a homes and home helps, and field work by social workers wasonly a small part of the whole.    There was thus no great scope forsaving) Furthermore, the bulk of the expenditure was current expenditure under the control of local authorities.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theSecretary of State for Social Services had expressed his willingness to increase the proposed saving on health and personal Boclalservices from  60 million to  70 million and this was agreed.The Cabinet -10.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister ls summing up of this part of their discussion,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that it*Y was agreed that no further saving could be made in this programmebeyond the  21 million already agreed.    Studies were in hand onstudent claims for supplementary benefit and on the abuses of thesocial security system; but it would not be sensible to count savings from these until they had been received and considered.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that further savings could not be had on this programme unless dispersal of the Civil Service were to be postponed for a year.    Cabinetconfirmed that the saving should remain at  10 million.The Cabinet -12.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.In discussion it was argued that it should be possible to reduce theprovision for loans to housing Associations if it were possible toarrange for the Associations to obtain finance from the private sector.    One other possibility would be to replace building grants byinterest relief grants, since by this means the public expenditurefigure could be cut by 85-90 per cent without there being any reductionin the funds available to the Associations.    However, whereas it hadbeen possible to have discussions with the Building Societies about their taking over part of local authority mortgage lending, no such consultation had taken place with the institutions who might take overpart of the financing of housing Associations.    It would therefore be unwise to count any saving from this source.   However, to meet this difficulty it was suggested that a saving might be shown on this account, on the understandings that the Treasury would advise the banks that this was an area of high priority for loans and that if it proved impossible to make suitable arrangements with private sectorinstitutions the sum concerned would then be accepted as a justifiableclaim on the 197 7-78 Contingency Reserve.    On this basis a saving of 35 million for Great Britain might be appropriate, with Scotland andWales each taking their proportionate share.On local authority mortgage lending a saving of  150 million (of which 50 million was earmarked as an offset to additional bids) had beenagreed for England; and it was agreed that a further  25 million -on a Great Britain basis, with Scotland and Wales taking theirproportionate shares - should be made.11.        Took note, with approval, of the  PrimeMinister &apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, on the understanding proposed, a saving of 35 million on housing Associations was agreed; and a further 25 million should be saved on local authority mortgage lending.This would bring the total net saving on the housing programme to 146 million.The Cabinet -13,       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, asa result of the savings which had now been agreed, the total reductions stood at  952 million.    cabinet should now consider whether this total was sufficient, given thepublicly known target of  L 000 million.In discussion it was argued on the one hand that a figure such as 952 million was in some ways more convincing than a round figure of 1, 000 million;  and indeed, it might be regarded as evidence that theGovernment had taken some account of the arguments which had beenput to them by the Trades Union Congress and others.   Against this itwas argued that for presentational reasons it was desirable to agreetotal reductions rather nearer to the  L 000 million target.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would meet later that day to consider a paper by theChancellor of the Exchequer proposing action to supplement theexpenditure cuts.   At the same meeting the Cabinet could take a finaldecision on the adequacy of the  952 million cuts so far agreed.The Cabinet -14.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.15.        Agreed to resume their discussion later inthe day.Cabinet Office21 July 1976
