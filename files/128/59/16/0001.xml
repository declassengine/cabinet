EXPENDITURE15th1. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of Public Expenditure.Their discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.1
2. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES drew attention to the position of the Health Services Bill,   After theguillotine motion had been passed the following day, it would beposBible for the Committee to hold two meetings daily, so that theBill would come out of Committee by 27 July,    It would then bepossible to take Report and Third Reading on 2 August; but this raninto the difficulty that the Government had wanted to avoid anycontroversial legislation during mat week.    He understood that itwas planned to end the session on 11 November, and unless the Houseof Lords got the Bill before 11 October, there was a danger that itmight be lost.    This would be represented by the Opposition as a major triumph and could lead to serious trouble in the national health Service.    He therefore wished to press, in order to avoid any possibility that the Bill might be lost through lack of time in the lords, that the Commons complete consideration of the Bill on  August.hi discussion it was argued that, while it was important to avoid theloss of the Bill, particularly in view of the trade union reactionswhich such loss would provoke, there were grave difficulties abouttaking such business in the week beginning 2 August.    That week wbbalready liable to contain a debate on public expenditure, as well asan Opposition Supply day, which meant mat the avoidance of controversy could not be guaranteed anyway.    The Health ServicesBill, however, would require a Three Line Whip.    In the week of2 August this could be extremely difficult;  some government supporters might nevertheless be absent, with the result that theBill would be defeated.    This would be the worst outcome of all.    Onthe other hand if the Bill did not reach the Lords until after 11 October,mat House might refuse to pass it on the grounds that they hadinadequate time for consideration.    It was in any case very desirablethat one month should elapse between receipt of the Bill in the lords and the end of the Session so that if the Bill were not passed by the lords this Session it could be passed under the Parliament Act next session.    One possibility would be the extension of the current session, since the loss of the Bill would be politically very serious.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that it wasnot possible to decide at present when the Session should end.    TheCabinet had noted, and shared the concern of, the Secretary of Statefor Social Services over the possible loss of the Bill, but felt mat thebalance of argument was against attempting Report Stage and third reading in the week of 2 August.
Cabinet Office19 July 1976Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
THlS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENTiCOPY NO    40CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(76) 16th Conclusions Minute 1Monday 19 July 1976 at 10. 00 am the Cabinet resumed their discussion of public expenditure andhad before them additional memoranda by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP(76) 54) about the treatment of publicly owned industries and companies and by the Secretary of State for Social Services(CP(76) 55) about expenditure on health and social security.THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that at their previous meeting theCabinet had agreed on the need to make a cut of Si, 000 million in public expenditure in 1977-78, but had not completely ruled out thepossibility that some part of the package might consist of taxationincreases, although it seemed likely that the great bulk would haveto be found from expenditure.    They had agreed that the mainsocial security benefits should be excluded from the reductions.On defence, they had favoured a cut of  100 million, rather than the 140 million suggested by the Chief Secretary; on overseas aid,they had agreed that for the moment mere should be no reduction,although this might need to be reconsidered later; on agriculturethey had agreed mat, after offsetting  9 million of additional bids,a cut of  25 million should be made; and on food subsidies they hadtaken no decision, but had noted that the Secretary of State for prices and Consumer Protection was prepared to find savings of  75 million.They had then discussed a proposal by the Secretary of State forEnergy mat the capital investment of the British National OilCorporation (BNOC) should be excluded from the public expenditure total; and on this question they had now received a further paper bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP(76) 54).   He proposed that theyshould pick up their discussion where they had left it last time, andmen proceed item by item in the order of the memorandum by theChief Secretary attached to CP(76) 53.1 *uc**fcENDrrUREte315th*k&quot;ions.
In discussion it was argued that the BNOC had been shown in theprevious February&apos;s White Paper (Cmnd 6393) as an identified item,although no provision had been entered for 1977-78 or subsequent years, any requirement being left as a claim on the contingency reserve.    Furthermore, in the next White Paper provision would need to be made for British Aerospace and British Shipbuilders, andit was difficult to Bee how one could exclude one body at the same time as two others were being brought in for the first time.    There was certainly a good case for saying that the investment of the nationalised industries as a whole should be excluded from theWhite Paper entirely, and tbat only their borrowing from theGovernment should be scored; and it was hoped that this could bedone in the White Paper due to be published in the autumn.    If,however, this produced a marked, and obviously only superficial,improvement in the overall figures, it would be attacked if such achange were made at the time the Government was bo eking to boostoverseas confidence by making cuts of  1, .000 million in public expenditure.To exclude BNOC&apos;s expenditure alone in the statement to be madelater in the week would be to invite criticism.    It followed that the 197 million of BNOC expenditure would need to be offset by reductions in other nationalised industry investment.Against this it was argued that on this basis cuts would have to bemade in other spending programmes merely to satisfy a meaninglessconvention.    Investment by British Nuclear Fuels Ltd, which was100 per cent Government owned, did not score for public expenditurepurposes and there was no reason why BNOC should not be treatedsimilarly.    It would be wrong to cut, eg food subsidies and social security, in order to finance BNOCTs expenditure, particularly whenthe Corporation could borrow on the New York market on better terms than the Government.    The 1977-78 figure for BNOC in thelast White Paper had been nil, and the ^classification of a nil figurecould scarcely be regarded as unfair.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that mere appeared to be good sense in the Idea of separatingthe investment of the nationalised industries from the remainder ofpublic expenditure, and showing only the extent to which theindustries borrowed from the central Government,    This was amatter on which the Cabinet would need to consider a paper by theChancellor of the Exchequer in good time before publication of themain public expenditure White Paper in the autumn.    Oh theassumption that this change would be made in the autumn, it seemedmost undesirable to have to accommodate the BNOC additional bidat this stage.    Provisionally therefore the capital expenditure of theBritish National Oil Corporation should be excluded from public expenditure in the statement which would need to be made later in theweek and the Treasury should give further consideration to how this could be explained.
It would be possible to find cuts of some  67 million on nationalised industry investment in the energy field.    Of mis,  20 million would come off the coal programme - although it would be difficult topresent thiB as part of a package designed not to hit manufacturing industry - about  20 million from gas, by delaying the gas pipeline,and  20 million from electricity, the last being to some extentdependent upon a cut in the housing programme with a consequentialreduction in the demand for connections.   A further  16 millionmight be found from cutting the coal industry plant pool, which wascoal face equipment purchased by the National Coal Board for usein the pits - which would mean the cancellation of orders - and some further reductions on gas.    Beyond that  40- 45 million could befound in the field of nuclear policy by deferring the Steam GeneratedHeavy Water Reactor (SGHWR).    This would provide total savings of  123 million; but if these were agreed, there was a strong case for offsetting against that saving the cost in 1977-78 of the proposed scheme for assisting poorer consumers of electricity.    That costwas  10 million, so that the savings would be reduced to  113 million.hi discussion it was argued that the heavy electrical plant industry,a report on which would be coming forward from the Central policy review Staff before long, was likely to be badly hit by the absenceof any need for further power station orders for the time being, andthat the deferment of the SGHWR could mean the collapse of theindustry itself, which employed some 25, 000 people.    Deferment ofthe SGHWR would revive demands for its cancellation, although on present plans the reactor was needed in Scotland and could not bereplaced,   A reduction in expenditure on the coal industry plantpool would affect a programme with direct consequences for work at the coal face,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the position was that savings of  112 million could be made - 67 million on nationalised Industry investment and  45 million ondeferment of the SGHWR - which, after allowing  10 mi1&quot;&quot;&quot; forassistance to poorer consumers of electricity, left a net  102 million.There were however additional bids of some  35 million towardswhich the Secretary of State for Energy was only offering  2 millionoff the fast breeder reactor programme, leaving  33 million to be offset against the proposed savings.    The Cabinet would therefore31. Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of mis part of their discussion.
score  69 million as the saving on this programme.    They notedthat they would need to consider the question of assistance topoorer electricity consumers again in view of the additional expenditure it would require in 1976-77.    They would also have toconsider, when they came to the Law, Order and ProtectiveServices programme, the Secretary of State for Energy&apos;s offer to save  3. 3 million on the civil defence oil stocks.The Cabinet -2.        Took note with approval of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.On regional development grants, it was explained that, for purelyadministrative reasons, these were now paid some three monthsafter application.    If the Government were to announce that actualpayment would be delayed by a further six months, there would bea once-for-all saving of some  120 million.    The Government could make clear, at the same time as at present, that the grant was going tobe given, so that the firm could, if necessary, raise short-termfinance from the banks to bridge the gap until actual payment.However, it was argued that this would be contrary to the mainthrust of the Governments industrial strategy, and it would be preferable to impose a purely administrative delay of an additionaltwo months, which would save  30 million.    It was pointed out thata six month delay, given the rate of interest on bridging loans, was equivalent to a cut of 7 per cent in the value of me grant.    It wasnoted that at a later point Cabinet would be considering the possibilityof some reduction in the Regional Employment Premium; and thetotality of the effect upon regional policy would need to be watched.If it were desired to save more than  30 million on regional development grants, it might be better to exclude some industries,eg construction, altogether from its scope rawer than to go in fora longer period of delay in payment.On nationalised industry investment savings of  65 million might bepossible from the British Steel Corporation (allowing for recentdecisions   on  Port Talbot and Redcar) and the Post Office.    It wassuggested that a larger cut than the proposed  20 million in PostOffice investment might be possible.THE PRIME MINISTER, Bumming up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Secretary of State for Industry should consider whether itwould      be possible to save  145 million net of the remainingadditional bids of some  19 million on votes and  64 million for the investment programmes of British Aerospace and British Shipbuilders.4
The savings could include  30 million from a two month delay inthe payment of regional development grant;   20 million fromexclusion of the construction industry from the scope of the grant; 65 million from nationalised industry investment;   5 million from the investment of British Shipbuilders and British Aerospace;and  25 million from miscellaneous items.The Cabinet -3.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the brief discussion, said that cabinet agreed that the investment programmes of British Airway sand the British Airports Authority should be cut by a total of 15 million;  and that additional gross savings of   5 million, giving netsavings of  2 million, should be made by the Secretary of State for trade by deferring for one year the recently agreed programme of support forthe film industry and further offsetting savings from the planned expendi-ture on civil aviation security and the promotion of exports and tourism.The Cabinet -4.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.ent Additional bids on this programme totalled   94 million, including 35 million as a result of the equalisation of the rates for men andwomen of Regional Employment Premium (REP) at  3, and  30 million from the collective funding of apprentice training.    It would bepobBible to abolish the payment of REP in Development Areas,leaving it only in Special Development Areas (but the effect ofabolition would totally overshadow the merit of equalising); to delayequalisation for a year; or to introduce equalisation at a lower level,eg  2 a week.    It was pointed out that REP was counted as areduction of a flrmS coats for the purposes of the Price Code, andit would be possible, in parallel with giving a lower equalised levelof REP, to discount the premium for Price Code purposes, thusenabling firms to charge higher prices, a change which would be worth some  180 million to industry in terms of prices.    Thiswould, however, only benefit firms in a position to charge a higher price; and it thereby eroded the advantage which Development Areas
enjoyed from the REP.   A saving of  15 million, as a partialoffset to the cost of the collective funding of apprentice training,might be possible if the Manpower Services Commission could agree to bring in a levy to charge part of the cost to employers; or alternatively the introduction of collective funding could be delayedby six months.   A further  18 million might be saved by reducingthe employers1 rebate on redundancy payments from 50 per cent to40 per cent.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Secretary of State for Employment should consider makinga net saving of  24 million after offsetting the additional bids of 94 million.    This could be achieved by dropping the additional bidof  35 million for equalising menS and women1 s rates of regional employment Premium at  3, thereby saving  35 million, andequalising instead at  2 a week, thereby saving a further  50 million,hi addition,  15 million could be saved by reducing expenditure oncollective funding for apprentice training; and  18 million by reducing the employers&apos; rebate on redundancy payments.    Thesesavings would total  118 million, which meant a net saving of 24 million.The Cabinet -5.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of the discussion.8 and There was an additional bid on this programme of  90 million,&quot;Port being prospective overspending by English local authorities mainly on concessionary fares and other transport subsidies.    This was virtually ineluctable, and it was proposed to offset it by imposing a moratorium on the construction of new roads by local authorities,which would save  90 million.    The question at issue was: how farshould other road construction be cut back in order to make further savings.   It would be possible to save a further  40 million by imposing a moratorium on the construction of new trunk roads in categories HI and IV; and a further  35 million if mere were cutsin categories I and II trunk roads also.    It was noted that the roads programme had suffered repeated cuts in recent exercises; thatroads were not altogether irrelevant to the industrial strategy, sincesome 80 per cent of goods travelled by road; and mat mere were strong environmental arguments in favour of taking through trafficflows out of towns.   No road proposal got into the programme unless it showed a high rate of return or had decisive environmentaladvantages.    The pattern of roads expenditure was such that capitalcuts in 1977-78 inevitably meant even larger cuts in 1978-79 and some
further cuts in 1979-80.   A reduction of  130 million in theprogramme next near could cost 9-10, 000 jobs in terms of directlyemployed labour, and possibly double mat in supporting industries.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat, over and above the  90 million cut which the Secretary of Statefor the Environment was prepared to make to offset the excessexpenditure on transport subsidies, he should seek to make furthercuts totalling  60 million.    The Secretary of State for scotland would find his usual proportion of 10 per cent, which would produce a further  6 million, and the Secretary of State for Wales would find  3 million, giving total net savings on roads expenditure of 69 million.   A further  5 million could be found by reducing the investment programmes of the minor surface transport industries.Total savings on the programme would thus total  74 million.The Cabinet -6.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.There was a prospective overspend of  250 million in England ini977.78 on this programme, of which some  150 million would beon new house-building, and  100 million on housing subsidies.The Housing Ministers had agreed that it would be necessary toimpose immediate control on the new house-building programme,which was at present open-ended; and in England this would meancutting the rate of approvals by local authorities from its present level of about 10, 000 a month to 6-7, 000 a month.    Because housingstress areas would need to be safeguarded, the reductions would fallthe more heavily on the non-streBS areae.    This would be sufficientto offset the prospective overspend of  150 million on house-building;and the Secretary of State for the Environment was prepared to findother savings of  100 million from local authority lending,municipalibation and improvement work to offset the overspendingon housing subsidies.    The subsidies themselves could only bereduced by legislation, which was not practicable at the presenttime.    To get additional savings of  400 million, as had beensuggested by the Treasury, would require a total moratorium onall new house-building.    It was however argued that, if the building societies could be persuaded to take over some of the local authoritymortgage lending, it might be possible to cut the present provisionof  286 million - Great Britain - by  250 million, and then to savea further  100 million from the  402 (Great Britain) provision for improvement of local authority houses,  50 million from theprovision of  139 million (Great Britain) for improvement grants to7
the private sector and  50 million from the provision of 746 million (Great Britain) for investment by New TownCorporations and Housing Associations,    hi further discussion itwas observed that the crucial judgment lay between rent increases and cute in investment.   Rents of local authority houses weregrossly inadequate, and it was questionable whether the proposed increase of 60p a week in the rent next year was the maximum possible.    One possibility might be to legislate simultaneously both to increase local authority rents and to reduce the tax relief on mortgage interest for owner-occupiers.    However, this kind of change could not be made in the course of the current week; and inany case Ministers would before long have the Housing FinanceReview before them covering the whole range of housing policy.THE PRZME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidmat the question of what could be done on local authority mortgagelending would have to be settled in the light of further discussions with the Building Societies which would be taking place later in theday.    For the moment the Secretary of State for the Environmentshould consider what would be politically the least damaging way of saving  250 million on his housing programme as a whole, over and above the offsetting of his additional bids, and should report back to cabinet the following day.    The Cabinet had noted that the housingsituation in Scotland was not parallel with that in England, and it wasnot therefore to be assumed that the Secretary of State for Scotlandcould offer 10 per cent of the English saving on all elements of hishousing programme.    They also noted mat the Secretary of Statefor Wales would wish to speak further about his additional bid of 78 million when they returned to this topic.The Cabinet -7.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;8 summing up of this part of their discussion.8. Agreed to resume the discussion at their next meeting.Cabinet Office19 July 1976
