Therewas circulated at the meeting a list prepared by the Secretariat ofthe changes in individual programmes which had provisionally beenagreed at the earlier meetings.THE PRIME MINISTER said that on the reckoning to date the cabinet were still  118 million short of their target of total reductions of L 000 million.    He therefore proposed that they should again runthrough the individual programmes.neeTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet appreciated that cuts here meant increased unemploy-ment, not least in the construction industry since, to help raise the savings from  75 million to  100 million, the Secretary of State for defence would be deferring for up to a year the building of 900married quarters.   Nevertheless, it was agreed that the saving tobe scored against defence should be  100 million.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.r**as Aid THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatmere was some feeling in Cabinet that this programme shouldsuffer some mods at cut; but the majority view was still that theUnited Kingdom&apos;s external image derived from her good aid recordshould not be tarnished for the sake of a relatively small sum.    Itwas therefore confirmed that no reduction should be made on thepresent round, though the Cabinet could return to the possibility Ifnecessary after going through all the other programmes.
secret the Cabinet -2.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of this part of their discussion.?*er THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatJ-jarBeas total expenditure under this head in 1977-78 was  305 million,^^vices Part 1 of the Review of Overseas Representation (the Berrill Report)was available, but Part 2 would not be ready until the end of the year.It was likely that the report would suggest economies, and theCabinet felt that some saving on account might be scored.    It wasagreed that a reduction of  10 million should be made.    there appeared to be no possibility of reducing the figure for contributions to the European Communities, nor of making any change in theprovision for the Joint European Torus which was under discussion in Brussels.The Cabinet -3.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;8 summing up of this part of their discussion.ture.^heriea andro**stryTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discusbion, said thatthe Minister of Agriculture  would prefer to save  20 million onthis programme rather than the  25 million previously proposed;but the general view in Cabinet was that they should stick to the saving of  25 million after offsetting the additional bids.The Cabinet -4.      Took note, with approval, of the prime minister s summing up of this part of their discussion.The cut provisionally agreed the previous day was  75 million,tidies which was  25 million more than the original offer by theSecretary of State for Prices and Consumer-Protection.    in discussion it was argued that food subsidies were of particular importance to the trade unions, partly for symbolic reasons, andpartly because of their real effect upon prices.    The need to subsidise food was part of the original Social Contract and had appeared in more than one Labour Party Manifesto.    In terms ofpublic expenditure saving the difference between  50 million and 75 million - which could mean two increases in the price of milkin 1977 instead of one - was not worth the strong reaction it couldprovoke.    This could in fact prove to be the last straw with the
trade unions.    It was noted that, even before the  75 million cutnow contemplated, past decisions would require a successive seriesof increases in food prices as subsidies were phased out, including three increases in the price of milk during the currency of the paypolicy; and that if cuts above  75 million were made, it wouldmean ending all subsidies except on milk during that time.    Anychange on the European front - eg in the value of the &quot;Green Pound&quot; -would be a very serious embarrassment when food subsidies werebeing run down so rapidly.    On the other hand, it was observedthat, under existing plans, expenditure on food subsidies would fallfrom  408 rniUfonin 1976-77 to  280 million in 1977-78; and thatconsequently the difference between a further  50 million and afurther  75 million could hardly be a crucial factor in the reactionwhich would be likely to come from the trade unions.    Even a cut of   100 million would only increase the Retail Price Index bysomething like 0. 2 per cent.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing Up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion in the Cabinet favoured keeping the reduction at 75 million.The Cabinet -5.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.In discussion of the treatment to be accorded to the capitalexpenditure of the British National Oil Corporation (BNOC) itwas recalled mat on the previous day Cabinet had agreed thatprovisionally this capital expenditure should be excluded from public expenditure in the statement to be made later in the week; and had invited the Treasury to give further consideration to how this could best be explained.    There were formidable difficulties over thissince, whereas BNOC would be excluded to avoid having to scoreadditional expenditure in 1977-78, credit would be taken for cuts onthe other nationalised Industries.    BNOC, like other nationalised industries, and unlike British Nuclear Fuels Ltd, was a statutorycorporation.    If BNOC alone were excluded this would be seen asa presentational device and the validity of the whole package mightBuffer some damage.     Against this it was argued that no figure forBNOCs requirements in 1977-78 had yet been published, nor would itoe known.    Given the intention to take all nationalised Industries outof public expenditure and treat them separately In the autumn white paper, there was everything to be said for avoiding the burden ofthe additional  197 million in the figures now under considerationby Cabinet, and presenting the change as justified by the fact matBNOC, following the recent participation agreements, was now anew industry whose investment should from the start be treated as
separate from the ordinary run of public expenditure - especially if,as was suggested, the Corporation was capable of borrowing in itsown right, and without Government guarantee, on the overae&amp;bmarket,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the majority view in Cabinet was mat it would be justifiable tokeep BNOC expenditure out of the public expenditure figures in thestatement to be made later in the week, but that it should be madequite clear what was being done and why, so as to avoid any risk ofsubsequently being charged with having attempted to hide anything.As for the remaining cuts on the energy programme, it was not necessary for the  10 million which would be the cost in 1977-78of the scheme for helping poorer energy consumers to be offsetagainst the savings because that scheme had yet to be examined and approved and its cost should therefore properly be treated as a potential claim on the Contingency Reserve.    It might be thatpossible reductions in the additional bids on the fast reactorprogramme and civil defence oil stocks (the latter appearing underthe law and order programme) had not been fully scored.    This point should be examined further between officials.    Apart from that last point, the savings to be scored under this head were therefore 79 million.   Some care might need to be taken, because of its importance in Scotland, about the presentation of the deferring of thesteam generating heavy water reactor.The Cabinet -6.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.In discussion it was noted that when, on the previous day, theSecretary of State for Industry had indicated that he could findsavings of   145 million net on his programme, he had meant thathe could absorb the additional bids of &quot;some  19 million&quot; referredto in paragraph 24 of the Chief Secretary&apos;s memorandum attachedto CP(76) 53, but not the  64 million required for British Shipbuildersand British Aerospace referred to in paragraph 26 of that paper.The Secretary of State was prepared to accept a reduction of  5 million in the latter expenditure.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that,given the present legislative position, it would be reasonable to leavethe additional bids in respect of British Shipbuilders and BritishAerospace as a claim on the Contingency Reserve,    Cabinet had discussed the possibility of increased savings on regional development Grants, and it might be in the longer term that therewould be some possibility of saving money by de-scheduling some areas - eg North Scotland - or by finding ways of excluding capital
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion said thatthe Cabinet confirmed that a saving of  17 million should be madeunder this head.The Cabinet -8.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.^onaiiBed**ustryS^atmentTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthey had noted the previous day that there were additional bids of 45 million on this programme which had not been offset.   one possibility might be to give the public expenditure figures withoutincluding the nationalised industries at all, and to make clear thatcertain changes, producing a net saving of  110 million were beingmade in nationalised industry capital programmes.    However, ifthiB were done the total savings would be that much more short ofthe target of  1, 000 million.    On balance the Cabinet preferred toleave the presentation as agreed.The Cabinet -9.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;B summing up of this part of their discussion.^Woyment THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said matthe Cabinet confirmed that  24 million should be saved on this programme but, In order to avoid unnecessarily damaging trainingexpenditure the Secretary of State for Employment should be givenflexibility so that he could try to make some savings by persuadingemployers to take on a larger share of the administrative costs of the Industrial Training Boards.intensive projects, such as oil installations J    This howeverwould take time.    For the moment the Secretary of State for industry was prepared to find a further  15 million of savings byan additional one month of administrative delay in the payment of regional Development Grants, and it was agreed that this shouldbe scored making a total saving of  160 million.The Cabinet -7.      Took note, with approval, of the prime minister tor ]s summing up of this part of their discussion.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet noted that, as a result of some of the cuts agreed forother parts of the United Kingdom, cuts in Northern Ireland might,on the basis of parity, be increased by  3 million; and theSecretary of State was prepared to increase this if he possiblycould to   10 million.    This meant that the total saving on thisblock should be increased from  25 million to  35 million.The Cabinet -11.    Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.THE PRIME MINE TER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthere appeared to be no possibility of cuts in expenditure on maintenance or rents; and the view of officials was that the capital programme could not be cut further.    However, the Secretary ofState for the Environment would consider the last point later in theday and report back.The Cabinet -12.     Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that although there was total expenditure of  849 million on this block,there did not appear to be any reliable scope for making a cut.The Cabinet -13.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that cabinet confirmed that there was no saving to be had on this programme.The Cabinet -14.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet noted that the provisionally agreed cuts of  60 million in the English road programme would lead to additional nnfemploy-ment of 23, 000.    Nevertheless, if the cuts were increased to 75 million there would still be  80 million left for new trunk road construction, and the balance of opinion in the Cabinet was that theyshould go for the higher saving.    Comparable savings on scottish and Welsh roads expenditure would be  8 million and  4 million respectively, giving a total for the block of  87 million.The Cabinet -15.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.In the course of discussion the following points were made--a. The  250 million saving shown in the Secretariatstable as related to England was in fact intended to coverScotland also.    The English share would be  200 million.Of this the Secretary of State for the Environment felt ableto offer only  100 million (after eliminating his  150 millionoverspend on housebuilding).b. Local authority mortgage lending should be capableof further cutting if the Government could negotiate with theBuilding Societies and the banks to take over some of thelending, even if the Government had to guarantee loans onsub-standard houses.    This was under discussion with theBuilding Societies.c. The improvement work by local authoritiesrepresented good value for money and Bhould not be reduced.d. Improvement grants to the private sector might be phased down; but this would require legislation.
e. Expenditure by the New Towns and housing associations might be capable of some reduction.    Theexpenditure scored against the housing Associationsconsisted of grants and loans to the Associations; it mightwell be possible for the Associations to increase theirborrowing from the banking system, and it was confirmed that if this were done it would reduce both public expenditure and the public sector borrowing requirement,since the Associations were treated as part of the private sector.    To achieve this result it would however benecessary for the Associations to borrow direct from the bar&amp;n    and not through the Housing Corporation.f. Another possibility might be to reduce the percentagesubsidy represented by grants to housing Associations, whichwere as high as 75 per cent.g. The municipalisation programme was already beingcut to some extent in order to offset the additional bid on housing.    The programme was a useful one, since local councils bought houses, sometimes in stress areas, which otherwise might stand empty, encouraging squatting.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that at this stage it did not seem possible to increase the saving on this programme beyond the  100 million proposed by theSecretary of State for the Environment.    The Secretary of state should however investigate the possibility of transferring somehousing Association borrowing to the banking system and report back.The Cabinet -16.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of this part of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that cabinet accepted that conditions in Scotland did not parallel thosein England.    There was no housing overspend to be offset; and itwould not be possible to take 20 per cent of the English cut on localauthority mortgage lending, which would be  20 million, since totalsuch lending in Scotland was only  12 million.    Nor was there anymunicipalieation programme in Scotland. On balance theCabinet took the view that Scottish housing as a whole might be cut by   12 million.The Cabinet -17.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister18 summing up of this part of their discussion.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet fully appreciated the difficulty of the Welsh position,with expenditure in 1977-78 planned in the last White Paper to fall well below mat in 1976-77.    Nevertheless, it was not accept-able that there should be an increase as large as  62 million inWelsh housing expenditure at a time when a cut of   100 million was being made in England and  12 million in Scotland.    on balance the Cabinet view was that an additional bid of no more than 20 million could be agreed.The Cabinet -18.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.oonientalTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said matthe Secretary of State for the Environment was prepared toincrease his offer of savings on this block from  55 million to 70 million.   If comparable increases were made in the scottish and Welsh savings they would rise from  8 million to  11 million,making a total saving on the block of  81 million.The Cabinet -19.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.1 THE CHANCE l^OR OF THE EXCHEQUER showed the Cabinet a copyof a letter which he had received from the Trades Union Congress (TUC)about expenditure cuts.    He indicated that, in his discussion with the tuc representatives the previous Friday little indication hadbeen given on trade union preferences on priorities, no doubtbecause these would affect different trade union members indifferent ways.    From a more recent talk he had had withMr Len Murray, bis impression was that the TUC would do their best to assist the Government, although they would necessarily have to oppose the cuts fairly strongly.    There was no intentionon the part of the TUC leaders, however, mat the cuts should beallowed to affect support for the pay policy.In discussion it was suggested that perhaps the TUC reaction wouldbe rather sharper than had been suggested, particularly when they saw the figures and the items involved.    Indeed, there was a case for reconsidering the composition of the package, which at presentbore heavily on unemployment and on industrial policy, both ofwhich were of great importance to the trade unions.   If there were
a aharp and adverse reaction from the unions or from the LabourParty this could itself react badly on confidence overseas, whichit was the purpose of the package to boost.    It might even be preferable to accept a smaller package which avoided so muchaddition to unemployment.   Against this it was argued that a smaller package might well be inadequate to achieve its purpose -and it was noted that Cabinet was still over  100 million short ofits target.    Presentation would be extremely important, and thepossibility of some additional expenditure for the national enterprise Board, as a means of making the package more accept,able to Party opinion, should be borne in mind.THE PRIME MINSTER, summing up the discussion, said that itwould not be desirable for Cabinet to go over all the expenditureitems again;  but there were still some programmes which had notbeen re-examined, and they would need to be considered further thefollowing day.   He proposed that this should be done the following morning, when Cabinet could also consider what action might betaken to close the gap to make up  1, 000 million.    A further meeting would take place the following evening to consider a draft of thestatement which the Chancellor of the Exchequer would propose tomake in Parliament on Thursday 22 July.The Cabinet -20.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of thoir discussion.21.       Agreed to resume their discussion the following morning.Cabinet Office20 July 197610
