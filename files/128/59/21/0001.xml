TARY     1.    The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the arrangementsfor the debate on public expenditure proposed for Monday, 2 August,had not yet been finally settled.    He had given no commitment toarrange a debate before the Recess, and had undertaken only todiscuss the matter through the usual channels, but a debate seemeddifficult to avoid and the Opposition could be expected to protestvigorously if no debate was announced for next week.    It had been proposed to the Opposition Oat 2 August should be a Supply Day andthat they should put down the motion for debate; a united vote couldbe expected on the Government side against any motion put down bydie Opposition.   If the Opposition declined this offer, the best chance of winning the vote at the end of the debate would be secured by holding the debate on a motion for the adjournment.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that neither the Government nor any of the Government&apos;b supporterswere anxious to have a debate on public expenditure now.    Therewas accordingly no need to make Government time available forsuch a debate before the Recess, notwithstanding the risk that theGovernment would then be criticised for avoiding a debate; there might also be criticism if a debate were to be held on a motion forthe adjournment.   It should therefore be explained to the Oppositionthat, if they did not wish to take up the offer of a Supply Day in orderto debate public expenditure on a motion of their own choosing, theGovernment did not propose to provide time for this purpose next week, but would arrange a debate in due course following thepublication of the Public Expenditure White Paper in the autumn.on Public^P*aditureThe Cabinet -1.     Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister, and invited theLord President of the Council to proceed accordingly.Sill THE HOME SECRETARY said that it waB most desirable thatCommons consideration of Lords amendments to the Police Billshould be taken in the House the following week, so that the bill could receive the Royal Assent before the Recess.   A number ofpolice officers, Including the Commissioner of Police of the metropolis, had voiced criticism of the Bill, and it was Importantquickly to reach the position where these officers could be told that since the Bill had become law may should desist from further public criticism of it.   Very little time would be required in the House andno votes would be involved.
THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he had considered whether Commons consideration of Lords amendments to mis Bill could be fitted in next week but mis had not at &amp;rstsight seemed possible.   He would, however, consider againwhether there was any way of fitting mis in.The Cabinet -2.      Took note.Benefit THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said thatthe joint working group on Child Benefit, consisting of representa-tives of the Government, the Parliamentary Labour Party, theNational Executive Committee and the Trades Union Congress,would be meeting that afternoon to consider a draft report.    Theyseemed likely to agree on recommendations that the full ChildBenefit scheme should be phased in by 1979 without necessarilyinvolving additional cost to the Exchequer and that Child benefit should be paid without tax and clawback from April 1977.    Hewould like, during the debate on the Child Benefit and Social Security(Fixing and Adjustment of Rates) Regulations on Friday 30 July,to say mat the Government accepted at least the first of these recommendations.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet had reached their earlier decision on the introduction of child Benefit after prolonged discussion and they wished to haveproper time to consider the full implications of the new recommenda-tions, if they were made, including the implications for studentsupport arrangements.   The Secretary of State for Social services should therefore reserve the Government&apos;b position during the debate on the basis that the working group&apos;a report would havereached him only the previous day.The Cabinet -3.      Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^summing up of their dia cubs ion and invited the Secretaryof State for Social Services to proceed accordingly.1^ *aft and THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that a number of(^T^Uding Government backbenchers had tabled a lasUnainute amendment for^les Bill the Report Stage of the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill to restrict the rights to consultation on Industrial democracy,corporate plans, establishment of machinery for negotiation of terms and conditions, and other matters, to unions affiliated to the
Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions (CSEU)instead of to any independent union recognised under theEmployment Protection Act.    Throughout all the proceedings onthe Bill hitherto the Government had firmly adhered to the position that this Bill should be kept in line with the provisions onrecognition in the Employment Protection Act, and the Billaccordingly defined a &quot;relevant trade union&quot; for the purposes ofthe provisions on consultation as one recognised as independentunder that Act.    Certifying Officers had, however, been certifyingas independent unions staff associations and other bodies notaffiliated to the Trade Unions Congress (TUC) or the CSEU,contrary to the intentions of the Government and the wishes of allgenuine trade unions.    The Government would have to indicatelater in the day whether they accepted the amendment, and he had discussed the position with the Secretary of State for Employment,who thought that it would be necessary to amend the EmploymentProtection Act so aB to give effect to the Governmenfs intentions.The Secretary of State for Employment was also in favour of takingcorrective action now in the aircraft and shipbuilding industries,by accepting the amendment.    He himself, however, did not thinkit would be wise to alter the existing arrangements in the context of a Bill applying to only two industries.    The atmospheresurrounding the Bill was already difficult, and such an amendment -which would certainly be removed by the House of Lords - would endanger the Bill&apos;s passage through the Lords.    He would prefer to examine this problem in a calm atmosphere and find a generalsolution to it.In discussion it was pointed out that finding a general solution would take some time, and the Government would be likely to incurcriticism, especially from the trade unions in the aircraft and shipbuilding industries, for failing to take the opportunity presented by the amendment to deal with the matter now in these two industries.An alternative to the amendment would be that the Boards of the twoindustries should be free to decide for themselves which were the relevant unions for the purposes of the provisions on consultations,or that they should consult the TUC; it was, however, now too late to put down any new amendment to the Bill in the Commons.Without amendment of the Bill, it would be difficult for the twoBoards to avoid consulting bodieB which were recognised under theEmployment Protection Act but were not genuine trade unions, andwhich would seek to exploit this situation to their own advantage.There was, however, general recognition that iaauee of greatdelicacy and difficulty were involved, which affected relationships between the TUC and some individual unions.    These problemswere particularly sensitive In a high technology industry like theaircraft industry, where some white-collar workers were genuinetrade unionists and others were strong anti-unionists.3
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theissue of trade union recognition raised difficult and technical problems and the general view of the Cabinet was that theGovernment should make no move in mis field without having first been able to give full consideration to these problems.    the secretaries of State for Industry and for Employment should accordingly explain to the supporters of the backbench amendne ntthat the Government were studying the general problem of recognition, which had developed unexpectedly following the enact-ment of the Employment Protection Act, as a matter of urgency andwould be bringing forward their own proposals for a general solution.It was reasonable to expect proponents of the amendment to payregard to the difficulty, particularly the parliamentary difficulty,of attempting to tackle this problem piecemeal in the aircraft and shipbuilding industries before the Government had been able toreach conclusions on the appropriate general solution.    TheSecretary of State for Industry should also advise the twoorganising committees that they should not meanwhile become involved in consultations with unions other man those longestablished and recognised unions which were members of theCSEU, and could explain to the House on the Third Reading of theBill that this advice was being given.   The Secretary of State for employment should explain the Government&apos;s attitude to the tradeunion group in the House and to the TUC.The Cabinet -4.      Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Secretaries of State for Industry andfor Employment to proceed accordingly.2.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat following the breaking off of diplomatic relations with theGovernment of Uganda, the French Embassy in Kampala had assumed responsibility for the protection of British interests inthe country.    The withdrawal of the Acting High Commissioner,Mr Gibbs, had been effected successfully.   So far the reaction of President Amin had been muted.    Commonwealth Governmentswho had been informed had been generally sympathetic.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.4
3,        The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum bythe Lord Privy Seal (CP(76) 39) about cutting the cost of the CivilService; and also had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP(76) 59) about Vehicle Excise Duty.THE PRIME MINISTER said that at their meeting on 8 July(CM(76) 14th Conclusions, Minute 4) the Cabinet had agreed tosavings totalling just under  95 million.    The majority view hadbeen in favour of abolishing the Vehicle Excise Duty (VED), butthey had left the question of the timing of mis change on one sidepending the further views of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.What the Cabinet now had to do was to take a view on VED and consider the bridging of the remaining gap to the figure of 140 million.    He had, along with the Lord Privy Seal, seen theNational Staff Side earlier in the week and had suggested to themthat there would be advantage if the agreed savings of  95 million could be announced, making it clear at the same time that the doorwas not closed to further savings.    The Lord Privy Seal*s private secretary had circulated a letter the previous day to all membersof the Cabinet enclosing a draft of such a statement.   His own lpersonal view was that they should agree to a statement of this kind,    &apos;and he suggested that In the first place their discussion might befocussed upon the draft.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the draft statement was somewhatstronger than was perhaps indicated by the note of the meeting withthe National Staff Side.    The Staff Side were a very responsiblebody, and they recognised mat the Government ran a certain riskin announcing cuts of  95 million having spent five months trying to find   140 million.    He reminded the Cabinet that they were verylarge employers, and that the uncertainty created through theabsence of any announcement bad created a great deal of unrestthroughout the Civil Service.   The National Staff Side were worriedover the limited degree of consultation which had been possible -they had been given the figures, but not the details of where withinDepartments the cuts would fall - and an announcement on the lines suggested would go far to hold the position.    The Governmentremained committed to finding the balance, but would have more time to consider this.    The terms of the draft statement for cabinet had been agreed with the National Staff Side.In discussion it was argued strongly that it would be difficult toobtain the co-operation of departmental Staff Sides to the agreedcuts of  95 million if they thought there were more to come.    Inany case, there was no reason to think that the balance of the cuts would be any easier to find in the autumn than they were now.    Itwas therefore suggested that the Government should accept that  95 million, or  95 million plus the saving from the abolition ofVED, if that were agreed, should be the end of the exercise.Against this it was argued that the Government could not formally        jforgo its  140 million objective, but that there was no need to &apos;agonise over it unduly.5
The Cabinet then considered the text of the draft statement, and anumber of excisions and amendments were agreed.    It was also agreedthat, while this need not be mentioned in the statement, the figure of 7 million against the Foreign and Commonwealth Office was anaverage assessment pending the outcome of the Review of overseas representation.In discussion of VED, it was argued that the situation at Swanseawas now critical, and that an early decision either to abolish or toretain the tax was essential if industrial action were to be avoided.On the other hand it would be wrong for Cabinet to be hurried into an important taxation decision and it was possible that a decision to abolish VED would cause even more unrest than the lack of adecision.   Nevertheless, it was argued that a decision was needed and that without the savings it would provide -  12 million in staffcosts and  22 million from the  2 registration fee - there was no prospect of ever bridging die gap between  95 million and  140million.THE PRIME MINSTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Lord Privy Seal should arrange for astatement to be made that day, by written answer to an arrangedParliamentary Question.   A revised text had now been agreed Intheir discussion.    The general view of Cabinet was that no decision should be taken on Vehicle Excise Duty for the time being.    Theannouncement of a decision to abolish it would cause great difficulties for the motor car industry, thus exacerbating further the adverse reaction of the Confederation of British Industries(CBI) to the addition to the employers&apos; national insurance contribution.   The Cabinet could consider VED further at a later date.   In the meantime all Ministers should continue to considerthe possibility of any further reductions which might bridge thepresent gap between achievement and target.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters Bumming up of their discussion.2.      Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for astatement to be made that day, by way of a written Lanswer to an arranged Parliamentary Question,In the terms which they had agreed in the course of &apos;&apos;    their discussion..t6
4,        The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Prices and Consumer protection and Paymaster General(CP(76) 58), the Secretary of State for Employment (CP(76) 60)and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP(76) 62) on measures whichmight be taken to reduce unemployment among young people.    TheyalBO had before them a note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(CP(76) 64) to which was attached a report on the state of the contingency reserve.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR PRICES AND consumer protection AND PAYMASTER GENERAL said that the ministerial Group on Unemployment among Young People had agreed that the Government should announce its support for theintroduction of work experience courses.    The scheme proposed would start in September and provide places for up to 30, 000young people at a gross cost of  19 million.   In the first instanceapplications for the scheme would have to be received by the end ofMarch 1977 but the Group considered that this should not be a finaldecision on the end date, which should be kept under review.   TheGroup could not reach agreement on the proposal for a job swapscheme.    They favoured the idea in principle but were conscious that it involved very considerable practical problems.    Of these the most serious were the high coat and the impossibility of enforcing or even policing the condition that anybody retiring underthe scheme should be replaced by the recruitment of somebodyfrom the unemployment register.   The majority of the committee felt that if the problems could be solved the scheme should be looked at very seriously; but the Chief Secretary, Treasury was more strongly opposed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that if theGovernment were to continue to enjoy the support of the tradeunion movement for their pay policy and for the decision to reducepublic expenditure it would be necessary for them to demonstrate that they were taking action to deal with the unemployment problem.The Trades Union Congress (TUC) would be meeting at a time whenunemployment might be as high as 1$ million and rising at a rateof 40, 000 a month.   The new Social Contract called for more actionto be taken.   The package of measures to which they were committed would therefore have to be both substantial and imaginativand should not be confined to the young.   The figure of  50 million which had been suggested by me Treasury was totally inadequate.The job swap scheme held out a prospect of releasing 90-100, 000jobs to those who were unemployed.   It would have its main effect in the winter when unemployment was expected to be at its peak andwhen the Temporary Employment Subsidy (TES) would be coming toan end.    The scheme had been criticised because of uncertainty about its cost, but to suggest that it would be taken up by 80 per cent of those eligible, twice the figure assumed In the estimates, wasabsurd.    Only 60 per cent of employees now retired when they
reached full retirement age.    The question was rather whetherthe proposed allowance at  23 was not so small that there wouldbe a smaller take up than the 40 per cent allowed for in hisfigures.   Fears of evasion were also grossly exaggerated.    Thescheme already allowed for the non-replacement of 10 per cent of those receiving the allowance, which was twice his ownexpectation.    He had consulted the TUC informally about theproposal.    They would welcome it though they had doubtswhether the proposed allowance was large enough and had mixedfeelings on whether those who were unemployed should be eligible.On this point he thought it unwise to take a decision without further consultation.   He strongly recommended however that theGovernment should announce that the scheme was being studiedwith a view to its introduction at the end of the year.In discussion there was general agreement that the Governmentshould announce a significant package.    Unemployment was a veryserious problem which needed to be attacked by micro-economic measures.    There were however differing views on whether theproposed job swap scheme was an effective and satisfactorymeans of dealing with the problem.    On the one hand it was argued that the estimated cost of  118 million was inevitably very uncertain.   The scheme would require legislation and the bill would be open to amendments in Parliament to extend its provisions which the Government might well be unable to resist.   AU thearguments in favour of the scheme applied equally to a general reduction in the retirement age, yet this could not be contemplatedsince the cost would be enormous.    There was no possibility that the replacement requirement could be enforced.    800, 000people changed their job every month - 25, 000 of them In the age group which this scheme would cover - and it would be impossibleto establish In this continuous turnover whether a particularretirement had been offset by a recruitment.   Since the fchemewas only temporary there could be no justification for recruitingstaff to make checks.   The payment of on allowance free of taxwas a dangerous precedent and could have repercussions.    Therewould also be considerable difficulty in preventing the recipientsof the allowance from also claiming Supplementary or other Benefits.There was already public concern about the degree of abuse of thosocial security system and it would be most unwise to add a newmeasure which was particularly open to abuse.   The impressionwhich the scheme created would be particularly bad if it were opento the unemployed where there would be no question of a new jobopportunity being created.   There was also danger of criticism bypensioners who would see no justification for those who retiredearly being paid more man those who had worked till normalretiring age.8
On the other hand it was argued strongly that it was imperative that the package should contain more substantial measures thanthose which had been agreed previously.    While it might not bepossible to ensure the strict application of the retirement condition in particular cases, the removal of a large number of people fromthe labour force was bound to increase the employment prospects of everybody else.    Industry had now redueod Us manning to a low level and a large amount of overtime was being worked to securethe present output from the existing labour force.    It was thereforeimprobable that the scheme could result in substantial retirementwithout replacement.   It was very likely that the large majority ofthose taking advantage of the scheme would be women, for . whomthe allowance would compare more favourably with earnings,whereas the unemployment problem was more acute amongst men.Far from adding to the pressures for early retirement the schemerepresented a cheap way of satisfying those pressures to a limiteddegree.    The legislation to give effect to this scheme would be popular and it was most unlikely that MP&apos;s would put it at risk by seeking to introduce unreasonable amendments.   At the very least,the Government should announce that the scheme was being carefully examined.In further discussion it was pointed out that the Social services committee would be considering later that day a proposal to extend the provision of educational maintenance allowances for thosestaying at school beyond the age of 16.   This scheme could beIntroduced by an amendment to the Education Bill at present in theHouse of Lords.   If it were endorsed by Social Services committee it would be a very suitable measure to include in an early statement.As an alternative to the job swap scheme it was suggested that additional finance should be provided for the job creation programme,and for the work experience scheme.   It was however argued thatIt was doubtful whether these schemes could absorb substantial additional funds in the short term.    The work experience scheme in particular was limited by the extent to which employers wouldmake places available.    It was also suggested that there would be advantage In extending the life of the Temporary EmploymentSubsidy beyond the end of 1976.    This scheme was already wellunderstood and had been effective.    Other measures which shouldalso be considered were the removal of some of the presentlimitations on the job creation scheme - its terminal date, the exclusion of any activity which would add to profits and the pro-visions which prevented unemployed teachers being used to giveservices In deprived areas.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that the proposed statement must includesufficient to demonstrate the very serious concern which theGovernment felt for the unemployment position.    There was general9
agreement that the work experience scheme should be included.So far as the job swap scheme was concerned there was a strongweight of opinion within the Cabinet which saw objection to thepresent proposals.    On the other hand the arguments in favourof some measure of this sort had a good deal of force.    The best course might be to indicate that the Government were seriouslyconsidering proposals of this kind in the hope that they could beintroduced for an experimental period of six months in the assisted areas only.    To limit the scheme in this way would reduce thescale of risk.    The statement might also indicate that theGovernment were reviewing the operation of the TemporaryEmployment Subsidy and would be discussing with the TUC thepossibility of its extension in time.    It might also say that the jobcreation scheme was also being reviewed with a view to thepossible widening of its scope.    In order to help with the presentation it would be necessary to distinguish clearly betweenthe items which were firmly decided, which could be coated and inrespect of which estimates of the effect on employment could bemade, and those items which were still under consideration.    Itwould be preferable for this statement to be made on 3 August,after the debate on the expenditure cuts.    The Secretary of Statefor Employment should prepare a draft and circulate it for approval by the Cabinet.    If the Social Services Committee endorsed theproposal for educational maintenance allowances, that could alsobe included in the statement.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime Minis tor1 summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Employment to be guided accordingly.10
5. The Cabinet considered a Note by the Lord President ofthe Council (CP(76) 63) proposing the terms of a supplementaryWhite Paper on the Government&apos;s plans for devolution to Scotlandand Wales.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that theGovernment were committed to a statement before the Recesson remaining additions and changes to the proposals in the november White Paper Cmnd. 6348.    In view of the range and complexity of the matters to be covered a White Paper was theappropriate vehicle.    The decisions covered by the draft beforethe Cabinet, and the terms in which they were expressed, had been endorsed by the Ministerial Committee on Devolution Strategy.In the round, they would represent a useful improvement in therobustness and political acceptability of the GovBrnmeaVadevolution plans.   He proposed that the statement should bepublished on 3 August; on the same day there would be a shorteroral statement in the House of Commons the terms of which hewould circulate to Departments in advance.THE PRIME MINISTER, Bumming up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet approved the statement attached to CP(76) 63, subjectto any minor drafting amendments which might be notified to theLord President during the course of the day, and to urgentdiscussion between the Secretary of State for Trade and theSecretary of State for Northern Ireland on whether any amendment in the sections on tourism was appropriate to allow for possible future changes in respect of Northern belaud.The Committee -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.11
6.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs(CP(76) 61) on direct elections to the European Assembly.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY recalledtha,t the European Council in Brussels on 12-13 July had reached agreement on direct elections, in particular on the size and composition of the European Assembly, which was subject to aderogation for the United Kingdom to cover the possibility thatwe might not be able to meet the date envisaged of May/June 1978and was within the guidelines agreed by Cabinet on 8 July.    TheEuropean Council had asked the Council of Ministers (ForeignAffairs) to settle all the outstanding questions by the end of July.This had not proved possible since at the Council (Foreign Affairs)on 19-20 July the French had objected to a derogation specificallyfor the United Kingdom and had insisted on all Member Stateshaving the same degree of commitment about the date of the firstelections.   As a result a compromise proposal had been worked out which removed any commitment to specific dates for the firstdirect elections, replaced this by a best endeavours clause inrelation to May (June 1978 and laid down mat the actual date shouldbe decided by the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affaire) actingunanimously.   The Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs had said that he was not able to agree to this compromisebefore the matter had been discussed by Cabinet.   The foreign and Commonwealth Secretary suggested that we should now accept this compromise proposal as fully consistent with the decisions ofCabinet on 8 July.    It was in practice unlikely that at the end ofthe day we would turn out to be the laggards.  But if necessary itwould be better to be isolated in a yeans time when progress hadbeen made on the revision of the Common Fisheries Policy than inSeptember of this year when the Council (Foreign Affairs) would return to the direct elections issue.In discussion attention was drawn to the difficulties which would be involved by the heavy burden of devolution legislation next session.It would be unfortunate if having introduced a Direct Elections Billearly next year it then turned out that direct elections would not inthe event take place until 1979.    And it was uncertain what shouldbe said in relation to this in The Queen&apos;s Speech.    Moreover itwas not clear whether the agreement in the form now envisaged -a decision under Article 138 of the Treaty of Rome - would beopen to the same processes of Parliamentary approval as theConvention originally envisaged.    It was further argued thatfeeling in the National Executive Committee was clearly runningagainst direct elections.   And while it was true that the compromise proposal would enable us to block direct elections throughout theCommunity if in a year or eo&apos;s time we were unable to meet thistimetable, the pressures on us then to come into line particularlyIn relation to the other objectives we would be pursuing in theCommunity would be all the greater.12DJRECTElections tothe european^assemblydeviousReference:CM(76) 15th^Conclusions,jl Minute 2
On the other hand it was argued that from the point of view ofmaking progress on the revisions we needed to the CommonFisheries Policy there was much to be said for deferring any possible isolation on direct elections from the next meeting of theCouncil of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) in September this yearuntil much later.    In Borne respects the new compromiseformula gave us a more effective let out than the previousderogation limited to the United Kingdom alone.    Thus ourposition was fully safeguarded.    Our proposal for the agreement to be embodied in a Convention bad met with no support but wehad been able to secure a number of changes in the text whichbrought it nearer a Convention.    What was said in The queen sSpeech and our tactics in relation to legislation next year couldbe fully considered later.    But In the meantime we shouldcontinue to make it clear in Brussels that, while we would use our best endeavours it was doubtful whether we could completeour preparations to meet the date of May/June 1978.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the compromise proposal now being considered had the disadvantagethat being different from the derogation specifically for the UnitedKingdom it might awaken suspicion.    But the general view of theCabinet was that the new formula in fact strengthened our position.It should be clearly recognised that if we were isolated at the endof the day the pressure on us to fid into line would be considerable.Equally other Member States must in mat event recognise thatwe had done our best to get legislation through but had not been successful.   It would be necessary to ensure that the arrangementsfor Parliamentary approval of the instrument to be agreed would be consistent with the assurances which he as Foreign and commonwealth Secretary had given the Hois e on 29 March.    Subjectto this latter point the Cabinet agreed that we should accept theagreement aB proposed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office29 July 197613
