^LIAMENTARY   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken In the&quot;AIRS House of Commons during the following week.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that on Tuesday20 July there would be three separate debates of three hours each onthe proposed timetable Motions; the first would relate to the aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill, the second to the Education and Rent(Agriculture) Bills, and the third to the Dockwork Regulation and health Services Bills.    The Motions would allot one day each,running until midnight, for the remaining stages of all these Billsexcept the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill, for which three days would be allotted, each running until 11.00 pm.    The remaining stages of the Education and Rent (Agriculture) Bills would then becompleted during the following week, and it was planned to take theremaining stages of the Dockwork Regulation and Aircraft and shipbuilding Industries Bills in the week beginning 26 July.   He hoped,subject to the progress of business, that the House would rise for the summer Recess on Friday 6 August and that it would be possible toavoid taking any highly controversial business during the final week.It might not be possible to take the remaining stages of the health services Bill until the House returned from the Recess.The Cabinet -Took note.i 2.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that^ **tS two courses of action had been open to us following the apparentmurder of Mrs Blcch and President Amin,s threats against ournationals.    The first was a tough statement and the immediatebreaking off of diplomatic relations with Uganda: this might well haveprovoked reprisals while in itself doing little good.    The second course, which he had preferred, was under cover of a restrainedattitude to take positive steps to disengage from Uganda over a periodof two to three weeks.    British subjects had now been advised toleave Uganda: and within three weeks their numbers should bereduced to those who would remain under any circumstances.   At that point it would be possible to close the High Commission in Kampalaquietly by withdrawing the remaining staff.    There was of course some risk that this gradual disengagement plan might go wrong and that president Amin would start taking action against the British community.If so. It would be necessary to fall back on a contingency plan agreed! with the Ministry of Defence, which was based on the use of civilianaircraft.    Meanwhile, certain requests for help had been receivedfrom Kenya and these had been met.
meeting THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had little to add to the statementg which he had made in the House of Commons the previous day on the^european meeting of the European Council in Brussels on 12-13 July.    What had^ncUstruck him most about the atmosphere of the meeting was the markedJuly helpfulness shown by President Giscard d&apos;Estaing.    On every issue hehad either avoided a difference of opinion with the Prime Minister orI JtJ^ous had given him his support.   This had been of particular help in theClif   aco: settlement of the direct elections issue.    The final compromise had14th emerged from discussion between the Prime Minister,illusions. President Giscard and Herr Schmidt and was based on a proposal of2 President Giscard.   Few of the Heads of Government seemed to havegiven adequate consideration to the administrative and legislativedifficulties which preparations for direct elections would entail and both Herr Schmidt and President Giscard, particularly the latter,foresaw difficulties on this front as did the Danes.   The fact that our share of the seats had been Increased to 81 would give us some moreelbow-room for the allocation of seats to the constituent parts of theUnited Kingdom, but the reports which had appeared In the Press of adistribution of seats within the United Kingdom were speculation andnot the result of official briefing.   Despite an attempt by the IrishPrime Minister to raise the question of Northern Ireland thedistribution of seats within national totals had not been discussed between Heads of Government,The Cabinet -2,        Took note.*^Nditurefens3, The Cabinet considered public expenditure. Their discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.1, Took note of the statement by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary,
4.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Price a and Consumer Protection and Paymaster General(CP(76) 51) reporting the views of a group of Ministers on proposalsfor action on unemployment among young people.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that he had putfour proposals to the Ministerial Group: first a proposal to replace the existing  5 Recruitment Subsidy for school-leavers by a subsidy of 10 a week for six months, payable in respect of anybody under theage of 20 who had been unemployed at least six months; and second aproposal to increase the number of training places provided by theTraining Services Agency (TSA) for young people from 7,000 to 10,000.Both of these proposals had been endorsed by the Group and he recommonded them to Cabinet for approval.   The third proposal hadbeen for the introduction of work experience courses in industry; andthe fourth was a job swap scheme whereby older workers would retireone year early and receive a special allowance on condition that their place was taken by someone on the unemployment register.   TheGroup had considered that both of the latter schemes required further work before any announcement could be made.   He was anxious tomake an announcement on Tuesday 20 July when the June unemploy-ment figures would be published.   He felt that the first two proposalstaken alone would represent a wholly inadequate response to thesituation which would be revealed, and that it was essential to include in his statement something about the work experience and job swapschemes.   The gross cort of the work experience scheme was estimated at  20 million, although allowing for the supplementary benefit which would be saved the net cost was only about half that sum.The idea had originated in the Trades Union Congress, and the confederation of British Industry were prepared to back it.   Hewould therefore like to announce the following week that the ManpowerServices Commission would be developing a work experience scheme inco-operation with both sides of industry to provide some 30, 000 placesat a gross cost of  20 million.    He would like also to be able to makeBorne reference to the possibility of a job swaps scheme which in his view had much to commend it,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR PRICES AND consumer protection said that the Group of Ministers were concerned at thepossible effect that the work experience scheme might have on thescheme for subsidising school-leavers.   Since in the former case thefull cost would be borne by the Government, while in the latter theemployers were left to bear part of the cost, there was a danger thatthe first scheme would undermine the second.   In any case, In theview of the Ministerial Group the scheme needed further refinement toensure that there was a proper training element.   On the question ofjob swaps, grave concern which she did not altogether share had been expressed at the possible effect this might have in stimulatingyjSfcPLOYMENT
increased pressure for early retirement over a much wider field.   Inany case, the cost of this scheme was still by no means clear.    TheGroup could not therefore recommend that an announcement be madethe following week on these two schemes.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that cabinet were agreed that the proposal to replace the existing  5Recruitment Subsidy for school-leavers by a subsidy of  10 per week,payable for she months, for the recruitment of anybody under the ageof 20 who had been unemployed for at least six months, should be approved at an estimated cost of  4.4 million.   Furthermore, they agreed to the expansion of training places provided by the TSA for young people from 7, 000 to 10, 000, and noted that this could bearranged without any increase in expenditure.    On the question of awork experience scheme and a job swap scheme, it was the general view that both of these required further consideration before theycould be approved.   The Cabinet shared the view of the Secretary ofState for Employment that to announce the first two schemes alone would not be helpful, and indeed might be regarded as derisory.When the unemployment figures were published the following week, heshould therefore say no more than that he hoped to produce a furtherprogramme of assistance before the Recess.    In the meantime further work should be done by the Ministerial Group under the Secretary ofState for Prices and Consumer Protection on the possibility of introducing a work experience scheme and a job swap scheme so that itwould be possible to construct an employment package of reasonablesize - although the possible repercussions of the job swap scheme would need very careful consideration.   The Secretary of State for defence had indicated that the defence cuts meant that faculties fortraining of apprentices were now becoming available In defenceestablishments and he should consult with the Secretary of State for employment on the way in which these could best be used.The Cabinet -1.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister &apos;s summing up of their discus sion,2.        Invited the Ministerial Group onunemployment among young people to consider further the possibility of announcing before the summer Recess the introduction of a workexperience scheme and a job swap scheme; andto report back.4
3.        Invited the Secretary of State for Employment,when the June unemployment figures were published,to do no more than indicate that the possibility offurther measures was under consideration.4.        Invited the Secretary of State for Defence,in consultation with the Secretary of State for employment, to consider how the sparefacilities in defence establishments for trainingapprentices could best be used.Cabinet Office15 July 19765
P DOCUMENT E THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NO40CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(76) 15m Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday 15 July 1976 at 9.30 am ttBUC-expenditure^**vious^fcrenca.J;**(76) 13thConclusionsThe Cabinet resumed their discussion of public expenditure and inthe first part of their discussion had before them further memoranda by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP(76) 52), the Secretary ofState for the Environment (CP(?6) 49) and the Secretary of State forEnergy (CP(76) 50).THE PRIME MINISTER said that at their previous meeting there hadbeen a clear majority in favour of an early statement of theGovernments intention to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) next year but he bad deliberately refrained from asking the Cabinet to take a final decision, then, either on theneed for this action or the form which it would take.   He suggestedthat the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for the environment and the Secretary of State for Energy should speak tothe further papers which they had circulated on the overall strategy and that the Cabinet should then proceed, without further repetition of the points which had been mads at their previous meeting, to adecision on the need lor a package of public expenditure cuts and itssice.   If the Cabinet agreed to this, they could then go on to considerthe other papers before them which bore on the overall shape and detailed composition of such a package.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that study of -dienational income forecast showed that on the basis of unchangedpolicies the money supply was likely to increase from a rate of8-10 per cent this year to 12-15 per cent in 1977-78: and It would rise further if we were unable to borrow heavily overseas.   Similarlydomestic credit expansion would be up from  5. 3 million to 9. 8 million as a consequence of the recovery.   This would result in aPSBR of   10, 500 million which we would be unable to finance withoutchoking off die recovery or printing money.   In his view It wasnecessary to have &amp; PSBR target of  9, 000 million for 1977-78, but a target of this kind would have no credibility without the action to achieve it.   Other Industrialised countries were taking action to eliminate or significantly reduce their budgetary deficit; and It was
relevant that these were the countries whose agreement would benecessary if we had to borrow further externally.   All thisreinforced the recommendation which he had put to the cabinet at their previous meeting and he felt bound to emphasise that unless action were taken before the Recess there was a stronglikelihood of a catastrophic run on sterling during August.   Thedecisions required were painful but the discussions which he had had the previous day with the Parliamentary Labour Party and withthe Economic Committee of the Trades Union Congress led him tobelieve mat the Government would be supported in taking the actionwhich they judged necessary.   Nor was there any alternative course.   An approach to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)or an attempt to fund the sterling balances would be fruitlessunless public expenditure had been cut: and the introduction ofgeneral import controls would both reduce our chances of borrowingand themselves require heavier public expenditure cuts.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatthe Chancellor of the Exchequer had produced no argument to show thatcuts of  1, 000 million would be sufficient to re-establish confidence in our economic policies to a degree which would enable us to rebuildour reserves and avoid being forced to the IMF, and there was every reason to mink that they would not.   This package would thereforebe a first instalment only and that was what made it so unacceptable.It would cause great damage to the Labour movement and yet sooner or later we would be forced to the IMF who would seek further cuts.The right course was to adopt an alternative strategy and to securethe main reduction in the PSBR through increases in taxation.   TheCabinet had not finally closed this as an option at their previous meeting and he very much regretted that it appeared to have beenforeclosed in the discussions which the Chancellor had subsequentlyhad.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that he welcomed the public discussion of the situation which had taken place,particularly since mis had exposed the weaknesses in theChancellor of the Exchequer18 arguments.   No-one now believedthat it was necessary to move further resources into exports andthe balance of payments: we were in a deep slump and there wasno suggestion of excessive pressure of demand.   Equally so the financing argument had not been established.    The confidencefactor needed careful analysis.   The danger was that our balanceof payments would worsen because of the erosion of ourmanufacturing base.   There was no sign of an investment boomand such recovery as we got would lead to a flood of imports and afurther deterioration In the balance of payments.   If the cabinet decided on public expenditure cuts they would be adopting thepsychology of failure which could only encourage extremist groupssuch as the National Front.   The right course was to make such  .
oatrfaga In public expenditure as were practicable without damage toessential policies or to relations between the Government and thetrade unions, to look at the possibilities of raising additional revenue through taxation, to open discussions with the IMF and torecognise that in any event we should need general import controlsby the end of the year.Summing up a short discussion THE PRIME MINISTER said thatthe whole Cabinet recognised the importance of preserving theGoveroroenfe good relations with the trade unions.   He recognisedthat some members of the Cabinet would prefer to have more timein which to consider alternative strategies and to discuss them withthe Parliamentary Labour Party and the trade unions.   On the otherhand, he was bound to say that their criticism of the Chancellor^strategy had not been matched by convincing arguments In favour ofany alternative course: indeed all alternative courses would seemto involve public expenditure cuts of at least equal size.   He did not accept the view that the present package was merely a first instal-ment.   He thought the Government&apos;a economic policies were gainingincreasing respect overseas.   There was however a feeling mat wehad been trying to do too much and other countries were looking tous to restrain public expenditure: if we did, mere was every reason,to think that we would be supported.   He did not think that further discussion would lead the Cabinet to a unanimous view of the right course of action, but thewe was a clear majority in favour of announcingbefore the Recess a cut of   1, 000 million in public expenditure for 1977-78 as compared with the White Paper figuree, together witha PSBR target of  9, 000 million:  the composition of that package(including eg the possibility that in place of some part of thereduction proposed in food subsidies there might be increases inexcise duties on spirits and tobacco) would form the next part oftheir discussion.   He recognised that this central decision placedthose who advocated alternative strategies in a difficult position buthe hoped they would be able to accept the majority view.The Cabinet -1,      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.The Cabinet also had before them a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP(76) 53) to which was attached a memorandum by theChief Secretary, Treasury, on public expenditure and taxation1977-78; a memorandum by the Minister for Overseas Development(CP(76) 47) about the overseas aid programme; and a memorandumby the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection and paymaster General (CP(76) 48) about food subsidies.3
In discussion attention was focussed on&apos;the broad shape which the  1, 000 million package should take, including the extentto which It should Include a taxation element.    If. was noted that,if the  l,DO0 million were mads up in the manner proposed by theChief Secretary, Treasury, in his memorandum, the effect was likely to be an addition of some 75, 000 to the number of unemployed in the first half of 1978, although it was recognised that forecasts of this character were necessarily very uncertain.   Cuts on capital programmes would cause unemployment In the construction industry; but other proposals - such as the reduction of mortgagelending by local authorities - would have little effect on unemploy-ment.    The effect of a cut of   1, 000 million at 1976 Survey priceBwas now thought to be a reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement in 1977-78 of  1, 000 million, rather than the  700 million which was the figure previously in mind.   Of the items proposed,only about one-quarter would have any effect upon the social wage;and it was argued that those effects were less severe than would bethe effects of additional taxation on those members of the communityabout whom the trade unions would be most concerned.   It wasnoted that to produce a given effect upon the public sector borrowing requirement called for an increase in taxation larger than thealternative expenditure cut.   It was, however, argued that theproposals in the Chief Secretary^ paper were socially regressiveand would have a serious impact upon the Social Contract.   Itappeared likely that the rate of inflation would cease to fall after thenext month or so, and would remain fairly level until the end of 1976.Thereafter there would be a slow decline in the rate of inflation,but the Government would be very lucky if it went into single figuresby the second half of next year.    The combined effects of the devaluation of the pound, the beginning of the next transitional periodof the United Kingdom&apos;s entry into fee Common Market (which would add l  per cent to the Retail Price Index), the implications of the drought for food prices, and the hardening of world commodity prices,would all combine to keep up the rate of Inflation, and this would produce a profound sense of disappointment in the trade unions.   Itwould be against this background that the Government would be taking steps, through expenditure reductions, to increase prices.   It maybe that this could not be wholly avoided; but it would be important for the Government to do all it could to sustain the Social Contract,which was itself an important factor in the maintenance of overseasconfidence.   If the present relationship between the Government andthe trade unions collapsed, overseas confidence would go too.From the point of view of the Social Contract, the impact of theproposed cuts on housing would need to be carefully considered, as would the proposed reduction in food subsidies, which would constitute a direct repudiation of the terms of the Social Contrag titself.4
Against this it was argued that both rent subsidies and food subsidies had been cut in the last package of reductions, and theeffects of those cuts upon prices had already been taken into account in the forecast.   The only additional effect which would arise fromthe further cuts in food subsidies now proposed would be an additionof one-quarter per cent to the Retail Price Index.   If, instead of cutting expenditure, the borrowing requirement were reduced by anincrease in indirect taxes, this could mean mat there would be nofall in the Retail Price Index through the whole of the period of thesecond round of pay policy, since such a taxation increase would add some 3 per cent to the index.   This would completely undermine the pay policy.   In any case, it was important to remember that itmight well be necessary to increase taxes in the 1977 Budget anyway,since expenditure cuts of  1, 000 million would not be enough to bringthe public sector borrowing requirement in the following year down tothe  9,000 million which it was proposed to indicate publicly as theGovernments target.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up mis part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet had confirmed their earlier view that, while thepossibility of including some tax increases in the present packagewas not altogether ruled out, the greater part would have to be made up of public expenditure cuts,   It was important to note that many ofthe &quot;cuts&quot; were really only the deferring of expenditure until a later date; and credit should be taken for this in the public presentation ofthe figures.   On the question of the priorities to be observed, itwould be important to have further consultations with the TradesUnion Congress (TUC) representatives; and while it would not be appropriate to discuss particular figures with them, it would be important to take their minds on the areas in which cuts might beless intolerable than elsewhere.   On one point Cabinet were agreed:the main social security benefits should be excluded from the reductions.The Cabinet -2.      Took note with approval of the Prime Minister*summing up of this part of their discussion.The Cabinet then proceeded to consider each spending programme in turn.**** Aid THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said matit was generally agreed that, for the moment, there should be no decision to reduce overseas aid, but this might need to bere considered after Cabinet had gone through all the other programmes.5
e In discussion it was argued that it should be possible to save 140 million in 1977-78 by deferring capital programmes andpurchases of equipment,   it was true that this would lead to someunemployment, in the construction industry and elsewhere, butthis was not a feature peculiar to the defence programme, sincemost capital cuts would have unemployment effects.   Against tillsIt was argued that -Oils would be the fourth round of defence cuts in19 months; and that those of the United Kingdom&apos;s allies who were pressing the view that the Government had allowed social expenditure to outrun productive capacity would not be impressed by a packagewhich included a disproportionate element of defence cuts.   A cut of  75 million might be possible, by a programme of defermentsand a three month moratorium on all new building starts, althougheven this would be held to affect the force growth of NATO.   Itwould mean a loss of 2,200 jobs in construction and 5, 000 jobs inthe defence industries. Any higher figure would not only lead to more unemployment, but would Ignore the burden of the responsibilities borne by the Armed Forces for security in Cyprus,Belize, Malta, Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands, as well as theprotection of offshore oil installations and the security task inNorthern Ireland.   To extend the moratorium on new starts from three months to six months would save an extra  10 million; butto go beyond this would be to cut Into areas of expenditure ofparticular importance to the Germans and the Americans.   One ofthese was Cyprus but we got little thanks for our presence mere andit would be worth considering whether we could start reducing our commitment there and perhaps at least give up one of the SovereignBase Areas.   This would however take time to settle and could notbe scored in the present exercise.   The present expenditure figuresassumed that a sum of  50 million would be received from west germany as part of a renewed offset agreement; but this mightnot in the event be realised.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that thorn was general agreement In Cabinet mat the figure of  140 million was probably too high, but mat, subject to any furtherviews of the Secretary of State for Defence, it should be possible to-secure a saving of  100 million.   The Foreign and commonwealth secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Defence,should review the longer-term position in Cyprus.63. Took note with approval of the Prime Minis ter&apos;summing up of this part of their discussion.
THE PRIME MINSTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthere was general agreement that, after offsetting the additionalbids of  9 million, it should be possible to save a further 25 million on mis programme without doing any serious harm to agricultural production.   The Cabinet noted that the Minister ofAgriculture would pursue the problem of legal difficulties aboutdeferring payment on agricultural grants, and would consider thepossibility of abolishing the lime subsidy, although it was notedthat the latter had in fact been reinstated by the Government sincetaking office as a reversal of a decision by the previous administration.   One possibility might be to retain the lime subsidy for less favoured areas.The Cabinet -5.      Took note with approval of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.The proposal before Cabinet was that food subsidies in 1977-78should be cut by  150- 200 million.   It was recognised that the timing of a cut of this kind - coming on top of the cuts which hadbeen made in the previous package of reductions - created some difficulties, but that the effect upon the Retail Price Index was less than 0.3 per cent.   Although it was not an easy area in which to make reductions, the alternatives could well be even moredifficult.   On the other hand it had to be recognised that food prices were an emotive issue.   The difficulty was mat to get the requiredsaving in 1977-78, and to avoid having very heavy price increases atthe same time In half a dozen basis foodstuffs, It was necessary tophase in the price increases in the course of 1976-77.   It was argued that the impact of increased food prices was highly regressive,hitting worst those, such as the pensioner and the single parentfamily, least able to bear the strain (although it was pointed out thatall subsidies had to be financed from taxation, and that the incidence of income tax at the lower levels of income was not all that progress-ive).    To take the whole of the  1,000 million package on indirect taxation might add 3 per cent to the Retail Price Index; but the option available to the Government on food subsidies was to reducesubsidies less and make good the difference by higher duty on, say,beer and tobacco, where the impact would certainly be socially lass4. Took note with approval of the Prime Minister *summing up of mis part of their discussion.
serious than an Increase in the price of milk (which, taking accountof subsidy reductions already agreed, would have to rise from$p a pint to 12fp a pint in a relatively short period).   Bread and milk were more important than alcohol and cigarettes, and 50- 75 million was the most which should be taken off next year18provision for food subsidies.In further discussion the possibility of an increase.In employers/ .national insurance contributions, as an alternative to a cut in food subsidies, was put forward.   This, however, had its own dis-advaatages - the reduction of company liquidity, the risk ofdiscouraging the taking on of more workers, the addition to prices,the undermining of the Governments relationship with Industry andthe fact that legislation would be needed.   Even the proposed increase in indirect taxation ran into timing difficulties, sincethe Finance Bill was not yet through Parliament; the early use ofthe regulator would produce tax increases before they were wanted;and the announcement next week of an intention to increase taxesnext April could lead to forestalling.   Since an increase of     inthe price of milk saved  80 million, it should surely be possible tofind ways of getting the total saving on food subsidies nearer to 200 million.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that it would not be possible to take any final decision on this item until the Chancellor of the Exchequer had had Us furthertalks with representatives of the TUC.   For the moment theCabinet noted oat the Secretary of State was now prepared to find 75 million.The Cabinet -6.      Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;8summing up of this part of their discussion.In the last Public Expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 6393) no provision had been made for the capital expenditure of the british national Oil Corporation (BNOC) for 1977-78, because the informs-tion aed policy decisions on which to base the estimate were notavailable, and it had been noted that the provision would be a charge on the Contingency Reserve.    The requirement was now put at  197 million.   It was argued that there was a fundamental absurdityabout treating this figure as a part of public expenditure.   TheGovernment had a 68 per cent interest in British Petroleumlimited, but because it was treated as a private company itscapital investment did not score as part of public expenditure.Again, the capital investment of British Nuclear Fuels Limited, inwhich there was a 100 per cent Government stake, did not score as
part of public expenditure.   But BNOC&apos;e capital investment didand, under the present rules of the Public Expenditure Survey,would do so even if it were financed by borrowings on the privatemarket.   It was noted mat Cable and Wireless Limited, which theGovernment also owned 100 per cent, was in exactly the same position, even when it wished to undertake profitable investmentabroad which it could finance by borrowing overseas.   There wasa strong case for saying that BNOC should be allowed to borrow onthe private market, and that such borrowing should not count as apart of public expenditure.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said mat there was a case for considering the present treatmentof BNOC further.   The Corporation was an infant industry, andit could be argued that now was the time for a fresh decision onthe way in which its capital investment should be treated.   Anarrangement based on a genuine understanding of the trading andffn*p^tM position of the Corporation would not lead anyone to thinkthat the Government were trying to hide something.   TheChancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary, Treasury,should therefore consider the question further and report to cabinet at a later meeting.The Cabinet -7.     Took note with approval of the Prime Minister^summing up of this part of their discussion.8.     Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theChief Secretary, Treasury, to consider thepossibility of some change in the accounting arrange-mente for BNOC&apos;s expenditure, and to report back.9.       Agreed to resume their discussion early thefollowing week.Cabinet Office15 July 19769
