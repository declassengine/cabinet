This meant that this additionalbid at present stood to be set off against whatever total reductionsmight be agreed.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the Prime. Ministers summing up of Oils part of their discussion.tag (Wales) In discussion of the Welsh housing programme, it was argued thatthe additional bid of  78 million in respect of 1977-78 was the outcome of an earlier failure to carry forward Into that year the      Iconsequences of increased expenditure in 1976-77.   Whereas total 1English expenditure on housing was estimated to fall between1976-77 and 1977-78 only very slightly, the comparable Welshfigures showed a fall of over one-quarter.    The Welsh figures
for new housebuilding showed an even more dramatic fall, of over one-third.    Such figures were politically indefensible, and it was essential that the provision for housing in Wales should have a realistic starting point in 1977-78.    Against this it was argued thatit was misleading to take only one expenditure programme and make this kind of comparison.    Of the additional bid of  78 million, 39 million was in respect of expenditure on improvements,municipalisation and mortgage lending.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that, while there was some sympathy in Cabinet with thepolitical difficulty of defending a sharp fall in the Welsh housingfigures, it was extremely difficult to contemplate, in the context of the present exercise to reduce public expenditure, addingsubstantially to the present figure.    The Secretary of State for wales had indicated that he was prepared to take the mean of theprevious three years&apos; total expenditure as the figure for 1977-78,which would reduce his additional bid to  66 million and then totake proportionately the same cut as England - 5 per cent, whichwould reduce his bid to  62 million.    Such an increase was mostunwelcome, but for the moment Cabinet took note that anadditional bid of mis amount should provisionally be allowed.The Cabinet -2.    Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.In discussion it was noted mat the total provision in 1977-78 in this programme for water services was  637 million, and for otherenvironmental services some  324 million - both figures coveringGreat Britain.    It was suggested that between them these might be cut by  100 million, of which  85 million would come from England.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Secretary of State for the Environment was prepared to offer areduction of  20 million on water services, and  20 million from capital expenditure on other environmental services.   It was arguable that it would be embarrassing to cut more off waterservices at a time of drought, but in view of the  act that it wouldnot be itemised in the public statement later in the week, it shouldbe posBible to increase the saving on that service by  10- 15 million this meant there could be a total saving, from English expenditure,of, say  55 million, which when the proportionate Scottish and welsh shares were added would make total savings of  63 million.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat the Cabinet noted that additional bids, totalling  35 million,would be withdrawn or offset, and that there was no scope forfurther savings on this block.    The question of expenditure onthe Urban Programme was under consideration by a CabinetCommittee.The Cabinet -4.    Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of this part of their discussion.In discussion it was observed that the Government had undertaken to the Trades Union Congress (TUC) that the present school mealcharge of 15p would not be raised during the current year and thatthe TUC1 s understanding of this was that mis meant the yearcovered by the second round of the pay agreement.    This made anincrease in the charge in April 197? unacceptable.    If there were anincrease of 5p in September 1977 that would leave an additional bidof  43 million in 1977-78.    If th* increase in September 1977 were raised to lOp, that would reduce the additional bid to some  15 million.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet favoured going for an increase in charges of lOp inSeptember 1977, so that the net addition to this part of the education programme would be  15 million.The Cabinet -5.    Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of this part of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthis expenditure totalled  7,500 million.   The Secretary of State had offered savings of  25 million, mainly in university and further education equipment, because the greater part of the current expenditure on education was in the hands of local authorities.3.    Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ Bumming up of this part of their discussion.
He was also prepared to offer  4 million from expenditure on science and arts.    The Treasury had proposed a cut of  60 millionall told.    On balance Cabinet favoured a figure of  45 million forGreat Britain which, when the additional bid of  15 million on school meals recorded in the previous discussion was netted off,would mean a net reduction, on a Great Britain basis, of  30 million on education expenditure.The Cabinet -6.    Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.IOci*l Security THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that cabinet noted that any additions arising from changes indemographic factors or economic assumptions were matters to bedealt with when the White Paper was prepared in the Autumn.There was general agreement that  10 million might be saved by restricting unemployment benefit for occupational pensioners;and that a further  13 million could be saved by delaying untilNovember 1977 the introduction cf the non-contributory invalidity pension for housewives.    Against these savings there was anadditional bid of f.2 million from the uprating of, and the extensionof eligibility for, the mobility allowance.    It was therefore agreedthat  21 million should be shown as the net savings.The Cabinet -7.    Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES, referring to his paper CP(76) 55, said that the Treasury had pressed him for total savings of  90 million, made up of  20 million from anincrease in dental and opthalmic charges;   40 million from a moratorium on capital expenditure; and  30 million from a reductionin current expenditure to meet the  30 million cost of the JubileeHoliday and junior doctors overtime.    He was prepared to agreeto  20 million from dental and opthalmic charges - which wouldmean a flat rate increase from  3. 50 to  6; to a saving on capitalexpenditure of  20 million, of which  10 million would come fromthe National Health Service and  10 million from the personal social Services - any further cut would reduce the provision for replacement of vehicles, X-ray and fire precaution equipment toa dangerous level; to offset the additional bids in respect of theanal Social^**ices
In discussion it was noted that last year the ministerial committee on Economic and Industrial Policy had examined thepossibility of tilting tariffs in such a way as to assist the poorerconsumer; but they had been unable to find any satisfactory wayof achieving this.    More recently the Committee had agreed toconsider ways of spending some  25 million to this end; and a highly selective scheme had now been designed under which, by concentrating the help on recipients of Supplementary Benefit andof Family Income Supplement who were electricity consumers, itwould be possible to give a 15 per cent reduction on electricitybills over the two winter quarters.    This would cost  15 million in 1976-77 and  10 million in 1977-78; and the Secretary of Statefor Energy had indicated that he would be prepared to accommodate the  10 million by other savings in his programme.    The  15 millionmight be treated as a claim on the Contingency Reserve for 1976-77,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said matit would not be appropriate for Cabinet to agree forthwith on this additional expenditure of  25 million, since the scheme which hadbeen proposed would need to be examined collectively on its merits.Nevertheless it would be helpful when making the announcement ofthe major cuts if the Government could indicate that they were considering how to help these poorer consumers.    The Ministerial$Jjkfcnce to^ *Eoergy^erBtJubilee Holiday and doctors overtime; and to get  20 million -an estimated product of nix month of the scheme - from a levy on motor insurers for road accident costs.    Thus, after off-setting the additional bids, he was offering  60 million.    If more were needed than this it should in his view come from an increasein the employers&apos; National Health Service contribution, where anincrease of 0.1 per cent would yield  60 million.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat it was generally felt that, while the idea of a levy in respectof road accident costs was valuable and should be pursued, theremust remain grave doubts whether the scheme could be worked out and the required legislation passed in time to yield half of afull year&apos;s saving in 1977-78.    However, the Secretary of state was prepared to undertake, if it proved impossible to get thatelement in the saving, to find other savings elsewhere to replaceit.    On this basis Cabinet agreed that a figure of  60 million should be scored as the saving on this programme.The Cabinet -8. Took note, with approval of the PrimeMinister&quot;e summing up of this part of their discussion.
Committee on Economic and Industrial Policy should thereforepursue the matter further.    In the meantime the additional bidof  10 million for 1977-78 could perhaps remain a claim on the contingency Reserve.The Cabinet -9.    Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.l0n Services       THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said matsavings of  10 million should be scored on this programme, butthe Secretary of State for the Environment should considerwhether more could be achieved without interfering with the dispersal of the Civil Service.The Cabinet -10.  Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland could not be present for this discussion but the Cabinet provisionally agreedthat a saving of  25 million should be made on this programme,being a proportionate share for Northern Ireland of the cuts beingmade in other parts of the United Kingdom.The Cabinet -11. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of thediscussion.In discussion it was argued that an additional  22 million should beadded to the expenditure for 1977-78 in respect of local authoritycurrent expenditure since mis was an unavoidable consequentialof an increase of  26 million in 1976-77 which had not been carried through to the later years.    This was not identical with theincrease in local authority current expenditure in England andWales, but flowed from the fact mat local authority reorganisationhad taken place in Scotland one year later than elsewhere.*****a Ireland
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat the Cabinet could not at this stage accept that  22 million should be added to the Scottish figures.The Cabinet -12.  Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos; s summing up of this part of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet had not so far agreed onsavings totalling   1, 000 million.    The Cabinet Office wcu Id prepare a table for circulation at their meeting on the following morningshowing what had been provisionally achieved so far.    Membersof the Cabinet should in the meantime give further thought to other possibilities.In discussion it was suggested that one possible course was tomake an across-the-board cut on all current expenditure.    On theother hand much current expenditure was under the control oflocal authorities.    To score a cut in that expenditure would beunconvincing, since the Government had not so far been able toget the local authorities down to the agreed level for the current year, and figures to demonstrate this would shortly becomepublicly available.    A severe Rate Support Grant settlement mightbe one solution; but this would penalise the co-operative localauthorities as well as the unco-operative.    In any case somecurrent expenditure, e.g. on prisons, was demand-related andnot susceptible to an across-the-board cut.It was also suggested that the Government should consider thepossibility of making additional money available for the national enterprise Board.    Of the 1976-77 provision only  24 millionremained uncommitted; and of the  225 million allowed in 1977-78,the whole was likely to be needed for Rolls Royce and british leyland.    It could help to present the major cuts if the Governmentcould demonstrate that more money was being put into the national enterprise Board to facilitate its major role of job promotion.Trades Union congress in further discussion the Cabinet were informed that the^TUCJhadexpressed no strong view to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the priorities which should be observed if cuts could not be avoided.The TUC had, however, indicated that increases in income tax and indirect taxes would be very damaging for the pay policy.On the other hand it was relevant that there were other items -food subsidies - which could be equally explosive; and that the tuc leaders had succeeded in getting the approval of the special meeting in June to the pay policy only on the basis that they would
oppose expenditure cuts.    The Government must thereforenecessarily tread very carefully in the items it chose for reductions.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that cabinet would resume their discussion on the following morningwhen it would be necessary to go through all the items again inorder to achieve the required total.The Cabinet -13.  Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;b summing up.14.   Agreed to resume their discussion thefollowing morning.Cabinet Office20 July 19768
