1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Presidentof the Council (CP(76) 13) containing proposals for the Governmentslegislative programme in the 1976-77 Session of Parliament.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that there would beunusually severe constraints next Session on the number of bills which could be fitted in, owing to the amount of time the DevolutionBill was likely to require, which might be as much as half theavailable time on the Floor of the House of Commons or even more.He was considering whether this Bill could be split and whether any ofthe Committee Stage in the Commons could be taken upstairs but hewas not hopeful of success.    Time must also be allowed for an appreciable number of Essential and Contingent Bills.   Accordinglyhis paper proposed that next Session^ programme should be described as &quot;provisional&quot; and that the Bills in it should be groupedinto three orders of priority.    The first priority group comprisedvery important Bills which were almost certain to be introduced; thesecond priority group comprised Bills with a reasonable chance of introduction; and the Bills in the third priority group would not have much chance.    The Government would be doing very well to get through all the Bills in the first and second groups.In discussion of the proposed short paving Bill on industrial democracy it was pointed out that the Government had made a firm commitment to legislate on this subject in 1976-77.    Failure to doso would invite a charge of breach of faith.    The Trades UnionCongress representatives on the Bullock Committee were working inthe hope that It would report in time for substantive legislation tofollow in 1976-77; a paving Bill could if necessary be drafted beforethe Committee had reported.    The development of industrial democracy should not be frozen while waiting for the Bullock report and industrial democracy legislation would help over devolution, as another aspect of the Governments programme for the promotion of democracy.    On the other hand it was argued that to introduce apaving BilL which could do no more than lay down very generalobligations of little practical effect, would fall far short of what theGovernment had promised:   and could risk prejudging decisions onthe Bullock Report.   The only industrial democracy legislation worthintroducing would be a really substantial Bill, and the better coursewould be to aim at introducing such a Bill before the end of next session and giving it a Second Reading, and then proceeding with itsenactment the Session after.    Whichever course was followed, anundertaking to introduce industrial democracy legislation should be contained in The queen e Speech.In discussion of each Departments individual Bills, the following main points were made.gislaxiveI^RAMME&apos;6-77
The Miscellaneous Financial and Administrative Provisions Bill.which would contain provisions required to achieve manpower savings in the Civil Service, might merit first priority.    The Cabinet had not finally decided, however, on the need for or practicability of this legislation.The most important provisions of the Education (miscellaneous provisions) Bill would overcome the difficulty that although there wasmoney which could be made available for financial assistance to tradeunions for their training programmes, and for new training courses attechnical colleges, there was no means of making direct grants forsuch courses in the public sector of education.    The Secretary ofState for Employment, however, had powers relating to the paymentof fees for courses, and the possibility of making use of these powers should be examined.The Coal Industry Bill was an important measure which might, ineffect, become politically essential.There was a strong case for giving high priority to legislation onDrink and Driving, to implement the Blennerhasset Report.    this bill would be very short and could be available for introduction in theHouse of Lords at the beginning of the Session.    The Bill on home lea fine ss would transfer responsibilities to housing authoritieswithout providing them with additional resources; this would entail achange in their priorities and the reallocatlon of their resourcesaccordingly.The Social Security (Amendment) Bill would save  50 million in1977-78 and would have to be Introduced at the very beginning of the session.    There had been no adverse reaction to the promise of this legislation made in the public expenditure White Paper, and there now seemed a good chance that it would obtain the necessary support in theHouse of Commons.    The Occupational Pensions Bill would introduceIndustrial democracy into the running of pension schemes, anddeserved high priority.2
The Conspiracy and Criminal Law Reform and Criminal Justice Billswere both expected to be introduced in the House of Lords early inthe Session, and the question arose whether they could be combined,provided that this would not result in a Bill which was too large andcovered too many disparate subjects.The Shipbuilding (Redundancy Payments) Bill would be very short andwould enable a redundancy scheme to be introduced comparable to thebest schemes In other industries; but it would not be volunteered to theunions, who had been told nothing of this plan.    Discussions on industrial democracy in the Post Office were taking place between theBoard, the Post Office unions and the Government, and might lead bythe end of the year to conclusions which would require legislation; thePost Office (Amendment) Bill would, however, be quite separate fromthe general legislation on industrial democracy.The Bill on the Regulation of Estate Agency in the Reserve categorynow had a stronger ca se for inclusion in the programme following theHouse of Lords decision that a prospective purchaser of a house hadno legal protection against loss of a deposit paid to a house agent.   Itwas hoped to complete the current Weights and Measures Bill this session, but if this were not practicable this Bill would have to be reintroduced next Session because it was required by 1978.The Patents Bill, which could be ready for introduction in the House ofLords before Christmas, and the Merchant Shipping Bill, a verydeserving measure, might both merit promotion.In general discussion the point was made that the lists of Billsincluded six Borrowing Powers Bills and three Independence BUIb, andit would be worth giving serious consideration to the possibility ofcombination.    On the other hand the result would be larger andpossibly more contentious Bills, and the handling of such Bills inParliament would involve a considerable number of Ministers fromseparate Departments.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that next Sessions programme category should be described as &quot;provisional&quot;, and should be grouped into three orders of priority.    Within the first priority group, the Governments legislation on industrial democracy would be of major political importance; andThe QueenS Speech on the opening of the next Session should reaffirm
in clear terms their commitment to introduce this legislation aB soonas possible after the Bullock Committee had reported.    It was not yetpossible, however, to decide whether to pursue the proposal for ashort paving Bill next Session, if the main legislation on industrial democracy could not be ready in time for enactment before the1977-78 Session.    Meanwhile a BUI on industrial democracy should remain in the first priority list in the provisional programme.    TheHomelessness and Housing Subsidies Bill, the Conspiracy and criminal Law Reform Bill, the Shipbuilding (Redundancy Payments)Bill and the Post Office Act (Amendment) Bill should all also remainin the first priority list.    The Home Secretary and the LordChancellor would consider whether the need for a separate criminla justice Bill could be avoided by combining the most importantprovisions of this Bill with the Conspiracy and Criminal Law reform bill,    The Secretary of State for Industry would consider whether thePost Office Act (Amendment) Bill could be combined with the contingent Post Office (Borrowing) Bill should the latter become essential.    The Social Security (Amendment) Bill should be added tothe first priority list, on the understanding that its introduction at the start of next Session would depend upon an assessment at the time of whether it could be got through the House of Commons.   All the otherBills in the second priority list In the Lord President of the Councilspaper should remain in that list, though the Occupational Pensionsand Patents Bills had claims for promotion.    The question which bills should be publicly promised next Session would have to be decidedwhen the terms of The Queen&apos;s Speech were being settled.   All the bills in the third priority list should remain in that list, but the miscellaneous Administrative and Financial Provisions Bill might need to be promoted after the Cabinet had reached decisions on CivilService manpower savings.    The Education (Miscellaneous Provisions)Bill should be added to the third priority list, and the Secretary ofState for Education and Science should consider, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Employment, whether the provisions relating to payment of grants for training could be Included in theIndustrial Training (Amendment) Bill,   It was not yet possible to take decisions on the introduction or timing of legislation on drink anddriving.    The Bills in the categories Essential, Contingent, Reserve,Scottish Grand Committee and Other should be as listed in the appendices to the Lord President of the Councils paper (subject to the promotion of the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill).    the responsible Ministers should now proceed with the necessary work on those Bills which would be or might be introduced next Session.The Cabinet *Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and Invited theMinisters concerned to proceed accordingly,4
Sjp*L 2.        The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor of the^industry Exchequer (CP(76) 11) and by the Secretary of State for Industry(CP(76) 17) on a proposal by the British Steel Corporation (BSC) thatsteel-making at Shotton should cease in 1980-81*THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that since coming to office in 1974 the Government had been reviewing the closuresinvolved in BSC1! modernisation programme.    The related issues ofthe proposed closure of steel-making at Shotton and the expansion of port Talbot were very difficult.   Economic arguments pointed in onedirection, social and political considerations in another.    The issueshad been defined In discussion in the Ministerial Committee onEconomic and Industrial Policy (El).    Shotton had a good record ofachievements in steel production, but the steel-making plant was nowobsolescent.    The issue was where to site the replacement capacity.BSC proposed that the iron and steel-making plant and hot rollingfacilities at Shotton should be closed In 1980-81 and that replacementcapacity should be built at Port Talbot, expanding output there fromthe present 3 million tons per annum (mtpa) to 5. 7 mtpa.    Shottonwould continue coke production and finishing operations.    Thiscourse. Option I, was part of bsc&apos;s basic strategy of concentratingoutput into a small number of large plants at coastal slteB.    It hadbeen supported by the majority of the members at El.    Analternative course, Option II, involved building a new steel-makingplant at Shotton with a capacity of 2,25 mtpa and to modernise otherparts of that plant, while Port Talbofs capacity would be increasedonly marginally, from 3 to 3,3 mtpa.   A third course. Option HI,would have meant the full development of Port Talbot as envisaged inOption I combined with the construction of a new steel plant at Shotton,but with less modernisation of the other facilities, so that the resultant capacity at Shotton would be limited to 1,8 mtpa.    Under all three options there would need to be large-scale modernisation of  -facilities at Port Talbot.The majority of the members of El had favoured Option I because itpromised much lower production costs and substantially higher productivity.    It would in fact result in productivity at Port Talbotequal to that in a comparable Japanese plant.    The cost of production at Port Talbot would be 13 per cent higher under Option H.    If BSCpassed on this higher cost it would damage the competitiveness of thetin plate industry and the motor industry; but if they had to absorb thehigher cost themselves this would In effect require a subsidy from the taxpayer.    Furthermore, if Option II were carried out further heavyinvestment would probably be needed before long.    The economicargument in support of Option II rested on the view that the cost corn-par i sons which had been put forward took inadequate account of theextent to which labour relations at Shotton were better than those at port Talbot - though even allowing for that Port Talbot would still5
have a 3 per cent advantage over Shotton in average production cost.Option II was supported principally by the social and political considerations.    Under either Option I or Option II 2, 600 jobs wouldbe lost at Shotton in the period 1980-82.    If Option I were chosen afurther 4,400 jobs, direct and indirect, would be lost over the period1980-84.    The Shotton area already had high unemployment and therewere few alternative job opportunities.    ft was near to Mersey sidewhere unemployment was very serious.    Option III, for which nostrong case could be m^de out, would involve the same number ofredundancies as Option IL but the first 1,000 of these would ariseearlier; it would create more production capacity than prospectivedemand would warrant; and would be strongly opposed in Scotlandbecause this additional capacity would be regarded as delaying thedevelopment of Hunterston.After taking full account of all the indirect costs of unemployment he did not regard it as possible to substantiate a case for new investmentat Shotton and considered the economic case for Option I overwhelming.He recommended that the Cabinet should decide on this course but thatthe Secretaries of State for Industry and for Wales should thenconsult informally with the Chairman-designate of BSC,Sir Charles VilUers, who would be assuming office in September.    Ifhe favoured Option II the Government should consider the case again.If he supported Option I the decision should be announced as soon aspossible.    The Secretaries of State for Industry and for Wales should however make proposals to El for measures which might be taken to attract alternative jobs to the Shotton area which might be Included inthe announcement.    If there were to be any substantial delay in announcing the decision on the issue as a whole he recommended that immediate approval should be given for that part of the modernisationat Port Talbot which was common to all the options.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY recalled that theGovernment had undertaken to review bsc&apos;s programme, which hadbeen approved by the previous Government, because they consideredthat inadequate regard had been paid to social factors.    The major part of the review had been completed the previous year and this meant that particular attention would now be focused on the decisionon Shotton,     Since 1974 the social problems had become more acute.At that time unemployment at Shotton had been lower than at PortTalbot - now it was higher.    He accepted that the economic analysispointed to siting new capacity at Port Talbot, though he thought thearguments less strong than the Chancellor of the Exchequer had suggested.    It would mean that 20 per cent of British steel-making capacity would be at one site, Port Talbot, and this involved risks.Cost comparisons assumed that the manning levels at Port Talbotcould be reduced.    While progress had been made towards this end,and an agreement concluded with the unions, it was in very general
terms and there must be doubts about how far it could be relied upon.He therefore favoured Option n.    The new 2.25 mtpa plant at Shottonwould be both modern and efficient.    Under Option I, 7, 000 jobswould be lost.    Unemployment at Shotton was already 7. 9 per cent and the prospects in the area not at all good.    Of the other two majoremployers in the area, Courtaulds was completing the closure of oneof its plants and there was no prospect of expansion at hawker siddeley.    The area was close to Mersey side where unemployment was already on a disastrous scale and there was serious concern about other major employers.    If he thought it were possible to attract 7, 000 jobs to the area he would support Option I, but he considered that it would be very difficult to attract even 2,600.Account also had to be given to political considerations.    There weremarginal seats in North Wales and the Welsh Nationalists alreadyheld Caernarvon and Merionethshire.    Closure of Shotton would cause serious damage to the Government&apos;s prospects.    There wouldbe no help from the steel trades unions whose interests were dividedand the Welsh Trades Union Congress, who had made representationsin favour of continuing steel production at Shotton might well take a stand against the closure.    In his view it was not necessary to take adecision immediately.    He believed that the right course was to askSir Charles Villiers to take a fresh look. The present Chairman,Sir Monty Finniston, had a closed mind but others In the BSC haddoubts about his policy.    In the meantime the Government should authorise the new hot strip mill and continuous casting equipment at port Talbot which were common to both options.    Considerationcould also be given to approval of new coke ovens though a decision onthe blast furnace would have to wait for the decision on the steel-making plant.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he had proposedOption HI because in his opinion it was Impossible to exaggerate thecatastrophe which would be caused by the closure of Shotton,    Thesocial and political consequences would be incalculable.    The planthad excellent management and workers.    They had waged a brilliantcampaign to preserve their plant.    If it were closed the odium would fall on the Government and this would be exploited by theGovernment&apos;s opponents.   At the same time there was a very strong case for the full development of Port Talbot.    There was alreadystrong expectation in the area that this would be approved and therewould be serious reactions if expectations were upset.    Developmentcould not be held back by doubts about labour relations which had been improved.   Given the very strong case for continuing steel production at Shotton and for the full expansion at Port Talbot he had endeavoured to see how both could be achieved.    The work force atShotton, who would of course prefer the 2,25 mtpa scheme envisaged in Option II, had nevertheless proposed a smaller development, to1.8 mtpa, which would be much cheaper - costing only  90 million, a
sum which could be recovered in three or four years.    It was truethat this would involve an increase of bsc&apos;s total capacity but in his view if the economy expanded as the Government hoped, this capacitywould be needed.    It was argued that an increase in capacity in wales would cause difficulty in Scotland, but it was not reasonable to suggestthat such a small increase would call in question the very large,long-term plans for Hunter ston.    In any case it was difficult to have confidence in bsc&apos;s forecasts and it would be unwise to rely on PortTalbot&apos;8 rapidly achieving BSC1! planned output of 5. 75 mtpa.    Therewas a strong case for the 1.8 million ton development at Shotton, inaddition to the full development of Port Talbot, as an insurance againstthe possibility of events not working out as planned.    In the past ithad been necessary to import steel in times of boom and there was avery grave danger that if Shotton were closed the decision would soon be regretted.In discussion it was argued on the one hand that there was a very strong case for Option I.    On the figures available the economic arguments were of overwhelming strangth.    If the Government,owning the whole industry, were unable to base its decisions in thenational interest on such clear economic grounds the whole basis ofpublic ownership was called in question.    Failure to develop PortTalbot would put in jeopardy 10,000 jobs in the tin plate industry InEbbw Vale, Trostre and Velindre which required high quality and lowcost steel sheet.    There would also be a danger of the motor industryeither being damaged or being forced to import.    It was imperative that the BSC should be competitive and to achieve this it needed a major improvement in productivity.    This was offered by Option J,At present 14,000 workers at Port Talbot produced 3 million tons ofsteeL    If Option I was carried out 12, 000 workers would produce5.7 million tons.    The trade unions had concluded a manningagreement for this expansion in the terms which management sought.It was however necessary to treat the economic comparisons, all ofwhich derived from figures produced by BSC, with some reserve.To proceed with development of both Welsh plants, as in Option III,would simply be to solve the problems of Wales at the expense ofScotland.    A large programme of steel closures had been agreed inScotland on the basis of an assurance by the previous Prime minister that the next major development - in the bsc&apos;s next strategy - wouldbe at Hunter ston.    This project was of greater significance to scotland than was the future of Shotton to Wales,    Option I wastherefore to be preferred.On the other hand it was argued strongly that Option I would result ina social disaster.    Few if any areas in the country were as dependenton one employer as Shotton and the prospects of attracting alternativejobs were poor.    There had been many instances where managementhad been over-impreBsed by the theoretical possibilities of large-scale new developments which had not been achieved in practice.   The
overriding requirement of British industry was regularity andreliability in supply, and this could not be promised by a schemewhich would concentrate output in a small number of very largeplants.    It would be wrong to throw away the advantage of acontented and reliable labour force at Shotton.    Particular doubt hadto be attached to forecasts by the BSC whose estimates hadfrequently proved wrong in the past.    On all these grounds, Option IIwas the better course.In further discussion it was argued that Sir Monty Finniston had not had an open mind about the arguments involved in this admittedlydifficult decision, and had identified the closure of Shotton with thesuccessful exercise of his own authority.    On so important adecision the views of Sir Charles VilEers, who would take over thechairmanship in September, were needed.    There was, therefore, acase for delaying the main decision until his views were known, alloptions being put to him, together with their significance forHunter ston.    It would not, however, be reasonable to expect him togive his view until after ha had taken up his post,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that therewas a consensus of opinion that it would be inadvisable to reach adecision without consultation with the Chairman-designate of BSC.The Secretary of State for Industry, in consultation with the Secretaryof State for Wales, should arrange for informal consultations to beheld with Sir Charles Villiers with a view to his giving his own viewof the optione which were open.    This, however, he could hardly dountil after he had taken office in September,    The Cabinet were agreed that, without waiting for the outcome of these consultations,immediate approval should be given to that part of the modernisationprogramme for Port Talbot which was common to all the optionsunder consideration.The Cabinet -L, Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.        Invited the Secretary of State for Industry,in consultation with the Secretary of State for Wales,to arrange for informal consultation with theChairman-designate of the British steel corporation with a view to his giving his own viewof the options.3.        Agreed that the modernisation of PortTalbot required under all the options considered in CP(76) 11 should be authorised as soon as possible.Cabinet Office18 May 1976
