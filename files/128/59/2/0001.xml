1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken In theHouse of Commons during the following week.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that, following thedecision by the Committee of Selection, on the Chairmanfs castingvote, that the composition of new Standing Committees should not be changed following Mr Stonehouse&apos;s crossing the Floor of the House,the Opposition had tabled an Early Day Motion calling upon theCommittee to withdraw the appointments to Standing Committees ithad just made and henceforth to appoint Members in equal numbersfrom the Government and Opposition Parties,    The matter was entirely one for the Committee of Selection, and neither he nor theChief Whip had brought any pressure to bear.    The Committee *edecision had been based on the composition of the House in accordingwith Standing Orders and there was a reputable case to be made for it.The figures published in some newspapers were misleading, in thatthe figure of 314 Labour Members excluded Mr Robertson andMr Sillars whereas the 316 Members of other Parties included the twoNorthern Ireland Members who regularly voted with the Government.The Opposition had behaved badly in tabling a Motion before theChairman of the Committee of Selection had an opportunity to reportto the House the reasons for the Committee^ decision, and he had accordingly proposed that there should be a debate on the adjournmenton Monday 3 May following the Second Reading of the Finance Bill.This would provide an opportunity for the Chairman to explain thedecision, and for the House to discuss the matter.   He hoped that thiswould take some of the steam out of the situation and that theOpposition would then reconsider their position.    If, however, they decided not to withdraw their Early Day Motion, time would have to befound to debate this Motion after 10.00 pm on Tuesday 4 May.In the course of a brief discussion the point was made that, wherethere had been a majority in the House on the Second Reading of aGovernment BilL, there was justification for a majority ofGovernment supporters on the Standing Committee for that Bill.The Cabinet -1, Took note.
THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that in the debate on 29 and 30 march the House of Commons had received favourably the Government^ offer to eet up a Select Committee on Direct Elections to the european assembly which would work in parallel with the discussions in theCouncil of Ministers.   He had accordingly discussed the ar range-ments with the Ministers principally concerned.    Their conclusion was that a Commons Committee would be preferable to a jointcommittee of both Houses which had been suggested in the House ofLords debate on 29 March.    The issues were rightly regarded by government supporters as matters primarily for the House ofCommons 2nd it was new expected that the House of Lords would not press for a Select Committecof their own.    There would be advantage in appointing a Minister to the Committee.    It could however be embarrassing for the Government if he were Chairman and this might also be unwelcome to the House.    The right course would be for aForeign and Commonwealth Office Minister to be a member duringthe Committee^ consideration of matters which were for Communitydecision, such as the allocation of seats among member states; andthat he should be replaced by a Homo Office Minister when theCommittee came to deal with matters for national decision such aselectoral arrangements.    A satisfactory agreement had been reached with the Opposition onthecomposition of the Committee,    The termsof reference proposed for the Committee, which should beestablished without delay, were:&quot;To consider the arrangements requiring action by parliament and by the European Community following the commitment toproceed to direct elections to the European Assembly&quot;.The Cabinet -2,        Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Prime Minister.2
2.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatMs meeting with the United States Secretary of State, Dr Kissinger,on 24 April had been most useful.    The discussion had centredlargely on Africa on which Dr Kissinger had been genuinely anxiousto learn our views.    He had in particular stressed to Dr Kissingerthe need to make it clear to the White Rhodesians that they could not count on salvation from the United States and also to understand the african attitude to a possible East/West confrontation overSouthern Africa. Dr Kissinger had taken substantialaccount of what had been said to him; and his subsequent majorspeech in Lusaka had made a major Impact by emphasising to the africans that they were not backed only by the Soviet Union but hadthe firm support of the West.THE PRIME MINISTER said that Dr Kissinger&apos;6 response wasencouraging.    We should however need to ensure that he was not over-impressed by the appointment of African Chiefs to Ministerial office in Rhodesia: these Chiefs were merely paid officials.The Cabinet -1. Took note.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR PRICES AND consumer protection AND PAYMASTER GENERAL said that a group ofMinisters under her chairmanship had given further consideration tothe Icelandic fisheries dispute.    The chances of the Norwegianmediation leading to any acceptable outcome were low.    the icelandic Government had not yet commented on the Norwegian draftof a possible agreement, and it was ominous that Ministers in the coalition Government in Reykjavik had decided that they would need to consult their Parties before doing so.    The Minister of State forForeign and Commonwealth Affairs, Mr Hattersley, had made itclear to the Norwegian Foreign Minister, Mr Frydenlund, that several features of the Norwegian draft were unsatisfactory to us, andwe would stand on this position until it was seen whether there wouldbe an Icelandic response-.    The matter was likely to be discussed atthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation Council meeting beginning on20 May: but the British case was unlikely to get much support there,especially following approval of the United States Bill to extend theirfisheries limits to 200 miles from 1 March 1977.    The situation on the fishing grounds off Iceland was not very satisfactory: the trawlerswere making poor eatches.    The Ministerial group had decided topermit the trawlers to fish outside a line 15 miles instead of 20 miles off the Icelandic coast, except where there were conservation ares which we were continuing to respect.    Ministers had however not been
able to agree on whether two Designated Fishing Areas (DFAs) shouldbe established under naval protection instead of on n.    The Ministerof Agriculture, Fisheries and Food had favoured this, but theSecretary of State for Defence had seen operational difficulties.    TheMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland would be seeing industry representatives the following week and if the industry then pressed for two DFAs despite thedifficulties this would entail in respect of protection, she would haveto ask for the matter to be considered by the Defence and overseas policy Committee.The Cabinet -2.        Took note of the statement by the Secretaryof State for Prices and Consumer Protection and paymaster General,
3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretaryof State for Social Services (CP(76) 2 and 3) on the Child Benefit(CB) rate and on transitional arrangements for non-residentchildren, and Notes by the Secretary of State for Social Servicesand the Chief Secretary, Treasury (CP(76) 4) and by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP(76) 5) to which were annexedrespectively a factual paper by officials and a memorandum bythe Chief Secretary, Treasury, on the Child Benefit rate.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL, SERVICES said thathe foresaw great political difficulty for the Government if the CBrate, to be introduced in April 1977, did not at the leastmaintain the real level of support for families which had obtainedwhen the Government came into office in 1974.    He was aware ofthe serious public expenditure implications of his proposal for therate, when coupled with the recommendation of the Social services committee to arrange a transitional period for Child tax allowances (CTAs) for non-resident children at an initial cost tothe contingency reserve of  45 million.    He was in full sympathy with this recommendation but had no doubt that the main prioritywas to settle a satisfactory starting rate for CB.    This meantfixing a rate which would take account of prospective increases inthe cost of living, including the rise in school meal charges andthe consequences of phasing out food subsidies, since for operational reasons the rate, once fixed, could not be altereduntil the autumn of 1977.    A rate which did not maintain the reallevel of support would increase the difficulty of negotiating asatisfactory pay policy with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) andwould be likely to harden their resistance to the phasing out offood subsidies.    The rate proposed by the Chief Secretary,Treasury would cut the real level of support in 1977 for mosttwo-parent families while giving a premium to large and one-parent families.    The premium classes of family would not correlatewith poor families as a whole, and the administration of the premium would be wasteful of manpower and could well lead to serious Industrial trouble with departmental staff at a time whenstrenuous efforts were being made to reduce manpower levels.He strongly recommended therefore that the rate should be a flat rate and that it should be fixed at a level of not less than 2. 70 which would aliow some margin for cost of living increasesbut still fall well short of the rate of support enjoyed by a three-child family under the Conservative Government in 1971.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the question was how best to use the very limited resources which were available.The memorandum (CP(76) 6) which the Cabinet were to considernext was very relevant to this.    The advantage of a premium wasthat it directed resources, on a selective basis, to where theywere most needed.    There was nothing novel in the idea of a5
premium: it had been introduced before for Family Allowances.Although its administration would involve extra staff costs, these would be insignificant- compared with the cost of a flat rate which made every family better off.   A rate of  2, 70, as proposed by theSecretary of State for Social Services, would involve a claim of 141 million on the contingency reserve and, if combined with the concession to non-resident children,  185 million.    He was strongly opposed to the concession to non-resident children: theGovernment had made no commitment to introduce it; it wasimpossible to check the widespread abuse of CTAs for non-residentchildren: and the cost of a transitional scheme would beinordinately high.    In considering the appropriate level for CBrate, it was wrong to make comparisons with the level of supportunder the Conservative Government without taking account of thepresent Governments measures to increase family allowances -the first increase for 7 years - and CTAs.    Moreover the CBscheme itself offered considerable attractions in providing for firstchildren and in transferring the value of the benefit of CTAs fromhusbands to wives.    A rate of  2.45, with a 50p premium for children of one-parent and large families, would make all familiesbetter off than at present.    He therefore urged the Cabinet not togo beyond thiB, although he would be prepared to accept a rate of 2. 50 plus premium if the concession for non-resident childrenwere dropped.^&quot;&quot;Resident In discussion of transitional arrangements for non-resident^Uiren children there was considerable support for the recommendation by the Social Services Committee that CTAs should be continued fora transitional period in respect of non-resident children.    Theissue was a difficult one and the concession could create anomaliesand a degree of resentment, for example in the comparison of wagepackets for the same job or if it were to be decided that the parentsof students not on awards should receive no compensation for theloss of CTAs.    But without such a concession the parents of non-resident children would be left substantially worse off, in contrast to what was intended for the public as a whole.    This would be strongly resented by the Asians who were the community mainly concerned and least able to suffer the disadvantage, and would belikely to arouse strong opposition in Parliament.    Although manyfraudulent claims were undoubtedly made, it would be wrong topenalise the Asian community at large on this account.    moreover the withdrawal of CTAs, without a transitional period, might wellincrease the pressures for immigrant children to be brought intothe country (not only from Asia but also from the Irish Republic)in greater numbers than the present machinery or the provision of schools and other services could cater for.    For me same reasona transitional period limited to two years would be likely to createstrong pressures for early entry; and estimates of the numbers involved ranged from 100, 000 to as many as 200, 003.6
In discussion of the rate, it was suggested that the Cabinetneeded to consider carefully how the introduction of the CBscheme, with the innovations which it provided for in respectof first children and the transfer of resources from husbandsto wives, could best serve the Government&apos;s present overallobjectives.    A major reform of this kind did not need to bejustified by reference to equivalence with what preceded it; onthe other hand, it was important that the implications ofparticular rates should be more clearly seen and weighed.In particular, it would be desirable to know what effectparticular rates would have on the eligibility of poorer familiesfor means-tested benefits, including free school meals and rent and rates rebates.    There would be little point in adopting separately which involved taking back with one hand what was givenwith the other. A major problem confronting theGovernment was the claims on the contingency reserve.    Asubstantial part of the reserve for 1977-78, a year ahead, was already committed; and it had to be recognised that any commit-ment entered into now could well be at the expense ofsome other desirable project later on.    If a CB rate whichwas politically acceptable could not be settled without making an excessive claim on the contingency reserve at the present time,there might be a case for deferring the introduction of the newCB scheme.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet recognised the major importance of arriving at asatisfactory conclusion on the complex issues which had been presented to them and agreed that further time was required to study these issues.    They were strongly inclined to accept therecommendation for a transitional period of CTAs for non-resident children and the public expenditure implications of thiswould be a  actor in their further consideration of a CB rate.    Inthe meantime, however, the Secretary of State for Social Servicesand the Chief Secretary, Treasury, should obtain furtherinformation on the effect of possible rates on eligibility formeans-tested benefits and, if necessary, circulate a short paper on the questions which had been raised about this in discussion.The Cabinet would resume their discussion at their next meeting.The Cabinet -1. Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.2.      Invited the Secretary of State for social services and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, toproceed accordingly.7Child BenefitHate,
4.        The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP(76) 6) to which was attached a report bythe Chief Secretary on the claims which were being made onthe contingency reserve.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, while thereport did not justify the view that public expenditure was out ofcontrol, the question of whether or.not it remained under control would depend crucially on the Cabinet&apos;b response to the situationnow revealed.    The main reason for the present weakness of sterling, apart from the uncertainty over a further agreement on payrestraint with the Trades Union Congress (TUC), was the high levelof the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR), which at  12, 000 million in the current financial year was   1, 500 million more than the previous year and  3, 500 million more than in 1974-75No other country had a comparable imbalance between its publicrevenue and expenditure, and it was essential that the PSBRshould not increase if overseas confidence was to be maintained.The plan embodied in the recent Public Expenditure White Paper(Cmnd 6393) assumed that expenditure in 1977-78 should be atroughly the same level as in 1976-77, so that the increase in revenue during 1977-78 would bring about a reduction in the PSBR.There was a serious danger that foreign confidence would collapseif the Government allowed the public expenditure limits whichthey had set themselves to be exceeded; and in mis connection itwas relevant that they had undertaken to provide quarterly reports on the progress of public expenditure plans to the House ofCommons Select Committee on Expenditure.    All of this meant that the Cabinet must resist to the maximum possible extent any additional claims on the contingency reserve, and where claimshad to be admitted offsetting savings must be found.    It mightwell be mat, in the negotiations with the TUC over pay, theGovernment would have to concede something on such relatedissues as unemployment, prices and social benefits which would increase expenditure: when these were announced it would be essential to be able to point to offsetting savings elsewhere.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that of the 1976-77contingency reserve only some  92- 142 million was left not subject to firm or agreed bids - and less than one month of theyear had gone.    If all the other claims on the reserve were accepted, then public expenditure would be out of control.    Hesuggested that it would be easier to resist the new claims than tofind offsetting savings.    In paragraph 12 of his report he had putforward a Beries of proposals, none of which (apart from thatrelating to child benefit, which had been discussed earlier in the meeting) asked the responsible Ministers to do more thango back and examine ways of reducing to a minimum, or improvingcontrol over, planned expenditure.8
In discussion it was suggested that the way in which the figures were presented was unhelpful, since claims arising from longterm policies were not distinguished from those arising from the deliberate adoption of short term counter-cyclical measures.Against this it was pointed out that, when the Government were considering how they should keep within their own statedexpenditure limits, the purpose and origin of the spending was of no consequence since the expenditure still had to be scoredand would contribute towards the FSBR.    A further difficulty was that where a particular expenditure proposal gave rise tosome partially offsetting savings (egt   by reducing expenditureon unemployment benefit) those savings were not taken intoaccount in  registering the charge against the contingency reserve.    It was recognised that there were difficult problems in presenting public expenditure figures satisfactorily, but itwas pointed out that for child benefit a considerablemethodological advance had been made in deciding to treat thecost for public expenditure purposes as net of the savings whichwould arise from the abolition of child tax allowances.    public expenditure figures alone could never tell a complete story whensocial policies were being pursued through the tax system.    Theproblem of attaining a satisfactory presentation was under study,but was sensible of no simple solution.On housing expenditure, it was pointed out that, because present government policy was that housebuilding by local authoritiesshould be subject to no restraint, the public expenditure commit-ment was open-ended.    At present it was forecast that thiswould lead to an additional claim on the contingency reserve inthe current financial year of  200 million, and although it wouldbe difficult, consideration should be given to offsetting this,possibly by reductions in expenditure on municipalisation and localauthority lending.    Furthermore, in view of the threat such apolicy represented to spending plans in later years, an urgentstudy should be put in hand to consider ways in which house-building in the public sector might be brought under control.The possibilities had yet to be discussed by the interested departments and Ministers would need time to consider such achange of policy.    It was noted that, having recently announcedan increase in expenditure on house improvements by localauthorities in order to assist the construction industry, it would look wholly inconsistent to cut expenditure on municipalisationand local authority lending.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe position presented in the Chief Secretary&apos;s report was aserious one, and it demonstrated how necessary it was for cabinet to have regular reports of this kind.    With most of the1976-77 contingency reoerve subject to firm commitment or firm9
bids, and with nearly one-third of the 1977-78 Reserve alreadyfirmly committed, the Governments published plans were clearly coming under severe pressure; but he thought that all ministers recognised and- accepted the need for keepingexpenditure within the published totals which the Government had accepted.    There were presentational difficulties about public expenditure figures, and no-one would wish to use figures whichwere misleading; but, while those concerned would no doubtcontinue to study ways of improving the presentation, theproblems before the Cabinet would not yield simply to changesin presentation: their solution required an approach along thelines proposed in the Chief Secretary^ report.    No immediatedecisions should be taken at the present meeting.    ministers would need time to reflect upon the position, and upon theproposals which had been made, in consultation with the chief secretary as necessary, against the background of theircollective responsibility for constraining additional claims furexpenditure to what could be accommodated within the contingency reserve.    The Cabinet would then consider the Chief Secretary Sproposals again at a further meeting.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office29 April 197610
