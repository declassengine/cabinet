HAMENTARY  1, The Cabinet were Informed of the business to be taken In the**RS House of Commons during the following week.ieand88fence:7thaions,1THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the situationwhich had arisen In Parliament on the Aircraft and shipbuilding industries Bill was disruptive of the Government&apos;s business, andespecially of the work of Ministers,    When it had become known thatthe Speaker would rule that this Bill was prime facie hybrid a quickdecision had been needed on what action to take in an unprecedentedsituation, but he doubted whether any different line of action wouldhave avoided the difficulties which had subsequently arisen.    The aimnow must be to restore the operation of the usual channels as soon aspossible.    There was a considerable number of Government Billsstill to be completed in the House of Commons, and a large number ofOrders requiring Affirmative Resolutions which were needed by the summer Recess.   Even if the Opposition resumed co-operation theywould remain able to hold up Government business, as they had done the previous day on the Report Stage of the Education Bill, and sometimetable Motions seemed likely to be necessary, at least on theAircraft and Shipbuilding Industries, Doek Work Regulation and education Bills,    It would have to be made clear to the Opposition inany discussions on the resumption of co-operation that timetableMotions might nevertheless be required unless there were under-takings to get the remaining controversial Bills through the House ofCommons in sufficient time.    He hoped that the present difficulties would ease before too long but thought it right to warn the Cabinet thatthey might persist for a considerable time.In discussion it was pointed out that two separate sources of difficulty had arisen on the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill, thequestion of hybrldlty and the allegations relating to the second divisionon 27 May.    ft was proposed to amend the Bill at the Report Stage toremove any element of hybrid!ty; and It was thought that the Speakerwould then be prepared to give a certificate that the Bill was not hybrid,and that the House of Lords would be unlikely to challenge such acertificate although they might well seek to delay the Bill.    Thesecond source of difficulty would remain, and it was clear that. If theusual channels were not operating normally in the House of Commons,there was no hope of obtaining the co-operation from the Opposition inthe House of Lords which would be essential if there were to be any chance of completing the Government^ legislative business by the endof the Session,   ft was suggested that in this situation some concession to the Opposition would have to be considered to induce themto resume co-operation.   Agreement by the Government to treat theAircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill as hybrid would have the desired effect, but the delay to the Bill involved in this and the
possibility- of wrecking amendments being made would have a serious effect on the shipbuilding industry, which was In grave difficulty, andwould be badly received by the Government&apos;s supporters.    other possibilities put forward were to have a further vote on theGovernment Motion which had been carried by one vote on 27 May -though it was suggested that this would amount to an admission thatthe vote on 27 May had not been valid; or to take the Report Stage ofthe Bill under the Government Motion relating to the Standing Ordersbut to allow normal Standing Orders to apply on Third Reading and obtain a further vote on the hybridity question then; or to withdraw the Bill and reintroduce It immediately in a non-hybrid form and take it through under a timetable Motion; or to split the Bill and dealseparately with the aircraft and shipbuilding Industries - though itwas suggested that mis would be the worst of all worlds.In further discussion it was suggested that, especially following theprevious day&apos;s unsuccessful Motion of Censure, the Opposition wouldcool down, and doubts were expressed whether they would maintainnon-co-operation for very long.   But there could be no certaintyabout this, and a number of suggestions were made for encouraging a resumption of normal relations.   On pairing, the first step might beto seek Opposition agreement to pairs for Ministers absent on important official engagements, eg representing the country overseasor on duty In Northern Ireland.   The damage to the conduct of thenation&apos;e business caused by refusal of pairs to Ministers would beregarded as more important by the general public than delays toGovernment legislation.    Direct pairing arrangements between back-benchers might be encouraged on business which In normal circuxn-stances would attract only a two-line Whip.    The suggestion thatproxy voting should be allowed for Ministers on official businessoverseas, or should be adopted more widely, might encourage theOpposition to return to normality.   An offer might be made to theOpposition to examine the whole question of hybridity, on which theexisting rules were arguably out of date, and to seek with them moreorderly arrangements on pairing, and for ensuring that once thebusiness for the coming week had been agreed that business would go through.    It might also be made known to the Opposition that theGovernment had In mind the possibility of running together the present session and the coming Session.   It would, however, be necessary,before making overtures on procedural points of this kind, for theGovernment Itself to have properly worked out proposals.    On the allegations relating to the second vote on 27 May, it might bepossible eventually to arrange for a joint statement by the two ChiefWhips on the lines that they had gone into the whole affair and that,while there might have been misunderstandings, there had been no bad faith.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the leader of the House and the Chief Whip had the full support of thewhole Cabinet in dealing with the difficulties which arose from theGovernment&apos;s minority position.    It was important to emphasise thatthe Government had done nothing of which to be ashamed.    TheCabinet had reached no conclusions, but had had a helpful discussionof the general situation, and a number of useful suggestions had beenmade.    He was himself uneasy at the prospect of a number of time-table Motions, which would not create a favourable public Impression,All the suggestions made, and any other means of resolving theproblems relating to the hybrldity of the Aircraft and shipbuilding industries Bill and to the second vote on 27 May, should be further explored, and the Cabinet would resume their discussion of theParliamentary situation the following week.The Cabinet -L        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister &apos;* summing up of their discussion, and invited the Lord President of the Council toproceed accordingly.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE saidthat last November he had approved a plan for reorganisation oncomprehensive lines submitted by the previous Tame side LocalEducation Authority (LEA), to take effect from September 1976, andthe Authority had taken steps to implement this plan before the conservatives had gained control of the Council at last month&apos;eelections.    The new LEA were now planning new arrangements forselecting children for secondary education next September, on thebasis of parental choice and teacher guidance, and representatives ofthe LEA had seen him the previous day.   In view of the disruptiveeffect which this late change in plan would have he had in mind to use his power under Section 68 of the Education Act 1944 to direct theLEA to implement the plan of the previous Authority which he had approved last year.    The Attorney General had been fully consulted about this proposal.    It would be desirable to inform the LEA,Parliament and the Press of this before the weekend, if possiblethat afternoon, since the following day was the last day for parents toexpress their new preferences, and the reallocatlon of children by theLEA might start immediately thereafter.In discussion it was pointed out that an announcement of this kind that afternoon might have a provocative effect on the Opposition,which should be avoided if possible.    The use of the power underSection 68 of the 1944 Act had given rise to difficulties In the past,
and although the LEA were not expected to refuse to comply with theenvisaged direction, there might well be criticism of the Government,Accordingly careful consideration was needed before deciding to use the power in the present case.   It was only the previous day that representatives of the LEA had seen the Secretary of State for education and Science, and it was reasonable that the Governmentshould take at least a few days to consider the position.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet themselves were not in a position to reach a conclusion on this issue without more information.   Accordingly the Secretary of Statefor Education and Science, with the Lord Chancellor, the Secretaryof State for the Environment, the Minister for overseas development, the Attorney General and the Chief Whip, should give further consideration to the action proposed by the Secretary of Statefor Education and Science: these Ministers had authority to decide thematter.    In the circumstances it would not be possible to inform theLEA or make any announcement that afternoon, and these steps wouldhave to wait until the next day or Monday 14 June.The Cabinet -2,        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of State for Education and science to proceed accordingly.l*^AteN 2.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said^URS tnat aa o^iclal from his Department was attending the trial of thel\oju mercenaries in Luanda as an observer.    He was being treated with reasonable courtesy but had not obtained access to much worthwhileinformation about the trial.    It was difficult to see what further action the Government could take.   There was no precedent for them to pay for defence lawyers for accused mercenaries: the American lawyersat the trial were being paid for out of private funds of one of theAmerican families concerned.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.4
3.        THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that in thepreceding week the exchange rate had been under serious attack andon Wednesday 2 June the rate had fallen by 4 cents.    He had, with theagreement of the Prime Minister, broadcast on television onWednesday evening in an attempt to reassure the market.   As aresult the rate had dropped by only l  cents on the Thursday and had risen slightly on the Friday.    He had resisted pressure to makeimmediate cuts in public expenditure and had, towards the end of theweek, begun to explore the possibility of activating swap arrangements with the United States and West Germany.    At this stage however theChairman of the Group of Ten, which consisted of the world&apos;8 richestcountries, had suggested a larger operation to support sterling.   Asa result a swap facility worth $5. 300 million, involving all countries inthe Group of Ten except Italy, plus Switzerland and the Bank for international Settlements, had been successfully arranged by Sundayevening.   As a result of his announcement of this facility on Monday afternoon, the rate had risen the following day by 2^ cents, and thenlater In the day by a further 1 cent following the result of the miners1ballot on the second round of the pay policy.    On Monday the rate hadbeen $1.80 in New York, and since then it had fluctuated at a littleabove $L, 77. &quot; Of the $2*, 000 million which had been made available by theUnited States, $1, 000 million came from the Federal Reserve Bank in new york and  $1,000 million from the United States Treasury, partly becausethe Federal Reserve Bank was under pressure from Congress not toarrange swaps too readily, and partly because in an election year theBank wished to share the responsibility with the United StatesGovernment,    The United States Secretary of the Treasury, Mr Simon,had been most helpful.    The standby credit was not a loan, but afacility which meant that the additional dollars could be put into theUnited Kingdom foreign exchange reserves whenever the government wished, but would attract no payment of interest unless spent, atwhich point the interest would be at the United States Treasury billrate, currently 5^ per cent.    The facility was available for threemonths, renewable for a further three months, and there were nostrings of any kind attached beyond an obligation, if at the end of theperiod the United Kingdom were unable otherwise to repay anydrawings, to go to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for afurther tranche of borrowing.    This meant that the Government neednot consider before mid-October whether they need approach the IMF.     iIn his view, if the United Kingdom drew any money under the facilityit should be possible at a later stage to recover this through themarket so that it could be repaid.    The standby credit had been madeavailable partly from a degree of self-interest on the part of the other   jcentral banks - particularly the Swiss, whose exchange rate was going     1uncomfortably high - and partly from their confidence in theGovernment&apos;8 economic policies.    In particular, the central banks hadbeen impressed by the Government&apos;s relations with the trade unions.The support which he confidently expected the Trades Union Congress(TUC) on 16 June to give to the latest pay agreement should push upthe rate further.
He appreciated that there was, in various quarters, concern over the size of the public sector borrowing requirement.    Although he had no intention of cutting public expenditure in the current year. ministers would need to consider the level of expenditure in future years whenthe report of the Public Expenditure Survey was available in July.   if some revision of their plans were needed, they would have toconsider whether these should be made through tax adjustments,public expenditure changes or other means.   Information on the causes of the recent pressure on the pound was still being collected,and he would be looking at ways of reducing such pressure, eg byoperating on the sterling holdings, whether through guarantees, orfunding, or the creation of a substitution account at the IMF.    on public expenditure, the 1976 Survey was in train and in the next week or two he expected to have in his hands the Medium-Term EconomicAssessment, which this year was being done In a radically different,and more realistic, way than previously.    The Short-term economic Forecast would not be available until early July, which meant that he would not be able to put forward material on theeconomic context in which public expenditure decisions would be needed until about mid-July.    In the meantime, it would be mostimportant to ensure that the public sector expenditure limits for1976-77 laid down in the White Paper of last February were notbroken, since, if they were, the Government would lose allcredibility.    The local authorities had already been told that theymust stick to their agreed target, and Ministers must ensure for their part that agreed claims on the contingency reserve - on which therewould shortly be a further paper to Cabinet - were similarlyrestrained.    He asked his colleagues to be particularly cautious inany public speeches they made relating to the economy, the exchange rate or to public expenditure, and to ensure that they cleared suchreferences with the Treasury in advance.In discussion the following points were made -a. The exchange rate had received an excessive coveragein the media In recent weeks, and Its importance had beengrossly over-emphasised by the British broadcasting corporation (BBC) in a way which helped to induce anunjustifiably nervous state in the foreign exchange market.If possible. It would be desirable to remind the BBC of its obligations to the country in these matters, although theGovernment had of course no control over the material whichthe BBC chose to broadcast.b. While the situation remained far from assured, june and July might well be helped by the announcement of goodfigures for the Increase In the Retail Price Index (RPI) which,partly because of the drop In potato prices, would fall to
13  per cent.    Difficulties might arise in the autumn when theindex would be less likely to fall.    If it were possible toarrange reassuring statements on, eg, the public sectorborrowing requirement.then, that might be helpful.    On theother hand, those operating in the foreign exchange marketalready appreciated correctly the importance of the public sector borrowing requirement.    They wanted to know that theGovernment were concerned about Its size and recognised the need to reduce it.    There could be political advantages in early action on next year&apos;s borrowing requirement before any possible recourse to the IMF In the autumn.c.        Although overseas opinion had taken some account of It,there had not yet been a full appreciation at home of the significance of the recently announced increase in the UnitedKingdom&apos;s recoverable reserves of gas and oil.    TheDepartment of Energy were endeavouring to produce moretelling monthly statistics which would point up the value ofthese assets, upon which emphasiB could also be laid at the energy Conference later in the month.    However, it was observed that foreign opinion had already taken full account ofthe value of the oil and gas reserves, and it was only for tillsreason that the country had obtained help on the scale whichhad recently been arranged.    The additional resource growthfrom North Sea oil and gas would be relatively small.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that,although the RPI figures for the next two months would be helpful, andthe outcome of the TUC meeting of 16 June could be expected to assistthe pound, he still felt that for the next six weekB the position would befragile.   For this reason he would himself resist regarding thestandby facility as a triumph.    It would take time to recover from thedifficulties of the last two or three weeks, and the Cabinet would need to keep their nerve.    It would be important to avoid a continuing slidein the exchange rate which compelled them to make panic cuts in public expenditure.    Such policy adjustments as might be neededshould be considered rationally and sensibly, and if it were possiblefor the Chancellor of the Exchequer to accelerate any proposals he contemplated putting forward this would be desirable.    The countrystill had a difficult 18 month s to two years ahead of It, and he felt sure that the Labour Party would understand and accept this If the truthwere put frankly.   He underlined how important it was that all ministers should comply with the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;request to clear with the Treasury in advance any speeches they might make touching on the economy.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the  Prime Mlnister&apos;summing up of their discussion.
4.        The Cabinet had before them a minute, dated 28 May, from theHome Secretary to the Prime Minister, to which was attached the text of a discussion document on human rights.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Cabinet, on 25 March, in the context of a threatened Motion by Lord Hailsham to refer to a SelectCommittee Lord Wade&apos;s Bill of Rights Bill, agreed to the publicationof a discussion document on human rights based on the report of an interdepartmental working group which was already available.    the text of the proposed discussion document had been fully consideredby the Home Affairs Committee which had agreed that, subject to asmall number of amendments which would appear in the final versionnow being printed, it was suitable for publication.    The document was neutral in tone and neither entered into any commitments norfavoured any particular solution,    &amp; would, in his view, make a useful contribution to calm and informed debate of the issues involved.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that public interest in legislation toprotect human rights had been stimulated by the publication of a labour Party discussion paper on human rights and by Lord JusticeScarmants advocacy of a Bill of Rights.    He did not believe that lord Justice Scarman&apos;s views were representative of judicial opinionnor were they of his own since he took the view that human rights were already better protected in the United Kingdom than anywhere else and thatit would be wrong to transfer Parliamentary responsibility for their pro-tection to the courts.    Nevertheless he agreed that publication of a discussion document in the neutral terms proposed would serve a valuablepurpose provided that the document was published merely to assistdiscussion and not for the purposes of consultation which might lead to decisions.In discussion, the view was strongly expressed that changes of thekind analysed In the document would be highly undesirable and make no contribution to the creation of a more just society.    The changeshad constitutional implications of a revolutionary character: theyimplied a written constitution which might or might not be entrenchedbut which would entrust to the courts decisions which wereessentially the prerogative of Parliament.    Chapter 3 of the documentillustrated the range of sensitive issues on which the courts might haveto pronounce; even without domestic legislation, there was already apossibility that judgments of the European Court of Justice on casesbrought under the Convention on Human Rights might undesirablyrestrict Parliamentary sovereignty.    On the other hand, it was argued that no-one in the United Kingdom could afford to take acomplacent view of the adequacy of the existing protection of human rights.    It was a very live issue in Northern Ireland where theStanding Advisory Commission on Human Rights was engaged in a study of the adequacy of existing legislation and where there were strong grounds for making some change; and, although the special
circumstances of Northern Ireland&apos;should not be allowed to influenceconstitutional decisions elsewhere, a number of minority and under-privileged groups in the United Kingdom as a whole did not see their rights as being adequately protected by Parliament.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that giventhe commitment, which had been made in both Houses of Parliament,topuhUnh a discussion document on human rights, the Cabinet agreedthat the text circulated by the Home Secretary, subject to the amendments which the Home Affairs Committee had approved andwhich would be incorporated in the printed version, was sufficientlyneutral in tone and was suitable for early publication.    the presentation of the document should be in a low key and should implyno policy commitment or intention on the part of the Government totake decisions.    On this basis it would be open to Ministers toexpress their individual views in any public debate of the majorconstitutional issues raised in the document.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and Invited the HomeSecretary to arrange accordingly for early publication of the discussion document.Cabinet Office10 June 19769
