I, The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the week beginning U October,In discussion it was pointed out that British interests could bedamaged by the fact that, owing to the exigencies of parliamentary business and the difficulties over pairing, it was not always possibleto maintain continuity of Ministerial representation at meetings ofCouncils of the European Economic Community (e.c.),    There mightbe particular difficulty during the British Presidency of the e.c., whenBritish Ministers would be unable to leave e.c. meetings at whichthey were in the chair, whatever the Parliamentary situation.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that anattempt was being made to reach a comprehensive agreement on thesematters with the Opposition, which would cover the absences ofMinisters on Government business and of Members too ill to attend theHouse,    The Select Committee set up to review the practice and procedure of the House had started work, but would not reach any conclusions in time for next Session.    Before any Minister gave evidence to the Select Committee, it would be necessary for ministers collectively to consider what views the Government should express tothe Committee.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion.1
pairs8*odafence;Zlatle22,        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY Bald thatwe had no conclusive information about the treatment of the two british subjects, Mr Clegg and Mr TuUy, arrested in Uganda.    Whatwas clear was that their arrest had taken place on the day before ourbreach of diplomatic relations with Uganda and that one of the two british subjects Involved had shown serious lack of judgment inreturning that day to Uganda from Kenya, despite the high commission^ warnings to British subjects.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatconsular access was being obtained to the pregnant British womanMrs Rabkin, detained in South Africa under the Terrorism Act.    *Official representations had been made on her behalf.The Cabinet -L Took note of the statements by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he wished the Cabinet to know thatduring the ReceBs we Bhould be carrying out an underground nucleardevice test on the American test site in Nevada.    There would be no public announcement, but the Secretary of State for Defence planned toissue a short statement immediately after the test had taken place.   In1974 there had been some criticism of the fact that a British nucleartest had been carried out without prior information to the Cabinet.Subsequently It had of course been decided in the Defence Review thatour nuclear deterrent should be retained, and this further test was needed to maintain its effectiveness.    It was over two years since aBritish test had been conducted, in contrast to the very frequenttesting of nuclear devices by the United States and the Soviet Union.They were however testing new techniques for a new generation of weapons, whereas we had made no decision to embark on nuclear weapons of a new generation.    The test now planned was to improve the effectiveness of our existing system.The Cabinet -2.        Took note.
PUBUCEXPENDITUREFollow Up to recent DecisionsPreviousReference;CM(76) 20thConclusion a.Minute 33.        THE PRIME MINISTER Bald that during the seven Cabinetmeetings on public expenditure reductions in 1977-78 a number ofIdeas were put forward by Ministers on which it was not possible totake immediate decisions but which it was felt ought to be followed up in an orderly way.    These were:-I. To provide assistance to poorer energy producers.ii. To consider new ways of funding our short termoverseas debt.iii. To change the presentation of the Public SectorBorrowing Requirement by excluding mo borrowingon account of the nationalised industries.iv. To consider reducing our presence in Cyprus,v. To consider legislation to cut housing subsidies atthe same time as reducing tax relief on mortgage interest.vi. To channel more industrial support through theNational Enterprise Board,vii. To look at the cost to the public sector of educatingchildren in the private sector,viii. To get a firmer grip on local authority manpower,ix. To get on preparing the public expenditure figuresfor 1978-79 and subsequent years, with a view to Cabinetconsidering them after the Recess.The first of these had already been settled, and he knew that anumber of the others were already under active consideration.    he wished his colleagues to know however mat he had now been throughthe full list to decide how best they could be handled and mat theSecretary of the Cabinet would be getting in touch with theDepartments concerned.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthere was general agreement that those matters, which had not been settled should now be followed up.    It had also been suggested that,while mere could be no question of interfering with the productionof the regular statistical Indices to suit the Governmentsconvenience, more attention might be paid to producing additionalstatistics which would present the Governments policies favourablyin an international context.    To some extent the remedy lay with
Departments since the statistical service was decentralised to themHe would however consider whether there were any further steps which could usefully be taken from the centre.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of thePrime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.-gencya*rve76-77ouse*ence:21stons.lueie 4The Cabinet considered a note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(CP(76) 64) to which was attached a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury, on the state of the contingency reserve.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that his memorandumrevealed the serious pressure on the contingency reserve for 1976-77.Already approved claims absorbed  411 million of the total provisionof  825 million.   He recommended that Cabinet should also approve 74 million for the excess expenditure on the English housing programme.    This excess, now estimated at  208 million, arose oncouncil bouse building and on bousing subsidies which were open-ended programmes.    The Secretary of State for the Environment had agreed to make other reductions accounting for all but the  74 million of the excess and it was this balance which he now recommended should be a charge on the reserve.    Deduction of thisprovision and also of  3 million for three small Items on other programmes which he also recommended for acceptance left a balanceof  337 million for dealing with all further claims.    From thisbalance would need to be found any provision for overspend on other local authority expenditure which the Cabinet would be discussingnext, a wide variety of other claims totalling 280 million, and the cost of the Job creation programme which was tobe announced that day.    In total these claims greatly exceeded the outstanding balance of the reserve.   He did not ask the Cabinet to takepositive action at present: they should however take note of the limited resources available in the reserve for further commitments,take account of this in their decisions on any specific proposalsrequiring immediate decision and consider very carefully thepossibility of absorbing or offsetting the claims annexed to his memorandum.    He also wished to draw attention to the fact that the contingency reserve for 1977-78 was only  700 million, out of which provision was already required for the job provision programme to be announced that day.
The Cabinet -2,        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of this part of their discussion and invited all Ministers to be guided accordingly.localAuthorityExpenditurePrevious^eforence:ZlJtUlb) 6thConclusions,Minute 3.The Cabinet then considered a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Environment (CP(76) 65) setting out proposals for dealing withexpected excess local authority current expenditure.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that atthe beginning of the financial year his Department had discovered,from returns from local authorities, that the total of their expenditure was likely to exceed the provision In Cmnd 6393 by 350- 45Q million.    Following discussion in the Cabinet on 20 May hehad asked the authorities to produce revised estimates by 16 July,This further return had shown a reduction in the estimated overspendto  250 million,    m the time available before his next meeting withthe Local Authority Associations he had not been able to agree with hiscolleagues or to consult the Cabinet on proposals for dealing with thewhole - of this overspend.   His colleagues had, however, agreed matthere could be no departure from the Cmnd 6393 figures for 1976-77IIn discussion it was pointed out that when reductions in public expenditure were required these normally fell with disproportionateeffect on capital programmes.   It was also argued that the need for reductions often arose because proposals for additional expenditure were approved individually without full regard for priorities.Attention was also drawn to the fact that, although It was clearly laiddown that all new proposals should include an estimate of their man-power consequences inadequate consideration was sometimes given tothese estimates,    ft was, however, pointed out that the large majority of the outstanding claims against the reserve were the consequence of decisions taken some time previously.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the paper showed the value of the new procedures which theCabinet had adopted for the regular monitoring of claims against the contingency reserve and also illustrated the way In which expenditurehad risen above budgets In previous years.    The Cabinet noted the excess of claims over the balance of contingency reserve and invitedall Ministers responsible for claims listed in the annex to CP(76) 64to consider carefully whether they could absorb or offset the amountswithin their existing budgets.
and 1977-78 taken together, and that any overspend In the first year would have to be made up for by an appropriate cut In the second ye*r.This action In itself would Involve the most painful contraction in thehistory of local government.    B: would, for the first time, reverse along-term upward trend in the local authorities1 real expenditure.   Inthe five years ending with the current financial year this expenditurehad risen by 8, 9, 10, 5 and Z\ per cent respectively.    In 1977-78 itwould fall by z\ per cent,       was his view, however, that a greaterreduction in the overspend should be achieved in the current year.    Hehad asked the Associations to consider what action they would take andhad warned them that he would announce his response within seven toten days.    It was likely that as a consequence of this warning theauthorities would reduce capital expenditure by some  30* 40 million.The only option remaining to the Government to bring about a further reduction was to cut back the Rate Support Grant Increase Order due tobe made in the autumn.    This was budgeted at  480 million and he proposed that this figure should be reduced by up to  50 million.    this action would send a shock wave throughout local government and woulddemonstrate very clearly the Governments determination to keep theexperditure within the provision which had been previously agreed.He did not think that it would be possible to make any largerreduction in the Order without destroying co-operation between localauthorities and central Government,   He had to emphasise that therewas no overspend whatever in central Government finance to localauthorities:&apos; the overspend was in the total of local authority expenditure, which was not subject to direct control by the centralGovernment.    It was possible to do no more than to cajole and toencourage.   It was likely that the action which he proposed on theIncrease Order would be presented as a breach of the Governmentundertaking: he felt that this would not lead to a breakdown inco-operation but any more severe action was likely to be counter-productive.In discussion it was argued that it would be unwise to make any reduction in the Increase Order.    The decisions already taken inrelation to 1977-78 were very stern in that they both maintained thedecision that there should be no growth and also required the current year overspend to be cut back.    There was a danger that the Bevereconsequences which this would have for local authorities had beenunderestimated, and the Government would be lucky to escape withoutsevere political problems.    The figure of  50 million which had been proposed was arbitrary and punitive.   It would fall indiscriminately on those authorities which had observed the Governments requirements and those which had not, and would open the Government to charge s ofdefaulting on its promises.    There was all the difference in the worldbetween making clear that the Governments future actions would betough and falling to live up to agreements previously reached.    On the
other hand it was argued that the local authorities were in no positionto complain because they themselves were not achieving the agreedstandstill in expenditure.    There was a danger of very seriousoverseas reaction if it were made public that the local authorities wereoverspending by as much as  250 million and the Government was not taking action to offset more than  100 million of this.   Account also had to be taken of the additional overspend in Scotland.    The more that was done to cut back the overspend in 1976-77 the less difficultit would be to meet the very stem requirements which had been imposed for 1977-78.    It was also likely that a reduction in the order would spur authorities to achieve further economies in their expenditure.    On all these counts it would be better to reduce theIncrease Order by  100 million for England and Wales and to takeparallel action in relation to Scotland.    It was not possible to predictwith any certainty the extent to which a cut in the Order would lead toa need for supplementary rates.    The reserves and balances of individual authorities were not known but in total they amounted tosome hundreds of millions of pounds.hi further discussion it was pointed out that there was no way in whichthe Government could discriminate between authorities in thecurrent financial year.   Further consideration could be given to thepossibility of ,     discrimination being introduced in the following year but this would give rise to very considerable problems.    It wasnot at present possible to identify which authorities were adhering tothe Government guideline because there was no knowledge of the siseof the burdens different authorities bore in particular sectors.   ,Ifdiscrimination were to be introduced it would impose a very largestaff burden.    It was also argued that careful consideration should begiven before the next financial year to the resources element in theformula for the calculation of Rate Support Grants.   Its effect was toensure that authorities which overspent In one year secured a largeshare of the amount available for grant in the following year.The point was also made that a cut in the Increase Order of  50 million was likely to cause a loss of 18 -20,000 jobs.    It was unlikely however that there would be any redundancies Eince this reduction could beachieved by natural wastage and stopping recruitment.   It was notcorrect to argue that the burden of reducing expenditure would be metwholly by cuts in capital programmes since the local authorities hadalready achieved considerable reductions in administrative coste.In further discussion it was argued that even if the argument pointed toa reduction in the Increase Order it would be Inadvisable to announce this at present.    The figures were as yet uncertain and there was no need to make an announcement until the Order itself was published inthe late autumn.    Local government, with the trade unions, was one
of the main areas of support for the Government and it would be veryfoolish to alienate support at a time when the future of the incomes policy had been made less certain by the recent expenditure cuts.On the other hand it was argued strongly that a commitment hadalready been given to announce the Government&apos;s response in the very near future, and that without a statement on the Increase Order thisresponse would appear very weak.    If reduction had to be made in expenditure in the current year it was far better for local authoritiesto know the position at the earliest possible moment.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that it was necessary to act to cut back the prospective oversperding by local authorities in the current financialyear.    The balance of opinion was that the target should be to reducethe overspend by  100 million on the basis that the remainder wouldbe offset by reductions in the following financial year.    Of this totalup to  50 million should be achieved by a reduction in the rate support Grant Increase Order, though the Secretary of State for the environment should have discretion to settle on a lower figure if hewas satisfied that he could nevertheless achieve the target saving of 100 million.    The balance of advantage appeared to lie withannouncing the Governments decision at the earliest possible moment.The Cabinet were in agreement that there was no possibility in thecurrent year of discriminating between one local authority andanother but they wished to give further consideration to the possibilityof such discrimination being introduced in subsequent years.    TheCabinet had noted that parallel action in Scotland could give rise tovery serious political difficulties but on balance they did not feel it possible to justify refraining from taking parallel action there.    TheSecretary of State for Scotland should therefore proceed accordingly,though he would of course be free to report back if unmanageabledifficulties arose.    Care would be needed in presenting these decisions to the Governments traditional supporters in localgovernment and he would himself consider whether he might make a speech putting the Governments policies in perspective.The Cabinet -3.        Took note, with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.4,        Agreed that action should be taken to try tosecure a reduction of  100 million in the prospectiveoverspend by local authorities in England and wales in 1976-77 and that the balance of the overspending bythe authorities should be offset by savings in 1977-78,
5.        Agreed that the 1976 Rate Support GrantIncrease Order In England and Wales should bereduced by up to  50 million but that the Secretaryof State  or the Environment should have discretion to substitute a lower figure so long as he was satisfied that this was compatible with conclusion 4.6.        Agreed that parallel action should be takenin respect of Scotland,7.       Invited the Secretary of State for the environment. In consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, to bring before the Cabinet in good time before decisions were needed on theRate Support Grant for 1977-78 a paper setting outthe issues which would be involved in discriminatingbetween local authorities in the calculation of rate support Grants.NT   4,        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Education and Science and the Secretary of State for Wales(CP(76) 66) containing proposals for the introduction of educationalmaintenance allowances.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE saidthat he and the Secretary of State for Wales proposed the introduction in England and Wales of a scheme of educational maintenanceallowances broadly resembling the existing Scottish scheme.Allowances would be awarded by local education authorities on a discretionary basis, as at present, to enable boys and girls over 16 toremain at school or In full-time education, but In accordance withnationally prescribed scales and methods of assessment of parentalincome.     This was one of the most cost-effective measures whichcould be taken to deal with the problem of children, especially frompoorer families, who left school at 16 although they had no jobprospects because only in that way could they qualify for social security benefits.    The scheme might result in an additional 21,000children staying on in education, at a cost of  14 million In a full year, but with offsetting savings on supplementary benefits.   Noextra resources of staff or buildings would be required.    The schemewhich would be welcomed by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and theParty, could&quot; be justified as part of the package of measures to dealwith unemployment among young people being announced that after-noon, and it w*D entirely In tune with the Governments general
approach that children should be able to stay on in educationregardless of means.    Once introduced the scheme would probably have to be retained, but the problems of unemployed school-leaverswere likely to persist.    Ninety per cent of the cost would be met bythe central Government, and this would require an amendment ofthis Session&apos;s Education Bill in the House of Lords, to provide thenecessary powers, and an amendment of the financial resolution whenthe BUI returned to the Commons,    The scheme could then come intooperation from the school-leaving date next Easter,In discussion it was argued that this would be a permanent and open-ended addition to public expenditure, which would involve payingallowances to some 55, 000 children who already stayed on at schoolin order to enable a much smaller number of other children to stay on.The scheme would conflict with the Governments current stance on.public expenditure.    Many Departments which had just sufferedpainful expenditure cuts would have leapt at the chance of an additional 14 million, and the recent public expenditure decisions should not now be reopened.    The proposal would be inconsistent with what theGovernme nt had been saying about the current expenditure of localauthorities, who would have to find 10 per cent of the cost and administer the scheme, and who were about to be told of a 50 million reduction in this yearS Rate Support Grant IncreaseOrder.    The scheme was not sufficiently important to justify theintroduction of a new specific grant, which would create demands forother new specific grants.    It would be bizarre to tack an important new measure of this kind on to the Education Bill In the House ofLords, having just guillotined the Bill in the Commons,   On the otherhand, it was argued that all possible steps should be taken to dealwith unemployment among school-leavers, which was one of the most damaging aspects of the life of the country.    The package of measures to be announced that afternoon was not large, and misscheme would be a welcome addition.    Neither House of parliament was likely to make difficulty over the adoption of an unusual procedure for such a purpose.    Large sums of money were spent on helpingstudents in higher education, yet many able working-clasB childrenlost the chance of a university education because no help was available to stay on at school.    The problem of unemployment among the young was likely to persist for some years, and a schemesuch as this which would act on a longer time scale would be a valuable complement to the shorter-term measures.   A childSprospects of continuing in education should not depend on whether he or she lived north or south of the border.In further discussion it was urged that no immediate decision shouldbe taken for or against the proposal to introduce educationalmaintenance allowances.    It was not wholly clear whether their main10CONFIDENTIAL
justification was their effect on unemployment or their educationaleffect.    The Social Services Committee had not had adequate time toconsider the matter fully, and it might be that other measures, suchas additional spending on vocational training, especially in scarceskills, would provide better value for money.   Several other possible measures were still under consideration - the job swapscheme, expansion of the job creation scheme, continuation of thetemporary employment subsidy - and In view of the public expenditure constraints these different possibilities were to someextent in competition with each other.    It would, however, bebetter not to mention in that afternoons statement that thepossibility of Introducing educational maintenance allowances wasunder consideration, or the statement would be overloaded with proposals which were not yet firm and which might come to nothing.Further Information was desirable about the costs, and the effects in keeping children off the streets, of this scheme and of the other possibilities.    In particular, firmer figures were needed on theproportion of the expenditure on educational maintenance allowanceswhich would relate to children who would have stayed on in educationanyway, the number of extra children who would stay on, and the savings on supplementary benefits.   A survey on these points, anda comparison of current experience In England and Wales and InScotland, might be useful.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that some members of the Cabinet favoured an immediate announcement thateducational maintenance allowances would be introduced next year,while others considered that a case had not been established for introducing this particular scheme now.     The problem ofunemployment among the young was of major importance, and high priority should be given to further action to deal with it, notwith-standing the pressure on the contingency reserve.    There were however several other proposals for such action on which final decisions had not yet been taken - the job swap scheme, expansion ofthe job creation scheme, continuation of the temporary employmentsubsidy, and the work experience scheme - and the possibility of expansion of vocational training had been mentioned during thediscussion.    While therefore the general view of the Cabinet wasthat something more must be done they were not yet in a position toreach firm decisions.    The Social Services Committee should accordingly give further urgent consideration to the proposal for educational maintenance allowances and other possible measures,and bring the matter back to the Cabinet in mid-September withspecific proposals for the most sensible and cost-effective measureor combination of measures which could be taken.    The Committeeshould take account of the points made in the Cabinet(s discussion, andshould In particular make a comparative assessment, In as concrete
terms as possible, of the costs of each measure and Its effect in reducing unemployment among the young.    The Cabinet should thenaim to reach a firm decision in time to amend the Education Bill in theHouse of Lords if it was decided to introduce educational maintenanceallowances.    The Secretary of State for Education and Science should reply to the TUC letter of 26 July expressing the Governmentswillingness to discuss with them the possibility of introducingeducational maintenance allowances, and discussions should also bearranged with the local authorities.    Nothing should be said aboutthe educational maintenance allowances in that afternoon&apos;s statement.The Government&apos;s public position, pending a decision in September,should be that they planned to bring forward further proposals, andthat educational maintenance allowances were one of the possibilities,under consideration, which the Government would be discussing withthe TUC and the local authorities.    The Cabinet noted that the termsof the statement by the Secretary of State for Employment that afternoon had now been agreed, and would make no reference to thetemporary employment subsidy.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office3 August 197612
