1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL, said that the opposition had chosen Child Benefit  (CB) as the subject for the Supply Daydebate on 26 June, and this debate was expected to take place on a motion for the Adjournment.    If the Opposition were to table a substantive motion for debate the Government would be inconsiderable difficulty.    The Government might well be defeatedeven in a vote on the Adjournment Motion, and the best course might be to accept the Adjournment.In discussion it was suggested that the acceptance of the adjournment in such circumstances would be unexpected, perhapsunprecedented, and might be seen as a trick to avoid defeat.Demands might men follow for a change of Government policy onCB to reflect this decision of the House, and the atmosphere forthe following day&apos;s debate on the Aircraft and Shipbuilding IndustriesBill might be spoilt.    It might therefore be better to have a vote,despite the difficulties.    This would require a statement of theGovernment&apos;s position on CB, or an amendment to any substantivemotion tabled by the Opposition, in terms calculated to secure thesupport of all Government backbenchers for the vote.    On the otherhand it was argued mat because of the strength of feeling on this issue among the Governments supporters, the Government wouldbe likely to suffer a heavy defeat in any vote which followed the debate.    If the Opposition chose to have a very general debate onthe Adjournment they could not very well object if the government accepted the motion, provided that a clear explanation had beengiven in the debate that mis was because mere was no questionarising from the debate on which to divide the House,    The principleof the CB scheme would not be at issue, only the pace of itsimplementation.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said mat asubstantial majority of the Cabinet agreed that the right course wouldbe to accept the Motion for the Adjournment.    Careful thought should be given to the way in which the Government&apos;s position was presented in the debate, and to how the Government should respond to any subsequent demands for a further statement of policy.    TheGovernment&apos;s commitment to implementing the CB scheme, whichhad been placed on the Statute Book by Government legislation in theprevious Session, should be reaffirmed; but he had informed theLiaison Committee that it would not be possible to introduce the fullCB scheme in 1977 or 1978, and particular care would be needed on what was said on timing.    The Secretary of State for Social services should let him see the text of what he proposed to say.
The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of State for Social services to proceed accordingly.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCDL. said that the Oppositionproposed to put down a Motion, before the debate on 29 June ontheir Motion to recommit the Aircraft and Shipbuilding fadustrlesBill to a Select Committee, that in the event of an equality of votesin a division on the recommittal Motion, the Speaker should declarethe Motion carried.    This was a proposal to change the rules, byinstructing the Speaker to use his casting vote in a way contrary tothe precedents, and was open to strong constitutional objections.It was open to the Government to decline to provide time to debatethis new Motion; but the Opposition attached importance to it, andit would be possible to meet their wishes by allowing it to be debated - probably as part of the debate on the recommittal Motion -with a view to securing its defeat on a vote.    It was not yet knownhow the minority parties would be likely to vote.hi discussion it was pointed out that the Governments principalaim was to restore the usual channels, and this would best be doneby winning a rerun of the disputed vote of 27 May without having to rely on the Speaker&apos;a casting vote.    However, while there seemedno way in which this could be achieved, all the Indications were thatthe Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition Chief Whip genuinelywanted a resumption of normal relations.    The idea of a Motion onthe Speaker&apos;a casting vote, which had not been raised until after thePrime Ministers statement of 22 June, was probably intended tosatisfy Opposition backbenchers; but it would evidently helprelationships with the Opposition if the Government agreed that this motion should be debated.   The Government would then be able to deploy the cogent constitutional arguments against the Motion, andIt seemed likely that at least some of the minority party members would vote against the Motion.    If the recommittal Motion was mendefeated only on the Speaker&apos;s casting vote, the fact that the Househad just endorsed the view that the Speaker should be left to casthis vote in accordance with precedent would strengthen theGovernments position.    The case against the Opposition&apos;s newMotion could be deployed most effectively if it were to be debatedand voted on separately from the recommittal Motion, but this mightnot be practicable.    The two Motions were closely linked and could resonably be debated together.2
In the course of further discussion concerning the prospects forthe remainder of the Session, THE LORD PRESIDENT said that,although there wOuld clearly be difficulties, he was not toodespondent about the prospects of being able to complete theGovernments legislation.    The Opposition had agreed that theremaining stages of the Education Bill should be completed duringthe following week without a timetable Motion, and he hoped toobtain a similar agreement on the Dock Work Regulation Bill theweek after. He was strongly opposed to any suggestion thatone of the Governments major Bills should be dropped, whichwould be received very badly by Government supporters.    But forthe present it would be necessary to take business which could beobtained without a timetable Motion, so as to maintain a calmatmosphere.    It was not, in any event, possible to take atimetable Motion on the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries bill at present.    He accepted that such a Motion might be needed onthe Health Services Bill, to ensure that the Committee Stage was completed sufficiently soon.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Conservatives were likely to run into trouble over their Motionto require the Speaker to vote contrary to the precedents, and thegeneral sense of the Cabinets discussion was that the Governmentshould allow time for this Motion to be debated on 29 June.    Itwould be necessary first to ascertain how the minority parties would be likely to vote.    The Lord President and the Chief Whiphad discretion to decide whether this Motion could be debated andvoted on separately, before the debate on the recommittal Motion,or whether the two Motions should be debated together.The Cabinet -2.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;8 summing up of their discussion, and invited the Lord President of the Council and theChief Whip to proceed accordingly.tort^ of the In discussion of the business proposed for Friday 2 July, theijjj Committee    debate on the Motions to renew the Northern Ireland Direct Rule*?6ct and Emergency Provisions legislation, the points were made that)***8 to the       it was desirable to hold this debate as far as possible in advanceof ***e beginning of the Northern Ireland marching season on^bly 12 July; but that, if the debate on the report of the SelectCommittee on Direct Elections to the European Assembly could notbe held   ; on 2 July, there might be no opportunity to debate thereport before the Cabinets discussion on 8 July of the line which theUnited Kingdom should take on mis issue at the European Councilon 12 and 13 July.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe debate on the Select Committees report would be one of a longseries of debates on this subject, and he and the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary accepted that it might not be possible tohold this debate until Friday 9 July.    The Lord President of theCouncil would, however, consider whether there was any way of arranging for the debate to take place before the Cabinet1 discussion on 8 July.The Cabinet -3.        Took note.4
^S3GN 2.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said^AjRS that the situation in the Lebanon remained extremely confused.However, all British subjects in the Lebanon who wished to leave**&amp;on the country had now had an opportunity to do so: those remainingPr*vi0U8 were doing so for their own purposes and in full knowledge of theJ*k*ence- risks.^76) 10th^hiBions, The Cabinet -31. Took note of the statement by theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary.^ce THE PRIME MINISTER said that the atmosphere of his talks with President Giscard d&apos;Estaing had been good.    The french president had clearly been anxious to improve relations with thiscountry.   A Joint Declaration had been issued providing that thetwo Heads of Government, accompanied by other members oftheir Governments, would meet annually: and also for periodicmeetings of specialist Ministers.    President Giscard had himselfclearly been more impressed than he expected with the progresswe were making in reducing the rate of inflation and had also cometo recognise the importance of our contribution to the north atlantic Alliance.    There seemed no doubt that French defence policy was moving closer to co-operation with the North atlantic treaty Organisation (NATO) even though that fact could not yet be publicly admitted.    In the industrial field President Giscard had made it clear that the French were willing to co-operate with us.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had emphasised theimportance we attached to fisheries matters and the Presidentundoubtedly had now a better understanding of our position; animportant practical consequence was that, contrary to the line which French officials had taken hitherto, he had agreed to bilateral discussions on the matter at official level.    On direct elections tothe European Assembly, President Giscard had not gone so far asto agree to a new formula which the Foreign and commonwealth secretary had put to him, but he had shown signs of movement andhad finally said that he would not take the lead in opposing a solution which would permit adequate representation of Scotland and Wales.In a brief discussion attention was drawn to the likelihood that french opposition to a minimum support price (msp) for oil wouldmean that no progress on a European Economic Community energypolicy would occur before we entered our period of Presidency on1 January i977.    It was suggested that the arrangements discussed between the Prime Minister and President Giscard for meetings between British and French Ministers gave an opening for inviting5
the French Minister concerned to come to London for talks withthe Secretary of State for Energy.   These talks need not be confined to map: there were other energy matters of common concern, for instance research and development in the nuclear energy field.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had raised the question of mspprivately with President Giscard.   Although the latter had not been willing to admit that he had actually undertaken to support an mspin return for our concession on a separate seat at the conference for International Economic Co-operation (CIEC), he had agreed thatmis was the spirit of the compromise which had been reached inthose discussions.    He had also agreed that the msp, although inhis view unlikely to be of practical significance In regulatingprices, could be a major factor in giving confidence to investors.A possible invitation to the French energy Minister to visit london was worth following up, but it would be wise to postpone a decision until the impact of President Giscard&apos;s visit could be seen more clearly.The Cabinet -2.        Took note of the statements by thePrime Minister.There was a brief discussion of the outcome we should like to seefrom the summit meeting to be held at Puerto Rico.    It was argued that, although the world economic situation looked much morefavourable than at the time of the Rambouillet Conference, misappearance might in part be deceptive.   There was a danger thatthe progress which had been made might not be sustained unless itwere reinforced.    It was therefore desirable that the communiqueat the summit meeting should come out firmly in favour of measures to maintain world demand.    Particular matters whichmight be discussed in this context were the Americans1 failure sofar to ratify the Organisation for Economic Co-operation andDevelopment Trust Fund, which they themselves had initiated, andthe need to make progress in the multilateral trade negotiationsas soon as the American elections were over.   Although it was inevitable mat the President of the United States, Mr Ford, wouldbe limited in entering into commitments by his need to avoidoffending his domestic audience during the election period, therewere nevertheless some undertakings he could make which wouldbe helpful to him as well as to ourselves.6
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that hewould bear in mind the points made in the discussion.    He hopedthat the Economic Summit would provide a forum for usefuldiscussion of the world economic situation and particularly perhapsof North/South problems.    But it had to be admitted that it containedelements of electioneering so far as both the United States andGermany were concerned.    For that reason it would be over-optimistic to expect any really important decisions to emerge from it.The Cabinet -3.        Took note of the Prime Ministers summing upof their discussion.7
3,        The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP(76) 33) to which was attached a draft of a white Paper:  &quot;The Attack on Inflation - the Second Year&quot;.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that the draftembodied the decisions on pay policy and on prices policy whichhad been taken through the established Committee machinery.The draft had been prepared under the guidance of a ministerial group under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.There were no general points to which he thought it necessary todraw Cabinet&apos;s attention.The Cabinet then considered the draft White Paper paragraph by paragraph,    hi the course of discussion the following points weremade -a. In paragraphs 3-5, the reduction of unemployment should be given priority over the other two objectiveslisted, so that stress could be laid on the human factor in the Governments policies.    Ministers should laterconsider the problems of school leavers and young people.b. hi paragraph 8, the figure of 35 per cent should notbe quoted.    The text should simply say that the inflationrate had been more than halved to 15^ per cent.c. The Government should be ready, after publicationof the White Paper, to make a statement mat the white paper did not necessarily mean that stage paymentspreviously promised but withheld under Stage 1 to doctors,dentists, senior public servants, etc. would be paid underStage 2,d. The sub-headings in the White Paper were not wholly satisfactory - eg although paragraph 23 et seq wereheaded &quot;Prices&quot;, the Price Code changes were in fact inthe section headed &quot;British Industry&quot;.e. Paragraph 30 might subsequently be held to bemisleading if it were later argued that it gave warning ofa lower level of public expenditure than mat agreed in the1975 Public Expenditure Review.    It was noted however thatthe wording reflected what had been said after the Chequersmeeting of the National Economic Development Council on industrial strategy.    The wording should therefore be leftunchanged but the Chancellor of the Exchequer should ifnecessary when introducing the White Paper make it clearthat it followed the Chequers statement.8
f. Paragraph 39 was unduly cataclysmic in tone,and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster undertook to prepare a revised version.The Cabinet agreed a number of minor drafting changes to the text of the White Paper,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that,subject to the changes which had been agreed, and to the furtherminor changes which would be made in the light of the discussion,the Cabinet were content with the draft White Paper before them.They agreed mat it should be published in the following week.The Cabinet -1. Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;a summing up of their discussion.2.        Invited the Chief Secretary, treasury to arrange for the White Paper to be amended inaccordance with the points raised in discussion,and to be published in the course of the following week.9
J^TURE OF 4.        The Cabinet had before them, a note by the Secretary of State;5* PRICE for Prices and Consumer Protection and Paymaster General(CP(76) 34) to which was attached the explanatory section of the consultative Document on the changes to the Price Code which was due to be published the following week.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR PRICES AND consumer protection AND PAYMASTER GENERAL said that the amendments to the Price Code contained in the consultative document would carry out all of the points which had been made inthe Prime Ministers recent speech to the Confederation of BritishIndustry.   Present intentions were that the Consultative Documentshould be published on 30 June, which would leave only two weeksfor consultation.   Since the Affirmative Order could not be debated in Parliament before October, it would be highly desirableto have a two day debate on the C ounte r - Inflation White Paper inthe course of July.In discussion it was pointed out that paragraph 39 of the explanatorysection of the Consultative Document would make it necessary forthe Secretary of State for Industry to ask the Post Office to reduce their telecommunications prices to an extent which would lose themrevenue of some  140 million in 1976-77, which would represent anet addition to the public sector borrowing requirement.    This wasa situation which the Government should not contemplate,particularly when a major review of telecommunications strategywas just coming forward for Ministers&apos; consideration the following week.    Paragraph 39 should therefore be amended in order toavoid this necessity, and instead the Poet Office should be told thatin addition to the stabilisation of charges which they had already announced, they should agree that there would be no increase intelecommunications charges before August 1977.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed in principle that it would be wrong to get into aposition in which price cuts had to be pressed upon the Post Office,The Secretary of State for Industry and the Secretary of State for prices and Consumer Protection should therefore agree on a redraftof paragraph 39 to avoid this result.    The consultative documentas so amended should be published in the following week.   On thequestion of the Parliamentary debate, Cabinet recognised thedesirability of two days on the Counter-Inflation white Paper, sothat both prices and pay policy could be discussed; but theParliamentary programme was of course subject to a great deal of pressure, and tills was a matter which the Lord President wouldhave to consider.10
The Cabinet -i. Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of their discussion,2.        Invited the Secretary of State for prices and Consumer Protection, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Industry, to amend the Consultative Document in such a way as toensure that the Government was not in a positionin which they had to press price reductions uponthe Post Office,3,        Invited the Secretary of State for prices and Consumer Protection to arrange for the consultative Document as so amended to bepublished in the following week, &quot;Cabinet Office24 June 1976U
