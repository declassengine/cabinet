1,        The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda onBritain and the European Community:A note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (C(76) 36) covering a paper by officials on British objectives in the european community.A memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs (CP(76) 30) on the United KingdomPresidency of the European Economic Community (e.c.),January-June 1977.A note and a memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign and Commonwealth Affairs (CP(76) 28 and 29) onthe enlargement of the e.c..A note and a memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign and Commonwealth Affairs (CP(76) 26 and C(76) 38)on the Tindemans Report.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that given the length of the agenda it seemed advisable to consider our objectives in the Community together with the Tindemans Report;the enlargement of the Community might seem a separate subjectbut could conveniently for the purposes of discussion also be groupedwith the other topics since enlargement would materially affect thedevelopment of the Community and thus our objectives in it.   Hewould in the autumn wish to bring before the Cabinet some iews about our longer term objectives.   In the meantime in terms of ourshort term objectives - covering the period up to and including ourPresidency in the first half of next year - we had a number ofpositive aims.    We attached great importance to a satisfactoryrevision of the Common Fisheries Policy - difficult though thisnegotiation would be.    We wanted to keep discussion going ofunemployment and of the transfer of resources from the richer tothe poorer members of the Community,   We would need to continueto press for the establishment of the Joint European Torus (JET) atCulham,    We wanted to work for changes in the Common agricultural policy.   And we needed to improve Community procedures.    Butwe also had a number of negative aims in particular the avoidance of gratuitous harmonisation,for example in relation to tachographs,drivers1 hours, passports, eviscerated chickens and summer time.All this placed us in a difficult tactical position.   We would accordingly need in relation to such topics as direct elections andthe Tindemans Report to play as positive and constructive a role aspossible.Direct elections was for consideration as a separate item on theagenda.   The Tindemans Report had its origins in the questions asked by the then   Prime Minister at the meeting of Community Heads of1
Government in 1974 when it had become apparent that despite the commitment to European Union at the Summit of 1972 there wasno clear understanding of what the term meant.    Monsieur Tindemanshad therefore been asked to report on the matter t   It was to hiscredit that despite a number of unrealistic ideas in circulation his report had not sought to promote federation but had recognised thepolitical facts of life and had taken as its basis existing Communityinstitutions.   Of the three main sections of the report that oneconomic matters had put forward the concept of a two tierCommunity and of the Snake as the centrepiece of Economic and monetary Union. (EMU).   The first concept had not found favour and thesecond had been undermined when the French had had to leave theSnake.   On external relations the report had suggested that theCommunityls successful efforts on the international stage could be built on by amalgamating political co-operation and Council Ministerialmeetings; this we could welcome on a pragmatic basis.    Oninstitutions the report provided a reasonable basis for discussion and we need not be obstructive about a few minor changes.    On thewhole therefore and subject to the point which he had made aboutthe two tier concept and EMU he hoped that hit colleagues could give a general welcome to the report.On enlargement the Cabinet had expressed a wish for a general discussion when it had considered the Greek application in February.Other applications were in prospect, notably those of Portugal and spain.    On the debit side it was clear that the economic andfinancial effects of enlargement would be bad; in particular the admission of these relatively poor countries would adversely affectthe possibility of resource transfers to the United Kingdom fromthe wealthier countries of the Community.   And Communitydecision making, already slow, would be made more difficult.But on the credit side admission of these countries would reinforce the tendency against federalism.   Furthermore the effect of theirexclusion on the maintenance or restoration of the democraticinstitutions of the applicant countries would be crucial,    ft wouldbe disastrous if it emerged that a Labour Government had been associated with an attempt to keep these countries out.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary asked his colleagues to note that he would later be circulating a memorandum on longer term strategy in the Community.   In the meantime he asked forendorsement of the line proposed in relation to the Tindamans report and the enlargement of the Community.2
In discussion it was agreed that the question of enlargement wascrucial to the future of the Community, and hence to the way inwhich our interests should be pursued within it.    It was argued thatenlargement had been taken far too lightly.    The entry of a wholegroup of Mediterranean States with quite different attitudesto public administration and taxation would fundamentally change the whole balance and nature of the Community, would diminishour prospects of receiving resource transfers and might endangerGerman allegiance to the Community.    On the other hand it was argued that despite the manifest difficulties, it was politically impossible to stand out against eventual membership of countriesbelow the &quot;olive growing line&quot; particularly since the Treaty of Romeprovided mat membership of the Community was open to &quot;european states&quot;.    On this basis it would seem right that Greece, portugal and Spain should enter if their democratic credentials were established: the European status of Turkey was however open to question.   At the moment it seemed possible that Greece mightenter the Community in 1980, and Portugal and Spain In the nextfew years thereafter, although It would probably be in our materialinterests for negotiations for Greek entry, and consideration of possible Portuguese and Spanish applications, not to proceed tooquickly.    The possibility could not however be excluded that in theinterests of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) alliance,and in particular of the strengthening of its southern flank, theUnited States would use its influence to speed up the process.A Community enlarged by the addition of . Mediterraneancountries, whose exports competed to some extent with those of developing countries, might become more inward looking than itwould otherwise be.    It would however also tend to develop In aconfederal rather than a federal way, and this would not be withoutits advantages; in some ways it could be easier for us to work within such a framework.    However with enlargement the tendency for the Community to develop into a two tier organisation might be strengthened.    The smaller countries would resent any move toestablish a Directorate of the major members: but there was usefulscope for informal co-ordination between ourselves, the French andthe Germans.    It would not be easy, given the decline in ourrelative economic strength in the Community as shown by Annex Ato the Note on British Objectives In the Community (C(76) 36), tocarry in such co-ordination with France and Germany the weightappropriate to our interests: and it was important therefore for us toensure that our relations with France and Germany were close atthe highest level.   With Germany the position was reasonably good;and the forthcoming State Visit of President Giscard to theUnited Kingdom might help in respect of France.3
Enlargement also raised issues both within the United Kingdom and beyond the countries at present being considered for membership.Within the United Kingdom it would be desirable tc keep in mind inthe context of devolution the desire of many in Northern Ireland for direct representation in Brussels.    More widely it was argued thatin the context of enlargement the Community might ultimately be faced with the need to decide its attitude towards certain eastern european countries.    It was tempting to think that an enlarged butnon-federal Community would be attractive to countries in eastern europe who were seeking to free themselves from Sovietdomination and to Yugoslavia,   This could however be a very dangerous concept to promote and speculation of mis kind waspremature and undesirable,    hi relation to the recommendations in the Tindemans Report on defence co-operation it was pointed outthat undue emphasis on co-ordination among the Nine could have unfortunate effects on the wider cohesion of the NATO allianceparticularly among the smaller European countries which were not members of the Community.In further discussion it was argued that while the prospects forenlargement had in some respects overtaken the perspectives for internal development sketched out in the Tindemans Report thegeneral tendency of this report to urge increases in Communitycompetence made it less acceptable than had been suggested.    Thereport saw the development of direct elections to the european assembly as a means of giving the Assembly legitimacy as a centre of Community decision making and legislation, presumably at theexpense of national Parliaments.    It was important to maintain and establish on the correct lines the relationship between parliament in the United Kingdom and the Community.    The present scrutinyarrangements, although more stringent than those in any countryexcept perhapB Denmark, needed further review, and we shouldwatch carefully any tendency for the development of majority voting in the Community on issues of importance in ways which might limit the authority of Parliament.    Tindemans1 proposal that the Presidentof the Commission should have the right to appoint his colleagues would be a move in the wrong direction in relation to national governments and Parliaments.    On the other hand it was argued that for our tactics in the Community to be effective we needed to sound as&quot;communautaire&quot;as possible,    hi this context the TindemansReport apart from its economic section was in general modest:  andin further discussion the cautious but generally affirmative line inthe memorandum by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary(C(76) 38) was broadly endorsed.    It was suggested, however, thatin the longer run it might be found that we need not be quite soopposed to the concept of the Snake as we were at present.    It wasTil*demanstt4
conceivable that when our rate of inflation had fallen further somevalue could be obtained from joining in arrangements which offered a greater prospect of exchange rate stability.Actives The pursuit of our objectives in the Community depended on a properrecognition of British interests.    It was generally accepted that countries would pursue their own interests in Community bargainingand through the collective action made possible by the Community.The French in particular pursued their interests doggedly,insistently and brilliantly.    It was essential therefore mat weshould identify our strengths and use them as singlemindedly.    TheUnited Kingdom Presidency in the first six months of next year would place us in a powerful tactical position particularly in relationto the compromise proposals which the Presidency was traditionallyexpected to make.    Substantial sums of money were now beingdisbursed from the Community Budget in the form of MonetaryCompensatory Amounts which cheapened British imports of foodstuffs; this gave us an excellent bargaining counter to demandmajor reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy,    The energyresources of the United Kingdom also gave us substantial bargaining power.    The limitations placed by Parliament on the freedom ofaction of British Ministers could also be used as a source of strength in bargaining provided sufficient flexibility of detailed manoeuvrewas also maintained.From the British point of view the most promising developments todate had been in relation to external policy.    We needed to bear inmind that our interests were not encapsulated in the internaldevelopment of the Community; 70 per cent of our trade was with countries outside.    Despite some failures, of which the recentUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development might perhaps be one, the establishment of common Community positions had proved very valuable.    This had been particularly the case inrelation to financial and monetary affairs.    We should build on this,seek to make progress in particular in the field of the CommonCommercial Policy and in relation to a more equitable distributionof Community aid to developing countries and concentrate less on anintroverted study of arrangements within the Community,    Therewere areas where internal harmonisation was both irksome and unnecessary.    Further, in many cases it involved extensions of community competence which we need not and should not accept.We should approach future consultations, for example aboutCompany law, with this consideration in mind.5
Some detailed proposals for objectives, including the developmentof ideas for further transfer of resources beneficial to us, were set out in C(76) 36.    One area which deserved attention was matof economic policy where the absence of any coherent policy to dealwith issues such as unemployment on a Community scaledemonstrated a central weakness, exemplified also by the very smallshort term aid facilities available within the Community in relationto its size and wealth.   Another need was for us to give some additional emphasis to social as well as to economic problems,and this could include the further development of consumer interestsin Community decision making processes.    Further areas were those of energy policy where the emphasis should be on establishingand co-ordinating interests and social policy where there might be advantage in bringing together the Community Ministers concerned.In pursuing our objectives in the period up to and including ourPresidency we should take what opportunities offered to improve the procedures of the Community.   A more informal approach to discussion in the Council of Ministers, involving some give and take in debate, rather than the recitation of set speeches could usefully be encouraged, with the emphasis on national contributionsrather than on papers from the Commission.THE PRIME MINISTER summing up the discussion said that it hadnecessarily been wide-ranging but that it would provide valuableguidance for the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary in further discussions within the European Community on the TindemansReport and enlargement against the background of our ownobjectives.    It would also provide guidance for himself and theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary at the European Council inJuly.    His first general conclusion was that we needed to take theCommunity seriously and to regard it as an important instrumentwhich could be used to our advantage and which must therefore betaken into account in our formulation of all our domestic and foreignpolicies.    He had been struck by a sentence shown him from a recent letter from a British official serving in the commission which said about French attitudes -&quot;As seen from my perch the French Head of State and his ministers have no illusions about the Community and novery dynamic vision of the Community&apos;a future; but they know the Community well and take it very seriously as an area in which French interests can be defended and advanced.They work at it; they exploit it; they are not divided orhalf hearted about it, &quot;This sentence contained a useful moral.    It was true that in the pastour approach had been half hearted.    We must now make theCommunity dimension part of our departmental thinking and pursue this with the same determination as the French: but in so doing we6
should also remember the need sometimes to cloak a bard positionin suitably&quot;communautaire&quot;doctrine and phraseology.It -would be particularly necessary to take the Communitydimension into account in the development of common Communitypositions particularly in the external field.    The development ofcommon positions rather than the promotion of artificialharmonisation would suit our interests best and there was reasonto think mat other member Governments, particularly the largercountries, were tending to take a similar view.It was not entirely clear whether the Germans in saying that theywould be willing to pay a price for greater unity were banking onthe fact mat greater unity would not arise (so that they would nothave to pay) or were genuinely thinking In terms of some furthertransfer of resources from the richer to the less well off members in the interests of economic convergence.    This question neededfurther exploration; but there now seemed to be a growingwillingness in the Community, which from our point of view wouldbe helpful, to relate the transfer of resources to economicconvergence rather than monetary union.Enlargement of the Community would involve some serious economic disadvantages but the majority of the Cabinet took theview that enlargement was inevitable.    We should not seek to hasten it and we should ensure that our interests were adequatelytaken account of in the detailed negotiations, but we could not affordpolitically to seem obstructive.    We should therefore move withthe main body of the Community, neither in the van nor in the rear:above all we should take a&quot;communautaire&quot; attitude.The British Presidency in the first six months of 1977 would place a considerable burden on the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary and on the other Ministers concerned.    The memorandum beforethe Cabinet (CP(76) 30) described the preparatory work which was going on.    But the Ministerial Committee on European questions should work out in advance, going beyond the procedural questionsoutlined in the memorandum, the positions which it would be advantageous for us to take up during our Presidency and submit areport to Cabinet in the autumn.    The Ministerial Committee on european Questions should also consider how best to establish a link between the Community and the Commonwealth.   A closerrelationship between the Community and the Commonwealth couldbe helpful to the latter and could usefully advance British influence in both spheres.7
In relation to democratic control of Community procedures theproposals which the Lord President had in preparation should be examined with care.    But in considering possible changes it wasnecessary to bear in mind that Parliamentary scrutiny of Communityaffairs was already more exacting in the United Kingdom man inany other country of the Community except perhaps Denmark; wehad to strike a balance between accountability and the need not tomake our own negotiating procedures more inflexible.hi so far as longer term objectives in the Community were concerned the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary would submit later in theyear a memorandum to the Cabinet,    hi the meantime there wouldbe a Parliamentary debate in the following week on developments in the Community, the Tindemans Report and related matters.The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs(Mr Hattersley) who would be speaking for the Government would be guided by the discussion in Cabinet.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.        Invited the Prime Minister and the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to be guided accordinglyin further discussions within the Community.3. Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaryto bring before the Cabinet in due course a memorandumon our longer term objectives in the Community.4.        Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary as Chairman of the Ministerial Committee on EuropeanQuestions to bring before Cabinet in due coursememoranda oni. the handling of the British Presidencyii. the development of a closer relationship between the Commonwealth and the Community.8
NrrvsULTURAL-FIXINGQcedure2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (CP(76) 31) bythe Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food covering a reportby officials recommending improvements which might be sought inthe procedure for fixing Community farm prices.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat the recommendations in the report were in accordance with theconclusions of the Ministerial Committee on European Questions.A further report on our future strategy towards the common agricultural Policy (CAP) would be made after discussion in that committee.    Meanwhile it would be useful to try to secure theprocedural improvements proposed.    These were that theCommission should be urged to consult Member States and alsoconsumer organisations more fully in drawing up the price proposals,and also to bring out more clearly the budgetary and resourcecosts; that we should propose a joint Agriculture/Finance Councilto discuss agricultural support before the publication of the priceproposals; that we should use our Presidency bom to ensureconsideration of a compromise package of our own and toorganise the discussions more sensibly with time for reference tocapitals before the final settlement; and that we should ourselvesarrange for a clear remit for the negotiations and for participationby interested Departments.In discussion there was general support for the recommendations inthe report.    In particular attention was drawn to the importance of improving the price-fixing procedure in view of the increasingimpact Community farm prices would have on United Kingdom food prices and thus on counter-inflation policy as we approached theend of the transitional period.   The fixing of prices by Communityagricultural Ministers alone was not in accordance with our widereconomic interests.    The proposal for a joint meeting ofAgriculture and Finance Ministers was therefore of particular importance for the United Kingdom.    The Minister of agriculture ahould report the outcome of his negotiations on procedure.   Asthe major consumers of Community agricultural surpluses we were well placed to insist on the maintenance of monetary subsidies onour food imports, as an offset to the excessive weight at presentgiven to the interests of producers, at any rate until we could secure adequate improvements in the CAP.    hi order to make thebest use of the strength of our bargaining position we would need to work out our long term strategy for the future development ofthe policy and define our objectives not only for future farm pricesettlements but also for the agricultural content of the multilateral trade negotiations.    Too much reliance should not however beplaced on our holding the Presidency in 1977 to achieve our aims.   Itwas important that the Minister of Agriculture should have preciseinstructions for the negotiations and be prepared to report back as necessary to his colleagues in the course of mem.9
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the proposals in CP(76) 31 and invited theMinister of Agriculture to pursue them as appropriate within theCommunity.    We were in a strong position to press our own interests in relation to the CAP and the Cabinet would wish toconsider a further memorandum on our strategy towards the CAPbefore the end of the year.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;8 summing up of their discussion.2.        Invited the Minister of Agriculture tobring before Cabinet in due course a memorandumon our strategy towards the Common agricultural policy.
3,        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the SecretaryhSONS of State for foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (CP(76) 25) on direct***** elections to the European Assembly,QPEAN**nLY THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY recalled that theHouse of Commons in the debate on 29 and 30 March had expressedstrong support for holding direct elections to the european assembly,    He understood that the Select Committee which had subsequently been appointed hoped to produce a report on 15 Junewhich was likely to embody the following conclusions :-a. A directly elected Assembly should have a member-ship of 350 to 425 members for the present Community of nine.b. There should be a minimum representation for smallMember States but the distribution of seats between member states should otherwise be as far as possible proportional totheir population.c. Direct elections should be held in the spring of 1978 buton subsequent occasions they should not coincide with national or local elections.So far as the number and distribution of seats were concerned his own view was that the latest French proposal for retaining the presentcomposition of the Assembly would fall to provide adequate representation for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland comparedwith the smaller Member States.   He had therefore been seeking a compromise preferably on the lines of the Belgian proposal for an assembly of 401 members.   There was some pressure for reaching a decision before the Italian elections on 20 June but he considered it more important to be ready for a decision at the European Council on12 and 13 July after the State Visit of President Giscard d^stalng tothe United Kingdom.    H it should prove possible to secure a .satisfactory agreement before then. It would be subject to approval bythe Cabinet and Parliament.    We needed to bear in mind that If wewere to secure our own objectives In the Community It would be important not to impede progress on direct elections to which other member States attached great importance.In discussion it was pointed out that the National ExecutiveCommittee of the Labour Party wiehed a decision to be deferred until after the Party Conference.    In any event direct elections held Inadvance of the next General Election might produce a Party balancedifferent from that at Westminster with embarrassing consequences for the Government both at home and in the Community,   To avoidsuch embarrassment there were strong arguments for deferring directelections until a General Election and also insisting on a dual mandate,,ie that British members of the Assembly should also be members of theBritish Parliament. 11
This would imply keeping the Assembly small and also reducing the participation of Members of Parliament in other international bodies in order to maintain the quality of the House of Commons.    the significance for democracy of a directly elected Assembly should notbe exaggerated, but there would be pressure to increase its powers.If we were to proceed to direct elections in 1978, this would involve legislation in 1976/77 which would clash with the devolution legislation and lead to serious constitutional and political difficulties.    Therewould also be a risk of a clash with elections to the Scottish &apos;Assembly (which would have no voice in the European Assembly) andwith local elections, which would place considerable burdens o!nParty organisations.    It would be unwise for the Government to act inadvance of a debate on the report by the Select Committee which was open to criticism both as to Its composition and for the apparent hastewith which it had reported.    More thought should be given to thenumber and distribution of seats and in the meantime it would be prudent to support the French in seeking to delay progress towardsdirect elections.On the other hand it was argued that lengthy deferment of directelections would be a blow to democracy In Europe.    The UnitedKingdom with its democratic tradition could expect to exercise astrong influence in a directly elected Assembly which would also actas a more effective check on the Commission.    If we insisted oncontinuing to nominate members to an enlarged Assembly other member States would find it impossible to proceed to direct elections.Nomination or indeed a dual mandate would impose a much greaterstrain on the manpower of the House of Commons than at present andthe status of United Kingdom members would inevitably suffer,   Apossible alternative to the dual mandate would be for members of theAssembly to have non-voting membership of Parliament,   Althoughthe Select Committee had produced their report in the knowledge ofthe timetable of negotiations they had not been pressed to rush theirproceedings.    There was no need to fear that a directly elected assembly would be a force for federalism in an enlarging Communityprovided that its powers remained Btrictly limited.    Our alma for thenumber and distribution of seats had been fully considered and anyattempt to shelter behind the French position would involve us inresponsibility for blocking progress and so Imperil our widerobjectives.    In any event no further commitment on the timing of direct elections or on the question of a dual mandate was proposed atthis stage in advance of further discussion In the House and in cabinet.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernments commitment to the principle of direct elections was notin doubt.    It was unlikely that any settlement in the Community wouldbe reached until the meeting of the European Council in July,    In themeantime the clear majority of the Cabinet agreed with the proposal
in CP(76) 25 that he and the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary should continue to negotiate on the lines set out in the Green Paper,in particular that they should not abandon our previous constructivestance and that they should seek a solution to the problem of thenumber and distribution of seats which would provide for adequate representation of the different parts of the United Kingdom,    We had promised to use our best endeavours to proceed to direct electionsby 1978 but there was no commitment on this and the practicability of doing so would be a matter for further consideration by Cabinet and byParliament.    Before the European Council on 12/13 July it would benecessary for the report of the Select Committee to be considered byParliament and for Cabinet to have a further discussion.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.theEuropeanEconomiccommunityuniformPassport4.        The Cabinet had before mem a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (CP(76) 27) on theEuropean Economic Community uniform passport.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY recalled thatthe European Council in December 1975 had agreed that a uniformpassport should be issued by Member States from 1978.   The pass-port would still be a national document issued by each Member state on its own authority.    But we had made it plain that we could notissue a passport on these lines before our proposed nationalitylegislation came into force.    The main issue for decision at this stagerelated to the design of the cover; various alternatives were attachedto his memorandum.In discussion it was argued mat the introduction of a uniformCommunity passport would be politically unpopular since it would beseen as blurring the sense of our national identity which wastraditionally symbolised by our national passport.    It would be preferable to retain the present form of British passport, at least asan alternative to the uniform passport, and perhaps to arrange for asystem of Community visas.    It would be undesirable to accept anappearance of uniformity which had no underlying substance.On the other hand it was pointed out that the uniform passport would remain in form and substance a national paB sport.    There was a danger of exaggerating both the extent and the desirability of nationalist sentiment.    Many people were not concerned with pass-ports, but the uniform passport would be convenient for travellers insimplifying examination procedures at frontiers.   It would also be welcomed by younger people.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed on balance with the proposals in paragraph 12 of cp(76) 27, save that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary shouldnot accept a design other than design D in the annex to that memorandum.The Cabinet -1. Took note,  with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.        Invited the Foreign and commonwealth secretary to be guided accordingly in further discussions in the Community.Cabinet Office14 June 197614
