ON 1.        THE PRIME MINISTER said that the whole Cabinet would benefit        share his serious concern at the article on child benefit which hadr SOCIETY      appeared in the issue of New Society dated 17 June.    He could notrecall any previous occasion on which there had been verbatimquotations in the Press of Cabinet documents, including twoextracts from a limited circulation annex.    There must have beeneither a theft of these documents, which seemed unlikely, or a deliberate betrayal of trust by a Minister, adviser or civil servantwho had had access to the documents and had chosen this courserather than the honest course of reaign&amp;tioii.    If this could happenwith impunity, then none of the Cabinet&apos;s business could beregarded as confidential.    It was therefore most important thatthe person responsible should be identified.    In view of the extremely serious nature of this incident he had in mind to announce in theHouse that afternoon the action which would be taken.In discussion there was general agreement that this was a serious and deplorable leak, and that a statement by the Prime Minister inthe House that afternoon would be appropriate.    The disclosure ofthe views expressed to the Chancellor of the Exchequer by the sixTrade Union Congress (TUC) representatives on the national economic Development Council, who had made no public statement to the same effect, was particularly damaging, since it might affectthe basis of trust on which such consultations with them were carried out.    A rigorous Investigation was required to discover theculprit; this was necessary both to minimise the risk of a repetition and indeed to lift the cloud of suspicion which would otherwise hang over all those who had had access to the cabinet documents in question.    The investigation might take one of twoforms.    The first would be an internal Government inquiry which,if successful, might lead either to disciplinary action against theperson responsible or to a subsequent police investigation.Alternatively, the police might be asked to conduct the Investigationfrom the start.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that there had been a serious leak and that thereshould be a full investigation.    He would decide its form afterconsultation with the Attorney General and would make a statement in the House that afternoon.   There were strict rules governing the handling of limited circulation annexes, which should be kept atall times in the Private Offices of Cabinet Ministers: it was important that these rules should be observed.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.1
f^LlAMENTARY     2.        The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenAIRS in the House of Commons during the following week.f&amp;ft and THE PRIME MINISTER said that, since the previous week181wilding discussion in the Cabinet, the Lord President, the Chief Whipretries Bill and he had been giving a lot of thought to how to proceed.    Therej^*viQug were two objectives, to unclog the business and restore the usualrence. channels, and to get the Governments essential legislationE**(76) 8th through.    The first need was to restore the Governments majority.L^Jttelons This should happen following the Rotherham by-election, although&apos; the illness of one Member could destroy the Governmentsoverall majority.   He had had informal contacts withMrs   Thatcher, who had been in a realistic frame of mind aboutthe Government1 s likely course of action following the by-election.It had been agreed to ask the two Chief Whips to report by the endof the week on what had happened on 27 May, and he would contactMrs Thatcher again next week to consider how, in the light of thisreport, the usual channels could be restored.    One possibility would be in effect to re-run the issue on which the House had votedon 27 May, for instance by voting on the Opposition Motion tore-commit the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill to a SelectCommittee, or on a Motion to re-commit those parts of the Billgiving rise to the hybridity issue.    Meanwhile the Lord president and the Chief Whip had to arrange the business in a way whichavoided problems, and time was being lost.    Timetable&quot; Motionswould probably be necessary on the Aircraft and shipbuilding industries, Dock Work Regulation, Education and Health ServicesBills, and there would have to be a spillover lasting until mid-November or even later.    This might limit the Chancellor of the exchequers freedom of manoeuvre and affect the Devolution Bill.He had had a meeting yesterday with all the Whips, who had reported that morale was good despite the difficulties.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL   said that the initiativetaken with Mrs Thatcher had improved the situation, but It would benecessary to wait and see what the atmosphere was in the following week before deciding how to proceed.    He and the Chief Whip had examined and were examining all the various possible ways of proceeding, but for the present planning must remain tentative.The objective was to get all the Governments legislation through,but this depended upon majorities for any timetable motionsrequired.    If the Government still lacked an effective majorityafter the Rotherham by-election, because of illness, it might even be necessary to wait until after the Thurrock by-election before being able to make progress on the most controversial Bills; butthe Chief Whip was exploring whether there were any other possibilities.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatno firm conclusions could yet be reached on the best way to proceed.The Cabinet noted that the possibility of resuming progress on someof the most controversial Bills depended upon the Government&apos;ahaving a majority.    There were likely to be adequate majoritiesfor timetable motions on the Education and Health Services Bills,but it would not be appropriate to take any timetable motions duringthe following week.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of their discussion.3
JSjplGN 3.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatAIRS the latest atrocity in the Lebanon was the murder of the United states ambassador, a senior member of his diplomatic staff and his , Lebanese driver.    It had been announced that Buspects were being held,^on but it was not yet clear which of the many factions was responsible.The murders had been committed in a Moslem area according to information received by the United States Government.    There were still about 800 British subjects in the Lebanon despite repeatedwarnings to them to leave, and about half of these were in Beirut.The Embassy were now organising two road convoys to Damascus totake advantage of the lull in the fighting.    The first would leave thenext day if the situation remained calm and the second on Saturday.The British Broadcasting Corporation had broadcast announcementsof these arrangements.    If the airport, which had been closed,reopened some British subjects might also leave by air.    TheEmbassies of the United States and of our European economic community partners had been kept informed.    The Americans hadin the past been opposed to evacuation by road, but following the murder of their Ambassador it now seemed that some Americansubjects might join our convoys.    More generally, although thesituation was somewhat quieter, political tension remained and therisk of further violence persisted.    There had been no militaryreaction from the Israelis to the entry into the Lebanon of Syrianforces, nor to the planned entry of Arab League forces.    They were no doubt keeping a close watch on developments which might affect the lebanon/Israel frontier area.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that invi0viB addition to the presence of an official observer from his DepartmentT*nce- at 106 trta-l In Luanda, there was now also an unofficial group of *) 8th British lawyers participating in the defence of the British mercenaries.cluBions ^e s^that^on was most unsatisfactory, both because of the nature of theite i     &apos; court proceedings and because it was increasingly being suggested thatthe British Government had connived at the recruitment ofmercenaries, an allegation which was totally untrue.    It seemed likely that the trial would end with the pronouncement of death sentences, butit was not clear whether they would be carried out.    The Foreign and commonwealth Office had prepared contingency plans for the variousconceivable outcomes, and its News Department was  giving the subjectpriority attention.The Cabinet -1.    Took note of the statements by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.4
THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee (DOP) had been reviewing policy towards Chile and hethought it right to report their conclusions to the Cabinet.    TheGovernment&apos;s policy on Chile had been a tough one and our recordinternationally was good.    Their reaction to the torture of dr  Sheila Cassidy had been firm.    It had comprised his own protest,as Foreign and C commonwealth Secretary, to the Chilean Government,the recall of our Ambassador from Santiago and the submission of dr  Cassidy&apos;s evidence to the United Nations Human RightsCommission^ Working Group on Chile.    This action had met withwidespread approval.    The conclusion of DOP was that this policy should continue and that we should intensify vigorous action on theissue of human rights, for example at the United Nations, In concert with other like-minded Governments, particularly of the european community.    But DOP did not think it right to proceed to the pointof breaking off diplomatic relations completely.   The work which our Embassy in Santiago could do for Chilean prisoners and refugeeswas well known and valuable.    On defence sales the government&apos;s policy had been to fulfil inescapable existing contracts for warships and to deliver spares and equipment relating to those contracts, butto grant no new export licences for arms - in short to do what we were obliged in law to do but no more.    This policy had been approved bythe Cabinet on 9 April 1974 (CC(74) 9th Conclusions, Minute 5)and announced to Parliament on 10* April 1974 (Hansard Col. 155written).    Against this background DOP had considered whether, asa means of bringing additional pressure on Chile following the case of dr  Cassidy, we could stop delivery of the two submarines still beingmade ready for Chile in this country.    In law the position was thattermination of these contracts could be justified only if the submarineshad not passed into Chilean ownership and provided the Chileans werebehind on their payments for the submarines.    On the latter point the 1976 payments were up to date but there was still an arrears onthe 1975 payments for the submarines.    In 1975 the Government had decided not to join in the rescheduling of ChileS 1975 debt(CC(75) 10th Conclusions, Minute 2): while still rejecting rescheduling,we had accepted a payment from Chile last year on account of their total 1975 debt and we expected to receive a further payment on thesame basis this year, but the re would however still remain an arrears of about  800, 000 on the payments due to us in 1975.    The first ofthe submarines, the 0&apos;Brien, was now a Chilean ship and DOP had to conclude reluctantly that she had immunity and that legal action toprevent her from Bailing to Chile would not succeed.    The secondsubmarine, the Hyatt, was not yet legally a Chilean warship.    It was,therefore, open to the Government in law to prevent her from sailingto Chile so long as Chile was in arrears in her payments for the submarines.    The trade unions concerned would probably be opposedto stopping the submarine, and the penalties of doing so could besevere, particularly if as a result Scott Lithgow, the building yard,lost other foreign orders which they might otherwise have secured.Nevertheless DOP had decided that we should maintain a lien on the5
Hyatt so long as Chile remained in arrears on her payments; that weshould inform the Chileans that we were taking this action; and thatmeantime we would take steps to ensure that the Hyatt did not acquirelegal immunity as a warship.    The Chileans had accordingly beeninformed that a serious situation would arise unless they paid thearrears on the submarines: we awaited their reactions,    DOPwould be reconsidering the action to be taken on the Hyatt whenfuller information was available on this point and on the practical problems which would be involved in preventing acquisition of legalimmunity by the Hyatt.     There was one other outstanding issue.This was the supply of a quantity of naval ammunition and Seacatmissiles which formed part of the spares and equipment of the twofrigates which had already been delivered to Chile.    Reference hadbeen made to these items in a note on assistance to the Chileanarmed forces circulated to the Cabinet in May 1974 (under C(74) 36).Earlier this year DOP had decided to postpone the delivery of the ammunition and missiles in order to underline to the chilean government the strength of public feeling in this country following theCassidy case.    On the other hand the firm view of the attorney general was that we would not be justified in withholding deliverycompletely.    He had advised that for the Government to refuse tosupply or to prevent the supply of the ammunition or missiles couldnot be justified in domestic or international law or on the basis ofgood faith.    It was also of course the case mat the statement ofGovernment policy made in April 1974 had made clear that thesupply of spares and equipment relating to existing shipbuildingcontracts would be allowed and that the ammunition and missilesfell into this category.    The majority of DOP had supported theview mat for these reasons we had no alternative but to supply these items to Chile, distasteful though it would be to do so.   In view ofthe sensitivity of the issue however he had undertaken to reportDOP&apos;s conclusions to the Cabinet.The Cabinet -2.    Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister.6
SECTOR       4.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the 8*GNS Lord Privy Seal (CP(76) 32) about the 1976 increase in publicservice pensions.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that under the Pensions (Increase)Act 1971, public service pensioners had their pensions increased in December each year by the percentage rise in the Retail prices index over the 12 months ending in the previous June.    those covered by this included civil servants, Members of Parliament,teachers, the Armed Forces, National Health Service and LocalGovernment employees, police and firemen.    Because of thehigh rate of inflation in 1974-75, the increase In December 1975had been 26 per cent, and this had attracted public criticism.    the ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy had considered whether the Government should take steps to intervene in the established machinery so as to modify the increase which wouldbecome due in December 1976, and which was expected to beabout 13-14 per cent.    The majority view in that Committee wasthat no modification should be made, but it was agreed that thequestion should be referred to Cabinet.    He urged strongly that,if the increase was to be modified, it would be Important not toact selectively against the public service alone, but to cover alsothe private sector.    This would involve a change in the rules atpresent operated by the Inland Revenue governing the approval ofpension schemes.    These enabled pensions to be based on notionalsalaries, so that, eg one entitled to a pension equal to two-thirds of their salary, and in receipt at the age of retirement of a salary of around  20, 000 a year, would be allowed to have a pension basedon a notional salary which, uplifted by increases in the retail prices index, could be as much as  34, 000 a year.    He reminded Cabinetthat the 1971 Act was regarded as of great importance by the staff side, who would certainly strongly oppose any change.    TheTrades Union Congress (TUC) would need to be consulted; and itwas worth noting that there had never been any pressure from the tuc on this point - indeed, their attitude had rather been thatpensions were not affected by pay policy.    If Cabinet favoured some modification, it should be only for one year, and legislation would need to be passed before the summer Recess.    He did not himselfthink it would be right to restrict increases to the  4 limit whichwas the maximum under the second round of the pay policy, whichwould affect 15-20 per cent of all public service pensioners.   Inhis view the choice was between applying a  6 limit (ie as in thecurrent round of pay policy) which would affect 5 per cent of pensioners, or operating a complete cut-off for increases topensions of   8, 500 a year or more (that being the cut-off point inthe current round of pay policy).   The latter would be likely to affect only about 75 pensioners, and save only  90, 000 a yearalthough he appreciated that it was the larger increases for the better-off pensioners that attracted critical attention.    the
rarguments were finely balanced and his official advisers were !indeed in favour of some action on a one-year only basis.    Aftervery careful consideration however he had himself come to theconclusion mat the Government should not interfere with theoperation of the statutory arrangements for increasing publicservice pensions.In discussion the view was expressed that if the practicaldifficulties were not over-riding the prospective increase shouldbe restricted in some way, and also that it would be desirableto discuss the question with the Parliamentary Labour Party.However, there was also widespread agreement that, whatever the merits of the arguments might be, the practical difficultiesof intervening in the established arrangements were overwhelming.       ;It would be unfair to restrict the pensions of public service !pensioners without doing the same to pensions of retired &apos;employees of the nationalised industries; but a firm commitmenthad already been given that the pensions of retired miners wouldbe increased in lin** with established practice.    Admittedlythere was some public feeling on the issue, but this was due tothe Press campaign against the Civil Service rather than any pressure from the TUC.    It could in fact be argued that it wouldin principle be wrong to treat pensions like pay, since the paypolicy was avowedly egalitarian in its aim and the Government had from the beginning exempted retirement incomes from it becausethey wished to re-distrlbute income in favour of the pensioner.The most logical modification would be to cut off increases at 8, 500 and above, but this would in practice be only a presentational,device, and it would be quite unacceptable unless it covered all fpensions, private and public, which would in practice be virtually impossible.    It was noted that the new State pension scheme to bebrought in from 1978 had inflation-proofing built into that part ofthe pension which was paid by the State, and it would be perversefor the Government to prevent the private sector from providingsimilar cover in respect of the private part of the pension.Furthermore, the TUC had tried to argue that old age pension i.increases should be linked to increases in earnings, an argument        -which had been resisted but which would be much more difficult to       Iresist if the present link with prices were broken.    In any case,the problem of very large relative increases in public sectorpensions would be greatly reduced as the Government&apos;b counter-inflation policies succeeded.    The case for legislation wastherefore a disappearing one. jTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that therewas a clear majority in Cabinet in favour of taking no action tointerfere with the increase in pension which would be payable in jDecember under the Pensions (Increase) Act 1971.    This decisions would, however, require care in presentation.    Emphasis would I need to be laid on the fact that the rate of inflation was declining;8
that the increase involved was less than that which would be giventhis year to the old age pensioner on social security; and that95 per cent of the public service pensioners involved would infact get less than the  6 which was the maximum under the currentround of pay policy for persons in employment.    The Cabinetaccepted that, however desirable it might be, it was not possibleto legislate to restrict the increases for the remaining small group-The Cabinet -1.    Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion,2.    Agreed with the conclusion in CP(76) 32.3.    Invited the Lord Privy Seal to be guided bythe Prime Ministers summing up in handling the presentation of their decision.Cabinet Office17 June 19769
