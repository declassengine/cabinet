rE OF 1. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet would wish toISTRATION   place on record their sincere gratitude to their former colleagues,notably Mr Short, Mrs Castle, Mr Ross and Mr Mellish, for theservices which they had rendered to th*e Government over a long period.    He also extended a warm welcome to new members of theCabinet and to the Chief Whip who would be invited to all their discussions.He would be sending to all Ministers the customary memorandum on questions of Procedure for Ministers.    This was based on the versioncirculated to the previous Administration, but included some minor amendments.    He asked all his Cabinet colleagues to read itcarefully and to ensure that it was read by all Ministers Intheir Departments.   He wished particularly to emphasise that the rule whereby memoranda for Cabinet and Cabinet Committee meetingshad to be circulated at least two working days before their consideration constituted a minimum.    It was highly desirable thatpapers should be circulated well in advance of this minimum period toallow time for full consideration: and he asked his colleagues to do their best to ensure this.He wished the new Government to work very closely with the party and Trades Union Congress.    There were some aspects of policy onwhich the views of the majority of the National Executive Committee ofthe Party differed from those of the Government and it would be important in the coming months to devise ways of resolving orminimising those differences so far as possible.    He believed that theGovernments standing with the country as a whole was good and that public opinion was in a mood to recognise the difficulties which thecountry faced and to support appropriate measures to overcome them.The Cabinet -Took notw, with approval, of the statement by thePrime Minister.
PARLIAMENTARY   2,        The Cabinet were Informed of the business to be taken in the^FAIRS House of Commons in the week beginning 26 April.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said thatthe previous evening the House of Commons had passed a resolutiondisapproving of European Economic Community (e.c.) measures onskimmed milk powder and aid for the storage of vegetable proteins.The first of these measures had been formally adopted by the EECCouncil and, as part of Community law, was directly applicable in theUnited Kingdom.    The second had not yet been formally adopted by theCouncil and the Commission might be considering a fresh proposal.Following discussion in the Legislation Committee and soundings bythe Whips, the Government had not opposed the resolution which hadno effect on the legal basis of the Regulation on skimmed milk powder.He had made it clear In the debate that the effect of this procedure wasto allow the House to register its dislike of these measures withoutcalling into question the fact that the Government had committed themselves, in the settlement of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)prices, to accept them.    The Opposition had however claimed that theresolution implied rejection of the measures and that a government statement was needed to remove the uncertainty,    ft was therefore necessary to consider how the Government should now proceed.In discussion it was argued that the Government could not ignore a unanimous vote of the House of Commons.    On the other hand, theGovernment had not exercised a veto on these matters during the CAPprice negotiations and it was impossible to reopen the settlement now.Furthermore it was necessary to preserve the position that the onus of decision lay on the Government so long as it could command a parliamentary majority: and if it could not do the latter a veryserious situation arose.    Accordingly the Governments responseneeded most careful consideration.    The best course might be tointroduce a Motion asking the House to approve the CAP price ^settlement as a whole: this seemed likely to command a majority.The wording and timing would need careful thought and there was no need to settle the details before the Recess.    It was howevernecessary to reassure the industry that the legal position would remain4unchanged.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the best course would be for the Government totable a Motion after the Recess which would represent the measures inquestion as part of the settlement of CAP prices which the Governmenthad accepted and seek approval for the latter.    The Lord President ofthe Council, in consultation with the Foreign and commonwealth secretary, the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection,the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Chief Whip,should consider the terms in which this Motion should be drafted.    In2
the meantime it was important that the industry should be left in nodoubt that the legality of the Regulation on skimmed milk powder wasunaffected.    It would be necessary, therefore, to make an early statement setting out the legal position and indicating that theGovernment would bring the matter back to the House in an appropriateway after the Recess.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion and invited theLord President of the Council^ in consultation withother Ministers concerned, to proceed accordingly.3
3.        THE PRIME MINISTER, reporting on the meeting of theEuropean Council in Luxembourg on 1 and 2 April, said that no majordecisions were taken, and none should have been expected.    TheCouncil should provide an opportunity for informal and privatediscussions between Heads of Government on broad politicaldevelopments, and any attempt to reach formal decisions on specificissues should be resisted.    Against this background the sour note inthe Press, which was based on unrealistic expectations, wasunjustified.    We had achieved our main objective of ensuring that theCommunity should consider what could be done about unemploymentdespite the Federal German Chancellors reluctance in an electionyear to support proposals which might require German financialcontributions.    Work would proceed in preparation for the tripartite Conference in June or July and for the July meeting of theEuropean Council.    By contrast, the French objective of securing alofty declaration on economic and monetary union had run into thesand.On direct elections President Giscard had, for tactical reasons,abandoned the French argument for the allocation of seats in proportion to national populations and had instead proposed continuingwith the existing numbers of seats allocated to member Btates.    this approach had proved unacceptable to countries with numerous minorityparties and Italy had taken the lead in rejecting it.    The matter would now be considered further by Foreign Ministers and we would continueto press for greater proportionality in the allocation of seats.    It was still the aim to hold direct elections in 1978 though others were nowalso coming to realise the practical problems involved.    It had however been agreed that the election period would run from Thursdayto Sunday: and that the Assembly would continue to be officially sodescribed but could be referred to informally as a Parliament.    TheGovernment&apos;8 suggestion of a Select Committee had been well received in the House of Commons: and Cabinet approval for thenecessary arrangements would be sought after Easter.The Tindemans Report had been the subject of a lengthy butinconclusive discussion.    The Council had agreed to a very usefuldeclaration in support of our position on Rhodesia; and had alsoadopted a useful declaration on the Lome Convention.    We had stressed the importance of a revision of the Common Fisheries Policyand of the implementation of the Dublin statement on imports of NewZealand butter.    Useful informal discussions had also taken place onSouthern Africa, detente and defence, the Lebanon, Spain and Portugal.The Cabinet -L Took note of the statement by the PrimeMinister.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES reported on the visit he had paid to Tanzania and Mozambique in his former capacity as  minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.    He saidthat his visit had been designed to follow up the statement ofGovernment policy made to the House of Commons on 22 March by the then Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary,    His aim had been toensure a continuing dialogue with President Nyerere of Tanzania andto initiate a dialogue with President Machel of Mozambique.    Inaddition, he had wished to discuss with the latter the question ofBritish aid for Mozambique,    Both Presidents had warmly welcomedMr Callagh2n&apos;s statement to the House of Commons.   Neither of themwanted to see a fight to a finish in Rhodesia and they therefore hoped for a negotiated settlement in due course.   At the same time they didnot wish to see new peace plans brought forward in the very nearfuture because to do so might cut across the agreement reached by thefour Presidents on their joint commitment to armed struggle.    Asbetween President Nyerere and President Machel he observed some differences of view, especially with regard to the leadership of the african National Council, with President Nyerere more inclined thanPresident Machel to support Mr Joshua Nkomo.    However,President Machel had been quite clear about the dangers of a longdrawn out struggle in Rhodesia which would assume an increasinglyracial character, with Rhodesia losing its white population and theirexpertise, just as Mozambique had suffered the loss of its Portugueseexperts.    He had corrected a misunderstanding on the part of president Machel, who had thought that 85 per cent of our offer of 15 million aid for Mozarobieque would be in grant form.    ThePresident had welcomed our intention to send an aid team toMozambique and also welcomed the Commonwealth initiative which hadbeen proposedby the Commonwealth Secretary General, Mr Ramphal.The prospects in Rhodesia were for a continuing but gradual build-upof guerrilla activity, but he did not expect the conflict to r*ach majorproportions before 1977,    For the time being we should refrain fromany new efforts but should emphasise our existing proposals.    In due course an opportunity for a further British initiative might well arise.The Cabinet -2,        Took note of the statement by the Secretaryof State for Social Services.
4.        THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the concept which he had outlined in his Budget Speech of additional tax relief conditional on a low pay limit for the next round had beensurprisingly well understood and was receiving an encouraging amountof support from the general public.    So far as the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) were concerned he had so far talked only to theirrepresentatives on the National Economic Development Council.They felt it would be very difficult to persuade their AnnualConferences to accept a limit which, Jf it were to achieve its main objective of a further significant reduction in inflation, would not leave sufficient room to correct major anomalies or restoredifferentials.    On the other hand ttiey did not wish to be held responsible for sacrificing the prospect of additional tax relief, ,andthey broadly accepted the need for general acceptance of a pay policywhich would be successful.    The further talks which he and hisnegotiating colleagues would be having with the TUC would need to becompleted within about a month since the TUC General Council would need to decide in early May what recommendations to make to theprobable Conference of Union Executives later that month.   Amongthe arguments for limiting pay increases to 3 per cent were theprospect of a rather greater increase in world prices in 1977, andsome upward drift in actual earnings above that allowed for during theoperation of the  6 pay limit due to factors such as mobility andovertime rather than evasion.    U therefore we wished to cutinflation by half we must reduce the rate of earnings increase byrather more than half to allow for drift and price increases.Despite the very considerable difficulties he hoped that the TUC would recognise the advantage of a low pay limit to protect employment andpriceb and that agreement would be reached on a figure near to 3 percent.    The first reactions of the TUC to his proposals, coupled withthe strikes at the British Leyland Motor Corporation, had caused .renewed pressure on sterling, but there had been greater stabilityduring the past two days: a nervous and volatile market must however be anticipated pending agreement on a satisfactory pay limit with the *TUC.In discussion it was pointed out that the TUC had been put in a verydifficult position by the way the 3 per cent proposal had been presented in the Budget Speech and their hostility should not be under-rated.    It was they who would have to deliver support for a successful second year of pay policy, and the initial favourablepublic reaction was not necessarily relevant.   It was also a greatpity that the approach which the TUC themselves were evolving couldnot have been considered before the Government put forward its ownideas: some features of that approach, for example a possible choice between a flat and percentage increase, might have considerablemerit In providing the flexibility which would be needed.    Further-more the attack on inflation might be better served by a lees6
ambitious target which would command the full support of the TUCrather than one which secured at best only their grudging acceptance.Nevertheless the link made between taxation and pay, though raisingsome interesting constitutional questions, could be seen as a valuable development in free collective bargaining and in opengovernment: and it might be helped if the negotiations were broadenedto include matters of social policy as well as pay.    On the otherhand it was argued that the Chancellor of the Exchequer hadnecessarily had to specify the pay limit which would be needed if therate of inflation were to be reduced to that of our competitors; andmany of these had also been making progress In their own counter-inflationary measures.    The Government must now strive to themaximum to achieve a limit of 3 per cent.    Nothing would do more toimprove industrial confidence.    We were still paying for the pent-upinflation of the past: and although good progress was being made wecould not afford to link the pay limit to price increases at a time whendepreciation was itself affecting the Retail Price Index.    The right course for the Government was to continue to urge the advantages ofIts proposals In a conciliatory spirit.    There was every reason to expect a responsible reaction from the TUC and it was relevant thatwider issues of policy had already been taken into consideration inthe Budget which had met 85 per cent of the tuc&apos;s recommendations.Any further concessions should be reserved for later considerationwhen they might be needed to clinch final agreement on the pay limit.The present economic situation was perilous and would remain so forthe next 18 months.    We could not therefore afford to relax, but should rather intensify our efforts.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, Baid thatinflation was being reduced but could again be stimulated by the prospective upturn in the economy.    Further progress in reducinginflation was therefore essential in this critical year.    In theircontinuing negotiations with the TUC, the Chancellor of the Exchequer   .and the other Ministers directly concerned would take into account the&apos;points which had been made In discussion.    The important thing was togive the Chancellor of the Exchequer the maximum support in developing in a non-provocative way the general concept he had &quot;*outlined in his Budget Speech about the relationship between incomes and taxation.    Ministers should therefore take every opportunity ofthis In speeches.    They should also stress the advantages his proposals would have in maintaining employment, reducing inflation,encouraging investment and maintaining our competitive position as a nation.    The benefits of stability should be contrasted with the direconsequences of further inflation.    Backbenchers should also be encouraged to take up the theme.    Suitable background material wouldbe circulated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Privy Council *Office.
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister &apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office13 April 19768
