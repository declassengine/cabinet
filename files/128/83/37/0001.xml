Acquired NV^PilE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Sub-Committee of the Immune	and Social Affairs Committee (H(a)) which was dealing with the

Deficiency /pr^vof Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) had met on 11 Syndrome	Np^mtster and had agreed that the Government&apos;s health and education

pro&amp;r^mme on AIDS should be immediately stepped up. The Secretary of Previous	Stat^e&lt;  ^^ Social Services had announced this after the meeting. A new

Reference:	roun^vM^n^wspaper advertisements would start in the following week,

CC(86) 36.2	with avWster campaign beginning at the end of the month and a campaign

aimed a^young people carrying on through December. There would be material on television and a leaflet would be delivered to all households as soon as the Post Office could manage it. There might be some complainLer^Miat this material was shocking, but there was no way of avoiding thisinf ^he Government was to make a meaningful effort to save lives by makin^36^S&gt;facts known to those at risk. The Sub-Committee would have two nraetings in the following week, at which it would begin to consider moreMw^ucult issues, of which there were many. In particular, much or^^Poublic pressure that appeared to be building up for screening paid ^  ^n^^egard to reality. But public attitudes were highly volatile on sircir^mer  ive subjects and the management of the AIDS issue would continue to^^^re very careful handling for some time to come. The responsible h^fdling of the matter was not, however, helped by the partisan behaviour^ei^dfrt&gt;osition spokesmen who had vied with each other in naming extravagenfS^c^ys^pf money that should be diverted to the fight against AIDS.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCML^^ICES said that he had obtained the agreement of the Chairman of the^FoVjtpoffice for the distribution of the leaflet to all households to take	in the first week of

January 1987, which was considerabl^^^rlier than the Post Office had hitherto accepted. In accordance wily^^fre Sub-Committee&apos;s decisions, he was about to have discussions with the^Ghairman of the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Independent Broadcasting Authority about the possibility of their mounting broadcasts on a public service basis. In the meantime it was important that there should be no speculation about this in the press, but he yfsrSf&apos;  t&gt;timistic that the broadcasting authorities would wish to be co\aaej  hive in this matter.

He intended also to speak to the Labour Party sraSlceranan and to offer him the chance to talk with his Department&apos;s medica^J^awya^ers. He would then have a better idea whether it would be possiestablish any common ground.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said/j^t the issues that would need to be considered, following the initiar^defiyfeions on publicity, would require the most careful judgment. It&apos;^a^^Nready clear that the issue of screening involved the cons ideratixMiya^ extremely difficult issues. The Opposition parties could, &apos;^T^ei&amp;rse, associate themselves with the Government&apos;s approach to the pvda%ej    


   vyZ^2*	posed by AIDS and thus create an atmosphere of bi-partisan co-operation.

It would	not be	right, however, to let the	Opposition parties put

&apos;&apos;	pressure	on the	Government by making their	co-operation contingent on

demands that the Government were unwilling to accept.

%

Abolition of /prewlCRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that the Bill to abolish Domestic	dpdjie3  ic rates in Scotland would be introduced in the House of Commons

UateS	at tK^end of the month. Its preparation was ahead of schedule and he

(Scotland)	wa^gjillwfihistic that it would both complete its Second Reading and start

gill	its Csromj^tee stage in the House of Commons before the Christmas Recess.

THE PRT^: MINISTER said that the speedy enactment of this measure was of the greatest importance, and thought should be given to improving its Parliamentary timetable yet further.

The Peacock THE HOME	SECRETAR  -^ayd that the debate to	be held the following

Report	Thursday	on the	Re^oc^^f the Committee on	Financing the British

Broadcasting CorporaJH^Sarvithe Peacock Report) would be important in revealing attitudes rosh^natter in Parliament, though he did not at this stage intend to r^e^pNzhe policy that was currently being formulated. The OppositMmj^yre expected to divide the House in this debate, on the motion fors~ady&apos;ptfrnment.

HOME AFFAIRS 2. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCAMON AND SCIENCE said that talks were still continuing between the unions and employers on the fresh Teachers&apos; Pay, package which was emerging from the negotiations earlier in the week. Duties and	On pay structure the package appeared	to	be modelled on that produced	at

Conditions of Coventry. This was unsatisfactory on	dif ferdrfOmls and unacceptable.

Service	It was claimed that the 13 conditions	in	the\j  ^c^  ge met all the 19

conditions the Government had set out	in	their j&amp;ffem. On pay levels,	it

Previous	was also costed to fall within, or very close tsc-^p&amp;d)amounts proposed

Reference:	by the Government. However, the package also inc^iwp^dditional add-on

CC(86) 36.2	costs, which would cost well over   200 million in a^rotl\year. As such,

it would simply not be acceptable to the Governmentattitudes to the offer were divided. The two largest unions - the Na^ernal Union of Teachers and the Assistant Masters and Mistresses Associ^iiaVi had accepted the proposals but the other unions still had no^rO^Kte Professional Association of Teachers, the National AssocifiH^wiv&gt;f Head Teachers and the Secondary Heads Association were concerneo^apctflt various aspects of the package, particularly those dealing w


   structure. The National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers who were endeavouring to recruit more members from other unions had also rejected the offer on the grounds that the pay rates were insufficient. It was possible, though unlikely, that the differences between the unions might still be overcome and that an announcement of   v\  he package would be made in advance of the debate on education that v^diternoon. If this occurred then he would not be drawn into commenting /^Vn^detail on the package. He would instead maintain the line that he /4  s&lt;6ed to examine it carefully to see whether it met all the conditions M^J^ad been attached to the Government&apos;s offer, the main features of vrnicl^ie would reassert. In the remainder of his speech, he would co^eflpS^te on the Government&apos;s other initiatives in the education field and	the reasons why it was necessary to repeal the Remuneration

of TeMMrs Act. If events developed as expected it appeared likely that tr&gt;&amp; Government would have to act to impose its offer in the forthcoming Bill on teachers&apos; pay. Instructions on this Bill had now been sent to Parliamentary Counsel. It would contain provisions to abolish the Burnham Committee, set up an interim advisory committee on pay and conditions and give him new regulation-making powers. He hoped this Bill woirCkhJEfts a speedy passage through Parliament. He must warn colleagues that(ihejHb would certainly be further disruption in schools but he could not^wpe^lct what form this would take. It would be important to prev^ify^rtpis action being turned into a protest over union bargaining rights,	invoke sympathy in the wider trades union

movement where at pre  ^&gt;t  *here was little sympathy for further action on teachers&apos; pay.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE Fok^Q&amp;LAND said that both press and public reaction to the Government^f^raer had been extremely good. The ballot of teachers would take place^sjSi^tly and the result should be available by about 25 November. It wasVjra^ted that this would result in a rejection of the offer but thiV&apos;w^^by no means a foregone conclusions. Even if the vote was for resection tpxpe was some doubt as to whether the unions could sustain further acti^jK^y-ven the public reaction and growing disenchantment amongst teaSit^^&apos; with suc^ a course.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a shorV^iscussion, said that it was most important to avoid creating the impressrLon that the Government were prepared to negotiate over the terms of any package now proposed or to make additional funds available. The packageannounced by the Government had not been for negotiation. It/gHould therefore be made clear that any consideration of a package wa^vj^o^s^e how far it met the conditions set out in the Government&apos;s offer, ^f^^as also important that the Government maintained the initiative. \The^ftiions were unlikely to get much support from parents if the dispute w^^^/j^longed and it should be possible to build up public support for t^p^^&amp;rernment&apos;s position. To this end it was vital that the very	terms the

Government had offered should continue to be made widely^    own and that emphasis should be given to the fact that the costs of^iwiBtettlement would have to be borne by the taxpayer and ratepayer.


   The Cabinet -

1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary ViyM	of State for Education and Science to be guided accordingly.

Lnniversary of TjHiXi&amp;CRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that as foreshadowed in Ithe Anglo- nis^Mport to the Cabinet the previous week, a new Protestant Iish	org    i  2tion had now been formed known as Ulster Resistance. The

  Agreement	organy^a^on of this group was still surrounded with some secrecy but it

was ci^ar that the Ulster Clubs were involved and that it had some links with Pr^festant paramilitary groups. The official Unionists were maintaining their distance. The first of the protest rallies planned to mark the anniversary of the Anglo-Irish Agreement had passed off peaceably. Ra^Ebes would continue throughout the week culminating in a major demonsoration in Belfast at the weekend which could lead to some violent incid&amp;o^^Nlt was also likely that there would be some disruption in tmeeiectricity supply of the Province over the weekend as a result of actibtr^a/the guise of an industrial dispute at the Ballylumford poweir&apos;I^a^ion. This was not expected to last beyond the weekend and contingarf/zw&apos;jsh.ans had been drawn up. Finally a protest was planned in his own conswMency at the weekend by certain unionist elements and the Natioi^3  0J&amp;ont.

Contacts	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH^Efi^TARY said that the Indian Government

with Sikh	were understandably and highly&apos;^sep^^ive to any question involving Sikh

Nationalists nationalism. It had been possilfta t^recognise their anxieties about extradition by offering them a satC^Ttartory treaty, but it remained vital that they should not be giveioi^&apos; cause for thinking that the United Kingdom did not take their coqoa^rfs seriously. It was important that members of the Government should\ao all they reasonably could to avoid contacts with Sikh nationalists which might be misrepresented by the latter as expressions of Government support for the cause of an independent Khalistan.	^

I Unemployment THE PAYMASTER GENERAL said that the unemployment ^  ^^s for October I Figures	that would be announced that day were extremely got^av^^he unadjusted

total showed a fall of 95,743 and the seasonally adjtf^^cKJiigure a fall I Previous	of 25,000. This was the third successive month in whiciMiite total had

I Reference:	fallen and the fall over three months was the biggest	973. An

I CC(86) 31.4 attempt would be made by the Opposition to denigrate thevfeu&amp;jtes and to maintain that they were the result of changes in the methorfi&apos;vtvEOunting rather than any real change. These attacks needed to be vx^ojrt&amp;jely rebutted. A particular effective means of doing so was to rVfjithe


   figures on vacancies where there had been no change in the method of /   //counting for some years but which now stood at their highest level since 1979. The Scottish figures showed a small rise in unemployment due to a decline in activities in the North Sea Oil industry.

FOREIGN	3.	EIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there had been

AFFAIRS	meetiifa^vetween the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze,

and thaXUnited States Secretary of State, Mr George Shultz, in Vienna on Lrms	5 and b November, on which Mr Shultz had subsequently reported to the

Control	North Atlantic Council. He himself had had a discussion on 12 November

with Mr Paul Nirfr^e, a senior adviser on arms control to the United Previous	States Adminifaira^ion. The Sovet Union was laying maximum stress in

Reference:	propaganda on^th^prf.aim that massive progress in nuclear arms control

CC(86) 36.3 was within reach(bu):J was being blocked by rigidity on the part of the United States insi^TO^ing curbs on the Strategic Defence Initiative.

The Soviet Union IMsIlafaso stressing again that the United Kingdom and France should join ^h^p^ocess of nuclear arms control. Yet, when the Soviet Union on 7 No^m^e^had tabled amended proposals in the negotiations with the	States in Geneva, it had become clear that

many of the major diffi  uiti)as presented by the Soviet position, for instance concerning veriKfcf^H^m and limits on shorter range nuclear weapons, were still presen^^^Mrly progress was unlikely. The Soviet Union would no doubt seek t^e^sizoit the situation to undermine public support in Western Europe forp   jfc^^ar, deterrence and to maintain the separation of nuclear arms conxi&apos;oL^rcom arms control in the field of conventional weapons. The Prime^wiryfeter1s Guildhall speech on 10 November had set out clearly tl^^^jiernment&apos; s position about the importance of nuclear deterrence.	were signs that people in the

United States were beginning to appr^/z^^^ the real difficulties in a sweeping approach to nuclear arms con^l^l. The Prime Minister planned during her visit to the United States Mie following weekend to explain the Government&apos;s views to the United States President.

    

Conference on THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said th^^ft^yeview meeting of Security and	the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Ev^^w/XCSCE) in Vienna

| Co-operation	was settling down for a long period of discussion. /^ft^NWest would put

in Europe	the Soviet Union under pressure for its failure to	with the

Helsinki Final Act. A Soviet proposal for a meeting to/&lt;6^cuss humanitarian issues in Moscow was being treated cautiovred^yyy the West. If such a meeting took place, it would be essential for\^a  arp^sted groups and individuals to have proper access to it and for^Ae^e to be full scope for press reporting. This proposal was an illu^trajj^on of the growing sophistication of Soviet tactics in foreign


   SJHp FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that discussion of Syrian support for terrorism at the meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Previous/^ European Community countries on 10 November had gone well. All twelve Refere4    &gt;^\ countries had agreed to implement the package of measures against Syria CC(86)	which the United Kingdom had proposed. Greece, with notable

&apos;&quot;&apos;-^VVanconsistency, had not been willing to subscribe to the text or to vTv i*riticise Syrian involvement in terrorism. The public impact of the &apos;^^iieating had been somewhat reduced by reports that the United States was /  initiating with Iran about the release of American hostages in the &apos;   mlidpty East and that France was negotiating for similar purposes with ityrLaoand other Middle Eastern countries. The Governments of the United St^Cfea^fad France were denying that they had entered into specific barga&apos;ms involving the relase of hostages, but their activities tended to un  4raiTne the position of the West and of the United Kingdom that there sftrmld be no compromise with terrorists.

o

Israel	THE FOREIGN AN^GpEtMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there was considerable

public interest fan Hie case of Mr Mordecai Vanunu, an Israeli citizen who had been in &apos;vEevjJnited Kingdom and had written a major press article about Israel&apos;s cajwrtv^bCfcy in the field of nuclear weapons. Mr Vanunu had disappeared in the	Kingdom and reappeared in police custody in

Israel. The GovernmMfi^sKauld not appear indifferent to the possibility that Mr VanajM^ftad been removed from the United Kingdom by the Israeli authorities//xWa Government had been pressing Israel to make the position clear. \3^s&apos;&amp;tement by the Israeli Cabinet denying that Mr Vanunu had been kitfrf&amp;ivp&apos;ed from British soil but giving no explanation of how he reachad/Tarael had merely fuelled speculation.

The Government had asked Mr	lawyer in Israel to confirm that he

had left the United Kingdom vownt^rily but the lawyer had declined to answer without the permission ofi^tne^sraeli Government. There was a possibility that the Israeli Gove&amp;Mi  i)Jt-&gt;.might be willing to provide clearer assurances on a conf identiSJ^asis; the Government should look carefully	at such a	possibility. Anj^^pications	that packages large

enough to	contain a	person had been d^^atched by	the Israeli Embassy	or

Consulate	should be	thoroughly investigated, even	if they seemed

unlikely to be suspect.

In a brief discussion, it was noted that the/w61yce were looking into the question of freight despatched by the Isinael^_E|mbassy and Consulate and that there had been an Israeli connection w/ytlTSnhe abduction of the former Minister of{Transport of Nigeria, Mr UmaVJji-d^kko, from the United Kingdom in 1984.	^t

The Cabinet -

Took note.


   \COmWk	THE SECRETARY 0F STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that at the Transport

aFFAv^m^ Council on 10-11 November the discussion on greater liberalisation of

__	air transport had led to substantial progress on capacity and market

Air TrsroSfromt access. A decision had been blocked principally on the question of

\y  ^/\cheaper fares and the conditions attaching to them. Six member states, /^sA^owever, now favoured the liberal position on fares. Public perception the issues was now clearer, and he would continue to seek progress on v&apos;ywji^ke lines.
