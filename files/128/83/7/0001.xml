Debate on \&gt;rajiyLORD PRIVY SEAL said that a large part of the debate on 27 February the Reports ^fyOk&amp;tain Reports of the Select Committee on Procedure would be    tjje House	coj*   ecnkd with the proposals to timetable automatically the Committee

Lf commons	Stag  ^o&amp;^ll Bills which seemed likely to take more than 25 hours in

procedure	Commit^e^. The arrangements would be supervised by a new Select

[ommittee	Commit^e^&apos;which would estimate the time likely to be taken and invoke

the new/brer^dure if it seemed likely to be more than 25 hours. This would cotSajiderably hamper the Government&apos;s control of legislation in the House of Commons and have serious repercussions in the House of Lords.

It was possible that the recommendation would secure support from backbenchers on both sides of the House, however, since they would regard it as bei^gy\ore efficient and less burdensome for backbenchers than the presenKjjiMcedures. It would be necessary for Ministers to be present to vote 01/^11^ occasion.

bisposal of THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COC^C^^aid that Cabinet had last week Radioactive	discussed the problems posed b^/W^p^sGovernment s existing policy for the

Paste	disposal of radioactive waste, (pr^Wtuid decided that the Home and

Social Affairs Committee (H) shoul^io^sider further a new suggestion Previous	made by the Secretary of State for t^KEnvironment for the disposal of

Reference:	low level and short-lived intermediS^S^^^^iioactive waste in under-sea

JC(86) 6th galleries. This the Committee had now^zfcbut were not able to agree Donclusions, that even a feasibility study into thi^^ew proposal was appropriate, iinute 5	It was clear that the new system would considerably more expensive

than the existing methods of waste disposal, by a factor varying between four and eight times. It was the strong view of the Secretary of State for Energy, supported by the Attorney General	, if action was taken

on these lines, the almost inevitable result touIv be a reopening of the inquiry into a pressurised water reactor at SiwVeivvand delay to the inquiry about the reprocessing plant at Dounreay\X^O&gt;   would have had an adverse impact on the British nuclear industryl^2bfema jority of the Committee had, therefore, concluded that a feasibilLwv^udy on under-sea disposal should not be undertaken and tha  .	evious

proposal, to go ahead with exploratory drilling on fourH*  fcs, was preferable. When the geological exploration had been c6j&amp;feds,ed and the results assessed, a decision would need to be taken . aboirt^j^Vmany of the sites should be put to a public inquiry. They were a  P^V&amp;ared to run the risk of damage to the nuclear industry by any furtn^c&apos;^e^ay. It was his personal view that the statement which announced the ^i^Aogical explorations on the four sites could minimise the political

&lt;y%


   difficulties by emphasising the exploratory nature of the test drilling, v It could also emphasise the very full consideration of all the aspects &lt;0 which would be taken into account before a site was chosen. He * ^recognised that this would present the Government with a very difficult C/lvp-year period but felt that it was necessary to accept this now as the tenable course of action.

lowing points were made in discussion -

T	There was a need for greater public awareness of the low level

^of^pisk involved in the type of facility which was being proposed.   x  ^r&amp;vel waste contained very low levels of radioactivity and the pr^ycbion given by the type of facility proposed was more than ad^wiirce. An education campaign mounted by the nuclear industry couemphasise these points.

b.	The fear of radioactivity could not easily be overcome by

public education. The fears aroused were easily and considerabroyolayed upon by those who were opposed to nuclear power, in MS/jggdia and elsewhere. There was some danger that any attempt to	serious education campaign would be used by the

opponents of t^^iclear industry to increase the publicity against it. If it wer^pM^Xble to wait - which it might well not be -there could be s^^wantage in not starting a new campaign before the receipt of th^r^D&amp;ft of the Sizewell inquiry. The current situation at Sellaf^^K^as also unhelpful. There was some reason to think that memberi^f)staff who were sympathetic to Greenpeace were active in informrag^Cii^L media of developments there.

c.	There would be someVhrfw&amp;htage in announcing the geological exploration of one site onb^^nce this would reduce opposition. There would, however, be a greaj^jrisk that the site explored and subsequently taken to a publj  ^ijHpairy would not be regarded as the most suitable. The history of&lt;i  t*mpting to proceed on a single site basis for controversial {  tttiZcies showed that they almost invariably led to a series of re&apos;&amp;fa&amp;is with consequential delay.

In addition, the single site woul^jiave to be Elstow; this would break assurances, given to local Members of Parliament and residents, that other sites would be considered.

d.	One reason why opposition to any nu/rean facility was so

strong was that there were very few advan^ag^ws-^to be gained from agreeing to its establishment. In some othew^c^untries for example France, financial advantages of some kind wVqrt^/WOvided for inhabitants of the area in which a nuclear	was sited.

This could take the form of cheaper electricitjQ^^educed property taxation. Recent events around Stansted and intone had shown how the financial advantages of development	alter

people&apos;s attitudes. On the other hand, it was poiM^Jdut that the fear of the effects of radiation was probably greate&lt;^p4H the nuisance created by aircraft or traffic, for example,&lt;^^tote the very good safety record of the nuclear industry. Grea\&gt;caye would have to be taken in considering any system of f inancialMyjW^ment.


   m	THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that this was a

difficult decision. It was necessary to maintain a range of sites so that the assessment could be seen to be valid when the final choice reached a public inquiry. Although proceedings with a single site might in some ways appear more attractive, it would be a risky option and /^s&gt;?Vwould break assurances already given to local Members of Parliament and &apos;\j&gt;j^esidents of Elstow. Further study should be given to the possibility ^^  ^creating a climate favourable to nuclear industry developments by ^/^qmeVform of financial inducement for those immediate affected. The g^Joiipkt agreed that the Secretary of State for the Environment should majrf^^statement to Parliament setting out his intention to introduce a Spe^5^M)evelopment Order approving the test drilling on the four sites sugg  s/^dPby the Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Executive. The text of tna^kcatement should be cleared in advance with colleagues.

The Cabinet -

2.	Inv,j^e&lt;Kthe Secretary of State for the Environment (j)o make a statement to Parliament as soon a^^Si^ible announcing that he would shortly bri^g&gt;fAj^ward a Special Development Order approVrtJ&amp;inest drilling in relation to four sites.

Pit Closures THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOS^^JSY said that the National Coal Board

(NCB) would today be issuiiC&amp;i^ statement to the effect that they had not accepted the recommendationsvto^^^ie modified colliery review procedure in relation to Bates CollieryTy^iK^^&gt; was the second colliery which had been subject to the procedure. v&apos;ihg^Dirst review, which had been undertaken by a nominee of the Na^^otja^ Union of Mineworkers, had recommended that the pit should be^M^SAd. The nominee of the NCB, who had undertaken the review of Bates	ery, had recommended that some

  20 million should be invested in it,  wjrf  &amp;t recognising that even after this it would still make a loss, althcw^n it would be capable of contributing to overheads and providin^vbenefits in the area of the colliery. The NCB were not prepared to accept this recommendation and therefore proposed to close the pit. Clearly this was an embarrassing conclusion and would no doubt be used to claii*^ih5i|t the modified colliery review procedure was a sham. There was .vhowever. no alternative to proceeding with the statement aS&quot;^*(gMSted by the NCB.

The Cabinet -

3.	Took note.

I Shops Bill	THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Shops Bill had now passed \\s^s  ages in

I	the House of Lords and had survived the experience remarkably^^^^ It


   now approached its Second Reading in the House of Commons. It would be most helpful if colleagues would use every opportunity over the weekend put forward the case for the Bill. He would circulate briefing rial to assist that process.

1k   	.........

creations Secri^5&gt;of State, Home Office (Mr Mellor), on television the previous &gt; t tion evenin^^dL given the impression that the Government were satisfied that &apos; Tchildren the pr&amp;^tfi&amp;TL in Mr Winston Churchill&apos;s Obscene Publications (Protection     ) Bill	of Child^j*^2tc) Bill to remove the exemption the broadcasting

authorities currently enjoyed from prosecution under the Obscene Publication^ Act 1959 was unnecessary because of the internal control the authorities exercised by virtue of their governing charter or statute over standards. Her office had that morning in consequence received a numbe^&apos;&amp;k complaints that the Government was giving insufficient suj^rkLto the Bill. The Bill was one on which a number of members of the Gov^S^nt, including herself, held strong views and they had voted for it	Reading. There was increasing concern over

the effects of violejroeAja television on crimes of violence and recent television programmes ^  J^Khannel 4 had cast doubt on the efficacy of the broadcasting authoritie^w^idelines.

THE HOME SECRETARY said t^^re^roe Government had indicated general sympathy with the intentioN^^^W Churchill&apos;s Bill when it had received a Second Reading, but there w^^ractical difficulties with some of his specific proposals. Discussi^V^re still in progress with Mr Churchill about amendments whi^r^wjiLd be made to ensure that his intention was carried out more e^^c^vvely. He believed that there was a possibility of reaching agreement.^/H^^ndertook to keep colleagues fully informed of developments.

iritish	THE SECRETARY OF STATE	FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY Va^^^at there had been a

.eyland	meeting earlier in the	week in Detroit between rKg^pw^utatives of

British Leyland (BL) and General Motors (GM) at wh^hrAt had been agreed &apos;revious	to work for completion	of the Salton deal within fiv^^6  &gt;!six weeks. It

leference:	had been emphasised by	GM that if the deal did not g&apos;^^^&apos;^jigh they might

:c(86) 6th	well have to close down their Bedford truck operation, ^-^flressions of

  onclusions,	interest in acquiring parts of BL&apos;s commercial vebicles^^re*|ition ha

linute 1	also been received from a number of other parties, who	asked to

indicate by 4 March whether they had a firm intention to iraJreViro offer (including an indication on price) and to outline their intentions for the business. There ws also the possibility management buy-out proposals emerging in respect of Land Rover


   Freight Rover and, separately, in respect of Leyland Bus. Parliamentary handling had proved difficult over the past week and had been much v	exacerbated by a number of leaks, including a breach of Lobby rules.

   )	Delicate handling would be needed over the coming weeks; there was a

clear risk of the GM deal falling through with no credible alternative ^^emerging.

&apos;^y/^f^discussion the following points were made -

Kr	The difficult handling problem in the coming week would not be

  /^peiafined to the House of Commons. Strong opposition was being ^J^ycountered in the House of Lords and from outside Parliament. It most important that the Government&apos;s case for exploring the possibilities of a sale was made effectively.

b.	Attention was being focussed on the Land Rover part of the deal, which was the most emotive element, and the problems of Leyland/ittreks had received little coverage. The employment consequM^eViif the various options had also become submerged; the GM proposlz/1i    ned likely to prove the best solution from an employmentwjj^wpaint. Although no explicit mention should be made of the risk iE^^/edford, it could be pointed out in general terms that the Saltowas not the only option available to GM in dealing with tn^flro^lems of Bedford.

c.	It was notab	opposition to the deal was being expressed

by some who, a few ^^  ^/  earlier, had opposed continued subsidy even at the cost of cj^iph. Critics could be challenged themselves to assume	taxpayer the financial risks of

maintaining United Kign&amp;Jja^pjpaership of Land Rover Leyland.

d.	United Kingdom opposrtipJ^-Qp Salton and the ending of the talks with Ford, risked prov^kuw a backlash against United Kingdom investments in the United Sta^sj^pn the other hand United States multinationals were accustomecr&apos;hSyEuropean political sensitivities, and were unlikely to over-react.vo^^

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion said that the issue needed to be handled most carefully in the coming weeks. She would set up a small Group consisting of those Ministers closgiy concerned to review tactics and handling. In the light of develcranenfcs, a further collective discussion would be arranged befor^^iaad. decisions were taken. In the meantime, the Secretary of State/ifor) Trade and Industry would circulate a brief for use in answering quover the weekend.

The Cabinet -

5.	Took note, with approval of the Prime	v/y\

Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.


   6.	Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to circulate a brief to Cabinet colleagues for their use over the coming weekend.

FOREIGN	MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE (BARONESS

AFFAIRS	said that Iranian forces still held the Iraqi port of Fao.

--	fighting continued. Chemical weapons had been used by Iraq and

Iran/lraq	pc^^btx by Iran. Iraq would probably be able to retake Fao but this

War	mijfirtf^ake some time. The Iranian capture of Fao had no great military

signi/&gt;&lt;^mce. Iran was not immediately threatening Kuwait. The Previous	occupation of Fao was a propaganda coup for Iran and a political setback

Reference:	for Iraq. There was no evidence that Iran would launch a major

CC(86) 6th	offensive elsewhere. The matter was being discussed in the United

Conclusions,	Nations Security Council. It was unlikely that a resolution passed

Minute 2	there would vCkdyto a cease-fire. Nevertheless the United Kingdom was

working for SAjjaraaced resolution calling for an end to hostilities and the observance dr&apos;&quot;Tmyernatinal law, especially in relation to chemical weapons. There\we^e^about 120 British citizens in the Basra area of Iraq, but none in^rf^/aar Fao.

The	THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN^  i#&lt;  OMMONWEALTH OFFICE said that there

j Philippines	was an uneasy calm in Manila follp^ai^ the declaration on 15 February by

the incumbent President, Mr Ferdrfiaijd^iarcos, that he had won the recent I Previous	Presidential election. The officiM^j?&lt;3?plt, which gave President Marcos

Reference:	a majority of 1.5 million votes, hacT^Siyijtle credibility. President

CC(86) 6th Marcos showed no sign of giving up thra  #residency, although his Conclusions, political standing had been seriously cmninished. The defeated Minute 2	opposition candidate for the Presidency, Mrs Corazon Aquino, had

launched a campaign of non-violent civil disobedience, which was backed by the Roman Catholic church. It was not cleap   whether Mrs Aquino&apos;s supporters would remain united in the new s i trfpFnqn. There was a risk of violence provoked by radicals on the left &apos;^^tfre&gt;vpolitical spectrum or by hard-liners among the military. The UnitrfirSnates President&apos;s special envoy, Mr Philip Habib, was in Manila airg*-tjjgK\seen President Marcos and Mrs Aquino. He was avoiding public com{jieiic^&lt;v There was pressure in the United States    Congress to cut off eaowwfai aid to the Philippines but the Administration was opposed to thj^N\ Xhe member countries of the European Community had issued a statemeja^^an 14 February expressing concern about the conduct of the el^^rSny

In a short discussion about the question of United Kingdom representation at the inauguration of President Marcos, due\to^jfe^ce place on 25 February, it was pointed out that the conduct ot&apos;^lfc^.ons


   &lt;/^\ k	countries   as open to criticise and the United Kingdom might not

iish to withhold official representation at the subsequent rnaugur.trons all such cases. On the other hand, the present case was yery ^^Vlunusual, because the member countries of the European Community ha ^    Xiticised the conduct of the election. The attendance of an official &lt;^&apos;  $tish representative might seem strangely inconsistent with that \wfticism One option under consideration among the European Community &lt;SK%es   was attendance by representatives of their Embassies in Manila below that of Ambassador.

international THE SECRETARY OF STATE F^^DE AND INDUSTRY said that the banks En Council involved in trying to solv^^Scrisis of the International Tin Council (ITC) were beginning to bre^^^jiwks and some had resumed the sale of Levious	tin. Earlier that week he	Mr Adam Ridley of Hambros Bank,

bference:	Mr Peter Graham of the StandaiMyQfc^tered Bank and Mr Ralph Kestenbaum

C(86) 4th	of the London Metal Exchange, ws  h  K suggested that the Government

Inclusions,	should make an immediate interest^ffe^&gt;loan of   200 million to rescue

inute 4	the ITC, of which   120 million migt  /  e^recoverable m due course from

the Council. The Secretary of StatS^^Trade and Industry had replied that the Government was most unlikely^^j^n^ke such a large sum available. Unless colleagues dissente^he proposed to confirm that the Government would not do so.	^

In a short discussion, the following points weremade -

a.	The Government had made major efforms     .rescue the ITC but

other European countries, notably the FeagYir&apos;wppublic of Germany, France and the Netherlands, had refused to\^aO&gt;^ipate adequately in the rescue arrangements.	  &apos;iL/y

b.	The Government had offered a contribution ^^^had exceeded

by   50 million in the United Kingdom&apos;s rightful pr&amp;fotiori of the rescue money. This offer had been very generous	re could

be no question of increasing it.	   

c.	Of the ten largest broking firms concerned in th&gt;^MGO accounting together for over 90 per cent of the exposun^Tgjiv two were British. But the collapse of the Council would hav^rat^&gt;.


   secondary effects on the British economy. Other parts of the London Metal Exchange might suffer. The tin mines in Cornwall     yS.	would have difficulty in selling sufficient amounts of tin at a

))	lower price.

d.	If the ITC broke down, there would be a great deal of litigation. Since the Council had been located in London, some I litigants might choose to take proceedings against the United ^^  ^Kingdom Government as being jointly and severally liable in the   ^tatter.

vm&apos; The efforts to mount a rescue of the ITC had passed through lyyKA.cal stages before. But there was now a serious risk that oKose efforts would fail.

I Inter-	resulted	from the	Intergoverrm^miai Conference. It had been made clear

I governmental that the	decision	of most other/  emer states to sign did not pose

I Conference problems for Denmark. The DaniMi^Gpt^rnment expected that the

referendum in Denmark would be fa&lt;fouj?^Ble and, if so, they would sign on I Previous	1 March. The Italian Government, wf  *j    arliament had made signature
