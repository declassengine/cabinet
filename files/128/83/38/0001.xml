Pm

I	SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that the Labour Party

* e	chosen, as one of the subjects for the first Opposition day of the

E Hange	the industrial dispute at J E Hanger Ltd who were the suppliers

I	National Health Service of artificial limbs. There had been a

sttid  dvat the factory for the previous two to three months. The bac^gp*5^bd to the dispute was complicated but essentially it had arisen out ^4&gt;mi  f  agement proposals designed to improve productivity. The AdvisoMVarU Conciliation Service (ACAS) had unsuccessfully attempted to achiev^ar^ettlement. The Government&apos;s line in the debate should be that whifia they would naturally be concerned if the supply of artificial limbs were disrupted, they were not responsible for the working arrangements of an independent company. These were a matter for the management and workforce of the company to resolve using the good offices of ACAtf/as^ppropriate.

lolition of THE SECRETARY OF STATE^Gk SCOTLAND said that, subject to the approval tones tic	of the Legislation Confc^tt  e (L), the Abolition of Domestic Rates

  tes	(Scotland) Bill would be i^mduced in the House of Commons in the

  Scotland)	following week. Second ra  rad  rog of the Bill would take place as soon as

m	possible thereafter, dursecond week of December, and the aim

would be to have at least twd^Mipittee sittings on the Bill before the levious	Christmas adjournment.

ubjects for THE PRIME MINISTER said that the respoo^of a number of Departments to Rebates	a request from the Chief Whip for sugge^ions for subjects of positive

effect within their responsibility for debates in Parliament had been disappointing. Colleagues should ensure that they were personally involved in considering their Departments&apos; repj^as to a further letter which the Chief Whip would shortly circulate. ((})

   /{jl/}	2. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the price of shares of

^	British Gas would be announced on 21	November and the prospectus on	the

I	saie 0f shares would be available to	the public from 25 November. The

I L    tisi^pK final date for bids to purchase shares would be 3 December. It was important that Ministers should not say anything in public about or N^^Orelevant to the prospects of the shares in the market.

u  red	Ti^%TO^ETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that his talks with the

q	Chavdiran^pf	the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Chairman of the

QQQUI1C	T	.	.	&apos;	       	  . ^

ficieocy	IndefSSjflwTit	Broadcasting Authority on measures to alert the public to

ndrome	the daWer^p	of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) had gone well.

Contact^had also been established with the written media. The revious	Government&apos;s campaign of advertising	would begin in the press the

eference:	following weekend. There would be a	debate in the House of Commons	on

C(86) 37.1 the following day; initial contacts with other parties suggested that an all party appr&lt;3^e?I\ to the problem of AIDS might prove possible.

In discussion,noted that all possible approaches to combat AIDS should be conside^ejl^ky the Ministers concerned, but the problems posed by each would requTM^very thorough examination.

[eachers1	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FMMLBjbCATION AND SCIENCE said that the situation

&gt;ay, Duties	concerning the teachers&apos; pa^^kpute was still developing. The proposed

ind Conditions agreement between the mathe employers and the	majority of the

&gt;f Service	unions was still only in	drat^^/He was in contact with	some union

leaders and was making the GoVerjMiieht&apos; s position clear. He would keep Previous	colleagues informed of development^^x The draft of the Education Bill

ieference:	would be circulated that day to cCoil^gues, so that publication would be

CC(86) 37.2 possible in the following week.

FOREIGN	3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY	the declaration

AFFAIRS	issued by the Government	of Argentina on 17 NovdAb^r/an	various matters

   	relating to the Falkland	Islands had made even a^YppMl	cessation of

Argentina	hostilities following the war in 1982 dependent on^MuJ&amp;ber of moves by

the United Kingdom. The declaration was an act of ^  cfp^g^nda, designed previous	to coincide with a visit by the President of Argentina,&apos;^)rORaul

Reference:	Alfonsin, to the United States, to precede by one week ^xJ  /oebate on the

CC(86) 22.2 Falkland Islands in the United Nations General Assemblyfollow shortly after the British announcement that a Falkland IstaJre&amp;AInterim Conservation and Management Zone (FICZ) would be introduceaXacouhd the


   vIIjO	Falkland Islands on 1 February 1987. Most of the British media had

understood the propaganda motives behind the declaration. The Government should continue to make clear to the media and to other /yy \ countries the reasons concerned with the conservation of fish stocks

which had made the FICZ necessary, the Government&apos;s continued interest a multilateral arrangement for conserving fish stocks and Argentina&apos;s ^VVvcwntinued refusal to discuss practical aspects of bilateral relations V/^*fh the United Kingdom.

I isit by the	THE KS^iGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the visit of Their

tince and	Royal Ri&amp;hji^sses the Prince and Princess of Wales to Oman, Qatar,

rincess of Bahrainymd Saudi Arabia had been very successful. The only shadow had a^es t0	been thac^the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Prince Abdullah, had left

rajj  a	the country shortly before the arrival of Their Royal Highnessess,

obstensibly on medical grounds but possibly as a gesture of displeasure at the United Kingdom&apos;s breach of diplomatic relations with Syria. The effect had beenfttnpt King Fahd of Saudi Arabia had become much more prominent in tnfe-^  ro^ramme of the Prince and Princess of Wales, so that the visit had beem^ievated almost to the level of a State Visit.

Si

Iganda	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWK    tt  \SECRETARY said that the visit to the United

Kingdom from 16 to 18 No\^b^W of the President of Uganda, Mr Yoweri Irevious	Museveni, had gone as wellSa^eould have been hoped. The Prime Minister

leference:	had received the President.&lt;ATOe^President&apos;s talks with Ministers had

;C(86) 6.2	provided the opportunity to iW^fss upon him that he should not trust

Libya and its leader, Colonel Hu  Far Qadhafi; the President had seemed to accept this to some degree. -Th^President had been appreciative of the help Uganda was receiving from-&apos;thje&gt;United Kingdom.

%

Iran	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY shid that the President of

the United States, Mr Ronald Reagan, had spoken on television the previous day about the question of United States arms supplies to Iran. According to early reports, the President had/^eemed rather uncertain in his presentation of the subject. A number of\(gspv[cts of the matter remained unclear. There were still rumours tnkx/tlraNUnited States Secretary of State, Mr George Shultz, might r es	United Kingdom

should make clear that its policy remained that thS^/should be no negotiations with terrorists and that its policy on /Afcm^*-sales to Iran and Iraq was unchanged.

In discussion, it was pointed out that negotiations for&lt;^h^\axport of Land Rover vehicles from the United Kingdom to Iran were\unj^Ucely to result in a sale; but that any question of a sale, if it VrtSs^Xwould need careful handling.


   ly^&amp;Tol	THE FOREIGN	AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Prime Minister&apos;s

I	discussions	with the United States President about arms control on

15 November	had been extremely satisfactory. The Prime Minister had

I	succeeded in refocussing attention on the steps that should be feasible

and were desirable in the coming period, namely a far reaching agreement c(86&apos;	intermediate nuclear range forces, 50 per cent cuts in the strategic

^Xfvojiensive nuclear weapons of the Soviet Union and the United States and VyoLjn 0n chemical weapons, and in deflecting emphasis from more

nary and unwelcome proposals which might lend support to opponents 6f\^^yBritish nuclear deterrent.

THE&lt;fraiMg\MIN 1STER said that the statement which she had agreed with the UnitSd^ates President, Mr Ronald Reagan, and issued after her meeting with h^^^^^d been prepared with the greatest care, and every word of it was significant. Copies would be circulated to colleagues during the present meeting. Among the key points stressed in the statement were the need for consultations on arms control within the North Atlantic Alliance, the importance of verification in arms control agreements, the importance of iWf^ar deterrence in the Alliance&apos;s strategy of forward defence and fl&amp;iMaL response and the principle that reductions in nuclear weaponst^&lt;iW\ increase the importance of eliminating the disparity in convAo^KMjal forces between East and West in Europe. The President had reafEptfi^d that the United States would proceed with its strategic modernisatf^programme, including the Trident weapons^system, and his full support^S^k^e modernisation of the United Kingdom&apos;s nuclear deterrent througl^feident.

COMMUNITY	4. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, E^HEMES AND FOOD said that there had

kFFAIRS	been a difficult Agriculture Councif\SZ07-18 November. On milk there

|    	were Commission proposals on the tabl4^  j*t the disagreement between

[Agriculture member states made it impossible for ttre United Kingdom Presidency to

put forward any compromise. On beef sotfe progress had been made and he   Previous	did not rule out some agreement at the next meeting in December. Very

  Reference:	late in the meeting the Commission had come forji^rd with a proposal for

KC(86) 33.4 changing the rates of the green pound and theAgTt&amp;n franc on beef and

sheepmeat. The measures would have helped td^djice the pressure on the French Government over sheepmeat without damagin&apos;g&apos;TJnited Kingdom interests. There was therefore a satisfactory mof agreement between the United Kingdom and France. Unfortunat&lt;eri^/Ujis proposal had run into difficulties with other member states and	be remitted

for further discussion at official level. In discusr^    i\^t was pointed was out that, despite the lack of progress on milk and	would

not be desirable to highlight this issue at the Europedtf^njhcil. There would be a serious risk that a debate there would be dif^ipd^t for the Federal German Chancellor, Herr Kohl, and that in the periM&lt;Wjedlately before the Federal German elections he might be forced to	strong


   vll/9	line against change in the common agricultural policy. This would not

LyC^S. be helpful in achieving the changes required during 1987. The

difficulties in the milk sector were great: reductions in milk quotas could give rise to serious political and economic problems in the United &lt;(/j&apos; Kingdom itself and the Milk Marketing Board was indicating that, if &apos;^Xv&apos;kurther quota cuts were made, dairies would be closed and jobs would be &lt;(\\&gt;lMt. None the less, the Community budget situation and the pressure on \&gt;/  h6 1.4 per cent Value Added Tax ceiling were so serious that action on ^Vfe&amp;ultural surpluses, including possibly an element of transfer to Witj^amal responsibility, was a priority.

m

Finance:	THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Economic and Finance

Liberalisation Council oh 17 November had agreed to a significant directive on capital Lf Capital movements. The Commission had put forward a programme for complete Movements and	freedom of capital movements	and this	measure	was a step towards that

Loans to Small	liberalisatiory^Tfee Council	had also	reached	agreement on 1.5 billion

Businesses ecu of lendingAto&apos;  mall firms, half of which would come from funds

raised by the CtJtlimTs&apos;ion and half from the European Investment Bank. It Previous	would be helpful\t^tkaw attention to	this in	the discussion on small

[Reference:	and medium businesaewpL the	European	Council. There had also been a

CC(86) 33.4 discussion within	mework of budgetary discipline leading to

conclusions on researhfej^n^ development expenditure and on fisheries structural measures. ThCTperPhad been an identity of view between France, the Federal Republic of&lt;jk  rt  ahy and the United Kingdom but other member states had been little c&lt;Srceraed about the need for budgetary restraint. It remained true that the on^^eally effective discipline on spending was the existence of the VaV6(e\bMMed Tax ceiling.

||||t

Aid for	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AM^^NBDSTRY said that the question of

Shipbuilding aid for shipbuilding had been addre  s^J^at the Industry Council on

18 November. Although there was no iifate^rate problem, this question would present real difficulties for th^UJnited Kingdom in December, since most other member states were ready to accept a lower maximum level of aid for shipbuilding than we considered necessary. We would need to find a way through the difficulty in order to avoid a serious effect on the shipbuilding industry, particula^Ty\\in North-East England and in Scotland.
