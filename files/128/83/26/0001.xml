In	f theiO^THS LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he hoped that the House of Commons would

   Dates	to rise for the Summer Adjournment on 25 July. This would,

    . rnment hcwewir, be partly dependent on the progress of business in the House of I    ^	Lor4  ^pd in particular on the timing and method adopted to reverse

Govepijiiient defeats in that House on the Social Security Bill. He would disM^S^Die matter further with his fellow business managers and report I	the	to Cabinet at an early opportunity.

   Funding of THE PRIME MINISTER, sa id that while many voluntary organisations were    Voluntary	engaged in ac/?vi^)es of a wholly laudable kind, there appeared to be a

   Organisations growing numberv  Vtf^also acted as pressure groups for particular causes, and engaged in pMitljtal activities of various kinds for that purpose. Many such organisreceived central Government funding, and it was not clear that the	that funding was always confined to the

purposes for which iC^raAvintended. In order to establish facts of this matter, she therefore T&gt;r  Di&gt;^ed to arrange for the compilation of a list of voluntary organisatiqjJ^Xikreceipt of central Government funds, and the amounts of money invdQreed/J

   Public Order:	THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCkTthat the Home and Social Affairs

iTravellers Committee had met the previous we^k^irJV agreed a course of action to be taken to counter the activities of	of travellers like the

   Previous	so-called peace convoy which had caiS^Sysuch public disquiet in recent

   Reference:	months. This action would involve th^^^kroduction of a new limited

|CC(86) 22.1	criminal offence of trespass. This coi&amp;4 either be introduced as an

amendment or addition to the Public Order Bill in the current Session or as a separate Bill in the next Session. He saw some advantage in the latter course, as it would avoid introducing acl^ange in the Public Order Bill which could take up a good deal of/Far|\iamentary time at a point in the Session when time was short, but V|ia^&amp;&amp;ognised that there were arguments the other way, and he would discuss^He matter further with the Home Secretary. Either way, the ob iecti^e^y&lt;fold be to have the provision enacted before the summer of 1987.	v&apos;y&apos;

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that, as he had reported m a lifogiUlation to minute to the Prime Minister of 1 July, it was now clear that I	preparation of legislation to privatise water authorities was proving

I Wamore complicated than had been expected: the late introduction of a AutlwvVv?	Bill of such size and controversiality in the next Session would present

great difficulty for the management of the legislative programme. yyyOs. Moreover, water authorities had been given legal advice that they might Jj be exceeding their powers if they did more to prepare for privatisation they were currently doing. A short Bill to enable them to do more ^\\p  eparatory work was an essential preliminary to the completion of \&gt;,/Myeparations for privatisation.

discussion it was agreed that the presentation of a decision to pdSsfpoipB this legislation to the following Parliament would need to be han^^L-wlth care, so as to avoid creating any impression that the GoveroMjitis resolve to privatise water authorities had slackened, or that oraje^parts of the privatisation programme were at risk.

THE PRIME* MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that Cabinet agreed that it would not now be practicable for legislation to privatise the water authoriti^s^to be introduced in the next Session. In the circumstances//iTSwould be right for that decision to be made known as soon as poss ilkke^ ^-ihe announcement should emphasise that it remained the Government&apos; s/jtnteyition to privatise water authorities as soon as possible. It appthat a short interim Bill might well be necessary, to enabl^Jwa^gr authorities to contribute fully to further work on the preparat/pj^if plans for privatisation: if the Secretary of State for the Environtjjerlrt&apos;wished to proceed with such a Bill, he should bring forward detailed p^Mjarsals in the usual way.

The Cabinet -

2. Invited the Secreo^ni^jyt State for the Environment to proceed ii^&apos;a^jz^Skdance with the Prime Minister&apos;s summing i^^oOBheir discussion.

Radioactive THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WALES said &lt;fiat subject to the resolution of Contamination some final points, he hoped to be able &apos;Oo announce later that day that of Sheepmeat the Order made on 20 June 1986, under the Food and Environment

Protection Act 1985, prohibiting the movement and slaughter of sheep and Previous	lambs within two areas in North Wales and Cumb^JiN could be partially

Reference:	lifted. This would involve removing the restWictvons from approximately

CC(86) 24.1 a third of the original affected area in Cumbri^armS from approximately 10 per cent of the original affected area in Walej^//Eull results of the monitoring exercise that was being conducted on iaMar/in these areas would be released at the same time. The intentionwafe^  o lay the amending Order on the following day. There was likei^^b^be pressure to I	make a statement to the House of Commons in the followin^^^ek.


   Pressure was also mounting for him to release details of compensation arrangements:	he was discussing this with the Chief Secretary,

Trei8&apos;   ry&apos;

SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that he hoped to make a similar xv\V^nnouncement in respect of Scotland in the following week.

\ j ~

Presentation THE^jRjiffi MINISTER said that it was most important that Government of Government polijS^as presented effectively and that inaccurate statements in the Policy	media)aop&lt;  fc that policy were corrected as speedily and authoritatively

as pos^ffle. To that end, Ministers in charge of Departments should ensure chat not only the morning press but also morning broadcasts on both television and radio were monitored by their Information Officers and that steps were taken to ensure the correction of inaccuracies, by a Minister, by Kjneiit ime on the same day. A record of refusals by the media to allowsuvh corrections should be kept. It was also important to ensure thac&apos;SiW&apos;S&apos;Khment policy continued to be presented effectively during the Summe\RjkdX  urnment; the fact that this was a quiet period for news should preserH^itoropportunity to get the Government&apos;s message across. To assist tn^^process, Ministers in charge of Departments should send her offrt^p^T^pte of Ministers on duty each day during August and September.

FOREIGN	2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH 1tf  G    &amp;yRY said that the approval by

I AFFAIRS	the United States Congress of supporfc^jiiapfch $100 million to the

&quot;Contras&quot; opposition movement in Nicacdgiia had aroused widespread I Nicaragua	criticism. The Nicaraguan Government l^ad reacted by closing the only

opposition newspaper. On 27 June, one day later, the International Court of Justice had ruled that certain United States action in support of the &quot;Contras&quot;, including the mining of Nicaraguan ports in 1984, had been contrary to international law. The Forajfgn^nd Commonwealth Office had issued a restrained statement reiterating^  e#|&gt;ihSLt for international law and for the Court and saying that the Uniten^Kingdom would continue to support efforts towards a negotiated settleme&apos;sI^in/Nicaragua. In line with the Government&apos;s policy, the statement M^^ther criticised nor supported United States policy in Nicaragua.


   0y7Y\ I	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the State Visit, which

of would conclude that day, of the President of the Federal Republic of I	Germany, Richard Freiherr von Weizsaecker, was going very well. The

T	Federal President had made a speech of the highest distinction at a

previmnVyi^ joint session of the Houses of Parliament on the previous day. It had eferen^  ^\ been an occasion of notable warmth. The Speaker of the House of Commons CC(86) 2v\0) an&lt;* the Lord Chancellor had spoken very effectively before and after the vT^^^ederal President.

Libya	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that British Caledonian

Airways CoCal) had sold two Airbus aircraft to a company based in Hong [previous	Kong which had immediately sold them to another company. The aircraft

[Reference:	were now in Dubai^in the United Arab Emirates and Amman in Jordan.

ICC(86) 18.2 There were strfofig&apos;Vindications that their ultimate destination was Libya.

It was most unq      r-able that they should reach Libya, not least because about 30 per cent/oiyjthe value of the aircraft, was of United States manufacture. The&lt;g^M^ talk in parts of the Administration in Washington of actia^ya&amp;iinst BCal if the aircraft reached Libya. Such action would be grea^W^X the disadvantage of United States/United Kingdom relations in   K^reeld of aviation. The Secretary of State for Transport had arranged fp^Hye withdrawal of the British Certificate of Airworthiness from th^afingraft: without it they could not fly. The British Embassies in Ammaiw^JraKEhibai were making use of the deregistration of the aircr^it\a^d other arguments in strenuous attempts to persuade the author i ties	allow the aircraft to proceed to

Libya. He had spoken to Sir Ma^M&amp;omson, Chairman of BCal, who at first had seemed not to be full  /al^rt to the dangers to BCal&apos;s interests in the United States if^fcfii^&apos;^ir craft reached Libya. Sir Adam had claimed that BCal had acted in&lt;g  *5dJaith in selling the aircraft.

In a subsequent conversation, he ha  C3^Snd that Sir Adam now understood more fully the importance of this matrar^r BCal&apos;s services to the United States. The Government had sug  1sted that BCal might consider whether the contracts under which the aircraft had been sold to the present owner by the company which had purchased them from BCal were fully valid and, if not, whether BCal could take legal action to. prevent the aircraft reaching Libya.	//&quot;n

In discussion, it was pointed out that, since BC^^Mparently no longer owned the aircraft, they were unlikely to be ahv^J^Aficily to repossess them except as a result of litigation. The idea, wM^m^BCal had mentioned in recent contacts with the Government, tbat/^itey might remove from Dubai the aircraft presently located there, prov^^eoxthat the Government gave them an indemnity against legal action by/spe owners of the aircraft, did not seem feasible.


   THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Government should do everything possible within the legal scope available, to prevent the two Airbus aircraft reaching Libya. Efforts should also be made to defend BCal against repercussions for its interests in the \CyA/  United States.

XOv/N The Cabinet -

Invited the Secretary of State for -//teansport and the Foreign and Commonwealth ^   jiiretary to be guided by the Prime Minister&apos;s VjrttmyTfrng up of their discussion.

   COMMUNITY	3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the South African

   AFFAIRS	question had dorfjftated the discussions in the European Council on

__	26-27 June. TOe   ur main points which had been satisfactorily and

   European	unanimously agreid^w&amp;r   e: increased financial and material aid for the

   Council:	victims of apartMijli/a renewed call for an early and peaceful political

   South Africa dialogue within Sb5rf    frica, for the release from prison of Mr Nelson Mandela and other	prisoners and for the lifting of the ban on

   Previous	the African NationalW^TWSs and other political parties; consultation

   Reference:	with other industrialHeilO^untries on further measures which might be

ICC(86) 25.2 needed, covering a ban	investments and the import of coal, iron,

steel and gold coins f roiri^SoijWh Africa; and the decision that he should himself go to southern Afrve^^Dresenting the 12 countries of the European Community, in orde^^^^stablish conditions in which the necessary negotiations could \io   iysnce. He had made clear that his mission to southern Africa wafTrfiM^. fact-finding exercise but was intended to build on the work oV^tlj^Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group. He intended to make more than one^wj, his present plan being to make a short visit to southern Africa sia more extensive visit in the last week of July. Action was alreScW^eing taken to seek as much backing as possible from other Cornmocountries, and he was in touch with the United States and Japan^X^A policy review was under way in Washington; the President of the Unired States, Mr Reagan, was concerned to avoid new or premature measures but there would be pressures on him to make some further move during July.

In discussion it was said that after the firt the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary would need to inform the	European

Community countries of how it had gone. The Hou^e^^^Commons might best be informed in the course of a debate which was li^^^y^o be arranged between his two visits to southern Africa. It was mwra&amp;ant that these factors should not complicate his task on his s(  c^jiwvisit.


   liur^ean	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the European Council on

and	26-27 June had endorsed the principal objectives for the United Kingdom

pjof Presidency during the second half of 1986. The economic discussion in the European Council had focussed on employment and has supported the Kingromv^o approach set out in the paper which the United Kingdom, with the support Presid  fjw  y\ of some other member states, had made available to the Council of

Ministers (Social Affairs). There had been favourable public comment in Previousnumber of member states on this United Kingdom initiative. The Reference: v^&apos;^oinclusions of the European Council also gave some impetus to the work CC(86) 24.3&apos;jthe completion of the internal market, which was a United Kingdom

AH^iraity. The United Kingdom&apos;s Presidency had now begun and had got off Mi^a^pod start. It was important that all colleagues should keep up tKemp^entum on the agreed objectives. In discussion the results of the Eur&lt;  g^wrNCouncil were welcomed. On action following the nuclear accinftfo&amp;&apos;at Chernobyl there was some risk that the Commission and, in particvj^f&apos;f Commissioner Clinton Davis might interpret the reference to concerned action on the safety of installations as an incentive to put forward Further proposals. It was pointed out, however, that this section of the European Council&apos;s conclusions referred specifically to the Community ij  4:i tut ions and the member states, each within the limit of their powei&apos;s^Srhe United Kingdom Permanent Representative to the European CommuQj^j-er  ., Sir David Hannay, had discussed this point with Mr Clinton Davisfwho)had said that the Commission had abandoned any idea of proposing a CoqEliij&gt;i^y nuclear safety inspectorate.

European	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWlsi^tirf^iaECRETARY said that the	developing dispute

Community/	between the European Commoljiiy^Vnd the United States	over the effects of

United States the accession of Spain on Urfy&amp;ckstates&apos; cereal exports had been Trade	successfully dealt with for xfopSpresent. Agreement had been reached

  Relations	between the Commission and th  &apos;yj  i^d States on an interim arrangements.

This has not yet been approved 4&gt;y a^Kmember states.	It seemed likely,

previous	however, that it would achieve th^wy/hdrawal of the	United States&apos;

References:	threatened measures against CommunLt^gjiports and the Community&apos;s

CC(86) 24.3	threatened counter-measures. In di  2uii  aon it was agreed that this

and 18.3	would be a satisfactory result, both ajjm^Lng the present trade dispute

and providing the time for any longer   rm settlement.

Pew Zealand THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said t\Lt disagreement between I ,	France and New Zealand in relation to the two FnMfcTMagents imprisoned

Previous	in New Zealand following the attack on the ship,\^tJ*^Rainbow Warrior,

Reference:	seemed to be imminent. It was probable that this ^^M^open the way for

r (.86) 24.2	a Commission proposal in relation to access for New ^4airand butter to

the United Kingdom market in 1987 and 1988. In disci^^ro^it was said that the New Zealand authorities might be too optimistic,/d^  assuming that the Commission would propose figures of 77,000 and^oyOTj) tonnes of


   butter. The Commission might not be willing to make such a proposal simply because it was apparently acceptable to France and New Zealand.

It was by no means certain that this issue would be easily settled in

I Community ^/IHjl&amp;CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the judgment of the European I Budget for M  ompXof justice in the case brought by the Council against the European 1986	P^rclidjkent on the legality of the Community&apos;s 1986 budget had been given

thg$0s  o*T  ing. He was glad to report that the European Court of Justice Previous	had^Cmled in favour of the Council. The Court had found that the

Reference:	decis{jb/yot the President of the European Parliament to sign the budget

CC(86) 22.3 withoucAthe agreement of the Council on the provision for non-obligatory expenditure was illegal and that consequently the budget was void. The Council - and the United Kingdom - had won a very important point of principle. It jwquld now be for the United Kingdom Presidency to settle a new and val/ija&amp;udget. He hoped that it would be possible to do this in July. Bec^use^ei the supplementary demands, resulting in particular from the effect /oi*&quot;Me fall in the dollar on agricultural expenditure in the Community,	budget would be larger than the budget which had

been declared ill

In discussion it was ^S^Mjiat the decision of the European Court of Justice was good for the/  &amp;isted Kingdom. It would be reassuring to British public and Parl    m  nnary opinion that the European Parliament could not go ahead on its^e^ril1 increasing public expenditure in the Community. The two issuesV^w^ powers of the European Parliament and the immediate decision on a&apos;v  e^  aed 1986 Community budget - were separate. The revised budgetVwt  dX had now to be adopted would be higher because it would includ4^ih^&apos;Commission&apos;s proposed supplementary budget. The supplementary eleme^re&apos;c^patained a substantial sum, about   300 million, for the United Kingdptj  ^

I Research and	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that the Ministerial

I Development	conference on market-oriented research and development under the EUREKA

I (EUREKA)	programme, held in London on 30 June, had beafp^^ary successful. Sixty

two collaborative projects between different!Companies and institutions in the field of high technology had been annotrrra^ti^yv It was widely considered that the United Kingdom had played	role in

developing EUREKA.

L&apos;jiifrccr*&apos;	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that at the Council of

\JfJl	Ministers (Transport) on 30 June he had successfully negotiated the

retention of the United Kingdom&apos;s maximum axle weight, 10.5 tonnes,

Id	under a derogation which was without time limit and could only be

changed by unanimity. This had been well received in the House of Commons. On aviation, however, no significant progress had been made at this meeting of the Council of Ministers.

  NORTHERN	4. Tiffi^S^CRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that the marching

  IRELAND	seasonvoi/liorthem Ireland had begun peacefully. There had been a

AFFAIRS	number oi\marches on 1 July which had passed off without trouble. On

6 July, however, there would be a loyalist march at Portadown which was   Previous	planned to go through the sensitive Roman Catholic area called &quot;The

  Reference:	Tunnel&quot;. Sinn Ee-in apparently intended to mount a rival march in

ICC (86) 20.5	Portadown at tfyesMne time. The Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster

Constabulary wa^cejreadering whether to order the rerouting of the loyalist march was likely to decide to do so. The period ahead in Northern Ireland b  nu^l&gt;e difficult.
