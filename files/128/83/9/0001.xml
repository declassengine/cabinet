Took note.

FOREIGN	3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEAM^BCRETARY said that two terrorist

I AFFAIRS	groups had claimed responsibili&lt;&quot;y&apos;&apos;rcjr\the assassination on 28 February

--	of the Swedish Prime Minister, Mr^&amp;j^JPalme, but the police were

I Assassination sceptical about these claims and had^o clear idea of who had been I of the	responsible. The former Deputy Prifl^&apos;^^LSter, Mr Ingvar Carlsson, had

I Swedish Prime succeeded Mr Palme. Mr Palme&apos;s funera)i^j0^1d take place on 15 March.

I Minister	Many Governments, and many parties whrWI^^ere members of the Socialist

International, would be represented by B^jeir Prime Ministers and leaders. The Lord President of the Council had agreed to represent the British Government.

&lt;Sk

I	Southern	THE	FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that&apos;CEe&apos;    ^ate President	of

I	Africa	the	Republic of South Africa, Mr P W Botha, had ma&lt;6&apos;^w&lt;Ointeresting

announcements in a speech on 4 March. He had announ^^jp^iw! lifting of I	Previous	the	State of Emergency. It was not clear whether thi  &apos;wq  r&amp; have major

I	Reference:	practical effect, since many of the measures being applwjijiftder the

I CC(86) 5th Emergency could also be applied under other legislation. ^Jre&amp;ident I Conclusions, Botha&apos;s move might have been timed to deflect calls for	ion of

I Minute 2	the public boycott of black schools. The British Governmenl^^r^

welcomed President Botha&apos;s announcement of the lifting of the^^i^ue of Emergency. The Government had also welcomed his second annour


   chat South Africa was ready to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 435 on the independence of Namibia, subject to prior y agreement on the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. It was to be hoped that this announcement would aid the negotiations being conducted the United States on Cuban withdrawal from Angola, but those      ^^otiations would continue to be very difficult; there was no prospect V&gt;*WPresent of An8ola agreeing to the departure of Cuban forces.

&amp;/&amp;j&amp;\tish citizens had been among 150 foreign workers captured in No^nE^tern Angola by forces of the Union for the Total Independence of a^3L(UNITA). The captives were now undertaking the two-month marctfS^ichwards to the UNITA headquarters at Jamba. The indications were ttte^&amp;ter arrival at Jamba the British captives would be released without preconditions.

The visit to the Republic of South Africa by all members of the Commonwealth Emment Persons Group had begun on 2 March. The Group were still managing/ti^void significant publicity. The visit was so far going as well &apos;^a^puld have been hoped.

Middle East THE FOREIGN AND COMMO^wS^H SECRETARY said that the Foreign Minister of Syria, Mr Farouk Al-Shanr^had visited the United Kingdom from Previous	2 to 5 March. He had hW&amp;s^ful meetings with the Prime Minister,

Reference:	himself and other Minist^sZvjhe visit had provided the opportunity for

CC(86) 2nd	the Government to speak for^h^^itly about the Arab/Israel problem an

Conclusions,	about the terrorist groups l^^yhad offices in Syria. The Government

Minute 3	had also pressed the Syrian	Minister to help in efforts to

secure the release of Mr Alec	the British subject held in

Lebanon, and also of United Stat^^tages still held in that country.

In the Israeli-occupied West Bank,^fe?  ssassination on 2 March of the Mayor of Nablus, Mr Zafer Al Masri, lW^Jken a setback to the peace process in the Middle East and to Isr^%Ti plans for increased Palestinian participation in administration on the West Bank. Two Palestinian terrorist groups had claimed responsibility for the assassination. The attitude of Syria, as expressed during the visit to London of the Foreign Minister, had been at b^SiXequivocal.

Iran/Iraq	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that	been n  

War	change in the past week in the military situation	Iran and Iraq.

But the continued presence of Iranian forces in Fao, cifa^d wlth some Previous	menacing statements by Iran, had given rise to disqui^^^ib\g the Gulf

Reference:	States, especially Kuwait. The member countries of thev^yJjp.

CC(86) 8th	Co-operation Council had met to review the situation. THg^g in mind

Conclusions,	the use if necessary of their joint standby forces; but tn^sipjflpre on y

Minute 2	of token significance in military terms. A full assessment

&lt;^&gt;


   situation would shortly be produced by the Joint Intelligence Committee. The Goverment would keep in touch with the Gulf States.

The Cabinet -/y^^S Took note.

\    

I COMMUNITY	4.	FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Commission was

I AFFAIRS	plai^rtrtfg^ meeting with representatives of Argentina. The United

Kingdomvn^A made clear and had received the Commission&apos;s agreement that I Community	in the&apos;wesent circumstances these contacts would not be put on a

Relations	regular\pstitutional basis and that there would be no attempt to reach

    th	any formal agreement so long as Argentina had not taken the necessary

Argentina	steps to restore normal relations with the United Kingdom.

CL

European	THE FOREIGN AND Cbffl*OHiiEALTH SECRETARY reported that the Single European

Act	Act, incorporating AaiK^a^ults of the Intergovernmental Conference, had

now*been signed by a^^n^mber states. The way was now clear in the Previous	United Kingdom to preseMyOte short Bill in the present Session of

Reference:	Parliament. The proces^/M^vatification by all member states might take

CC(86) 7th	some time.

Conclusions,

Minute 3	The Cabinet -

Took note.

TEACHERS&apos;	5. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCMpN AND SCIENCE said that at the

PAY DISPUTE meeting of the Burnham Committee on 3&gt;^rch the employers and the five unions who were party to the agreement reached with the help of the Previous	Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) had agreed to a

Reference:	pay settlement for 1985   86. Negotiations wouAdh&gt;now begin on the longer

CC(86) 8th term issues under the guidance of the indepetodei^ ACAS panel. The Conclusions,	agreement was, however, a compromise one; thi  3pjiljsyers had had to

Minute 1	accept that the conditions of a return to full^rdil duties would not

be met. The National Union of Teachers would coat^ye to pursue wrecking tactics and in particular to seek to blww^o^cussion at the Conditions of Service Committee on which they had	and which

was also due to meet shortly. He had no confidence^   ttik^he ACAS talks would lead to an outcome acceptable to the Government	was too big

a gulf between the parties involved. He therefore fuliv^iiected to renew his recommendtion for a Government-sponsored inqut*v^ij\respect of England and Wales when the ACAS initiative failed. In tW^ft^^iime he supported the proposal of the Secretary of State for Scotl&lt;ujd^  or an inquiry in respect of Scotland alone. He continued to believ^^&amp;t the


   present was the most propitious time to bring the ACAS process to an end and to set up a Government inquiry in respect of England and Wales also, he accepted the judgment of his colleagues that the time was not

\v_y  ine for this.

XVraEO&amp;ECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND, introducing the discussion of his \wp  ndum (C(86) 9), said that the situation in Scottish schools was d^f  rating from week to week. More than half the secondary schools Wg&apos;^/^f^fectively on a three-day week. The start of the public examinations was now only seven weeks away, and the time for any remedigj^ir^tion was running out. The Scottish teachers    unions had made clear tqSt\&gt;t&gt;ey were not interested in an agreement on the lines of that negotiacwiior England and Wales with the help of ACAS, and were continuing^to insist on an independent inquiry confined to pay. There was now no other way forward than a Government-sponsored inquiry, although the terms of reference would have to cover duties and responsibilities^^, well as pay. Given their previous insistence on an inquiry confine(d[ t^)pay, the response of Scottish teachers to a wider inquiry coverin^^a^ktions as well was likely to be mixed; but he was confident that thi(e^tkblishment of such an inquiry would bring an end to strikes and to cfc^i&gt;6ycott of examinations, although it was unlikely to be entirely suecl?#4  4n restoring fully normal working. The terms of reference for an ifc^ninhhad been discussed and broadly agreed by a Group of the Ministers^&apos;mdtfj^elosely concerned, on the basis that they would need to be suitabl^^^exention also to England and Wales, if the negotiations under ACAS w^eibbreak down. Subject to some minor amendments to take accountNrf^to. special position of Scotland, the terms of reference previousMdiJ&amp;issed and now set out in paragraph 5 of his paper should prove sa?%^&lt;/tQry. A particular question arose whether an inquiry should be askfetf^h examine the arrangements for financing as well as for managiii^S^p^pls and the teaching service.

This would open up fundamental qu^ktj^s about the relationship between central government and local author^i^ and could extend the time an inquiry would need to report; his pr%%pfetjce was to omit any mention of financing. His paper included sugges&amp;faji   for the Chairman of an inquiry, who would ideally need to havds5both a Scottish background and the stature to cover England and Wales ii well, if the inquiry should subsequently be extended. If the Cabinet agreed that an inquiry should be established on the lines of his proposal, imae^iate announcement was desirable on both political and educational gt/Sun^s. He therefore sought agreement to announce the establishmenK^f^S^f*1 an inquiry that same afternoon, Thursday 6 March; at the same tifafefli invited his colleagues to select a Chairman for the inquiry &apos;fcggBhe three names he

had submitted.	!*yy\

In discussion the following main points were made -

a.	Although there was little confidence that the &lt;$CA3)process would lead to a settlement in England and Wales accewm. to the Government, the Government could not be seen to take M^jretiatlve to halt that process. If and when it became clear thaHj^^AS process could not succeed, then the way would be open	the

Scottish inquiry to England and Wales. Although there wav&apos;spa^


   small risk that the immediate announcement of an inquiry for Scotland would upset the ACAS process in England and Wales, this was not likely; the teachers&apos; unions would expect to do better out of the ACAS process than out of a Government-sponsored inquiry. If they were now to reject ACAS they would in effect be inviting the Government to extend the Scottish inquiry to England and Wales.

/v*\b. On the terms of reference there was general agreement that

should be no explicit reference to financing schools and the \r w^teaching service; it was for the Government to determine policy on    an&lt;* i-t would be embarrassing if an inquiry, having been asked consider financing, specifically rejected any possibility of Vp&amp;ate sector contributions towards the costs of maintained a  $iools. It would however, be desirable to emphasise more clearly in^the terms of reference the public expenditure constraints within which the inquiry would need to take place.

c.	Fur/Gtte?\V:onsideration needed to be given to the choice of Chairmar\Van^a  epibers of an inquiry. Although it would perhaps have been prefeoaBTaNto announce the name of the Chairman in the announcemeni^-ad^aia inquiry, this was not absolutely essential. But the names of ip^XJjairman and the members would need to follow very shortly.

...

THE PRIME MINISTER, sumnn^fg^up the discussion, said that the Cabinet recognised the sharply ikkgt&apos;vtorating situation in Scottish schools, and agreed to the Secretary	for Scotland&apos;s proposal to establish a

wide-ranging inquiry into te^rfflwrs&apos; pay conditions, duties and responsibilities. The term^A^yy^i&apos;teference should exclude any specific mention of arrangements for	schools and the teaching service,

but should emphasise more speci/^eratoy the need to take into account what the country could afford; th^^d^al text should be settled by the Secretary of State for Scotland wfth^fte Secretary of State for Education and Science and the Chiei^5  S^tary, Treasury. The Cabinet were not immediately attracted by an^Oortlie possible names for Chairman put forward by the Secretary of Statevta^&apos;scotland; he should consult his colleagues further on possible nominations for Chairman and members of the inquiry. The Secretary of State&apos;should announce on Thursday 6 March the Government&apos;s intention to establish an inquiry confined to Scotland; subject to the deletion of the third^s-antence of the third paragraph of his draft, they were content witlV&apos;tTieJ statement set out in Annex 2 to C(86) 9.	\

The Cabinet -

1.	Agreed to the establishment of an inquiry on teachers&apos; duties, responsibilities and pay, restricted to Scotland.

2.	Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to settle the precise terms of reference for the


   inquiry with the Secretary of State for Education and Science and the Chief Secretary, Treasury and the Cabinet Office.

3.	Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to put further proposals before his colleagues ylIabout the Chairman and members of the inquiry.

^	Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland

\r &gt;^o announce forthwith the Government&apos;s intention ^^OsjiNestablish the inquiry, taking into account the ^^oanjts made in discussion about the terms of his V^^ement.

5.	Noted that the inquiry might need to be extended later to cover England and Wales, if and when it b^qme clear that, through no fault of the GovefoflmaKt, the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitraoy&gt;on ^    rvice process could not lead to an acceptayreagreement.
