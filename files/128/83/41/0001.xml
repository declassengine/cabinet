   ivdni?MLNTARY 11 The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House of Commons in the following week.

Teachers&apos;VXf/THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE, said that Pay Dutie^^r^d^iteration of the remaining stages of the Teachers&apos; Pay and n&lt;j   	C^Cpfltfitions Bill had begun in the House of Commons on the previous day.

Conditions ^ffeTjrause had sat throughout the night and was likely to complete its of Service	ation later that day. In the meantime the process of unions

cofieJ^i&apos;Tng their membership continued. The consultation exercise previous	moun^/M^Sy the Assistant Masters&apos; and Mistresses&apos; Association should be

Reference:	completed that weekend, and that mounted by the National Union of

CC(86) 40.2	Teache^fe should be completed in the following week. The other two

unions which had initially associated themselves with the package agreed between employers and unions - the Secondary Heads Association and the Professional ypS&amp;ciation of Teachers (PAT) - had now announced that, following consul lotion, they intended to seek variations in its terms.

It was believte3yO*  lv the revised terms to be sought by the PAT would be very close to tneseAput forward by the Government. There had been some speculation in rhe^frtj^ia that a meeting of the Burnham Committee would be convened for e^ij^d^kmary. It therefore remained important to secure Royal Assent^t^^Mus Teachers&apos; Pay and Conditions Bill at the earliest opportunityv&apos;1&apos;^

THE SECRETARY OF STATE I^^SffifeTLAND said that the prospect that he too might take powers in legl^yi^Oo to impose a settlement had had a beneficial impact on the dviu^A^ons with the Scottish teachers&apos; unions. The unions had now accepteuNMAiK^ny settlement must fall within the total amount of his offer, an^^/pA progress was now being made in discussions on pay structure arrci^ionHj-tions of service. A further meeting of the negotiating commitfc^e&apos;vas to take place on the following day and he would report further to^^^^eagues in the following week.

The Cabinet -

Took note.

HOME AFFAIRS	2. THE SECRETARY OF	STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENX^rJii^rting	on recent

---	developments on local	government finance, said cowTrao or	three dozen

The Solvency	local authorities had	borrowed very significant araoim/^vof	money through

of Local	various &quot;creative accounting&quot; devices designed to ay^fl^the financial

Authorities disciplines that the Government had imposed, and the	ing of these

debts would undoubtedly be a problem for the future.	short term,

acute difficulties could be predicted with a handful or

authorities, mostly in London, which were controlled by raj^    n}our Party and which appeared set on course to spend at as higher le^itWan they could, or were prepared to, finance. In total, the extent&apos;^^^a^s unfunded spending could be several hundred million pounds.

Wa


   These problems might become unmanageable in about the spring of 1987, when Hackney might be the first council to run out of money. The Audit T/2*	Commission were preparing a report on these matters. He intended to

refrain from comment until the report was formally published in the New Year, but as soon as the report was published the Government would need to be seen to respond very quickly.

PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that the matters /&apos;^estorted by the Secretary of State for the Environment were of the     S^est importance, and he should submit a paper on them to an ^p^^priate Cabinet Committee soon after Parliament resumed in January.

^^S^^abinet -

iiv Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of the discussion, and invited the Secretary of State for the Environment to bring forward a paper on the lip&amp;s indicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.

The Attorney THE PRIME MINISTER^^dj/hehalf of the Cabinet, welcomed the Secretary of General v	the Cabinet on his	from Sydney, New South Wales. The Cabinet&apos;s

Heinemann	thanks to him shoulcp^0^&lt;  ^  orded for the admirable way in which he had

Australia	given evidence in the GovpTjhnent&apos;s action against the publication of a

and Wright	book by a retired Secur^^^^rvice officer, Mr Peter Wright. Press

accounts of the trial hairQje^rn much distorted.

Reference:	THE ATTORNEY GENERAL said	process of taking evidence in the

CC(86) 40.1 case had now been completed,\kjjwjcounsel would make their final

summissions to the Court in tne/^^iowing week. Judgment would be reserved; it was understood thav^th/^Jhrdge hoped to deliver a judgment before Christmas but this timetab^ecp  &gt;ld prove unrealistic. If the judgment went against the Crown, h^^dujji then advise those colleagues most concerned on whether an Appeal	be lodged and about the

grounds on which such an Appeal might	sed.

Flotation of	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that it/rfgBsared that the

British Gas	flotation of British Gas had attracted some twfc/miy.ion new investors

who were buying shares for the first time, andxj^&amp;^5j\s a notable Previous	success for the Government&apos;s policy of encouraginE^wi/er share

CC(86) 40.2

In a short discussion it was noted that the programme^p^ptfe flotation in the Granada Television series &quot;World in Action&quot; hadCefS^aAned a particularly tendentious account of the Government&apos;s privjM^  tftion policy and that this bias had been the subject of advers^^pSmamt in the press.


   The Cabinet -2. Took note.

FOREIGN xC^V&apos;V THE MINISTER 0F STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE (BARONESS AFFAIRS	\&gt;ty    WMG) said that the Prime Minister of France, Monsieur Jacques Chirac,

__	VafsK^^ydifficulties following demonstrations by students against the

France	GOTecm  knt&apos;s education bill, which had been withdrawn. Monsieur

Chirac Malposition had been weakened in relation to that of the Previous	Pres i^feptCSMonsieur Fran  ois	Mitterand, who had not been helpful to the

Reference:	Goverimn^trl? during the recent	events. Monsieur Mitterrand had spoken of

CC(86) 31.1	the pos&amp;ft^  ity of pardoning	an Arab terrorist gaoled in France if all

French hostages held in Lebanon were released, though not in an explicit bargain. Such remarks were not helpful to other Governments which took a firm stand against pressure from terrorists.

Ck

South	THE MINISTER OF STAI^^  OREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE, said that

Africa	further sweeping zoxwrpLgfroxi reporting in the media in South Africa were

likely to be announce^/^w^Kday. A new definition of subversive Previous	activity was likely tovi  ^irptroduced. The South African Government was

Reference:	likely to show greater reaw^ss to take action against foreign

CC(86) 39.2 journalists. These measures ^are part of a general tightening up by the Government.

..     .

In discussion, it was noted	Minister of Home Affairs of South

Africa, Mr Stoffel Botha, had	gainst the ideas for power-sharing

arrangements which had been worked am among the various races in Natal and Kwazulu with the discreet backingChief Buthelezi. The South African Government was, however, say^fg^frhat Mr Stoffel Botha had spoken in his capacity as the leader of the^it  j%nalist Party in Natal, and that the Government had not yet taken qny&apos;  position about the ideas for power-sharing. A general election mighiAtake place in South Africa in April 1987 and it was unlikely in the meantime that the situation would improve or that the Government would contemplate any kind of reform.

The Cabinet -	(ll)

Took note.	If ))

\

Hong Kong	THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE, a&amp;fothat the

funeral of the late Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Edward Yotwisf^yan 9 December had been a very moving occasion. Large numbers o$^K  $hle had signed the books of condolence and had lined the streets fow&apos;tta  w^ funeral. This display of sadness and emotion was uncharactel&amp;S&apos;Ue for

m


   the people of Hong Kong and demonstrated that Sir Edward had been seen V    y^\	as a great and well-loved Governor. The Minister of State, Foreign and

Commonwealth Office, Mr Timothy Renton, had represented the Government at the funeral. The question of a successor to Sir Edward Youde was   ///YSunder urgent consideration.

/wree Cabinet formally recorded their great appreciation of the remarkable NAjmirtribution of Sir Edward Youde to Hong Kong, especially during the ^ikfiro&gt;  ations with China leading to the agreement on Hong Kong, and i^rted the Secretary of the Cabinet to convey their condolences to Lady You&lt;d^&gt;

m

COMMUNITY	4. THE xRIME MINISTER said that the European Council in London on 5-6

AFFAIRS	December had been very successful. It had concentrated on practical

---	problems in relation to business and jobs and measures against

European	terrorism, illea^E&gt;Ammigration and drug abuse, as well as an agreement

Council	to exchange iniMrm^ion on ways of checking the spread of Acquired

Immune Deficiency\  ynihrome (AIDS). The European Council had benefited Previous	from the good wo rk(^upder taken by the United Kingdom Presidency in the

Reference:	specialist Councils&apos;T^ir example on progress towards the internal market

CC(86) 40.4 on which 32 new measuygfe^p&gt;ad already been adopted during the Presidency.

The United Kingdom haa^pxtyed for good reasons that it would not be worthwhile to have a fundamental discussion of future financing at this European council. the C&lt;s6^avion had not yet put forward its report, although the President of \fii  /Epmmission, Monsieur Delors, advanced some ideas on 5 December and indi^ao^. that the financial situation of the Community was very serious. &apos;^uPtAermore, the text agreed at the Fontainebleau European CounciMt make a reference to any change in the Community&apos;s own resources be  or^Ol January 1988; and that reference was in any event an option, not a odOTOtment.

In the European Council on 5-6 Decemlieip2friere had been disagreement on three points:	/y

a.	Some member states had tried hrv strengthen references to the cohesion of the Community because they considered that this ought to be achieved by direct transfers of resources to poorer countries. The United Kingdom and some othEjv member states, on the other hand, considered that the main method qj: achieving greater cohesion was by convergence of policies itv^thj^Jiember states.

b.	It had not been possible to get a s tron&amp;e^yeference to lower air fares because of the opposition of some meifib^r^tates, in particular Spain. It was nonetheless true thatMjiifvthe member states were now broadly in line with United Kingaom^jf^ws on this point.

c.	The Federal German Chancellor had opposed for elfeT^riif&apos;al

reasons a more robust reference to the need for action\Bi&amp; agriculture and, in particular, on milk and beef.	!Sy


   (Qk)	on 7 December she had reported on the United Kingdom Presidency and the

European Council to the European Parliament in Strasbourg. It was (/iv\ regrettable that Monsieur Delors had taken a different line in the European Parliament from that which he had taken in the European   ^O^Council. After explaining to the Heads of Government in London the real ^^yXinancial difficulties of the Community, he had called in Strasbourg for &apos;&apos;   ^sS^stantively higher expenditure. This tended to undermine confidence vTttl/Che institutions of the Community.

Ii/^ttirc&apos;ussion it was said that the United Kingdom abatement was now firml^&amp;itrenched in the Own Resources Decision. A supplementary budget in n  X/provided that it left expenditure within the own resources cei1not inconceivable. We should not, however, indicated that we could^aae^pt in 1987 financing outside the Community budget by an intergo\^  iraental agreement. The full United Kingdom abatement, however.flight be received later if the option were totally closed.

o

Community	THE CHANCELLOR OP^PJIS^XCHEQUER said that the meeting between the

Budget for	Council and the EiUogjdin Parliament on the Community&apos;s draft budget for

1987	1987 had reached nV^jfitfement. The European Parliament wanted an

increase in the maxittuft^te for non-obligatory expenditure, but the Previous	Council had refused ti^rf^de this. The European Parliament was now

Reference:	voting on its possible^mMyrnents.	If these amendments gave rise to

cc(86) 39.3	figures exceeding the ma^^w$^rate	f  r non-obligatory expenditure agreed

by the Council, it was unMceW that the President of the European Parliament would sign the bbtig    \ In that event there would be no 1987 budget and Community expendi^S^V^W 1987 would be determined by the arrangments known as provision^^twfJ-fths relating generally to the level of expenditure in 1986.

Economic and	THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said tfc^the Economic and Finance

Finance	Council had agreed on 8 December on a mh^sure on standardised

Council:	presentation of accounts of banks. This would contribute towards the

Subsidies on	completion of the internal market.	The Council had also agreed that the

Greek Cement	second part of a loan for Greece should be rele^s^d by the Commission

under tight conditions. These included a conWVtnnyit by Greece first to to reduce and then to abolish by 1 April 1987	t deposit scheme

and to reduce export subsidies at the beginning	and to phase

them out thereafter. He had also ensured that tft  _^w^tity of Greek cement for the British market would be held down	level.

In discussion it was argued that there was strong reay6i\^wj&gt;y the Greek export subsidy on cement should be eliminated altogethe^^a^^lie end of this year. Information on the measures now being taken	be made

available to the Prime Minister and other colleagues conc^  ^^\^


   Rea0rf/jKand THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that the Research Deve$5p  d\t Council on 9-10 December had failed to reach agreement on the

VMV multi-annual framework programme for Community research and development. It was expected to meet again on 22 December. Discussion had ^V/S^concentrated on attempting to agree on the resources to be made &apos;^-^V^vailable for a three year period. Since the Budget Council had decided x^AW^provision of about 1.05 billion ecu for 1987, it was to be expected a three year programme of at least 3.15 billion ecu would be ^Ay&amp;g^Bted. The Commission and some member states, however, were looking fQ^^a^Vignificant rate of increase each year. He doubted whether France anc^fcfi^f&apos;ederal Republic of Germany, which had supported the United Kingde^s^-estrictive position on finance, would be prepared at a later Counccirt!y maintain the common line.

In discuf^Vion it was said that efforts should be made to keep the French and German^ committed tb a programme of acceptable size. The United Kingdom&apos;s position on finance had been decided by the Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Strategy, Sub-Committee on Economic Affairs (E(A))	November.

to

Action	THE HOME SECRETARY safc^ifXt a meeting of European Ministers concerned

Against	with action against te^c&amp;rsm had now reached agreement on an analysis

Terrorism	of the threat from terrorla^p^which covered specific countries and

organisations. The Greelik/^d\dissented. The agreement on a threat analysis was a useful sequ^l-^tA^the conclusions of the European Council. There had also been a useful/^Ci^ng with the United States which had complemented the work going rwrv^a-fcl in Europe.

m

A Programme	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMEN^^^ that the broad endorsement of

for Jobs	the programme for jobs by the European&gt;Goj^fcil was welcome. Opposition

was coming only from some parts of the   bmmission and certain trade union interests in the Community. He wav hopeful that the programme for jobs and the proposals relating to small business would be agreed in the specialist Councils.

The Cabinet -	(( v

1.	Took note.

2.	Invited the Secretary of State for Trade !^y/\ and Industry, in consultation with the Chancello^/^Tv of the Exchequer, to report to the Prime Minister Syy\ on the agreement reached with the Greek Government

on imports of cement.
