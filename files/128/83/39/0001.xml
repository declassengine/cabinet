eachers&apos; FW&amp;reE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE said that the previous uties and x^^Lfek f  ur of the teachers&apos; unions and a majority of the employers (with i Lotions ^C/wiaWvative members dissenting) had signed a draft document on pay and f Service Vernons, subject to ratification by the individual unions. A number ofw^ts^Jeatures were welcome to the Government. For the first time tevious	the&lt;  ^j*esrt.d be a clear definition of teachers&apos; duties and agreement on

eference:	hourS^^rkad and on the length of the working year. Appraisal would be

C(86) 38.2	introdGfcdji; It had also been recognised that the existing Burnham pay

determination machinery should be abolished. There were, however, a number of unacceptable features. First, the cost of the proposed pay rises fell outside the envelope which he had indicated the Government could accept; there was an excess of   85 million over the amount the Government hadYoffVred for 1986-87 and 1987-88. Second, the proposed pay structure yg  ^  2ecessively egalitarian and the pay scales too flat. The proposals won/fdjmaan that the number of promoted posts (other than heads and deputiefij^ro^ld be reduced from 105,000 at present to 80,000 compared with the (Sswjxpnent&apos;s proposal which had implied an increase to 145,000. It was vit^&amp;^^piportant that the number of promoted posts should be increased tV&apos;^spre the proper management of schools. They were needed to reward te^jrtid&amp;s who took on additional responsibilities, to reward good classroomcreaoners and to deal with difficulties in recruiting teachers in ceN^i^uibjects and in certain areas. He proposed to make a statemerii^hka^afternoon making clear that these two aspects of the draft agreemeM^usre unacceptable to the Government. He would also announce that a BirlVj^j^d be introduced the following day which would repeal the RemuneraVfop^f Teachers Act 1965, contain provisions to enable him to set   4^aj&amp;nterim Advisory Committee on the lines previously agreed and give h^rj^^owers to determine teachers&apos; pay and conditions. Under present law	be obliged to promulgate any

agreement lawfully reached by the BurmyaiJ^Jommittee and it would therefore be crucial for this Bill to w^cure Royal Assent as soon as possible. In the meantime he would tal)r further to the employers and unions but on the clear understanding that no resources additional to those already announced were available and tha  _^he pay structure must embody satisfactory incentives.	(fl)

In discussion it was confirmed that, in line wi  ft\e proposal of the Secretary of State for Education and Science, acce^J  aftce of a recommendation of the interim Advisory Committee	require a

negative resolution procedure and rejection should fMyaie an affirmative resolution procedure.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that the resuf^^ofijthe ballot conducted by the Education Institute for Scotland (EIS),&apos;^lra  d|hrgest Scottish union, had been announced the previous day. The tfw^A&apos;^gainst the offer - 84 per cent of those voting - had been surprisi)  Djy^arge. Public and press opinion in Scotland, however, continued to


   Government offer as reasonable and the unions&apos; position as increasingly unrealistic. He was meeting the EIS on 1 December but it appeared almost inevitable that legislation to impose a settlement would be necessary. He would discuss further with the business managers what legislative vehicle would be appropriate if this was the conclusion he Nv-^YVyentually reached.

&apos;v^wnL^RIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that the Cabinet Z  r  vagreed that the Secretary of State for Education and Science should ma)6^3^statement that afternoon in the terms he had indicated and that tliend^ssary Bill should be introduced on the following day. The busM  esC  ^nanagers would use their best endeavours to secure Royal Assent by thSvVap&amp;iest possible date. The Government&apos;s offer was a generous one ana^oiose attention should be paid to presenting it effectively.

The Secr^ary of State for Education and Science should circulate briefing material to all colleagues. He would also write to backbenchers before the weekend setting out the Government&apos;s case. The Cabinet noted MKNpresent position in Scotland. The Secretary of State for Scotland shouyl consider urgently with the business managers how legislation migBto^Se^st be effected should it prove necessary.

The Cabinet

1.	Took note/^Hifi^pproval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their^jjd^cussion.

2.	Invited the Se^eparv of State for Education and Science to proceed aV^nw&amp;ated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.

3.	Invited the SecretarV^rWate for Scotland to discuss with the business map^gtgrs how legislation might best be effected shouldpt  &gt;e needed in Scotland.

FOREIGN	2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the disclosure

IFFAIRS	that money generated by the controversial sale of arms by the United

   	States to Iran had been diverted to the	Contra^xebels	in Nicaragua was	a

Jnited	major blow to the Administration in Washington, ^jiich	was under strong

States	criticism from the Congress. The President&apos;sx2Sd^3?ir for national

security affairs, Admiral John Poindexter, had res^wned and one of the Previous	latter&apos;s staff, Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North/^M  ^been dismissed.

Reference:	Not all th   details of the affair might	yet have	In the Middle

SC(86) 36.3	East, moderate Arab countries were very	critical anWawd probably

become more so. The credibility of the essential elemen^^pf British policy towards terrorism - that there should be no neg^M  w  ns with terrorists - might be undermined by the way the Administration had behaved. But it was also possible that there would be gren^6^&gt; understanding in some quarters of the British policy of fi^mn^ffpv since the alternative of dealing with terrorists had failed on thi^^efcrcasion.


   m	The British policy was right and the Government must continue to uphold

/yfcs.	it, while being careful not to add to the difficulties facing the United

\Xyj States President.

(/   sXVjn discussion it was agreed that anything that weakened the United &apos;&quot;\&gt;  7tates also weakened the West. The Government should maintain support the President, while avoiding any involvement in the controversy Vvid^Kin the United States. Two points should be central to the

^^foeinment&apos;s public position: the Government were not responsible for t\v4/acJiions of the United States Administration, and the Government had fuElT^&amp;&apos;nfidence in the integrity of the President.

X

Falkland	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Government had

Islands	decided a yea^p^eviously to adopt a more relaxed position towards the

annual debate^and(/vote on the Falkland Islands in the United Nations Previous	General AssemWPte^iw the present year the Government had again

Reference:	canvassed otherT^ov^nments, but with a lower profile than in earlier

I CC(85) 33.3	years. The restrhfe-^^ythe vote on 25 November had been much as expected:

116 votes in f avoifry^^foie Resolution drafted by Argentina, four including the Unite&lt;M  tf&gt;ghom against it, and 34 abstentions. The number of votes against the	ion had been the same as in 1985 but some

seven countries had switjjMraNfrom abstention to a positive vote. The Government&apos;s necessary ae^lsaon to announce the new Falkland Islands Interim Conservation and wSM^aent Zone had probably had an adverse effect on the vote. A chan^i\Vvvote by the Netherlands had brought to five the number of Europeau^oip*jiikity countries supporting the Resolution, but a majority ha)^a^u^*l withheld support for Argentina. Despite British representations(^ti^Jike-highest levels, France had again voted for the Resolution.

% ,

South	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY id that the decision of the

Africa	Barclays Bank Group to sell its remaining shareholding in Barclays

National Bank (BARNAT) in South Africa was being presented as a Previous	commercial decision but would inevitably be in	eted as a move in

Reference:	protest against apartheid. It might acceleraijp ttte process of

CC(86) 31.1 disinvestment from South Africa, although Brioca^Org^ro 1 eum PLC was

reportedly taking the different route of investinginjthe provision of racially mixed schools in South Africa. Recent	disinvest might

diminish some of the pressures for mandatory sanctiQii^jj^ainst South Africa, by showing that market forces were applying ]^r  ^j^re.


   THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the results of the ^ w^vs.	general election in Austria on 23 November showed a shift towards the

eviousv^	right. The Socialist Party had lost votes while the People&apos;s Party

sferendi#y^\ (conservative) had gained, as had the right wing Freedom Party. The C(86) 2&amp;  ^A/&gt;Pext Government was likely to be a &quot;grand coalition&quot; of the two largest ^-^rwarties, the socialists and conservatives, but there was also a \Ovtyras ibility that the conservatives might form a coalition with the &apos;&apos;^ra&amp;pdom Party.

The^w&amp;remely difficult position of the Austrian President, Dr Kurt Waiah^  , would not be affected by these developments. The position remM     Z6Tthat researches, including those undertaken by the Foreign and CommonwMUrh Office and the Ministry of Defence, had not substantiated specifre&apos;^dllegations that Dr Waldheim had been involved in executions of allied personnel during the Second World War. At the same time, it remained a fact that Dr Waldheim, when he had assumed office as Secretary-General of the United Nations, had misrepresented the status he had held dupiSSNthe war. It was very difficult to see what the Austrian Goverramei^p could do to alter Dr Waldheim&apos;s inability, caused by doubts about hr^jtfSi^role, to carry out many of his duties as President.	u/i,.

he	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWBj^fi^SECRETARY said that it had appeared that

hilippines during the previous week^M_Mjre. Government of Mrs Corazon Aquino in the Philippines had been in dahg3Hv&quot;nrom a coup backed by the military and revious	led by the then Minister ofN^e&apos;eep&amp;e, Senor Juan Ponce Enrile. But the

teference:	Chief of the Armed Forces, Ge^^i/t^Fidel Ramos, had supported

:C(86) 8.2	Mrs Aquino. She had called for/p   ^esignations of the whole Cabinet

and had replaced Senor Enrile. SThe&apos;&gt;s^tuation in the Philippines was calm on the surface and the underryip^position might now become more stable. A ceasefire of 60 days witw^fcjjg^Communist insurgents had been agreed. Mrs Aquino had become more aWMinjtent on the right wing. From the point of view of the West, she wa^^rtll the best available leader for her country.

COMMUNITY	3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said th&lt;k&apos;Xi(^|   oreign

AFFAIRS	Affairs Council on 24 November had made rapid progress i  pAing to

agreement on some significant measures including the pr^pJxJjM. extending Foreign	the multifibre agreement. Difficulties with the Greeks TOaipe Dutch on

Affairs	the movement of Turkish workers had been resolved after mbT^wrtensive

Council	discussion and a common position of the Community had been	He


   |Ov/s	had informed other Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom&apos;s proposed

subjects for discussion at the European Council in London on

I	5-6 December and these had been generally welcomed.

lvironment&lt;X\JKK SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the results of the xsjfatJirnninent Council on 24 November had been satisfactory. Agreement had ^bw^Xeached on standards to reduce the level of motorcycle noise. In MfeApAcussion on emissions from large combustion plants the United Ki^gfdomPwas now broadly in line with the majority of member states; the Fede^a^^&amp;public of Germany was still seeking more rigorous standards but, oii^ne.other hand, the debate in the Environment Council had usefull^^iiown that some member states, in particular Spain, were not willing go as far as the United Kingdom. Denmark was continuing to block the agreement on vehicle emissions.

finance	THE CHANCELLOR OmVtHbJEXCHEQUER said that the Budget Council had been

successfully concMifeB^ythat morning. The Minister of State, Treasury, had again shown very^flU^ chairmanship in achieving a majority in the Council for a Communifa^i^Bf t budget for 1987 which respected the rules of budgetary discipliiw^v had not been an easy task to persuade those member states who had beeij/reeking too high expenditure. The Council&apos;s budget would now be Sent&apos;^rclujto the European Parliament. It was too soon to be sure of the ourcjQmjy&apos;ftut there was a reasonable chance of agreement by the end of the	a budget which did respect budget

discipline. In discussion ipointed out that once again the results of the Budget Council aaqpj&amp;trated the importance of maintaining as far as possible a common lineXwiMjSr   rance and the Federal Republic of Germany. The Community&apos;s budge ta^yswyiat ion still presented serious problems, as the budgetary provisicw  ^  g  h for 1986 and 1987 was likely to be insufficient to meet all the   ief*|^aiture being incurred, so that some payments would be deferred into W&amp;8y^ No crisis was expected this year but there could be a serious problem towards the end of 1987. Much depended on the decisions which the Agriculture Council needed to take. The timing of changes was also influenced by electoral considerations in a number of major member states.
