   1     THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet would wish to congratulate AFFAlK&amp;ovCv the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the content and presentation of his

L0cal	THE LORB^BKESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL	said that the House of	Lords had

Government	amended	Local Government Bill	in a way that weakened	the provisions

Bill	relating to political advertising	by local authorities.	It was very

doubtful if it was feasible to achieve the reversal of these amendments in the following^Sfeek, immediately before the Easter Adjournment, and any attempt to (do ^ would provoke a major contretemps between the House of Lords and the^3i^i2b&gt; of Commons. He had therefore intended to tackle the matter in a measurjbd way after Easter. It had now become apparent, however, that, if cfc^Bxll did not receive its Royal Assent in the following week, the prop^^ions in question would be retrospective, because they attractea^a^WBmencement date of 1 April that did not now appear to be amendable, vrg^nt efforts were being made to find a procedural way of avoidiq^^r^rospection, but they did not seem at all likely to be successful. \Qe/other alternative was for the House of Commons to accept the House^-o^^Ards1 amendments, in which case the Bill would receive its Royal AsseqOi&gt;eiore 1 April and its provisions would take effect before the local gWefonment elections in May. This course of action would disappoint some JC  irei|xvatives, who had felt that in any event the Bill needed to be strong^r^pther than weaker. It would, however, be possible to undertake Mina^^trengthening legislation would be included in next Session&apos;s progrMjiie^^

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brieiv&lt;M  cussion, said that accepting the Bill in its weakened form was not av^all palatable, but the other possible courses of action were even less acceptable in the circumstances. The Bill, as amended by the House of Lords on the advertising provisions, should therefore be tak  iK.to Royal Assent before Easter. It would certainly be necessary to grj/e an undertaking to introduce strengthening legislation in the nex^&amp;ejn^ion.

The Cabinet -	&apos;   -yyi)

   |bTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that the British t  yCrody	Leyland Board had now talked to all the serious bidders for parts of

I	their business. Contrary to stories in the press, the bidders had been

|previoi*  \\v given as full information as was consonant with normal commercial iReferenceY/^   practice. The Board would finalise their views very shortly, as &apos;they ICC(86) lflCoK^\\were anxious for the uncertainty to end. He hoped to have clear \\_^/Aproposals within a week or two.

FOREIGN	2. THE^dREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, as he had

AFFAIRS	reported&apos;^: the previous meeting, letters had been sent on 14 March to

___	members of Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) staff who

Government	remained members of unions, and the Head of the Civil Service had seen

Communi-	the General Secretaries of the Civil Service unions the same day.	The

cations	representatives(of(/the unions had concentrated on the position of those

Headquarters staff who had or^^i&amp;lly accepted the terms offered by the Government and withdrawn froW_iy*jions but had later rejoined, and were now being Previous	told that, if they&apos;-t  rjy/iot now resign from unions, they would face

Reference:	disciplinary proceeayyg^f or being in breach of the conditions of

CC(86) 10.2 service at GCHQ. UiMOTKKVpresentatives had been told that disciplinary proceedings were a maccei^ror the Director of GHCQ, and the outcome would depend on the mana^  m*wt decision in each individual case; that dismissal was only one,	most extreme one, of a wide range of

disciplinary penalties ava&apos;Hjalitev to management; and that in those circumstances the GovernmenXvv^rjkmuch hoped that there would be no need for any dismissals. In subs  (Mlw Jiress briefing the unions had presented this decision as inaice^itfg that GCHQ members who refused to resign from unions faced the threa  ^e(   dismissal. They had asked to see him on 18 March. He had been abve tprfkeW the representatives of the unions at that meeting that the Di^e^freiNof GCHQ had now informed the Head of the Civil Service that on tnSw^ffmrmation available to him he did not regard dismissal as an appropio^re penalty in disciplinary proceedings for those who had rejoined\nnions in the circumstances of the past months. This had been welcomed by the unions, and it was to be hoped that on this basis stability could be restored at GCHQ at least until the next General Election. Press report#   af his meeting with the representatives of the unions had led some otraer)staff at GCHQ to ask if they were now free to rejoin unions; it was b&gt;Kj5)^3W.de clear to them that they were not free, and that what the Director)pf GCHQ had said in his letter to the Head of the Civil Service appris&amp;^nly to those who had rejoined in the circumstances of the past monfiif

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that he had iirft&amp;mj^ the General Secretaries of the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunicdiirah and Plumbing Union (Mr Eric Hammond) and the Engineers    andOtfan^eers    Association (Mr John Lyons) of the outcome of the ForeigV-aj    \ Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s meeting, and they were content wi^?\jK.

   iFraiv^iTHK FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the parties of the Parliid^hXry traditional right in France had won a slim overall majority in the Elections^&gt;^ Parliamentary elections on 16 March. Monsieur Jacques Chirac of&apos;the Gaullist Party (RPR) was likely to succeed in his current efforts to previous	form a Government. The exact extent of the support for such a

Referencer^-^OWverriment in the National Assembly would be known only on 27 March, CC(86) 10.2	the Assembly reconvened. It was possible that the parliamentary

&apos;v^M/ority would prove unstable in the longer term.

\

Channel	THE   ETSMT^RY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that, following the Cabinet&apos;s

Fixed Link	discusMe^Kon 13 March, the Prime Minister had intervened with the

Presidenv^of France on the outstanding matters which had then been Previous	delaying signature of the concession agreement on the Channel Fixed

Reference:	Link. President Mitterrand had reacted rapidly; France had conceded the

CC(86) 10.2	points at issue^emd the agreement had been signed on the basis of her

understandings/witw the President when they announced the decision of the two Govern*^i),tQ*t Lille in January.

  South Africa THE FOREIGN AND COMMOotJ^aL^ SECRETARY said that the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group h^d^  $toleted its visit to South Africa on Previous	14 March. The Group had  dccraeded in maintaining discretion and

Reference:	avoiding publicity for itsKj  ir1&amp; It had managed to see all the people

CC(86) 10.2	it had wanted to see. It h^dS^rae a good impression on both the South

African Government and the	National Congress. Lord Barber, the

British member of the Group, Hlia/j  i^yed an outstanding role in the work of the Group and in the proposal	had been formulated. The

Government was trying to promote ^rr^  &gt;onse by the South African Government which would enable the d^i  o  ue to continue.

Japan	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WALES said that, during a visit to Japan

which he had just completed, he had found wide^qalisation that the Previous	European Community and the United States meaiiySiisiness in their

Reference:	pressure on Japan for more equal trading and	arrangements.

CC(85) 22.4 Some people in Japan now seemed determined to own w their markets to imports and to move on the other steps which thevS    Sean Community was urging. On the other hand, the recent appreciatictfK^Lr^he value of the yen against the dollar was beginning to arouse conc^M^io. Japanese industry. The Prime Minister, Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone, &lt;tt  $^egun to talk publicly of unspecified emergency measures to protect J/Makse industry from excessively rapid movement in exchange rates. Thuq&apos;/wHile there was now momentum in Japan behind the changes which the Euai    ^fri Community sought, there was also a possibility of a domest^&quot;\  caitical reaction in Japan against such changes. The European Commulirajs^y &amp;ould need to redouble its efforts to secure the desired changes.


   In a brief discussion, it was noted that Japan was unlikely to take ^ lOy\ major measures to protect its industry before the Economic Summit of the seven major industrialised countries in Tokyo in May. There wou^d be a good opportunity for discussion of the appreciation of the yen when (wn the Finance Ministers of a number of key countries were in Washington NX-^y^Sn April for meetings of the Interim Committee of the International /^wi^netary Fund and the Development Committee of the Fund and the World

Republic	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WALES said that he had just returned from a

of Korea	visit to the Far East. The President of the Republic of Korea, Mr Chun

Doo Hwan, wouLd^dJ^S,visiting the United Kingdom from 7 to 10 April and was clearly exngcMjje a serious discussion of trade matters when he called on the P^raH&amp;inister. He would be bringing a group of some 30 prominent Korean\\ndjfe&lt;rialists to the United Kingdom. These people were influential aiwpdfco^thy of attention from the Government.

The Cabinet -

2.	Invited the FWie^gy} and Commonwealth Secretary and the Secretary of^si4j&gt;e for Trade and Industry to arrange for the incfoSsi^plists accompanying the President of Korea to	appropriate programme

in the United Kingdom.

&lt;%&gt;

I COMMUNITY	3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRE^R? said that the European Court

I AFFAIRS	of Justice had ruled in favour of the^Wfited Kingdom in the case which

--	the United Kingdom had brought against\  he European Parliament on the

I Community	Community&apos;s 1986 budget. This decision related only to interim measures

I Budget 1986	but had the effect of reducing, for an interim period, the United

Kingdom&apos;s contribution to correspond to the bd3Sat level established by the Council of Ministers rather than to the   ^ve&lt;|/ adopted by the European Parliament. It was necessary now to^rijicatatrate on winning later in the year the substantive case which tHa^g^sjlpcil of Ministers and a number of member states, including the UniT^^^ingdom, had brought against the European Parliament. In discussion wi{pSA&amp;y&amp; that no other member state had been prepared to join the Utr^^d^&apos;^.ngdom in seeking interim measures. The result however, was ver^^^J^isfactory, even if slightly unexpected.	^ssn

ECONOMIC ^Jvl P   CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that financial markets had AFFAIRS	^^ro^j4ed very well to the Budget. As a result the Bank of England had

bWn/a&amp;le to reduce its dealing rates by 1 per cent. The big four Interest	cl    rip  &gt;banks had immediately responded by reducing their base rates by

iRates	the ^rfyL^rmount. The two largest building societies - the Halifax and

the A^bk  /National - had also moved immediately to reduce their normal mortgag^v^te by 3/J per cent and their endowment mortgage rate (which had beenvfc per cent higher than the normal rate) by IV4 per cent. The new rate was the lowest since 1984. He expected that other building societies would follow. The foreign exchange market, although still volatile, was showing confidence, with the pound at or about $1.50. The stock market rM^onye was also good.

In discussion it w  s^greed that in present market circumstances, in which the oil comp^rfvp  ^had been holding back in reductions in the price of petrol at the pu^^Me^pite the fall in oil prices, until the Budget, it would not be reaso^at  j  Nvfor the duty increase of 7ip a gallon on petrol to be fully pas^^cm. to the consumer. The decision of Shell and British Petroleum to pass/WX&apos;on fully had been widely criticised. It was likely, however, part    nljtyiy in view of the criticism of the companies&apos; action and of r  fcg  ^vpetitive situation in the market, that petrol prices would fall bao^w    n. There were already quite big variations in price in differ^afe^areas of the United Kingdom.

   

Unemployment THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMElt  Ug&amp;  d that he had made clear to the press the further measures which the ^zroe^iment was taking to combat Previous	long-term unemployment. This had been^^ell received, but it would take

Reference:	some time before the employment figures&apos;vjegan to reflect these

CC(86) 8.4 initiatives.
