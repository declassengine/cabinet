   I	1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

[fFAIRS/^N Commons in the following week and that the prorogation of Parliament I	was still planned to take place on Friday 7 November.

%

|rogress of	D PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that in the House of Lords

lusiness in cona^d^ration of House of Commons amendments to the Education Bill that    he House of	afCerjx^en the amendment designed to secure freedom of speech on

|or(ls	uniV^^i^ campuses was at risk. A number of influential peers,

includMljgs  me vice-chancellors and a number of the Government&apos;s supporr&amp;i&apos;V; were intending to speak against the amendment.

In discussion it was generally agreed that, if the amendment was lost, it would need to be reinstated in the House of Commons; it was to be hoped that the Ikroee of Lords would accept the Commons&apos; decision.

H

   he Autumn THE PRIME MINISTER   dij^phat the Ministerial Group on Public Expenditure Statement on under the Lord Presidigjr^a^f the Council had reached agreement on a   he Economy number of programmes,	Chief Secretary, Treasury had resolved

outstanding issues on a	of others. She therefore hoped that it

would be possible for the/irab\met to discuss the outcome of the public expenditure survey at thexx^j^e^ing the following week. In previous years the timetable had been^w\3the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make the Autumn Statement in the ftw^d^yof Commons on the Tuesday following the Cabinet meeting. That time^al^p&gt; was not possible in the present year because of the timing of tWe^prpnogation of Parliament. Provided, therefore, that the Cabinet was al^erpvcomplete its discussion of the outcome of the survey at its meeting^fTd November, the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed to make an or^TrSt&apos;atement in the afternoon immediately after the Cabinet meetingjW^fc^ the printed documents being presented to the House when it resumed raisiness the following week. It would be prudent to set up arrangements&apos;por handling the concluding stages of the public expenditure survey in the way she had described, but the survey would of course not be completed until it had been approved by Cabinet.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that his St^em^nt would cover the outturn for public expenditure in 1986-87, the pl^n^/for the next three years, and the economic prospects shown in the Inon^wyAct Forecast. Departments would no doubt be issuing their own pres^rfowces in the usual way. The texts of these should be agreed withM^tg^T^easury. The positive and forward-looking presentation of expenditure&apos;T&gt;r^grammes would be very important in sustaining the market&apos;s confin Government policies. The detailed handling of the followMig/jre.ek&apos; s business was affected by an Opposition motion on the econoin^i&apos;^Copresent scheduled for debate on 5 November: he would discuss this wixlrOtfre Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip.


   The Cabinet -Took note.

\

I AFFAIRS (/ /HE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that at Saughton Prison in

P   1 	EdirifeiS&amp;h one prison officer and three prisoners had been taken hostage

I &apos;dent at	by a/^roup   f five prisoners all of whom had a violent record. The

rc	inciqgfS^ad now entered its third day and the condition of the hostages

fU8on	was bediAp^Jig to deteriorate. The ringleader of the group had not been

receivia^the medication he required to control his psychotic disorder. The Priso^j Governor might need to seek the advice of the local police.

locial	THE PRIME MINIsTESKaiiid that during questions in Parliament earlier that

Security	week it had been ura^W to her attention that an Irish tinker, with his

lenefit	wife and 11 childr^w^Aving been denied supplementary benefit in

Intitlement	Dublin, had crossed&lt;^0^t^ United Kingdom where his claim had been

allowed with the resiAl^Kvkt the family were now allegedly in receipt of some   2,000 per week. ^TM^yas the sort of case which brought the I	social security system	repute.

In discussion the followinV-^ai^\points were made -

a.	As the Irish Governaww/tightened their benefit system in response to their current eJcles^Klie problems there was a clear risk that the number of such ca^esw  &gt;uld grow.

b.	One possible option might^J*^^   place a ceiling on the total amount of benefit any one famil^t^iild receive.

c.	An alternative would be to eiuwe strict reciprocity with other countries. This would need tw take account of European Community law on the subject. A particular problem arose, however, in relation to Irish citizens because of their unique status under treaties with the Irish Republic.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, s^i^yhat the problem clearly required further study. This should ini \^-Aj^y*\be carried forward by the Secretary of State for Social Servi^^^yiiv consultation with the Secretary of State for Employment. It was Lm&amp;kv that this study would expose issues outside the social security^^^Tl^J which might need to be considered in a wider forum.


   The Cabinet -

Invited the Secretary of State for Social ))	Services and the Secretary of State for

Employment to proceed as indicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.

OREIGN	3* &lt;^H    TOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that his announcement

FFAIRS	in tili^Sou^e of Commons on the previous day of the introduction from

1 Febry  &lt;y&apos;i987 of a Falkland Islands Interim Conservation and lkland	Management Zone to conserve fish stocks around the Islands, which would

Island	be virtually co-extensive with the existing Falkland Islands Protection

i&apos;sheries	Zone, had been well received in Parliament and had been welcomed in the

Falkland Island^-^The reaction of Argentina had been less intemperate than had at f i/rat~&apos;seemed likely:	a nation-wide broadcast by the

President, Dr i$^Li-ALfons in, had been cancelled. Overall, the reaction to the British ariaoun^ement had so far been as good as could be expected. The BrQ^s^action did not exclude the resumption of the search for a multil^t^r^il fisheries regime around the Falkland Islands, which the Government majKfceen pursuing for the past two years. The unilateral move had b&lt;^ft^n  de necessary by aggressive Argentine patrolling of the area and&apos;^ipgentina&apos; s conclusion of bilateral fisheries agreements with the Sov^^^Jnwon and Bulgaria, as well as the rapid growth in fishing activitjQ^^aWl the Falkland Islands.

\

fcyria	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRgi&amp;RV.said that, following the

conviction of Mr Nezar Hindawi (foi^cempting to sabotage an El Al previous	flight from Heathrow Airport) in	Court on 24 October, the

Reference:	Government had announced the rupture   a^^^pplomatic relations with Syria.

KC(86) 34.3	Syria had responded with a propaganda&apos;       fensive, the expulsion of the

British Embassy in Damascus within seve^days and an immediate ban on British over   flights of Syrian airspace and on British use of Syrian ports. The Departments concerned were considering what further action the United Kingdom should take against Syria,instance in the fields of technical co-operation and export credits/^At^)a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council of the European ComrnurvQjj^^&amp;C) on 27 October, all but Greece had supported the British action hmd^algreed not to accept in their countries the Syrian diplomats expellea^lijJnd^he United Kingdom in connection with the Hindawi case. It had not be^n%5^sible at the meeting to secure agreement on wider measures again^Jx^j^Xa. A majority would have been willing to recall their Ambassadors rconupajnascus for consultations and a large majority would have been will^W  ^^o ban arms sales to Syria, suspend high level visits, place restriction^ on Syrian Embassy staff and introduce tighter security for flights   ^^^Lan Arab Airlines. The EC Commission had agreed to suspend special	on

agricultural exports to Syria. The United Kingdom had made	that

it would not agree to the renewal, which fell due on 1 November4ik^t\the


   I    1r/y\ Community&apos;s Financial Protocol with Syria. The disappointing result of the Foreign Affairs Council suggested, in retrospect, that there had been insufficient time between the United Kingdom&apos;s decisions on action against Syria on 24 October and the Foreign Affairs Council on &lt;0^27 October for our partners to give proper consideration to the subject to be ready to act in concert. Since then the Federal Republic of NA^Gglpnany had acted unilaterally to prohibit arms sales to Syria, to end level visits and to review the activities in the Federal Republic Syrian Embassy and of Syrian Arab Airlines and also to end rind^C^al aid to Syria and to freeze disbursements of commodity aid. He hoped/pnat there would be agreement at the meeting of Foreign Ministers of raa-&apos;jiift countries on 10 November to take further action against Syria.

Ludi Arabia THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, while it was too soon to assess property, the reasons for the dismissal of the Minister of levious	Petroleum and /Minanal Resources of Saudi Arabia, Shaikh Ahmad Yamani, it

Lference:	appeared that KgMiastNbeen made the scapegoat for the economic problems

E(86) 34.3 of his country, [f Jj

In a brief discussifefyiL/Q was noted that the dismissal of Shaikh Yamani might be followed by(pj  aiiffes in the oil policies of Saudi Arabia, and that expectation of sadft\  ^5,nge could have the unwelcome effect of stimulating uncertainty Jdv^^rkets.

bMMUNITY	4. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH ST^^^RY said that useful progress

FFAIRS	had been made on external trade issue^/ap^fche Foreign Affairs Council on

I   	27 October. The Council had agreed to^iciunch action under Article XXIII

[ade	of the General Agreement on Tariffs and\Jrade (GATT) against Japan&apos;s

slations	discriminatory taxation on alcoholic drinks, including whisky. This

Uh Japan, would be carried forward as quickly as possible and the Council had le United	agreed on a 30 day deadline for consideration^di^Bpmmunity action if the

tates and	GATT were to find, as we expected, against Japan. (J The Commission was

Idxterranean also examining other sectors. The Council hacT^^liciv^d agreement on a    untries	settlement of the trade dispute with the United \jto:ap&apos;e/&amp;* over citrus and

pasta. The mandate for trade negotiations with M^r  r  ieyrranean countries levious	was also now agreed. At this Council meeting pref    KKd trade access

   THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that agreement had been out	reached on 27 October on the implementation of the measures already

decided on imports of gold coins from South Africa and on investment in lfV1  	South Africa. The decision by the member states of the Community on

1(86) 31V^xwrvestment made quite clear that the ban on investment could be [	vf^mplemented, as the United Kingdom intended to implement it, by guidance

companies rather than be legislation.

tEACHERS&apos; PAY, 5. The Cabinet considered the Report by the Ministerial Group on iuTlES AND * Teachers&apos; Pay (RISC 122) on School Teachers&apos; Pay, Duties and Conditions CONDITIONS of Service (C(8^T%), together with drafts of statements to be made by Ip service the Secretariek^f&gt;  *&gt;3te for Education and Science and for Scotland on 30 October announcingjthe Government&apos;s decision.

Previous	yy

Reference:	THE SECRETARY OF ST^raVraR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE recalled the history of

CC(86) 30.4	the two year dispute M&amp;rfbv school teachers&apos; pay and duties. The offer

made by his predecessa^wi&amp;&gt; previous year had not achieved any progress towards an agreement on p^^and conditions, and negotiations had eventually begun in the	part of that year under the auspices of

the Advisory Conciliation&apos;^adyk^bitration Service (ACAS). These negotiations had led to an	agreement at Coventry in July, which

although marking some progrels^s&apos;^0&lt;ftards a sensible definition of teachers&apos; duties would have pu^uWinpromoted teachers on a scale rising to   14,500, while reducii^P&apos;drevnumber of promoted posts. Such a pay structure would be incompatibLe^if&apos;Cth the proper development of the education service. More recently ch^xeport of the Main Committee chaired by Sir Peter Main (Cmnd	produced recommendations on

pay structure, duties and conditions cNy&apos;s^vice of Scottish teachers which were broadly consistent with th^G^fernment1 s objectives, although the pay increases put forward as part cr^the package were high. Competition between trade unions in England and Wales added to the difficulty of making sensible progress; the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, which wp^~expanding at the expense of the National Union of Teachers, an&lt;^/wh^h had not accepted the Coventry agreement, had now called for furQjejr^5|Rdustrial action in pursuit of pay increases still higher than those^tgrj^d at Coventry, and had threatened to picket the meeting between the&apos;ioCTiyauthority employer and union negotiators arranged by ACAS tOM^a^p-^Dlace at Nottingham on 8 November. At that meeting the emplo^e^^wjd the unions, with the knowledge and encouragement of the Labour PaV&apos;fy^ N?&lt;jre likely to seek further to embarrass the Government be agreeing rao|pe^w  ^ensive new pay arrangements than were contemplated at Coventry and concessions to the teachers which would add to the costs

education service. There was little prospect of any progrea^^otoards an effective agreement on teachers&apos; duties and conditions of se&apos;wjrjie&apos;.


   MISC 122 had therefore concluded that the Government should step in and set its own terms for resolving the dispute, in advance of the Nottingham meeting. The Group&apos;s recommendation to the Cabinet was that ^ pay increases averaging 16.4 per cent (ie the same level as recommended 7/ky Main) should be introduced in two equal stages, the first on &apos;v5ovdanuary 1987, and the second on 1 October 1987. The settlement would until March 1988, and there could be no question of any further pay ^(Ato-^kases for any reason during that period. The effect would be to Ln^raase the pay of the Head of a large comprehensive school from   2g^J0O\to   30,000 a year, while that of a good honours graduate with two v^rj^service would increase from   8,000 to   10,000 a year. For Englaif^^nd Wales this would mean additional public expenditure provis  jrfv^i   490 million in 1987-88, towards which the Government would contribute   200 million in Exchequer grant; these amounts were double those offered by his predecessor. This very generous pay settlement for teachers could be justified only by the fundamental restructuring of the profession, carrying with it the essential clarification of teachers&apos; duties and concKk^hns of service, on which the Government would be insisting. Noi^ddVtional pay would be granted until the teachers either accepted the prbpiirfsiri^ or had them imposed through primary legislation.

MISC 122 had also clnpalaided that the opportunity should be taken to abolish the Burnham^omji^fctee and introduce new machinery to determine teachers&apos; pay and coitdH-fth^. It was clear that this task could not be left to voluntary negoiiarj^iis between the employers and the unions; instead pay and conditio&lt;fe&apos;^  ^ld be set by the Secretary of State on the advice of an Interim Advi&apos;^ry/COTimittee. This would require early legislation.	/Yv,

The proposals represented a neW^^Qejl for teachers which would provide greater rewards for responsibili/^/ahd proven good performance, and so enhance the position of career	they would also enhance the

authority of Heads, and so enable&lt;^chp^is to function more effectively. They were a very generous response	needs of the teaching

profession; the Government could go ms^&amp;irther. The Nottingham meeting should be given the opportunity of acMp^rng the Government&apos;s proposals, although in practice it was most unlik&lt;^^/ that the unions would agree to this. The way would then be open for the Government to impose their proposals through new legislation. There should be strong public support for the Government&apos;s proposals:	the Gojiarnment would then in

effect be appealing over the heads of the uniara^Teyders to all individual teachers. Subject to the agreemeno^^f^the Cabinet, he would announced the Government&apos;s decisions in a statemiui   tyjiat day, the draft of which had been circulated to Cabinet colleagua^r^p&apos;O

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that the ma^&apos;Mjbstance of the MISC 122 proposals would apply equally in Scotland, a&lt;ik^u  h the existence of the Main Committee Report meant that indepejpdppt advice on teachers&apos; pay, duties and conditions was already availa&amp;ik^^   giving the package greater authority. Public opinion would unde^s^^pdkand support the staging of the pay increases. There was some p^o^o^t that the package would be put into place by the Scottish Joint Ne^^^i^ing Committee, which covered both pay and conditions, but it was


   uncertain what would be the result of a ballot of all Scottish teachers.

&quot;&gt; His statement, the draft of which was before colleagues, would follow A\ that by the Secretary of State for Education and Science.

discussion the following main points were made -

Greater emphasis should be placed in the Secretary of State // %r Education and Science&apos;s statement on the fact that the

/VMyernment1 s proposals represented a firm and final decision, and a basis for further negotiation. It would not be open to ^  ttte/^ottingham meeting to seek to vary them, or to accept them on anyatjaer basis than the . terms and conditions specified by the Government.

b.	There could be no question of further additions to expenditure resulting from recommendations of the Main Committee not directly related to^p^v and pay structure.

c.	It wa&amp;3e^5&amp;ntial that the specification of teachers&apos; duties and conditions a\ service, and the proposed new salary scales, which were to^^^bnveyed by letter to the leader of the local authority emplshould be fully consistent with all the Government&apos;s obj^r^hs. Once that document had been published, there would be ncP&apos;op^^funity for second thoughts.

d.	It was essentiasl^uAjt the Secretary of State for Education and

Science&apos;s statement sKSw^d^be unambiguous about the abolition of the Burnham Committee. &lt;^p^{Mractice the Government would be imposing their own settl^mew. The remit of the Interim Advisory Committee which would be	the new machinery to settle

teachers&apos; pay and conditioiia^wprud need to be carefully defined.

Its task would be to advise	Secretary of State on teachers&apos;

terms and conditions of service^/aijd on the distribution of a specified amount for teachers&apos;	it was important that the

financial markets should not see ^h^^Committee as another review body without financial restraints,&lt;Vlf the Nottingham meeting did not accept the Government&apos;s proposals, the Committee&apos;s first task would be to advise on the distribution of the money the Government had decided to make available. At the same time, however, care would need to be taken to avoid stirring/jJ-^necessary hostility among teachers by announcing the decisiomsovthat it could be represented as the removal of negotiating^ralgirN^ leaving them with no alternative safeguards.

e.	Pay increases on the scale proposed coula Jaa^^&apos;very serious repercussions elsewhere in the public sector, i^^^ence against such repercussions was the fact that teachers wouldikOfuture have to comply with a more onerous specification of theC^x^rc&apos;i.es and would be subject to much tigher contracts. The pack^g/ajKiuld not be presented simply as conferring benefits on teacherSrjXoitere were a number of aspects in the specification of duties ano\coo^artions of service which their unions would have wished to avoia^^m^ presenting the package to the wider public, the Government^ijiro^d

s/*&apos; 1 \


   a	not focus exclusively on the position of teachers; the underlying

reason for putting forward the package was their concern for ))	children and for the improvement of the quality of education.

In presenting the proposals, Ministers should avoid being &apos;v/^7 drawn into comparisons of their cost over a four year period with   at of the former Secretary of State for Education and Science&apos;s ^/oKer over a similar period. The settlement now put forward &lt;/cov  red the two financial years 1986-87 and 1987-88 and the

&lt;  &lt;    i-fe-ion thereafter had yet to be settled. The figures on which to   orfea&apos;ntrate were the costs in 1987-88.

g.	\\No attempt should be made to hide the costs of the proposals. Improving the education service, and financing the new arrangements for teachers, meant a heavy burden on taxpayers and ratepayers.

The average increase in rates in England resulting from the GovernmentT^&apos;Mioposals would be in the range 2-4 per cent; it would be better Wo make this clear in the initial statement than to have the point e&gt;H7b  cTskd through subsequent questioning.

h.	It was	that all teachers should be fully informed

about the Governmeni/S proposals. The unions would not provide information in an^dJaXwfive way, and the Government would therefore need to consider other^&amp;nrs of getting their message across. One possibility, subject&lt;^a^covestigation of its propriety, would be to convey the GovernmentX&lt;^_jyroposals by letter to all teachers, drawing on the list hertf/fOT\\pensions purposes. Other ways of providing information, ch^oii^FK advertising and through Party channels, should also be   ^e^^irdered.

i.	The decision to abolisli^t^^yrnham Committee would in any

event require an Education Biilin  3the forthcoming Session of Parliament. A reference to thi^/jheaid be made in The Queen&apos;s Speech.	V/So

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the disci&amp;6ion, said that the Cabinet endorsed the proposals of the MISC 122 Group. The Government had taken final decisions on teachers&apos; pay, duties and conditions of service. Teachers&apos; pay in England and Wales and in Scotlan^l should be increased by 8.2 per cent on average (on the current basa&apos;V&apos;ohN 1 January 1987 and by a further 8.2 per cent (on the same base) onAJL (/  Lober 1987; these increases allowed for the salary structure put fo  y  ra\ by Main and for the comparable salary structure now proposed for   jvg-^apd and Wales.

These large increases in pay were justified only by ^pra/cJearer specification of duties and more onerous conditions o r	r ac t which

teachers would be required to accept in return. There^pmii^ be no question of further negotiation, and the Government should/f  sist on full delivery of all their terms; if, as seemed likely iiV&apos;jifig&apos;ihnd and Wales, the local authority employers and teachers&apos; unions	accept

them, the Government should move quickly to impose them throu^n^l^ew primary legislation. New legislation would be introduced inNknVjsvent to abolish the Burnham Committee, and to establish new machine^Jf^o^ settle teachers&apos; pay and conditions; this would be done by the S^jre^ry


   of State on the advice of an Interim Advisory Committee, whose remit \ would cover duties and conditions of service, and the distribution of )&apos;pay within the amount decided by the Government. Every effort should be ^Sade to put the Government&apos;s message across effectively to the teaching /v\pwifession and the wider public; the Government&apos;s decision to introduce Sawktantial increases in teachers&apos; pay were only justified by the ^iS^antial concessions teachers were required to make in return; the   ^tlSihent should thus not be allowed to constitute a precedent for otbfixEwil ic sector pay negotiators. There was no avoiding the fact that/M^settlement meant a considerable additional burden on taxpayers and rScTfiayers. It reflected the Government&apos;s concern for children and for the^/mi^ity of education. Given the firm decision to introduce new machinew^to settle teachers pay and conditions, mention should be made of the necessary legislation in The Queen&apos;s Speech.

The Cabinet -

1.	Endorsed &lt;^:he proposals in C(86) 21, subject to the poim=V^ira&amp;e in discussion.

2.	Invited rhjS^ecretaries of State for Education

and Science an&lt;r^K^cotland to announce the Government&apos;s deci^ic^t^^ later that day, in Parliamentary statemwryra the texts of which should be amended	account of points made in

discussion.

3.	Invited the Secret^i^s^Qf State for Education

and Science and for Scothkj^^o consider whether the Government&apos;s proposals	and should be

communicated by individual	to all teachers.

4.	Took note that the Prime J^jri^fcqr would arrange for the inclusion of a referencd^^^ahe Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Pariiame^V^rjP the Education Bill which would need to be introd^ded to give effect to the Government&apos;s proposals^
