RESIGNATION 0The Cabinet expressed their deepest and heartfelt appreciation of KEITH ^Ap^iedicated public service and inspiration which Sir Keith Joseph had hnSEPH MP	^en&gt;\s a member of the Cabinet in every Conservative Administration

r	si  ^   v^2. He would be very much missed from their counsels.

PARLIAMENTARY 3. The vabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House AFFAIRS	of Commons on its return from the Spring Adjournment.

Power Workers&apos; THE SECRETARY OF IMAg^OR ENERGY said that, with the assistance of the Negotiations Advisory Conciliati^fcAhd Arbitration Service, a settlement had now been reached in the negotiAoprte between the Electricity Council and the Previous	unions in the electriC^Ok^pply industry. This included a pay increase

Reference:	of 6i per cent and a form$*  which remitted for future consideration the

CC(86) 20.6 question of a new bridgift&amp;tffme between industrial staff and the engineers.

; \    

Redundancies THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY 5^W&amp;that the National Coal Board

in the Coal	(NCB) intended to make significanr&apos;mMjiilng reductions in the coal

I Industry	industry over the following two yea  ^r^^f)iese were being considered

region by region. In the coming yearroej^ would be substantial redundancies declared in Yorkshire and   vocotland. Against this, NCB Enterprise Limited, the company set up the NCB to provide a source of alternative employment in the areas affected by redundancies, was making very good progress. It had already created some 6,800 job opportunities and several large projects were under contemplartrj3*n which would significantly increase this total. It had alsn^h^y considerable success in attracting investment from the private sectoi^^I&amp;&lt;s was currently running at more than five times the initial inve^ime^iin the company by the NCB. It was important to secure as much pubrbejrv/as possible for this.


   THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that an announcement T&apos;would be made that afternoon of the new terms and conditions of service Con	of General Managers in the National Health Service (NHS). The main

Ser^onalX^V^\ feature of the new arrangements would be the introduction of short-term Natlth3 vCv/flspntracts (usually of three years duration) with loss of rights Hea .	&gt;^O^ociated with any previous NHS post and no rights of renewal of

Servic^	\Ov#ffttract. An element of compensation for this loss of tenure was

Genera	in the ProPosed new PaY rates. The consequence of these

was that some individuals would in the normal course of events re$ew&amp;&gt; increases which could be represented as out of keeping with the rates^^ecommended by the various Review Bodies whose reports the Cabinet were^cC^^hsider under a subsequent item of the agenda. He believed that tVre/cJ^nces of such criticism could be largely avoided by adopting a tvo-s&amp;ge approach and he had agreed this course with the Chief Secretary^ Treasury. The Written Answer and press notice by means of which the announcement would be made, would stress the balance being struck between loss of tenure and pay. Taken as a whole, the arrangements re^SXented a very significant step forward in promoting efficiency in the	It had to be accepted, however, that some

General Managerfci^eaS with the change might choose to resign; whilst, on the other handiftjjyre could never be a guarantee against mischievous comment in the med&apos;i^&amp;^ut apparently generous pay awards, however good the reason for them    !

Picketing of THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR^S^J^l SERVICES said that an ugly situation Department of was developing in connectioiM^H^a cleaning contract for a Department Health and	of Health and Social SecuritjN^pHSS) local office in Liverpool. The

Social	cleaning of the office had been /  ji&amp;ac ted out to the private sector for

Security	many years and the contract had Ve^ep  ^y been awarded to a small local

Office in	company. The Transport and Gener  &apos;Jfo  kers&apos; Union had objected to this

Liverpool	change, and were now organising int^a^dajppry mass picketing of the

office and seeking to escalate the dfrs&amp;nte* He believed it would be wrong for the Government to stand asid^o^nd was in consultation with the Attorney General and other colleagiroT about the most appropriate legal action to take.

Ck ,

Report by	THE PRIME MINISTER said that the report by HM Inspectprs of Schools,

HM Inspectors published on 21 May, had been most unfairly treao^d^^Othe press, of Schools on Newspaper headlines had given the misleading impres^^sj^hat the main I the Effects thrust of the report had been to criticise the resou^  e^^vailable for of Local	schools, whereas in fact the report had made useful craiSi^res on the

Authority	quality and performance of teachers.

Expenditure	j)

Policies on	In discussion it was noted that the press reception had bA^j^^J\least

Education	partly attributable to the contents and layout of the Depar^me^^^of

Provision in Education and Science&apos;s press release itself, which had beetr^cur|ulated England - 1985 in draft too late for colleagues to make all the considered p&lt;&amp;Wte&apos;Xhey


   would have wished. The former Secretary of State for Education and CScience had acted swiftly to limit the damage, and the coverage in that &apos;   &apos;vyy	day&apos;s newspapers was more balanced. One way of minimising the risks of

similar incidents in future might be to reinstate the practice of Chief y^y&apos;/.jnformation Officers meeting weekly under the chairmanship of a Minister ^-^Vyith responsibilities for the co-ordination of Government information.

NV&gt;ftfej&gt;RlME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the incidents   mpfiffsised the need for effective co-ordination of Government xnfwA^tion. She would wish to consider the best arrangements for this.

FOREIGN	4. THE FOREIwff~^ND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the raids by South

I AFFAIRS	Africa on targe^s/jHsZambia, Zimbabwe and Botswana on 19 May had been

__	militarily ineffe/tiye. The targets	did not	appear to have been

I South Africa	logically selectea^i&amp;OTr instance, a	meeting	between South Africa and

Botswana on the coi^nM^f border incidents had been due to take place I Previous	four days later. Th^^dirc appeared	to serve no South African interest,

I Reference:	save perhaps as a demotis&apos;Orjffcion to the right	wing in South African

I CC(86) 20.3 politics. The decision .i^xic&amp;rry out the raids had appeared to ignore the work of the Commonwesri^ihjBminent Persons Group (COMGEP), although the Group had been visitin^Sierffoh Africa at the time. A letter from President Botha to the PrimwTC^  ster, attempting to justify the raids, appeared to be a standard letJS    yaddressed to a number of Heads of Government; it had not re ferrety jirf^DMGEP or sought seriously to explain the South African raids. The sWth^frican action had been condemned across Africa and much more wide]^*Jmere would be increased pressure for further sanctions against South^A^j-ca. In the United States Senate, which had successfully pres  ad^  resident Reagan to introduce some sanctions in 1985, new moves wer^AiJs^ly. The work of COMGEP was in serious jeopardy. The British memb^. Lord Barber, had made a major contribution in helping the members, whVrepresented very different countries and views, to develop a coherent group personality. Lord Barber had thus been able to persuade the Group to proceed with a meeting with South African Ministers shortly   frilr the raids. The meeting had been inconclusive, not least because xyie South African Government remained divided about the proposals /o&apos;f~lshe Group. The South African Government&apos;s reply to the Group was thenAforc^till outstanding. Earlier, the Group had had reasonably encouraging gfdfyigs with the African National Congress and with Mr Nelson Mandelar/^^he Group had not abandoned all hope of continuing to play a useful ro^&lt;\\/yhey were due to meet in London in two weeks&apos; time, to consider their lArt on .their work. The Government should do everything possible to Hrarf^pyhe Group in play. A key consideration would be whether the coherenceN^xfvptoe Group

M


     11/)	would be undermined when individual members were subjected to pressures

l//y\	by their own Governments. If the Group held together, it might still

have a useful role.

Cry&apos; In discussion, the following points were made -

a.	The Government should make strenuous efforts to support COMGEP and to keep negotiations going. The imposition of sanctions on

^y^^^South Africa could place 120,000 jobs in the United Kingdom at &gt;^risk. If South Africa deteriorated into violence, many of the   r s)rath Africans with a right of abode in the United Kingdom might ^i^shvto settle in this country. The consequences for the United ^Kdi$$uom of major deterioration of the situation in South Africa or oy^^Kctions would be much greater than for other Western cowitr ies.

b.	The Governments of the Federal Republic of Germany, France and

the Uni ted States would probably wish to maintain opposition to sanctions/yfjpiiknst South Africa. It was in the Government&apos;s interest	hard to influence them in this sense. There would

be significami   disadvantages if the United Kingdom were to become isolated in	sanctions.

c.	A meeting	Commonwealth Heads of Government to

review the Accor^on. vouth Africa agreed at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting^   1985 was due to take place in London at the beginning of Aiiorj^Mto consider the work of COMGEP. If the Group&apos;s role were toxJ^odje^&apos;to an end prematurely, there would be pressure to bring the	of Heads of Government forward.

The	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETMi&apos;sai.d that, contrary to the

Netherlands	expectations of some observers, the^ig   of centre coalition government

of the Christian Democrat and LiberalV&amp;aptpies had won the general election in the Netherlands on the prwidus day. The two parties together had secured the same number orgeats and the same majority as before. Within the coalition, the Christian Democrats had won seats at the expense of the Liberals, and had overtaken the Labour Party as the largest party in Parliament. The Labour Party^^jd .also increased its number of seats by winning those previously hefrd ^ry the Communist Party.

In a brief discussion, it was noted that the co	government had

followed a policy of financial discipline and coroijraitits on public expenditure. The Netherlands Government&apos;s electiony^  2ory should ensure that its earlier decision to carry out the so^J^h^ig of the Netherlands and United States intermediate range nuclea referees would no longer be seriously questioned.	  //^\

   COMmWC$\ 5    THE F0RE1GN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, in preparation AFFArSy\^	for the Un*ted Kingdom Presidency in the second half of 1986, he had had

T full discussions on 21 May with the President, Monsieur Delors, and

Discussi&lt;woA\ men,bers t&apos;ie Commission about the United Kingdom&apos;s objectives and with the Yvyy&gt;3Pproach. These discussions had been satisfactory.

PAY REVIEW	6. TlwL&apos;V/Dinet considered a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet

BODY REPORTS	(C(86) rS&amp; about the recommendations of the Pay Review Bodies (PRBs).

1986

THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was necessary to reach decisions on the recommendations^cHs. the PRBs concerned with the armed forces, doctors and dentists, nurse/, anidwives and professions allied to medicine, and those of the Top Salacie  ^3teview Body (TSRB). As in previous years, the PRBs1 recommendations pmesemted the Government with serious problems, because the members of the-s^Bppies, who had no responsibility for finding the money, continued toM5aYe  cessively influenced by comparability and to pay little or no regaf$*i^M\af fordability. The recommendation of the Ministers directly cotwrei^ep^was that the recommendations, apart from those of the TSRB, should^bjK^iccepted, but that action should be taken to reduce the costs durin^xthe) current financial year by deferring their implementation until 1 Juiy_^rf^is would reduce the average increases paid within the current f inaraYaVArear from the 7.5-8 per cent recommended by the PRBs to	under 6 per cent. The costs of the

pay award for the armed forces&apos;^^piAybe found from within the defence budget; but the recommendations Sin tnev Health Service were more than could be afforded without prejudis^dgjsyrvices to patients. The Chief Secretary, Treasury had therefore, e^epi.ionally, offered to increase Hospitals and Community Health Servi	sh limits by   60 million (for

the United Kingdom as a whole) which,   og/  ier with the benefit of lower than expected inflation and continuing wogress with Health Authorities&apos; cost improvement programmes, should enaDK services to be maintained.

In the case of the groups covered by the TSRB (which had proposed increases averaging 6.5 per cent) the recommendation was that, following the very large increases awarded in 1985, inccM?M should be restricted to the amount required to keep pay broadly conALant-in real terms. Accordingly the pay bill for these groups in 195Br&apos;87ytoould increase by 3 per cent, which translated into increases averaki*(g^4 per cent payable - as in the case of the other Review Body	from 1 July.

At the same time it was proposed to implement the TSkb&gt;^&apos;1985 recommendation that a system of discretionary increme^sYa^ove the normal scale maxima should be introduced for Grades 2 ancp^&amp;^where the benefits from the 1985 pay restructuring had been rathe^^tfp&apos;i&amp;Nmodest. This would make it possible to reward exceptional service\mo/e^\ effectively; the discretionary additional increments would^E^OX withdrawable if performance ceased to merit them, and would &apos;^hirpd&apos;5ore not be pensionable. At the same time it was also proposed to^awe^the


   increments up to the normal maxima for Grades 2 and 3, which were introduced for the first time in 1985, no longer automatic; such increments, once awarded, would not be subject to withdrawal and would v be pensionable; it was to be expected that the performance of people )i qualified for promotion to these grades would normally be such as to   ^arrant the award of these increments. Subject to the approval of the &apos;Vcsbinet, it was proposed that the Government&apos;s decisions on all the \	&apos; recommendations should, in accordance with established practice,

^h^X^nounced that afternoon by Written Answer at 4.00 pm. At the same iilne^^fXletter addressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to all Metjitf^r^oof Parliament explaining the Government&apos;s decisions would be avai^J^Ks-Nin the Vote Office and the Whip&apos;s Office. Drafts of the WritC  i*^nswer and the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s letter were attachM^5^C(86) 15.

In discussion the following main points were made -

a.	The   6iLmillion increase in Health Service cash limits should

not be judrl&apos;Med exclusively in terms of the Review Body rgrnmmpnriwjnVs The existing cash limits already included an allowance roMiMher pay and prices, and the Health Service would also have	  150 million from the cost improvement

programme; theg^maunts had to cover not only the Review Body increases, but aflredMbay settlements with other Health Service employees and ri^^|T^emands for patient care for demographic and other reasons. It w^^ssential not to give the impression that further increases v/tfC&amp;tfye made in cash limits to finance pay settlements for non-St^i^ey&apos;yBody Health Service staff.

b.	The proposals concwimf| performance-related pay for Civil Service Grades 2 and 3 wajidlv^quire careful handling. Appropriate consultation would be requ^pOT/^ith staff interests, and a good deal of work remained to be d^ireVto define the criteria for the award of discretionary addition^^increments. The announcement of these new arrangements, alongs^gjsC^&amp;ose for the pay of Health Authority General Managers, woulaV^^ positive step towards establishing sensible per formancev  e,&apos;fated pay differentiation at senior levels; but it was doubtfur^hether the withdrawal of automaticity of increments below the present Grade 2 and 3 maxima     which had not been recommended by the TSRB, and which might be seen by the Staff Side as foreshadowing a widej^3tt.tack on automatic increments throughout the Civil Service rMsh^fild be included in the package.

c.	Given the special steps taken in the ca&apos;se^MV the TSRB, it seemed likely that criticism of the Governmenr^V/^^.sions would focus on the deferment of the pay award to nur^^Y^ever the less the Government&apos;s decisions should be seen as repVesep^p.ng a fair balance, and it seemed likely that the PRBs would ^  JY^^act adversely to them.


   d.	Despite the difficulties encountered in 1985, it would be right to make the Order increasing the salary of the Lord Chancellor, so as to maintain the present differential with that of the Lord Chief Justice; there was unlikely to be any particular difficulty in securing the necessary Affirmative Resolutions.

PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet fbsed all the proposals set out in C(86) 15 for responding to the commend at ions, apart from the withdrawal of automaticity from inp^efnwits below the Grades 2 and 3 maxima. They also agreed that an Ordec^ficreasing the salary of the Lord Chancellor by   2,400 should be laid^^tifjjYe Parliament in due course. Appropriate arrangements should be mad  	ify the Review Body Chairmen and representatives of the

staff cenderned of the Government&apos;s decisions. The arrangements for the announcement of the Government&apos;s decisions and their presentation should be as set out in C(86) 15. No amendment was needed to the draft Written Answer she would give to reflect the change in the treatment of increments paid&lt;  ?i\Grades 2 and 3, since the text contained no direct mention of thifei (J
