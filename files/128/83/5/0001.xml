I Northern	SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that the Privy Council

I Ireland	ting on 12 February would be invited to approve an Order in Council

I Local	would give him power to replace by Commissioners local councils in

I Authorities N^xl^rn Ireland who failed to make a rate. The power would be

additional to that under existing legislation which enabled officials of theMCStf^hern Ireland Department of the Environment to administer a specnKc^  ervice when local councillors failed to meet their resptfa^iilities in relation to it. The new power would be discretionary and it would not necessarily have to be used. It was, however, necessary to have the power in being before 15 February, which was the statutory date for making a rate. Unionist councillors should be in no doubt^oi.all the options open to the Government before they took their f:Wal)decisions. They should not be allowed to believe that they could rs councillors whilst failing to undertake their duties under th/rLaUnionist attitudes could still change: a pending case of judicialS&apos;JM^i^ involving Belfast City Council might help in this respect.

The PRIME MINISTER,	up a short discussion, said that, although

the special circumstance^^i0N.Northern Ireland must be recognised, the Government would wish to^^Uuc very carefully before taking a power to send in Commissioners to	authority. Legislation had been

drafted for such an eventu^^^^^n Great Britain, but the Government had not brought it forward, not^^rjyy because it would have taken pressure off the local authorities conVe^^L It was important to make sure that the strategy which had worked isx//GT^^i Britain was inappropriate for Northern Ireland. It would be p^  ibte in principle to arrange a meeting of the Privy Council after^^C^eparture of Her MaJesty The Queen on 16 February.

The Cabinet -

Invited the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to discuss the question of an Order in Council with the Lord President of the Council, who wa^J^vreport back as necessary.	(( v

   FOREIGN	2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thA^th^sltuation m

   AFFAIRS	Haiti remained uncertain. President Duvalier seemedmoment to

I 	have re-established his position in the capital but the^^j^wwl

   Haiti	expectation was that he would be deposed before very lor^^ijnere was no

obvious successor:	a military regime was one possibilityV-^^S^e was no

resident British Embassy in Port   au   Prince but a British	was

currently there on a visit. There were up to 85 British nac&apos;vMwl^i.n


   Haiti. The United Kingdom and United States Governments had joint contingency plans for evacuation of their nationals, if necessary.

%

i Uganda nCv^/Bhe FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had taken the

pnortunity of the meeting of the European Community countries and the Previous	Line States in Lusaka on 3 and 4 February to discuss the situation

Reference:	  oUwmda with several Foreign Ministers of the Front Line States. All

CC(86) 4th Had^prought that the Ugandan President, Yoweri Museveni, was likely to Conclusions,	prwSw&lt;S2feferable to his recent predecessors. All had agreed that the

Minute 4	key&apos;wHipn was the degree to which President Museveni would achieve

recom  i&apos;W!ation with the provinces not at present under the control of the National Resistance Army. The United Kingdom should build up its dialogue with President Museveni, so as to influence him in positive directions. The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mrs Lynda Cha,ik  r), would visit Kampala on 12 February.

%

I Nigeria	THE FOREIGN AND COtfiffiMJM^LTH SECRETARY said that on 3 February the

Nigerian Government ^a^g^  anted agr  ment for the new British High Previous	Commissioner in Lago^&apos;\Jr^. appointment of Mr Ewans would probably be

[Reference:	announced on 7 February	Nigerian Government had not yet nominated

CC(86) 1st	a new High Commissioner^^iaVidon, but the prospect of the exchange of

I Conclusions High Commissioners markeaya^Kj^Stinct step forward in the rebuilding of I Minute 3	Anglo-Nigerian relations. /rfrarb^had been useful contacts between the

Central Bank of Nigeria and&apos;^h^l&amp;nk of England on the question of possible fraud cases relatingWfo^t  feeria and involving certain banks and firms in the City of London. I^Jf^rpcKl talks continued between Nigeria and the International Monetary Fiwf^  rout a package of economic measures which Nigeria could present as being^S&apos;elf   imposed but which the Fund would subsequently endorse. The ap^g&lt;?ffinearing in the case of the two British engineers from Bristow Helicopyej^ Limited, who were held in prison in Nigeria, was expected in lac^iebruary.

I [Southern	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said th&amp;t ^ie situation in the

I Africa	Republic of South Africa had become a little c  3ta*  c^for the time being.

Children had returned to school. President Both^s^feroeech on 31 January I Previous	had been better than the one he had made in Durbaa-^^^ugust 1985.	He

I Reference:	had promised some legislative reform in the presenr  M^on of the	South

I PC(86) 2nd	African Parliament. But the speech had mainly been ^^wtoement of

     Conclusions	principles. The important question, therefore, was hWw&apos;&apos;  h^speech	would

   linute 3	be followed up by the South African Government. It was^l#  foorthy	that

even Chief Buthelezi, who was the black leader most like^r*to)consider joining the proposed National Statutory Council, had not j^^^raAided


   /fV^\	whether to do so. Another important question was whether the South

African Government would release Mr Nelson Mandela, the former African National Congress leader, from prison.

   &apos;     .

I Meeting	FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the meeting between the

I between	/^BtiMiDean Community countries and the Front Line States on 3 and 4

I European	E  pfi^ary in Lusaka had been very useful. The only European Foreign

I Community	Miru^rers to participate had been the Netherlands and Greek Foreign

I Countries	MwoeiS^s and himself. His own presence had helped to consolidate the

land the	posiKwra^f the United Kingdom in relation to Southern African affairs.

I Front Line	The nairfp  r of participants on each side - twelve representatives of

| States	Europewa Community countries and six of Front Line States - had provided

a good basis for the Europeans to press the Africans to engage in dialogue about the problems of Southern Africa. The communiqu   issued by the meeting^rn Lusaka had been moderate:	the United Kingdom had held

the line on ^rtHar measures against South Africa and had emphasised the importance or  fefoa^gemmonwea1th Eminent Persons Group.

During the meetra^^^^usaka, an official from the Foreign and Commonwealth Offic^&apos;^asj^had a meeting with representatives of the African National Co  jj^s  v (ANC). There had been no question of the United Kingdom engagfe^jr^Ministerial contact with the ANC. Virtually all the countries of the^ijjrvopean Community had already had contact with the ANC at official leveZs&apos;jnie meeting had provided the opportunity to explain the role and impo^fc^  k of the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group, and the ANC had seemiid^wvlling to give the Group a chance. The United Kingdom had also urgia Mis ANC not to engage in violence and had made clear the reasons for Bre^L&amp;k  topposition to mandatory sanctions against South Africa. The maii^fJornt made by the ANC had been the importance of the release from prd^s&apos;m^j.n South Africa of Mr Nelson Mandela.	Ss

I

   Libya	THE FORIEGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that on 4 February Israel

had forced a Libyan aircraft flying from Libya to Syria to land in I Previous	Israel. In reacting publicly, the United KinadSJjK Government had

I Reference:	condemned the interception of the aircraft an&lt;| h^cj avoided taking a

I CC(86) 4th position on whether that interception would haSZ2^d5S&amp;n legitimate if, as I Conclusions the Israelis had evidently expected, there had Men/Important terrorists I Minute 4	on board. This position was compatible with theSy^  ir^Siich the United

Kingdom had adopted after the interception by the	States of an

Egyptian aircraft on 10 October 1985. The Israeli	caption of the

Libyan aircraft was being discussed in the Security wun^Ckof the United Nations. The United Kingdom was co-operating with^Piratace and the United States in an attempt to modify the language proposa fcV non-aligned members of the Security Council for a public siE^Jx^fent by the Council.	\fC\S &gt;\

---	&apos;^iroO^porating the results of the Intergovernmental Conference before the

I Inter-	waireferendum. Denmark, however, had now suggested that the signing

I governmental	sHajCW-ihe postponed. The date of signing was, therefore, again under

I Conference	corfSvreration, in view of the need to take account of any potential

diffvo*^ies for the Danish Government.

I ECONOMIC	4. THE SECRETARY	FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that discussions

I AFFAIRS	had taken place on t^y&apos;Vsewarate proposals concerning the future of

--	British Leyland (BL). Rira&amp;j after an approach by the Government,

I British	General Motors had beeifcii^&apos;2&apos;uss ing with BL a possible takeover of the

I Leyland	businesses within Land Rfcstae^A&lt;  ^yland, the commercial vehicle side of BL

    pic	which included Land Rover.	course held out better prospects for

continuing truck manufacture^.&apos;atf&apos;^the Trucks Division was now making significant losses, and of op^rilnftg^the United States market to Land Rover sales. The talks were a/^smadvanced stage; there was, however, no specific proposition yet fromJS^ri&amp;tfal Motors. The Government would require certain assurances. The suj^&amp;ommittee on Economic Affairs of the Ministerial Steering Commit tee^MK^SSbnomic Strategy (E(A)) had agreed that an arrangement on these lywe^Nwould be advantageous, and had authorised him to pursue discussiiM^with General Motors accordingly. It was probable that the&apos;Situation would be sufficiently clarified for the Government to take a final decision before the end of the month. Secondly, there was a more tentative proposal which had been put to the Government that the Ford Motor Comnany. should take over the Austin Rover Group (ARG) and Unipart from BL/f Iujwas regrettable that the existence of this proposal had been leakeiijvpr^jkably from within BL. Talks were at a very early stage. It would be accessary for the Government to decide whether the Ford proposal walCuvdJfe politically acceptable. If not, there were two alternatives:	it might be

possible to stitch up a deal with a minority sharehcyJa^igVby Honda Motors and with the co-operation of BL&apos;s management   *rff^J.a  pur force, so that the company could be privatised by the end of the de  ^*be, or the present situation could be allowed to continue, with the^^^oVability of increasing financial commitments to BL by the Government^Q^S^u^ar BL had had about   2.2 billion in grants and the Government was exp&lt;Miea\  o guarantees of about   1.6 billion. There was considerable co  c&lt;Lary/among


   colleagues, particularly in the Midlands, about the suggestion that Ford should take over ARG and Unipart, and the debate in the House of Commons on 5 February had been very difficult. A quick decision was needed whether or not this would be politically acceptable.

V In discussion the following points were made -

a. Cabinet colleagues with an important departmental, constituency, or regional party interest in a matter such as the ^^^future of BL should be kept in touch and should not hear of ^^developments for the first time when they appeared in the &lt;^^jSVspapers.

Public opinion both in the West Midlands and more widely was bSkely to show understanding of the case for the deal with General Motors but to draw a distinction between that action and the suggested takeover of ARG and Unipart by the Ford Motor Company. There was^auch more political concern about the major car producing operati^pofNBL. In his public statements, however, Mr Edward Heath MR^^p  -t&gt;Lnked the two proposals together, and this had magnified cfie Jjplitical problem.

c.	When Fo^Pfi/^ppproach had been discussed in the Sub-Committee on Economic AfttZ&amp;fSof the Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Strate^y&apos;vlrwisters had been conscious that, if they had turned down even t)&gt;^J*  vgestion to explore Ford&apos;s approach, the financial and indu^^ialj consequences could have been difficult.

It was for this rea^  *  xlrflat they had agreed to the talks and asked for a fuller assessmenrpv^^the implications of the Ford proposal.

d.	There was a large riimfiej^of component suppliers in the West Midlands which did busine^l^wroh BL and Ford. These companies now saw themselves as in danger.^iroii^changes which might come at BL.

The fear would be that, if Fopd^ook over ARG, some of these suppliers would go out of busTgeSSS^and others would have to deal with a monopsony customer. TheNiMvg^nment had followed the course of encouraging greater efficiency^ax BL and had agreed to links with Honda Motors. BL was widely^ecognised as a company which had made big strides in modernisation and in the process of recovery under the present Government. Discussion with Ford was now being seen as a completely new tack, which app^U^d to be inconsistent with the record of progress achieved.	l^g as this suggestion

was in the air, fewer BL cars would be	Japanese confidence

in the link with BL would be reduced. There^ w   a risk that, as a result of Ford&apos;s approach, the Government w  ui$i^&amp;e drawn into criticising the performance of BL, which wouM&apos;ycw^against the widespread view that the recovery programme shqp^^e regarded as a success.

e.	There was a fundamental problem of survival ton/a. jnompany with too small a share of the world market. BL&apos;s corpora^g^pOns had been too optimistic and there was a serious risk that^kO  s  s would continue and that profits would not materialise. A lai^te^awount of


   public financial support might be needed, and this would be at the expense of other priorities for resources.

f.	The scale and speed of changes in BL&apos;s position was important. The Government had taken the view that BL should be encouraged to y\ take the steps necessary to recovery. Jaguar had been privatised. /S\ The proposed deal with General Motors was sensible. The

Government should not, however, risk going beyond the point of political credibility.

It would be unfortunate if the debate on BL were conducted in ^^ecms only of keeping British production here. It was necessary to also the opportunities for penetrating overseas, and jS^^icularly European, markets.

h.	wrhe suggestion that the Ford might take over ARG and Unipart also^aised the question of competition. To the man in the street the first result would probably be a reduction in the number of car dealers and of competition.

The Cabine^^i-^

1.	Agreed C^e^^here a Cabinet colleague had an

important consfi&apos;ji/iercy, regional party or departmental interest in an	political importance, he should

be kept informed w^wernment discussions on the issue.

2.	Invited all MirtteZetik and the Cabinet Office to give particular attent^ttM^dNi this point, when submitting questions forfxtwniLSterial discussion.

3.	Took note that the iyg^U^relating to British Leyland pic would be discuas^a^kter that day in the Sub-Committee on Economiq^kffi^irs of the Ministerial Steering Committee^iajiconomic Strategy.
