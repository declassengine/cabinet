0F M The Cabinet welcomed the Secretary of State for Scotland as a new    HE QApOl&amp;T member, following the recent Ministerial changes.

I A

PARLIAMENTAWpwV. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House     pFAIRS &apos;\&gt;/*$i/Commons in the following week and that the date for the Budget, to be ^aw^nced that day, would be 18 March.

Rate Support	THE SE&amp;MARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that he and his

Grant Debates Ministerial colleagues in the Department of the Environment would be

making vigorous efforts to maintain support for the Government when the Previous	motions on the Rate Support Grant Reports were debated on 20 January.

CC(85)	26th	delegations fr/wP&apos;mcal authorities,	mainly from the	shire	counties.	It

Conclusions, was inherent i\qkj:h)t-gresent local government arrangements that the high Minute	1	resource	areas, wfyfch)included many	shire counties,	would	especially

stand to	suffer wqevfAAte rate of central Government	grant	was reduced.

The latest settleme^^^&gt;  wever, had such severe effects on areas such as Hertford and Surrey	doubted whether another such settlement in

12	months&apos; time would	or table.

In discussion it was po^  reo  ut that the differing effects on local authorities were producea^^A^ombination of the level of aggregate Exchequer grant and the netbdMMgy for distribution. Under the present arrangements there were extrror^ftary variations between the treatment of different authorities, and	uthorities under Conservative

leadership that had loyally res^ptra^ivto the Government&apos;s calls for control of spending were deeply dej^resked to find that the grant system seemed to operate so as to punish raoer than reward them.

the PRIME MINISTER, summing up the br^e/^s cuss ion, said that what underlay the problem was still the urg&amp;Zff local authorities to spend at high levels. The reduced spending to w^ch rate-capped authorities were now accommodating themselves showed what could be achieved. The Government had been faced year after year with the acutely difficult problem of a distribution formula which operatejT^fco the disadvantage of its supporters. It was essential that more d^fensj.ble results should be achieved in the next year.


   ir^^&apos;WrS&apos; THE SECRETARY 0F STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE reported that the |Dispu/e^^\	National Union of Teachers had withdrawn from talks being organised by

the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service. It was noted that   Previous	the Ministerial Group on Teachers&apos; Pay had the dispute under continuing

feeferenc^i^/&apos;\\ review. It was suggested that the dispute was an issue of such lc(85) 29ua^/Aimportance that it should be brought to Cabinet at an appropriate time, tone lus ions

Minute 1 NVfcjE) PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that the

^  otjh^rs1 pay disputes in England and Wales and Scotland were due to be daj&amp;iua!sed shortly at a meeting of Ministers under her chairmanship. She wouJ&lt;d/&amp;prange for the subject to be put on the agenda for discussion by the Ca^raet thereafter.

FOREIGN	3. THE FOREIGN^Nj^fcOMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the outcome of the

AFFAIRS	power struggle tak^ng/place in the People&apos;s Republic of South Yemen

I 	could not yet be pre^r&amp;tfed. The protagonists in the fighting were two

people&apos;s	factions within the	ng regime in that country; the present rulers

lemocratic	were less pro-Soviet Mjin^Wieir opponents. The Soviet Ambassador was

Republic of	hoping to mediate be tweenReports of the execution of four

south Yemen members of the regime hac^irjy^Oaeen confirmed. The President, Mr Ali

Nasser, appeared to be alivealJd still in place. There were a number of Soviet and French citizens	and about 100 United Kingdom citizens

and 150 Commonwealth citizena/isgrMdiose interests the British Embassy was responsible. The British&apos;Kmra/sy had been damaged and communications with it were di    ya&amp;kv\ Food and especially water were in short supply at the Embassy. Yfhp  ^iad been no reports of casualties to United Kingdom citizens. The Emlfa&amp;a^ were in touch with the French and Soviet Embassies, inter alia on ^fp-^oestion of possible evacuation of foreigners from the country. Evactfaiiorucould not be undertaken against physical opposition. As to mesu^^efr evacuation, the airport at Aden was damaged and the road to North rwmen was very difficult. Evacuation by sea would probably be a more practical possibility, provided that helicopters from Her Majesty&apos;s ships could be flown to the shore at Aden. A Hercules aircraft of the RoyaL-Air Force was six hours away at Akrotiri, and another could be made av^rTable from Lyneham. A Royal Naval patrol would reach the Aden area tn^t^evening. HMY Britannia was about six hours&apos; sailing time away.(/French and Soviet vessels were in reach. The resources for evacuatr&lt;ti  &gt;  ^e therefore available but the questions of the necessity and the^^m^g of any evacuation remained to be answered. It was a worrying^r^oation.

In a brief discussion, it was agreed that it was preferal^^^^. keep HMY Britannia in reach of Aden. Although she had no helicopters; ^ut was possible that a vessel of this nature would be more acceptanl^^^r an evacuation operation than a warship. Moreover, her departur^f^w^the area at a time when she might be needed for evacuation might vteW^lie


   criticised. The question of the modalities of an evacuation required vll/O	further consideration in the light of what would be practicable.

I	*	    &apos; . . &apos;

fiddle EasX^^HE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that his visit to Oman,

w^^di Arabia and Kuwait from 11 to 15 January had been useful. On the previous \\A&lt;3ip/lsraeli problem, he had encountered the familiar Arab tendency to keference:	to try to do something to achieve progress. He had reassured

EC(85) 33rd	mrf  ia^  rs in the three countries that the resignation of Mr Heseltine as

Conclusions,	Sea^ex^pjr of State for Defence would not affect the United Kingdom&apos;s

kinute 3	firm^  u  j?ence to the agreements to supply Tornado aircraft and Hawk

train	craft. He had found a very friendly attitude to the United

Kingdom^^jK^his impression was that British exports were doing reasonab^T well in these large and difficult markets.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY had found that all three countries sharedt  ie British desire to prevent or control international terrorism. TheXMiM themselves suffered from it. But they had felt constrained to ^  y^  am  port to Colonel Qadhafi, the President of Libya, in the face of a   jY^cAived threat of American retaliation against Libya after the terroris^-ip^Ments on 27 December 1985 at Rome and Vienna airports. They did ^^T^pport Colonel Qadhafi because they liked him or feared him, but berom^eNof their commitment to solidarity among Arab countries. It was iroi^^^Mt the Arab countries were unable to unite on the question of the Arab^isxael dispute but coyld unite in support of Colonel Qadhafi&apos;s unaccepTjaf  eSpehaviour.

In discussion of the price o&amp;^a  J^ the Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia, Prince Saud, and the Oil Minis^ej^&amp;f Kuwait, Shaikh Ali Khalifa, had been pessimistic about the prosy  tLgfr The latter had predicted a drastic fall in oil prices unles^borov the members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (O^gtfv.and the other oil producers curtailed their production. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had explained British policy: his interlog    tjvs had understood the policy but had not been convinced that it wasV^jjiffc. He had not been pressed to agree to an institutionalised dialogu^between OPEC and other oil producing countries. He had, however, agreed that informal contacts should be maintained between the Saudi Arabian Minister for Petroleum and Mineral Resources, Shaikh Yamani, and the Department of Energy.

In a short discussion, it was noted that a misWadiUg report about the Government&apos;s contacts with Shaikh Yamani had appe^    5\&apos;i.n the press. It would be important to conduct any such contacts diicpAeily, if they were to be of value.


   the FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the restrictions imposed by South Africa along the border with Lesotho were creating increasing difficulties for Lesotho. Shortages were developing and previoi  &apos;\&gt;^vN there were signs of political instability and mounting tension. The Reference^/^\ Government had put pressure on South Africa to proceed by diplomatic tC(86) ls  v&apos;&apos;^Yimeans rather than border restrictions. The South African Government&apos;s fconclnfiiorfsyv^fteply had been that they intended to maintain the restrictions until she Minute 3	seen the results of a meeting of a new Security Committee which had

established between the two countries. Meanwhile, the level of in South Africa had somewhat diminished; but the prospects r^tiau^ed uncertain.

m.

Uganda	THE FORE^N AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the ceasefire in Uganda

between the Government forces and the National Resistance Movement was previous	still holding, but there	had been very little	headway in the

Reference:	implementation ofthe peace agreement reached	on 17	December 1985.

CC(86) 1st	Kenya, and Pres/i?iyv Moi	personally, appeared	to be	disappointed that

  onelusions,	the United Kingdom Vould	not participate in a	force	to monitor the

Minute 3	implementation of&quot;/yfie&gt;\\greement. They had never been given grounds to

expect such partick^pajM^to. The United Kingdom had offered a team of military advisers antraining for a new national army, if it could be established; and inr^KMjstion was now offering a contribution in cash or material towards log^*ca&amp; back-up for a monitoring operation and diplomatic support in seeki4w    sOther contributions of this kind.

I	%g&gt;	7

Soviet	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SBEfflWARY said that the General Secretary

Proposals on of the Communist Party of the SoTy^t ^Uoion, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, had Arms Control launched a package of proposals on^rm^.control which largely

represented existing Soviet positions^fncluding insistence on an end to the United States Strategic Defence :^rt3^rtive. But the package included some elements which at least waf^/^resentationally new, such as the elimination of all nuclear weapons bw/i999 and the extension by three months after the end of 1985 of the^unilateral Soviet moratorium on nuclear weapons tests. Mr Gorbachev&apos;s proposals were likely to have considerable public impact and the Government should not appear to dismiss them out of hand. He would be proposia^*&amp;v soon as possible a draft reply to the message of 14 January from iwGdyrbachev to the Prime Minister, in which the Soviet proposals had beeit-^t&quot;&apos;  Yt.

   IcOTHtiiwjhf	4. THE	CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the President of the

lAFFJrfRji^N	European	Parliament had signed a Community budget for 1986 which was in

--V&gt;oCv	t*ie v*ew	the United Kingdom and other member states illegal because

Icommunity^^ it contained figures higher than those agreed by the Council of iBudget f^S^o^VSMinisters. The Commission was expected to implement it. This gave rise   986	t*iree questions. First, it had been necessary for the Council of

N&quot;^&apos;^&amp;nisters to decide whether it should launch an action against the    Previous \0&amp;ip?opean Parliament - and possibly also against the Commission - in the Ikeference:	&apos;^  wropean Court of Justice. The Council of Ministers had now agreed to

lcC(85) 37th stkyt^n action against the European Parliament. Secondly, individual Ibonclusions, memhe^&apos;^tates should decide whether to buttress the Council&apos;s action by    Minute 3	laurich^g actions in the European Court of Justice on their own account.

Thirda^L^Sfember states had to decide whether in the meantime they would pay a TwtiTejmtr ibution or a lower figure. Legal advice had been taken and thes&amp;^rad also been consultations with other member states, includingothe Netherlands which now held the Presidency. He considered that the United Kingdom should launch an action in the European Court of Justice against the European Parliament in order to buttress the Council&apos;s action^SThe Federal Republic of Germany, France, the Netherlands andr/possibly Luxembourg might take similar action. The advice he had rioivgA was that, in order to maximise the chances of success in the Cou/t jjation and to avoid potential interest payments, the United Kingdom^sTijxCLd contribute at the full rate in the interim: this would need the vf&gt;|i  0$al of the United Kingdom Parliament. The decision of the Presicferf^   ^yl the European Parliament to sign the Community&apos;s 1986 budgeiS&apos;w^Mmt the agreement of the Council of Ministers was a major issu^^hd the Government&apos;s prime objective must be to succeed in challengi^iz^ iri in the European Court of Justice. If the European Parliament coui3^fsh&gt;ly add to the Council&apos;s agreed figures in this way, there would be	loss of control by member states.

NORTHERN	5. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN YRELAND said that the unionist

   RELAND	parties in Northern Ireland had arranged for &quot;dummy&quot; candidates, all

bearing the name of Peter Barry, to stand in the^four constituencies    revious	where unionists would otherwise have been unopnoiiedNin the by-elections

   eference:	due to take place on 23 January. Some rather w^crytee opinion polls

   C(86) 1st were being published. One suggested that a signiffrcanV majority in    onclusions, Northern Ireland thought that the role accorded to^fejJfi^&apos;IVish Government    mute 5	under the Anglo-Irish Agreement was more than consulA large

number of Roman Catholics and a majority of Protestan(np^*i&amp;eared to think that the Agreement would lead to an increase in	in

Northern Ireland. He would seek in his public statementsthe findings of the polls into proper perspective. Meanwhilel^intte Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, the Irish Governm^rr^  d been pressing hard for changes in Northern Ireland which were sougjlvooS^ the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). There had been lea^s^bbut


   the work of the Intergovernmental Conference and some public claims that points favouring the SDLP had been agreed when in fact they had not.

The purpose of the Irish Government was obviously to boost the chances of the SDLP in the forthcoming by-elections. It was to be hoped that these Irish tactics would cease after the by-elections, since they complicated the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.

. . .

xO^v^as possible that moderate people in Northern Ireland were beginning

\&gt;,i^realise that unionists could not say &quot;No&quot; to everything. Such &apos;xepdJgBcies were appearing in the commercial community and in the Ulster FWmer^vUnion. But unionists were very divided on the course they shaft&apos;d ^rake after the by-elections. After being re-elected Members of Parifrom the Democratic Unionist Party might leave the House of Commo	n once they saw that the Government would not alter or

withdra^o^* Anglo-Irish Agreement. But Members of Parliament from the Official\flnionist Party would probably wish to stay in the House of Commons. &apos;The vacuum which could appear in unionist policy could be dangerous.

CC(86) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 6 Thursday 16 January 1986 at 9.30 am

(CHANNEL FIXED	The Cabit|J considered	a note	by	the Secretary of State for Transport on

   LINK	the ChannS|  fixed Link	(C(86)	3).

   Previous	THE SECRETA^j^^^sTATE FOR TRANSPORT said that since the last meeting of

   Reference:	the Economic	Sub-Committee of the Ministerial Steering Committee

ilcc(85) 35th on Economic Str^^^M he had explored the possibilities of collaboration    Conclusions,	between the various^ptpmoters	and	had concluded that	such collaboration,

   Minute 1	at least until a clear	-choice	had	been made, was not	possible. He had

also had further taws^HLth the French Government to see if he could persuade them to change^roeir position. Channel Expressway (CE) had reviewed their cost estimates and by increasing their contingency provision from 25 per cent to 50 per cent of total costs had brought their estimates closer to those of the assessors. They had also proposed boring a pilot tunnel Lrom the French side to test the feasibility of 12 metre tunne^n( the strata on that side of the Channel. The French maintain^A^^r preference for EuroRoute but would be prepared to accept the Chann^^Hfcpnel Group (CTG) as a fallback. The British Government had re jected ^rRd^te as being unf inanceable and posing severe environmental difficwties, and had been pressing for a bored tunnel drive-through scheme. On transport grounds he continued to prefer CE which he believed was finalJRa^e and would be profitable for the promoter. He accepted, however, df^utf^was unrealistic to insist on CE in the light of French oppositionlVl^uherefore wished to alter the recommendation he had put to Cabinet    n his note in favour of a decision to allow the financial markets to^Krae between CTG and CE. This would take the pressure off the Government for a decision, keep open the drive-through option, and go some way to meet public concern that the Government was being rushed into a decision by the French. The Government&apos;s financial consultants on this matter, Schroder Wagg, regarded it as feasible to put together within two   ^Rhree months a prospectus on both schemes which could then be put ^^pro*ential investors as a basis for a judgment. In the meantime^lt the meeting in Lille on 20 January the Prime Minister and President ^fercMcand would be able to announce that the two Governments had definitelyjffe  ded to proceed with a bored tunnel link but would leave it to tn^^financial markets to decide between the two possible options.


   Negotiations on two issues continued:	with the French the management,

procurement arrangements and revenue sharing between British Rail (BR) and Soci  t   Nationale des Chemins de Fer (SNCF); and with the promoters (particularly CTG) the minimum acceptable period of exclusivity for the Concession Agreement (he was proposing a period until 2020) together l with conditional provisions for the further development of the link to f^rovide or improve drive-through capacity. Continued confidentiality P^uld assist these negotiations.

^RTwiscussion the following points were made -

a.	There were difficulties involved in asking the financial markets to decide the choice of scheme. What the mechanics of such consultation might be was obscure. The result might be marginal an^w^ necessarily in accord with public preference. It would

bemM^difficult - if indeed it was possible - to introduce a hybrid Bill in Parliament covering both options including related prov^Q^fe^^or land acquisition and other factors specific to each scheme, j^on* would result in prolonged and intensive lobbying by the int^lfc  ed parties, and the Government would still be left at the end o  08^  iay to make a choice, while giving an undesirable impression of it tecisiveness in the meantime. Public opinion would see thijjrt^^ choice to be made by Government.

b.	To fail to malre^ decision now would lead to postponement of the construction of the link and to a major row with the French, with implications for the United Kingdom&apos;s wider interests. A commitment had been given to an announcement of the choice within a specific timetable and it should be adhered to. Anything else would give an impress ion^^^indec is ion.

c.	While the CTG scheme rqraBMiave some risks of industrial action

because of its reliance on^^yg^.e mode of transport, a drive-through tunnel dependent ro9the maintenance of ventilation and other services would be na^kess .immune from industrial action. The risks with the CTG scheme	diminished if it could be

arranged that BR and SNCF were r^sp^^ble only for trains and not for vehicle shuttle traffic throug(P  b tunnel, and that there was only one union for those employed th^^huttle, with which CTG could enter into agreements designed .40 irarnimise the risks of disruption as a result of industrial action.

d.	Although all the proposed schemes were vulnerable to terrorism and sabotage, CTG, by operating trains which did not stop in the tunnel, was potentially the safest.

e.	Although public preference currently appea^favour a drive-through scheme, the fundamental uncertain^H^Jf CE&apos;s proposal - its costs, and ventilation and tunnellr^^^fcpblems -raised serious doubts about its financeability. The ln^.ihood of delays and queuing on entry, and the strain of a 30-aj|SPdjrive through the tunnel, might well also reduce its attractJRieks to travellers as compared with the rail shuttle, whose carryP^k


   capacity (a maximum 4,000 cars an hour) was expected to be substantially greater. There was also a possible conflict of interests given Mr Sherwood&apos;s ownership of British Ferries. Of the two schemes CG, because of its uncertainties, was the most likely k	to involve future Governments in public guarantees of expenditure.

HE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the choice P^^KQre the Cabinet was whether to accept the proposal from the CTG now ^ow) postpone a decision. The effect of postponing a decision now

well be to postpone the construction of a Channel Fixed Link for a very long time. In view of the Government&apos;s commitment to facilitate the construction of a Channel Fixed Link and to choose a scheme within a specific timetable, the difficulties involved in leaving the final decision to the financial markets, the satisfactory nature of the CTG&apos;s proposal, andkthe likelihood of its acceptance by the French, and the high deg^e geological, technical and financial uncertainty inherent in CE, thSc||pwet agreed that the CTG should be invited to construct and operat^raM^hannel Fixed Link. This would itself represent a major achievement ai^MMuld, of course, continue to be subject to the scheme being privatel|^financed with no Government guarantees. The Secretary of State for Tr^^^  t should therefore continue his negotiations with the French to secure the best possible terms for BR&apos;s involvement and with CTG to securd^PKminimum acceptable period of exclusivity for the Concession Agreemen^an^Kor the firmest possible commitment to the future development of^^^^ive-through facility. The decision should be presented in as positive a light as possible, emphasising the historic nature of the decision and the advantages which CTG offered. It was important for the success of the remaining negotiations that the confidentiality of the Cabinet&apos;^decision should be maintained, if necessary until she and Presi^fl^Mitterrand made the final announcement of their joint decision in Lii|  l  2^20 January.

The Cabinet -

1.	Agreed that the Channel ^nnS^^roup-France Manche should be chosen e^mpstruct the Channel Fixed Link on the bas^j^p^^the proposals which they had submittedj^Ph^k

2.	Invited the Secretary of State Transport to continue his negotiations with the French Government and the Channel Tunnel Group accordingly, as indicated in the discussion and in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.


   3.	Took note that, if agreement was reached with the French Government on this basis, the Prime Minister and the President of the French Republic would announce the decision at their meeting in Lille on 20 January 1986.
