   IpARLZ^95*^ARY K The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

nii

  Progress ofSV^PHE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the seasonal pressure on the (Legislation &apos;^^ftp^able for Government business in the House of Lords was proving lin the House	M&gt;^aV)sr than usual because of the exceptionally heavy legislative

lof Lords	pra^OTme, which had recently led to a decision to have an all-night

sitton the Gas Bill. The pressure was exacerbated by the desire of LibewrCia^id Social Democratic peers in the Lords to adopt a high profile in theyyo$position to Government proposals. That had sometimes upset arrangM^tits reached with the official Opposition through the usual channels^j?ut he had so far resisted including parties other than the official Opposition in such discussions. To reduce the effectiveness of the Opposition parties&apos; tactics he had explored the options for extending the atiaber of days in which the House would sit in that Session. He cnfd i^t think it would be profitable for the House to continue sittingX^jrtX August once the House of Commons had risen for the Summer Adjournmen^ij/ut he had persuaded the Opposition parties that the House would have c-o^iw/ume earlier than usual in the autumn and that it should sit during	y Conferences. While he was confident that he

could secure Royal As^emTvto the Gas Bill on the timetable the Secretary of State for Energy had &apos;revested, he could not guarantee being able to secure Royal Assent	Summer Adjournment for all the other

Bills for which that was^eing sought.

I	The Cabinet -

1.	Took note.	/   /v\

  Public Order:	THE HOME SECRETARY said that the so-c^l^i &quot;peace convoy&quot; of travellers

  Travellers comprising of 112 vehicles was current!^ camped in the New Forest at

Stoney Cross on land belonging to the Forestry Commission. Action was being taken in the High Court that day to recover possession of the land. Although initial public comment had focjvs^d on the absence of a crime of trespass, it was now being more wide^LyiSacognised that a full range of powers were available to the police	example, in relation

to criminal damage, obstruction of the highway   aa Breach of the peace. Nevertheless he believed there was probably scopg-^gQsome extension of the law and he would shortly put forward proposalsdifficulty was in devising changes in the law which would not impe^xrcofectly legitimate activity - for example, by ramblers organiCsci^ohs and the like. The police faced difficult choices in the exercis^jH&gt;&gt; existing powers. They had to strike a balance between strict enix^cement of the law and general maintenance of the peace. In addition tovjm^Xions of police powers and their exercise, a wide range of other is^uek&apos;wad been highlighted such as breaches of law in relation to the roadw^j^ra^rness of


   the vehicles in the convoy; the fact that the children involved did not Cv appear to be receiving regular education; the question whether the

children should be taken into care; and the treatment of the travellers for social security purposes. The question of allocating such people vOv/vermanent sites had also been mooted. At present sites were only made ;^Oikailable to those who had a genuine nomadic tradition and he was wary vT&apos;W   ^b re aching this limitation. In view of the range of interests &apos;v^yGgrtved some collective consideration of these issues seemed

    m

Inai^Jtfission the following points were made -

ayV JOae activities of the convoy had given rise to strong anger ana^dnxiety and it was most important that the Government should be see&apos;skto be responding quickly. Although the convoy in the New Forest was currently attracting all the media attention, there were other smaller groups in other areas which were causing similar problemsof them long-standing.

b.	Prevrok^Skperience with such groups suggested that the law provided a sufficient range of remedies but that the penalties imposed by thep^ourts, at any rate initially, were insufficient to deter people   fymj^kind that were involved.

c.	Although somewf/^he members of such convoys were relatively harmless individua]^^^&gt;^ce groups were formed they began to attract criminal elements. ^meMost important ingredient of control was to prevent such groups r  e^^^ing beyond a manageable size.

d.	There were strong oM^cions to giving such groups permanent sites. This would only i^/  i  ise their activities and encourage the spread of the problem.&apos;   ^Tj&gt;  &gt;^8 would be intense opposition from local residents to whicheveiO^^^ were chosen.

e.	Action had already been tSte^to prevent social security fraud by such groups but to go furtherUm^Kremove entitlement to benefits raised more fundamental questionsSX

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that it was most important that the genuine feelings of alarm aiyi^anxiety caused by the activities of such groups should be seen to bi^mM by a quick and vigorous response from the Government. The ax^t^ojis^that could be taken should be considered as a matter of urgency by &lt;/rr^\als and then by a small group of those Ministers most concerned, p^j^^&apos;bo a full collective discussion in the Home and Social Affai^i^Cpjjmittee. This consideration should include the various points rai^^^^K the discussion but the Cabinet were agreed that the option of providib^&apos;w|rmanent sites for such groups should not be pursued further.

The Cabinet -

2.	Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 s^y/^ summing up of their discussion.


   (yllys	3. Agreed that the possibility of providing permanent

sites for groups of &quot;travellers&quot; should not be pursued further.

4.	Noted that the Prime Minister would arrange for the action that might be taken to deal with such groups to be considered by a group of those Ministers \ySyf] most concerned, prior to consideration by the Home ^y^^end Social Affairs Committee.

I FOREIGN	2. THB^v   OREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, during the

I AFFAIRS	meeting dr Foreign Ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation

I  	(NATO) in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 29-30 May, there had been

I The North	considerable discussion of relations among	the allies and in particular

Atlantic	between the Uni^%a\States and the European	members of the Alliance.

I Council	This had been VLr^tlection, in particular,	of the tensions caused in the

Alliance by theDwftM States military action against Libya on 14 April. The United Kin gdcnj^-^ypitp port for the United States action had been a positive contributi^^^^\solidarity in the Alliance. The discussion at Halifax had also cov^raj^bhe United States intention to modernise its chemical weapons and Qj^^&amp;lure of the recent meeting in Berne, as part of the process stemming prjS^the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, to discuss huMsrtK&apos;c&apos;OTtacts between East and West. The European members of the	had expressed anxiety at the

announcement by the United	of its intention to cease to abide by

the provisions of the SecondvOVgj*  efaient on Strategic Arms Limitation (SALT II) after the end of 198  ^fcj&gt;  use of violations of those provisions which the United Sta^pa^j^lieved the Soviet Union to have committed.

There had been a useful discussion	North Atlantic Council of the

positions of the allies on arms controjyf/Jt had been recognised that the positions of the Alliance on stratWc arms reductions, intermediate-range nuclear weapons and a^ban on chemical weapons were convincing and that the Soviet Union had generally failed to respond adequately to them. It had been agreed that the allies should do more to secure public recognition for the merits o  ^^BS.ir positions. The allies had also decided to undertake a study conventional arms control covering the whole of Europe. The remthis subject by the General Secretary of the Communist Party of (ttJieJspviet Union,

Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, on 18 April were likely to Ti^^aborated by a meeting of Warsaw Pact Foreign Ministers on 12 JuneiypM^ariwhile, the Soviet Union had put forward on 29 May a new proposa&apos;Jr^O^e negotiations on nuclear arms control with the United statp^Oin Geneva. This linked the strengthening and clarification of the M^^^allistic Missile Treaty with 50 per cent reductions in strategic Mc^Air weapons. The Soviet proposal seemed similar at first sight to ideaa-jKujt^ the Government had canvassed with the United States AdministraPwrOxKrhe United States Secretary of State, Mr George Shultz, had told&apos;^Jrffyy


   Foreign Ministers in Halifax that the Soviet proposal seemed potentially important. He had urged that it be kept confidential; but its substance had become public some two days later and it had been denounced by the &lt;y//\ United States Secretary of Defense, Mr Caspar Weinberger. This incident &lt;X^/^  howed the difficulties that could be caused for the West by differences th in the Administration in Washington.

The Cabinet -

Took note.

-Soviet THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Soviet Ambassador, rions	Mr Leonid Zamyatin, had informed him on 2 June that the Soviet Foreign

Reia	Minister, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, wished to pay his outstanding visit to

the United KinadpjNbefore the summer break. Dates in the second half of July were undeWd^cussion. The visit would provide an opportunity both for the United&apos;kinga^m to contribute to East-West discussion, notably on arms control, an/(foJJthe Soviet Union to seek to influence public opinion in this cotmiiy.

THE LORD PRESIDENT OR^fl^S  &gt;UNCIL reported on his visit to the Soviet Union from 23 May to rjhh^pas leader of a British Parliamentary delegation. He said it ^^^Lear that Mr Gorbachev had greatly appreciated the treatment&lt;tfeij}ad received during his visit to the United Kingdom in 1984 and especi^H^^is talks with the Prime Minister.

Mr Gorbachev had concluded i^  kjpiat visit that a dialogue was possible between the Soviet Union and&apos;^fo^linited Kingdom. He had decided that the British Parliamentary delega^feaio.should receive the same high level treatment. The meeting with MrVJoi^Wv had been the most important event during the visit. It had tiken^lace in St Catherine&apos;s Hall in the Kremlin. Mr Gorbachev&apos;s handli^^^f^this meeting had shown that he had a sense of theatre, as well as 5n\5imposing presence and great sharpness of mind. The meeting had b  M*  6ith a restricted session between Mr Gorbachev and himself. He Kid handed over a letter from the Prime Minister. The meeting had been friendly, both sides deliberately avoiding polemics. Mr Gorbachev had said he had appreciated his meetings with the Prime Minister in 1984 and wa^glad to receive her letter. But he had expressed some doubt whetKei   &apos;phe United Kingdom really wanted good relations with the Soviet \Qa^o)C^He had implied that some British decisions, for instance the expulsigfi^fi members of the Soviet Embassy in London or support for the Unir^d-^p^es military action against Libya, were not compatible with a gQxJipA search for goo relations. The Lord President of the Council had	that neither

the Prime Minister nor he himself would have wished ftf^i^visit Moscow if the Government had not wanted good relations with	Un-ion.

The Lord President of the Council had formed the firm i*rap  s?^ion that Mr Gorbachev wanted a second summit meeting with the Uni ted&apos;^^Upei^ President, Mr Reagan, provided that he could secure some s^s^^p result. President Reagan&apos;s recent decision that the United


   might cease to observe the Second Agreement on Strategic Anns &gt; Limitations (SALT II) would give Mr Gorbachev a convincing excuse should he decide not to attend a second summit.

   

-^O^When the other members of the delegation had joined the meeting,

Gorbachev had said that, if the United Kingdom eliminated its nuclear \y/^Pons capability, the Soviet Union would be willing to reduce its   &apos;      faar weapons to an equal extent and that, if nuclear weapons were 4^nnS\from British soil, the Soviet Union would guarantee not to use

weapons against the United Kingdom. A number of the members of the/  i^ish delegation had found these remarks unconvincing and demefeiiSy. The delegation had raised with Mr Gorbachev the question of human	in the Soviet Union and had handed over a list of 23

persona&amp;&apos;cases with the request that they be settled. Mr Gorbachev had said thav all Western delegations seemed to speak on these lines. He had taken the list but had given no sign that there would be concessions. The delegation had later urged the importance of the list in meetings wirf  Er~^ther Soviet figures. The Lord President of the Council thougMtMt there might be some Soviet response, such as permission fort^^5^\ three persons on the list to leave the Soviet Union. The GoveMjaeM^should maintain pressure on the Soviet authorities for a r^^/6t)ae.

The Lord President of^^^^ouncil said that the delegation had also had meetings with the SovietTH&amp;d of State, Mr Andrei Gromyko; the Minister of Foreign Trade, Mr Bo^^^Avistov; and the Deputy Prime Minister with responsibility for agrico&amp;pfi^Mr Vsevolod Murakhovsky. The last was an effective and likeable pa^afiik relations with whom would be worth cultivating; he was due shoBXly^^ta visit the United Kingdom. The delegation had gained the imp^^^^^^p that the nuclear reactor disaster at Chernobyl in the Ukraine haV    u  ^d great concern among the Soviet leaders and that East-West co-opep^&amp;n on matters concering safety in nuclear power stations should be po^^^ble.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a shory^dj^pussion, said that Mr Gorbachev, after his visit to the wrf^ed Kingdom, had reported on it to the Politburo of the Communist Part^of the Soviet Union, which had reached a positive assessment of the visit. It was particularly appropriate that the Lord President of the Council had reported fully to Cabinet on his visit to the Soviet Union. //^~\\

The Cabinet -

2.	Took note, with approval, of the Prime^3fiio3ter&apos;s summing up of their discussion.

3.	Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secrerary^M arrange for the Soviet Union to be informed that

Lord President of the Council had reported fully 01 visit to the Cabinet, who were appreciative of the which the delegation had been received and saw the vi^^^X as a positive step in British-Soviet relations.


   4.	Thanked the Lord President of the Council for his C^Vvs.	successful leadership of the delegation.

The Prime \Ov/THE PRIME MINISTER, reporting on her visit to Israel from 24 to 27 May, Minister&apos;s	that it had gone extremely well. The effect in Israel and

visit to	/4iirio  g m  derate Arab leaders appeared to have been positive, although the

Israel	pj^a^in some parts of the Arab world had been predictably critical.

  ?fie&gt;  au stressed while in Israel that Israelis could not deny to others thK^ftf^D democratic and human rights which they sought for themselves.

ln(jia	the FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, after much delay in

the governmenfc^tNbureaucracy, India had at last confirmed on 3 June its Previous	agreement, fi^st ^foreshadowed by the Prime Minister, Mr Rajiv Gandhi, in

Reference:	April, to the^2io&lt;  ii  g of two British drug liaison officers to India. He

CC(86) 20 3 had informed the^Homb Affairs Committee of the House of Commons on

%

Argentina	THE FOREIGN AND COMMON WS^Tji)SECRETARY said that on 28 May Argentina had

fired on a Taiwanese fisthtaj^jrassel close to the Falkland Islands Previous	Protection Zone. One persw^^ya^. died and several had been injured.

Reference:	This was the latest example\hf^rgentina&apos; s determination to assert

I CC(86) 8.2 authority over these waters. TJa^Bovernment had reaffirmed its

commitment to a multilateral apprto the problem of fishery stocks in the area. He and the Secretarycvf&gt;State for Defence would shortly be circulating papers to colleagues	cts of the situation concerning

I	the Falkland Islands.

South Africa THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said tlya   the Commonwealth

Eminent Persons Group (COMGEP) was meeting lipflcmdon to consider its I	Previous	further role. It had not yet reached	any coi^clu&amp;4&lt;m. The British

I	Reference:	member of the Group, Lord Barber, was	working Ward\fto keep the Group in

I	CC(86) 21.4	being, so that it could carry forward	the attemgfe-^jaQengage South Africa

in dialogue. The Australian member of the Group^irayjtolcolm Fraser, was giving some support. COMGEP might not decide to gjQ^e^&amp;v its work immediately, but the prospects for its future efforfi^&apos;^^fe not good, in view of the far from encouraging response which the SoytfeiAfrican Government had made to the Group&apos;s proposals. The plalK^ronja meeting of Heads of Government to review the work of COMGEP from 3&apos;^e  x^August in London would probably not be altered, provided that there^dA.&apos;wo serious trouble in South Africa meanwhile.	&apos;v/^/


   THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had discussed the situation regarding South Africa separately with Foreign Ministers of the United States, France and the Federal Republic of Germany. Although the attitude of France regarding further measures against South Africa in principle firmer since the advent of the Government led by /v*o?%onsieur Jacques Chirac, France had not vetoed the most recent

^    solution about sanctions in the United Nations Security Council, and v&apos;yMj^LFrench attitude was thus uncertain. The United States

Ot^m^istration was coming under pressure in the Congress for further m^ireup&amp;s against South Africa. The Government would remain in close coni^K^^with the United States Administration. He would report further to &lt;S535j&amp;agues as the situation developed.

COMMUNITY	3. THE CHANCEUM^^K THE EXCHEQUER said that the Council of Ministers

I AFFAIRS	and a number of	states, including the United Kingdom, had decided

   	earlier in the year Ara^iake the European Parliament to the European

I Community	Court of Justice on T&amp;eXg^ounds that the European Parliament had

Budget	illegally adopted the Corajipaity&apos; s 1986 budget. The Advocate General of

the European Court of Jv^ar&amp;a had now given an Opinion in the case I Previous	brought by the Council	ters. While he also criticised the

Reference:	Council, the Advocate Genecrf^^^ted clearly that in his opinion the

I CC(86) 12.3	European Parliament had exc^eTOd^its powers under the Treaty. If the

European Court of Justice, wn  d$/&gt;TOuld be giving its judgment shortly, were to follow the Opinion of VwcAdvocate General, the United Kingdom would have gained what it was seekifi^pn the important issue of the budgetary powers of the European&apos;   Parliament. There were, of course, other major budgetary difficulties&apos;^hSw, and some of these problems would fall to be settled by the Unitefl/Kij&gt;gdom Presidency in the second half of 1986.

Maximum	THE PRIME MINISTER said that she understood t^at():he Community had now

Radiation	reached agreement on a regulation on maximum r3&gt;d  ai3spn levels in food

Levels for	imports from all countries. In discussion it wefesaod that, although

Food Imports the standards might be slightly more strict than&apos;wjreujtechnically

justified, it was satisfactory that agreement had n^M^eached and the Previous	ban on imports from certain countries lifted.	vvOCxS

Reference:

CC(86) 20.4


     Amt*?orgy THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that there was a risk of a

polarisation of attitudes towards nuclear energy among member states of the European Community. In particular, the Commissioner responsible for energy, Mr Clinton Davis, might be giving too much attention to the y^/z-views of non-nuclear countries such as Greece in the proposals which ^^Vykight be brought forward following the Chernobyl nuclear accident.

Agriculture THEMpTLSTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that at the Council of i&amp;friSders (Agriculture) on 26-27 May satisfactory arrangements had beencw^zfipted on certain issues relating to monetary compensatory amounts and are^izlnent had been reached on directives relating, in particular, to pesticifcQs residues.
