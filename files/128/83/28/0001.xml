   I	a^^DDING	1. THE PRIME	MINISTER said that she had received a	letter from His

yyvYv	Royal Highness	Prince Andrew and Miss Sarah	Ferguson	expressing their

^&apos;vy^ warm gratitude for the present which members of the Cabinet had sent to them on the occasion of their wedding.

The Cabinet -

PARLIAMENTARY 2. TW^binet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

  FFAIRS	of Conflows in the following week.

Progress of THE PRIME MINUTER) said that the Cabinet would wish to congratulate the

Legislation Lord President^sf^Jli   Council on the successful completion of the Report Stage of the Socfi/aljaecurity Bill without further opposition amendments

  Previous	being carried.

Reference:	,	, , .

ICC(86) 27.1	THE SECRETARY	OF STA^K^^k SOCIAL SERVICES	said that	he would like

personally to	endorse^fu^^wime Minister&apos;s	remarks.	He was in close

touch with the business jrf^jjfeteers in both Houses and the Chief Secretary, Treasury on the handling^orjftie three amendments carried against the Government in the Committ^g^^hie of the Bill in the House of Lords.

They would certainly seek ts^ire^rse the main amendment but some concession would be needed	less important issues and he was in

discussion with colleagues	details.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCA^jO^^D SCIENCE said that the remaining stages of the Education Bill would^Ktaken in the House of Commons in the following week. Media at tentlikely to concentrate on the issue of corporal punishment in schoc&amp;^ypThe House of Lords had introduced an amendment to the Bill aTro^ishing corporal punishment in maintained schools. The House of Comrades would now have an opportunity to consider the matter. A free vote would be allowed. He himseTf would be voting for the retention of corporal punishment. He understood that if the result was to overturn the Lords&apos; amen*fSivt, the fact that the reversal had been on a free vote would help ^rfs^uring the Lords&apos; acquiescence to the Commons&apos; wishes. The ver&gt;3s^rShg abolitionist lobby in the House of Lords, however, meant that the	could not be

taken for granted.	//I!

As far as the other contentious issue of free speech0f  *^iversities was concerned, he believed that he now had a Government artnewdja&amp;nt in a form that would prove acceptable to both Houses.

The Cabinet -

1.	Took note.	v^/TyO


   Ipar&apos;l^imeitaary THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that on the previous evening the House of |AllovMli^s/\ Commons had considered a resolution to substitute an increase of 6 per /yy^\ cent for the increase of 18 per cent in the Office Secretarial and Iprevious^vO i Research Allowance for Members of Parliament, which would have followed |Reference^&gt;^^the restructuring of the Civil Service salary scale to which the ICC(86) 27. KyVy&amp;lowance was linked. The official Opposition had tabled an amendment overturn the basis on which part of the Allowance was calculated so instead of being based on the assumption that one full-time and one Vj^rtptime assistant would be employed, it would be calculated on an a^dmH&amp;Lon of two full-time assistants. This amendment had been carried on a^rrge vote. It would have the effect of increasing the allowance by som	cent. He thought such an increase quite unjustified and

liable^cp^Sttract public criticism. He did not, however, consider that the Go^rcnment should attempt to reverse the vote. Instead, he proposed that wheo the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) considered the Allowance in their quadriennial review at the end of that year, he should point out that the amendment had disrupted all the previously accepted understandings^Sbut the basis of the Allowance and suggest that the TSRB should consider whether there was any justification for it. He also proposed tS^^-Siwe TSRB should consider whether arrangements should be introduced tol^n^ute that the Allowance was put to the specific purposes for whicir^rt&gt;was intended. The present system of self-policing defied good manageraej/ji^OTactice and would not be tolerated in any well-run organisatios^rfri^ompany.

THE PRIME MINISTER, sumsj^&amp;^ip the discussion, said that the Cabinet agreed with the Lord Pri^n^Sral&apos;s proposal to draw the fundamental nature of the change to tne^riiAntion of the TSRB in their quadriennial review and to invite them t\^c^k&amp;  a view on the matter. They also agreed that the TSRB should b^^iwited to consider whether payment of the allowance should be made	to a proper control and

verification system. In the meant^m^v Ministers should emphasise in answers to questions on the subjwt trat the increase had been the result of a free vote that went ag^^f^t^the Government&apos;s wishes in the matter.

I	The Cabinet -	^

2.	Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion, and invited the Lord Privy Seal to proceed accordingly.


   Ifore^Ov	3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY reported on the situation in

IaFFAI^vx^	the Turks and Caicos Islands following the report on the subject by

Mm

Ivisit of	THE FOKjjtfGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the visit to the United

  Soviet	Kingdom xfcf the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, Mr Eduard

  Foreign	Shevardnadze, which had ended on the previous day, had been the first

  Minister	full-scale visit by a Soviet Foreign Minister for ten years. It had

been an intere^Ste demonstration of the changed style of Soviet diplomacy sina   MvMikhail Gorbachev had become General Secretary of the Communist Party^i^iile Soviet Union. Mr Shevardnadze was friendly, forthcoming and Mrafeesional but he had concentrated in the traditional Soviet way on selerreal/ob jectives closely related to Soviet interests.

It was a fair as sumf&gt;pjitfj     for the moment at least, that the Soviet Union was in earnest in seej  rtK  \faeadway in the field of arms control, on the right terms. The role ovlroe West should be to seek to bargain with equal clarity and f irmn^^/&apos;^VST terms which would suit its interests. Mr Shevardnadze had, for ini^im/a. shown clear interest in some new British ideas regarding on-site irbspjHii^on to verify a treaty banning chemcial weapons. Mr Shevardnadze hwT&apos;^jdently wished his British interlocutors to pass on to the United Sta&amp;  ^ilie message that the Soviet Union wanted another Soviet/United States	provided that it could produce

concrete achievements. There haa aiw been useful discussions during the visit of British/Soviet bilat^aj^atters. Three agreements had been signed - on incidents at sea, ^ff^Leog-term economic and industrial co-operation and on claims dating bS^^^o the Soviet revolution in 1917. An agreement on notification of visit^oJ^Soviet merchant ships to British ports had been initialled. Mr\$hevardnadze had conveyed an invitation from Mr Gorbachev to the Prinre Minister to visit the Soviet Union at an appropriate time.

In discussion, it was agreed that the style ad^ffTw^d by Soviet diplomacy made discussion with Soviet representatives mwe Wg^eeable, but its benefits to the Soviet Union should not be undenysftmated: it was part of Soviet attempts to present a reasonable face ^a^s^ern public opinion while the substance of Soviet policies remg^ied^essentially the same.	/


   Isout^^*^3 THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, during his recent    	visit to Southern Africa on behalf of the Twelve members of the European

I|previous^^\ Community, he had held meetings with the President of Mozambique, Reference^yi Mr Samora Machel, the President of Zambia, Dr Kenneth Kaunda, and the Jcc(86) 2i   e Minister of Zimbabwe, Mr Robert Mugabe. Since his return to

(VVyhlbndon, he had held a meeting with the President of Botswana, Dr Quett *re     President Machel took a relatively realistic view of the tion of South Africa and would not press for comprehensive (^  onAiiiic sanctions. President Kaunda favoured comprehensive sanctions bt^^nask probably been convinced during the Foreign and Commonwealth Secp^aj^r1 s visit of the sincerity of his mission and the breadth of its&apos;^as a European initiative. Mr Mugabe, influenced by the history of ZinWHaJ&gt;$  , persisted in saying that an armed struggle must be waged in South   CSfica, along with other measures to promote the end of apartheid. He had Wen less convinced of the sincerity of the European mission.

He would leave that day for the United States, to consult the Administratioiv^ah&amp;ut policy on South Africa among other things. There was a prospecc(of\A speech on South Africa by the United States President, Mr Rwh^idNReagan, or another senior representative of the Administration, b^M^uly. At present, it seemed unlikely that this would signal any ctpapjfc/e of policy. But he would make clear to the United States Secre  a$  ^&gt;sf State, Mr George Shultz, the Government&apos;s hope that the UnitedV&apos;J&amp;af&apos;^s Administration would make no major move on this subject while the Ewp&lt;J&gt;ean mission continued.

He would be visiting Sou^Kern/Africa again between 23 and 29 July.

There would be two meetings-xwv the President of the Republic of South Africa, Mr P W Botha. The w^jfcight include visits to one or two of South Africa&apos;s neighbours wtrkfciMvad not been covered in the recent visit to the area. The indicationsVw  *^&apos;fchat the South African Government would be extremely resistant toMnaJs^jrg moves towards the dismantling of apartheid or the establishment of/an^jional dialogue within the period set for the European mission. Ind^&lt;f^-fchere were some indications that the South African Government might T^nsi dering further military raids on neighbouring countries. While in v&amp;i Africa, he would press, despite the difficulties, for moves towards dialogue, the release of political leaders and the unbanning of political parties. There was considerable scepticism about the prospects for his mission, and Commonwealth countries were arguing that the Eminent Persons Group had done everything that was possible by this kityy&apos;JTSNmethod to stimulate political progress in South Africa. Neverthaies^Lhere was no doubt that it was right to try through the European mYwSTsh to secure some advances. In so doing, he would make plain the \^oi  e  tunent&apos; s position of outright opposition to apartheid, of recognising t^iriy^ome changes had taken place in South Africa, of already applying ce/rifrKmeasures against South Africa and of being prepared, without ^^i&amp;r^commitment, to consider some further measures, taking into account the ISdapnonwealth Accord of October 1985 and the statement by the Europec^^Jefiyicil of June 1986, if the outcome of the European mission required

In discussion, it was noted that eight countries had so fa^C^phflrawn I	from the Commonwealth Games shortly to begin in Edinburgh. N^^^^as a


   risk that more countries would withdraw, if the Front Line States &apos;wCv decided on withdrawal at their meeting the following day. But there was also a hope that the determined efforts of the Government to work for progress in South Africa would influence other Commonwealth countries V-&apos;V^Aagainst withdrawal. The organisers of the Commonwealth Games had raised y^T^ome   9 million towards the cost and needed   4 million more. Following withdrawal from the Games, further sponsors were not coming ^^fchj^&gt;ard. Efforts to raise more money were continuing. Any decision not u*5a  \ahead with the Games would fall to the Commonwealth Games Fe^?^kion, rather than to the British organisers.

THE^SS#)^ MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that policy on South AfricepywodJd need to be discussed again in Cabinet on 31 July, after the returnrafthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary from Southern Africa and before the meeting of seven Heads of Government from the Commonwealth in London from 3   5 August.

o.

I Nigeria	THE HOME SECRETARYj/did that there had recently been a marked increase

in the inflow of &gt;r3%/ors to this country from Nigeria, to an extent which was putting ^A^train on the immigration service at ports of entry from Nigeria. C^f^ppeared to be linked to rumors circulating m Nigeria to the effeet&lt;&apos;th^?ir fares from Nigeria to the United Kingdom were about to be signifi^^v increased. He would be continuing to monitor developments, in&lt;^oi})^ltation with the Foreign and Commonwealth

Secretary.

I AFFAIRS	Council of Ministers (Agriculture) unde   his chairmanship on 14-15 July

a preliminary discussion of the reform of the beef regime and of I Agriculture:	agricultural structure measures had shown thatthere would be

   5* THE SECRETARY 0F STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that extremists in the Protestant community in Northern Ireland had hoped that marches AFFAIRS&gt;^\ taking place the previous weekend would be accompanied by major

disorder, which would demonstrate that the majority community had previous\Ov^\withdrawn its consent from the process of government. But, because of a ReferenceY^OAwssive deployment of the security forces and a carefully judged CC(86) 27.tf\v^ision by the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) &apos;v^floput Protestant marches in the town of Portadown, the marches on 12 /J5*iy^had passed mainly without difficulty and the incidents that had

during the weekend had not been nearly as serious as expected. Tnterp^Had been no fatalities. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the RepmildS^of Ireland, Mr Peter Barry, had made a statement criticising thel^sjffln of the Chief Constable to allow a Protestant march to pass near ^Cafholic area of Portadown. This was wrong in substance and ill-judged politically. Colleagues needing to comment on Mr Barry&apos;s remarks should avoid polemics but state firmly that the Government had complete confidence in the RUC and should praise the courage and dedication of Lt^members.

AFFAIRS	unemployment figures to	that day	would show a reduction in	the

   	&quot;headline&quot; figure of about	compared	with the previous month, but

I Unemployment on a seasonally adjusted bas^s,^^ increase	of about 15,000. For the

The Cabinet -

I	Took note.


   7,	The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of the

EC  ;gn Exchequer (C(86) 17) on Economic Prospects and a memorandum by the Chief

PND	Secretary, Treasury (C(86) 18) on the 1986 Public Expenditure Survey.

1087-88	CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the short-term prospect for

lQ89-90	economy now differed from that foreseen at the time of the Budget.

1	Inflation had turned out substantially better, with the year on year

^Rc^ase in the Retail Price Index now down to 2.5 per cent, and likely to stay below 3 per cent for a considerable period. There had been a step change to a lower rate of inflation, and this represented a major achievement. But output was weaker than had been expected, with the result th^^unemployment was continuing to rise. The Gross Domestic Product     Pll was now expected to grow by 2.5 per cent or less in 1986, as againlflu^ earlier expectation of 3 per cent. Other major economies were also exEmencing a weakening in the trend of output, and in Japan product ion^S^J^ually fallen in the first quarter of the current year for the fin 11 years. It was still expected that there would be a pick-up inactivity, and an acceleration in the growth of world trade later th^R^*r, as consumers in industrial countries reacted to the increase in B^eir real incomes resulting from the very sharp fall in oil prices. For	being, however, the impact on the world

economy of lower	had been contractionary, in that the oil

producing countries w^^rcl^had suffered major losses of income had been obliged immediately to reduce their expenditure, while countries which gained had yet to adjust their spending in an upward direction.

Apart from the impact of a rather stagnant world economy, there were a number of problems specific tA^M|s country. The continuing rapid growth in earnings, far out-s^Jkmijng the rate of inflation, added to unemployment and carried the th^eaTOf upward pressure on prices. High pay settlements in the public s^fcirajpMresented a double problem, in making it more difficult to secure^K&gt;  r settlements in the private sector and at the same time addingxo pt|^.ic expenditure. The sharp fall in oil prices inevitably reduced^^^*value of United Kingdom exports, and at the same time reduced	r^renue. These developments

had become a source of serious concern	financial markets, as had

been shown by their behaviour on 14 July^TlmUnited Kingdom economy had in fact been remarkably successful in ^j^^^^ing the severe shocks, first of the 12 month miners&apos; strike and then of oil prices falling by more than 60 per cent, and this was evidence of the Government&apos;s success in maintaining market confidence in its prudent economic management.

That confidence could only be maintained if the Government were seen to be keeping public expenditure under tight control. .Qflhy ^ this could be done could the economy retain its ability to wiAsta^J destabilising shocks. It was essential that the Cabinet should g^S a ^ear signal to financial markets and pay bargainers through the main^H|^^e of tight restraint over public expenditure.

THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that despite the Govern|^^^6 Manifesto commitment to lower public expenditure and lower^^aj^jj^n, public expenditure had continued to increase in real terms 1985-86. That year, for the first time, a small reduction wa^^^k prospect. For the future, the intention of his proposals for CTie^^^6


   Survey was to hold public expenditure flat in real terms, which would

  mean that it absorbed a declining proportion of a rising GDP. The objective should be to reduce the proportion of GDP taken by taxation to ^ts 1979 level. Against this background the size of the additional bids JjLbmitted by spending Ministers in the context of the 1986 Public ^%x5fendi ture Survey was very disappointing; and there was in most cases evidence of a search for offsetting savings through changes in ^^orities. Morever the cases made for the additional bids frequently failed to make clear what the additional spending was intended to achieve. It would be impossible to absorb the totality of the additional bids; so far as individual programmes were concerned, it was essential ^jyit clear objectives were set, and yardsticks specified by which progress towards these objectives could be measured.

Parti &apos;    I ar^^M&apos;nn had to be focussed on three specific areas -

Loc^^iiPyiority expenditure: the last White Paper had shown for 1987^% an|k 1988-89 the same cash figures as for 1986-87, because of^Che j^fficulty of finding a satisfactory basis for distributionlGM^ total among the different services. The size of the Reserves I^OTkbeen increased to allow for additional expenditure in xh^p^rea. The agreement now emerging from the Ministerial Stee^Rguommittee on Economic Strategy, Sub-Committee on Local Authority Expenditure (E(LA)) would mean showing markedly higher local authority current expenditure in 1987-88; in presenting this change it would be essential to emphasise the impact of the new restrainy^the Government would be placing on this expenditure, so as fe^F^&gt;id the impression that the Government was simply underwriting &lt;^ferspending. At the same time local authorities were overspendin^^^ry substantially on capital account, and action would b^pieed^ to close this loophole. Unless satisfactory arrangements could b  made, there would need to be still greater restraint on oth^^gp^^rammes.

ii. Departmental running costs ai^^^ianDOwer: Departments&apos; bids would mean an increase of 6.5 per	total running costs and

an excess of 14,000 over the manpowe%^J|et for 1 April 1988. It was essential to reduce this substanti^P^^^eal increase in total running costs, and to prune Departments&apos; manpower requirements.

iii. The nationalised industries: the opening bids made the previous April for external financing were   850 pillion above baseline for 1987-88, and here the objective shc^i be to get back at least to baseline, and if possible below it^jk^A

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL summarised the posiMgj^ched on local authority expenditure, about which he had minuted ^^^pime Minister on 16 July. E(LA) had agreed that the followin^|^|U Rate Support Grant settlement should provide for total expenditure*   25.2 billion, of which 46.4 per cent would be met by Aggregate Grant (AEG). Although this appeared to be a large increase previous plans, E(LA) had considered it essential to make a re^Tstic settlement, taking account of local authorities&apos; powers to levy


   rates if they considered the provision by the Government to be inadequate. Although a settlement on this basis had important disadvantages, it had to be seen against the background in which AEG had been reduced from over 60 per cent in 1979 to 46.4 per cent in 1986-87. Jmo allowance had been made in this settlement for any additional y^frpenditure on teachers&apos; pay. Two new disciplines were proposed to     lJLtrain local authority expenditure:	first, grant recycling would be

4ebMi8hed, so that authorities would know from the outset the financial discipline they would face; and second, an &apos;unallocated margin&apos; would be left between the total of Grant Related Expenditures and provision, which would tend to penalise higher spending authorities. A further problem arpse on capital expenditure, where an overspend of   700 million was in mrcH^ect in England for the current year. Since the 1987-88 baselin^^A^^been set   600 million lower than for the current year, there was^ajiO^prmous gap between current actual spending and the following jfcJreX^programme. Numerous devices were open to local author ities^^Temde the effect of current capital spending controls, and it would not be possible to hold the following year&apos;s expenditure to baseline consid^Ktly with assurances previously given about access to receipts from as^^ sajes and about future levels of allocations. As things stood, sucli^^^braints as were open to the Government would tend to fall most heavil^oi^^^ose authorities in depressed areas whose needs for expenditure were	but whose accumulated receipts from asset

sales were small. In order to overcome this difficulty, new powers, on which E(LA) were currently working, would be needed to control local authority capital spending, and it would be difficult to avoid some increase above baseline if authorities in the more prosperous parts of the country were not to feel   fflSky harshly treated. Urgent new primary legislation would be needed i^^*spect both of the abolition of grant

recycling and of the new---flocal authority capital

expenditure; both aspects wouldernely contentious and it would be most important to be sure that thetfegtslation was right before bringing it forward.

In discussion the following main point^Fwere made -

a.	There was still insufficient publi^  nderstanding of some of the causes of the relatively poor perform*ice of the United Kingdom economy. Although great improvement had been achieved in inflation, prices and unit labour costs were still rising faster in Britain than in other major industrial countries, real interest rates were higher, and unemployment was substantially higher. Against this background there could be no questAflkof taking risks on public expenditure, and every effort had to    *^le to secure public recognition of the need to cut back the^Spwfefekof earnings and unit labour costs.

b.	With high pay increases boosting real incomes	as

increasing public expenditure directly and indirectly^Kmould be unwise to foster public expectation of still further inareaAes in real incomes through tax cuts.


   c.	There should be substantial scope for improving the quality of public expenditure programmes through value for money improvements and through reordering priorities, but without increases in the

^ totals. Changes in public expenditure and taxation should also be targetted as precisely as possible, so as to minimise the overall costs. Small expenditures (eg on the General Certificate of ^^J^Secondary Education) precisely targetted could have a

disproportionately beneficial impact. Any scope for tax reductions should be concentrated on the lower paid.

d.	There was general support for firm discipline over

departmental running costs, but it was suggested that there could be Aitpptions where the needs of the economy could best be served by	some limited increases in manpower and gross running

costs^^C^xample in the areas of tax collection or the provision of services khose costs were met by charges.

e.	Althllfeij the financial markets would require reassurance of the GovernnlPfcffl determination to continue prudent fiscal and monetary pol^Pie&amp;, they would also be concerned if the rigour with which those polic&apos;s^te were pursued made it unlikely that they would be continued b^^&gt;n^a^he next General Election.

f.	Local authority expenditure was in practice outside the control of central Government. Other countries did not include such expenditure in the control totals for Government expenditure, and it would be for consideration in the longer term how such expenditure should be tr&lt;A    in the Public Expenditure Survey.

g.	There could be no	any change at this time in the

published public expenditur^^J^^ng totals. But the difficulty of holding to those totals shouldMot be under-estimated, given that more than half of the Resl^^^or 1987-88 would be absorbed by the increase in local authority wKft expenditure agreed by

e(la)	VQt

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discus^onj^aid that it was of fundamental importance that the Government	stick firmly to their

established policies of strict control of public expenditure and public borrowing. Any weakening of the Governments resolve would put at risk all their achievements in securing lower inflation and greater efficiency and competitiveness. Accordingly the Cabinet fully supported the Chief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s proposals in C(86)	should now

conduct bilateral discussions with spending Ministe^^J^^he usual way about their public expenditure programmes and their	for running

costs and manpower, working within the existing publis^^W^^Anning totals of   144 billion for 1987-88 and   149 billion for^^^^y9, and within a total of   153 billion for 1989   90. The aim for nationalised industries should be to hold the provision at^g^^^^ to baseline and where possible below that. Departmental Minist^J^Jg^uld pay much greater attention to specifying the objectives to beiac8  kved by their programmes, particularly where there was any questionlor additional bids above baseline. She hoped that the Chief Secret^jj^^^^


   Treasury would be able to reach agreement with all his colleagues on the basis proposed; if that proved impossible, she would at the appropriate ^ time establish a small Group under the chairmanship of the Lord A President of the Council, which would consider outstanding issues and ^^tke recommendations to the Cabinet. If it proved necessary to ^W^ablish such a Group, she would inform the Cabinet of its membership. Meakwhile it was essential that the Government as a whole should be seen ^fe fully committed to the approach agreed by the Cabinet. In reply to questions, she would explain that the Cabinet had discussed public expenditure and agreed that the Chief Secretary, Treasury should hold bilateral discussions with colleagues working within the existing published olanning totals for 1987-88 and 1988-89 and within a new plannin^W^l of   153 billion set for 1989-90. Other members of the Cabinet WiouM adhere strictly to this line in any outside contacts. It was more^SlB^int than ever that the bilateral discussions with the Treasury snoul&lt;  ae carried on in confidence, and that there should be nothing on v^ff  ^phe media could base speculative stories of int ermin is ter ipp^ti ^agreements.
