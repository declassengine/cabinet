   p   ^/j  wwTARY 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House of Commons in the following week.

In discussion it was noted that the business would be so arranged as to NAwX^yschedule the proposed debate on South Africa for the whole day on &gt;^Oy  uesday 17 June; this would enable the Foreign and Commonwealth Vv&apos;^fecretary both to open that debate and to be present for the first day ^Arf^the meeting of. the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) of the /fftirppfian Community on Monday 16 June, when the Report of the Gajpmcmwealth Group of Eminent Persons on South Africa would be considered.

FOREIGN	2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Dr Kurt Waldheim

AFFAIRS	had won a convincing majority in the presidential elections in Austria

---	on 8 June. Th^*lhrime Minister had sent a message to Dr Waldheim which

Austria	acknowledged Wtie democratic verdict and wished the President-Elect well.

The tone of tnrs^nffsteage was in line with messages sent by other Western leaders. The inauaura.tion of the new President would take place on 8 July. The GoveTTM&amp;nt would consider carefully the question of British representation on choft^paoasion and whether to advise Her Majesty The Queen to send a

Haiti	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEAL&apos;n^BfepiMSTARY said that disturbances continued

in Haiti, but the situation tMji^m^far been contained. The question of Previous	evacuating foreign nationals mign  c&lt;&amp;rise. There were 70 British

Reference:	citizens in Haiti. The United sti^eT^intended to take action, if

CC(86) 5.2	necessary,	to protect the lives at	td^eign residents. The Government

would need	to take care,	if the qu    jfcjx2jb of any reaction arose, to be

concerned only with this aspect and nop&apos;ta be drawn into wider operations.

People&apos;s	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said t/hat})he visit of the

Republic	General Secretary of the Central Committee or\Ch/^Xbmmunist Party of

of China	China, Hu Yaobang, which	had ended	that morning(Thao)gone very well.

Previous	in a brief	discussion it	was noted	that Hu Yaoban^wa^^. man of great

Reference:	energy, initiative and enthusiasm; and that he had lva^di^d adroitly some

CC (85) 18.2 difficult questions raised after his talk at the Roy^ivii|^itute for International Affairs on the previous day.

The Cabinet -

1.	Took note.	_


   |Ann^^\ THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Warsaw Pact had IControlyy	made a further set of proposals concerning arms control. They had

syyCS. proposed reductions in conventional forces in the whole of Europe from I Previou^   y) the Atlantic to the Urals. The proposal had been put forward with the I Reference^^/VProPaSan&lt;*a skill now associated with the General Secretary of the I CC (86) 2.3\^v^Smnlun^st PartY the Soviet Union, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev. The

&apos;v/oi/vernment would say that it welcomed any serious proposals in arms WiiMrcol and would point out that the members of the North Atlantic Organisation, following the recent meeting of their Foreign M^iiis^rs at Halifax, Nova Scotia, had established a task force to

question of reductions in conventional forces in Europe.

The^^rnment would also point to the new proposal, put forward recenl&amp;j^riy the West at British instigation, in the negotiations on mutualNiind balanced force reductions in Vienna. The Government would remind public opinion in this country of the full range of far-reaching arms control proposals which the West had on the table: proposals for a reduction of 50   per cent in the strategic nuclear armaments of the Soviet Union ariSjnhe United States, for the global elimination of intermediate VJaag)i   nuclear forces, for a complete ban on chemical weapons and on crefieinmatiers.

In a brief discusswas noted that a recent example of the Soviet Union&apos;s attempts to^^ras the West through proposals on arms control was the offer of bila^^&apos;ralXtalks on nuclear weapons with the United Kingdom and with France^/^Jne positions of France and the United Kingdom on this matter were the^&amp;du^n

I	The Cabinet -

2.	Invited the Foreignv^M^ommonwealth Secretary to write in his Governmenv^fanakity to all Members of Parliament to draw atten^dnj^   the arms control proposals of the West.

m

I South	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Report of the

   	Africa	Commonwealth Group of Eminent Persons (COMGEP) would be published that

day. Its conclusions were sharply critical o^-S^uth Africa. The Group, I Previous	whose work had seemed for a time to offer a potetvtial opening towards

   	Reference:	dialogue, had reached this negative conclusionTreiTroipally because the

I CC(86) 22.2	South African Government had been unable to agr^e__ijA*:espond in a

reasonable way. The last straw had been the raiaS^^/sputh Africa on neighbouring countries on 19 May when the Group had Afe  ^\visiting South Africa. Lord Barber, the British member of the Grou^^fia^ managed to prevent the inclusion in the Report of a specific recomn^rfSation for economic measures against South Africa. But the report  ^Kjrvkefer with evident approval to &quot;effective economic measures&quot; and	action

of an effective kind&quot;.


   Meanwhile, the tenth anniversary of the Soweto riots, whch fell on 16 June, might be the occasion of intensified violence in South Africa. Black organisations were planning protests. There was every sign that the security forces would act harshly. There might be an early debate

^.in the United Nations Security Council.

/  ejlad recently discussed the matter with the Foreign Ministers of the /  jiraipean Community countries and with the United States Secretary of &lt;S//Stgn^ Mr George Shultz. Pressure for further measures against South iCfrip^p was building up in the United States Congress. In the House of ReiJ^SjSKtatives, a Bill had passed the Foreign Affairs Committee. In the^S&amp;nate, on present prospects, movement was likely to be slower. The Admirw^t^ation wished to hold the line, but Mr Shultz accepted the possibility that further measures against South Africa might be necessary. In the European Community, Denmark, under pressure from domestic opinion, favoured further measures. Greece was likely to take the same position. But Portugal, with many of its nationals living in South Africa//ffo&lt;m the same position as the United Kingdom. The Federal Republic of O^g^iejKwas standing firm against further measures. In France the Pr ime/MimjLster, Monsieur Jacques Chirac, was openly against sanctions, while^tji^&amp;resident, Monsieur Fran  ois Mitterrand, took the opposite posit ion	he most recent vote on sanctions in the United

Nations Security Co^^^rt\ France had not joined the United Kingdom and the United States in^  ^crog a veto. But in the European Community, France was likely on baJ^Hj^A to be helpful to the British position.

Italy and Belgium had a&apos;^gnsmble attitude. The Netherlands, despite domestic pressure for fufc^jre^toeasures, ha&lt;} come recently to see more clearly the case for actiorfxin&apos;voncert by the European Community countries.	&apos;X

In the Commonwealth, there woui   ^course be active advocacy of further measures by countries such as Za  j  unxZimbabwe and India. Australia and New Zealand now favoured further measures.

A group of officials (MISC 118) was analysing the various implications of the measures that had been listed   r&apos;the Commonwealth Accord (agreed by Commonwealth Heads of Government at\Nassau in October 1985) and of some other measures likely to be advocated in the coming period. In Parliament, there would be Members who were strongly opposed to further measures. There would also be support, whicb^probably would be stronger, for the adoption of some further me^susgs. The Government should respond to the reference in the COMGEP^T^ffSraj to the need for &quot;effective measures&quot; by pointing out that no me  sjM^e  \could be effective unless they were taken by all the main industria  ^fflycountries, notably the seven participants in the Economic Summits ana   ni^ftembers of the European Community. Reference should also be made li^tfhe^need for countries bordering South Africa to consider objectively   ^ effect on them of possible further measures against South Africavx$  K\Government should be active in restraining the European Community c  mr  r  es and the United States from moving towards wide-ranging further meas^r^Vv against South Africa. The Government should point out that the Uni^ew^Klngdom already applied certain measures and that the adoption of co^prafoMisive trade sanctions would produce the opposite effects in South AOT^daV^rom


   those sought by the advocates of such a policy. At the same time, it could be indicated that intermediate positions were possible, where certain carefully chosen measures might be considered, such as might help to keep alive the prospect of dialogue in South Africa. The /^Government should seek to maintain control in this debate, and not be Vyiwept along by the pressure for excessive measures.

/oiiws cuss ion the following points were made -

^ jyz. The Department of Employment had estimated that the imposition &lt;^rji^full economic sanctions against South Africa could cost the loss 000-120,000 jobs in Britain. The losses of jobs would rLerafinue long after the political and media effects of the imposition of sanctions had died down. There was, however, little support in the international community for a general trade boycott. In the Commonwealth, the more responsible members were talking of specific/fflgTflsures concerned with such matters as investment or tourismf^ Tftjs United Kingdom Government should consider whether measures^32iefe^available which would have little impact on British economic intere/sts.

b.	The f irWfy&amp;fOUie possible measures listed in the Commonwealth

Accord was a b^tf^itfioair links with South Africa. The United Kingdom had then&apos;sedoM largest airline industry in the world, and interference with^^SK^inks would set a precedent harmful to British interests.wfioyaover, the Government would be obliged, if it wished to terminsiE^^i^L Air Services Agreement with South Africa, to engage in ^dnPtjJiations lasting two months and then to give twelve months&apos;	termination. The revenues to British

Airways from services witn/^S^th Africa and from related services exceeded   80 million per afinjmX These points were among others being considered by MISC 1

c.	It was difficult to be cSnJj^ent about the evolution of United States policy on this subject.   fl^a^Administration wished to resist movement towards further measure^T The line might be held in the Senate until September.^ But major trouble in South Africa could affect the attitude of the Administration. If the United Kingdom decided to consider the adoption of a few^limited measures, this might help to hold the Administration b//lc&quot;&gt;mrom more far-reaching measures.

d.	Countries which would not be affectecNo^y^yjftr-reaching measures against South Africa were the most avid advo^aWj^of such measures. For the United Kingdom, there would be economi^^o^ees from measures which, by contrast, were very likely ft^devsvaded by South Africa. There would be benefits for the Soviet UniJ&gt;*  \if South Africa ceased to be a reliable source of supply fcw&apos;/tnej West for platinum, gold, vanadium and other special metals,as diamonds. It was generally thought that the moral aiflyMneVp: s pointed towards further measures; but there was also ope^w counter-argument that far-reaching measures would increire  ^  &amp;e instability in South Africa without offering any prospec\^tnak\a


   new stability would subsequently emerge. The final paragraph of the COMGEP Report, which called for &quot;concerted action of an effective kind&quot; as &quot;the last opportunity to avert what could be the SSj)	worst bloodbath since the second world war&quot; was open to the

objection that the imposition of wide-ranging measures might actually precipitate a cycle of violence.

^ the United Kingdom were to be isolated in the Commonwealth resisting further measures against South Africa, the position of /Apr Majesty The Queen as Head of the Commonwealth and Head of State number of member countries should not be affected. Decisions measures against South Africa were a matter for each individual ymr|5  onwealth Government.

THE PRIMfc MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the United Kingdom&apos;s immediate objective should be to hold the situation, so as to allow discussipa^with other industrialised countries before the meeting in London frafak&apos;JSno 5 August of the Heads of Government of the seven countries rep^e^ea-feed in COMGEP. The Government should take no action on further measVn!&apos;es)\gainst South Africa unless other industrialised countries took o&lt;te^!aibe measures. The report by officials on the measures should be^^ans^dered initially by a group of the Ministers most closely concerned.

The Cabinet -

#  

3.	Took note, witi^afppiWal, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their dir&amp;e&amp;s^ion.

I COMMUNITY	3. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EOT^gfi^^aid that there were reports	that

I AFFAIRS	at the European Council on 26-27 Jun&amp;yzpt&amp;te would be pressure,	in

particular from the Republic of Irela*{$7 for a Community nuclear I Nuclear	inspectorate with access to nuclear installations such as that	at

I Energy	Sellafield. It was important that the United Kingdom position	on	this

and similar nuclear issues should be closely concerted with the French and other nuclear member states.

In discussion it was noted that this had beenNi^rCTMised at the informal meeting of Foreign Ministers on 8 June and that\vJi^Ataited Kingdom could expect strong support from the French.


   ECON  iS\. 4* THE SECRETARY 0F STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the monthly figures on unemployment to be released that day would show a reduction of 54,000 but the seasonally adjusted figure would be 6,000 higher, compared with Unemployment) the previous month. Unemployment now seemed to have been slightly ising over the last six months.

discussion it was pointed out that this trend was not surprising.

^/JraeVe had been a pause in economic recovery in a number of major CfridasNirialised countries, and the United Kingdom economy was rather remained, however, the expectation of informed observers, in^5$i  g the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, thaS^OTards the end of 1986 the beneficial effects of the fall in oil price4o*^d be more widely felt and that there would be a resumption of growthsX While economic growth in 1986 might be lower than had been foreseen earlier, economic growth in 1987 might be better.

In discussion af^the recent higher than expected money supply (M3) figures and hfvk^ra^ssible trend of inflation, it was said that there were no signs of overheating in the economy and none of the signs which would have been assocVaiiea)with monetary laxity. The various monetary indicators were &apos;Qerog^affected by the substantial changes in financial markets associate&lt;^  fXit)*yleregulation and by the large measure of financial innovatioi/&apos;iro^taking place. Because the financial framework was changing, the inl^rf&apos;prWtation of the monetary statistics was difficult. The United Krradom would have low inflation that year.	It

was to be hoped that tlrj^/Croujld encourage businesses to make more moderate wage increasespossible that there would be a slight increase in inflation agai  ^  n/\he following year because the direct effect of the oil price fali^ap&lt;tybf some reduction in interest rates would already have been ref 1^&apos;uM^luring 1986. The absolute level, however, should remain low.	Y\

The Cabinet -

Took note.

NORTHERN	5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by tKe^ecretary of State	for

IRELAND	Northern Ireland (C(86) 16) proposing the introduction of an Order	in

ASSEMBLY	Council to dissolve the Northern Ireland AssentW^&apos;&apos;l5^vfore the Summer

Recess.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said niaUP^pe Northern Ireland Assembly had been established four years eari  ^ri^ It had two purposes: to consider how to achieve devolution and to (yp&amp;ate committees to scrutinise the work of Northern Ireland EGgra^irtunents. The first purpose had never been fulfilled, largely because&apos;Wj^/ppcial Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) had not joined the Asseraoi^&apos;X The scrutiny function had been discontinued after the signatureAcvjlrhe Anglo-Irish Agreement of November 1985. The representatives^r/  j&gt;^ Alliance Party had subsequently ceased to attend the Assembly,/^mfvil:


   Sl	was now reduced to a rump of Unionist members meeting once a week in

/p	order to criticise the Anglo-Irish Agreement, often in extravagant and

offensive terms. The Exchequer was paying for this irresponsible activity. The Government had so far been tolerant, but action to ^-^VVd is solve the Assembly was now needed, since otherwise elections would \Cv .arytomatically follow in the autumn. They would coincide with the first adversary of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and would be used by unionists tevive their campaign against the Agreement. The need to undertake ^an^^ction campaign might drive the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) closer tc t^more extreme Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) or, if the two pawiejS^ompeted in the election, the DUP might make gains at the expet?s^aA the UUP. The Government had powers under the Northern IrelamKAct 1982 to dissolve the Assembly by Order in Council at any time. &apos;That was what he was proposing. It was important that the dissolution should take effect before the marching season in Northern Ireland got going in July. In announcing the dissolution, he would make clear that the^&amp;sembly was not being abolished but only dissolved; that the Governmei/v^wcWld continue to seek devolution in Northern Ireland; that the Govei^nw?JEE&gt;had repeatedly warned that action would be taken regarding the Assembly if it continued to behave unacceptably; and that the unionist leaaS^^Jvad recently refused to see him to discuss the subject.

Some people in NorthCTnvTp^Land would seek to stir up trouble following dissolution of the AssqgW^X There would be accusations that opportunities for unionists l)o express their views were being stifled. But the facts were otherwss-e^^t was the unionists who had deprived themselves of opportunitiei1^^express their views, by refusing to talk to Ministers, by not at tend tutelar e House of Commons, by walking out of local government and by misuseyq  /i&lt;fce Assembly itself. The leader of the UUP, Mr James Molyneaux HP^re^^ded it as inevitable that the Assembly would be dissolved and mu ndt seem to mind this greatly.

Mr James Prior MP, who as Secretar^g^f   fxtate for Northern Ireland had established the Assembly, and other^ rested Conservative Members of Parliament agreed that action should q^^aken on the Assembly. There would be wide support.

If the Cabinet agreed his proposal, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland would make a statement that afternoon iir the House of Commons on the dissolution of the Assembly and the OrdenyinXlEouncil would immediately be laid. The Parliamentary procemu:j  s   should be completed as rapidly as possible. Consideration was bein//giV\n to a special meeting of the Privy Council to bring the Orderfeet.

Dissolution would follow immediately after that.

In discussion it was noted that public opinion in Gr^at^B^itain was moving against the unionists because of their continuinjg^ywposition to the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the face of the overwhelmrlM^ipm   oval which it had received in Parliament. It was confirmed that the^Gw^Xhment had powers under the Northern Ireland Act 1982 to dissolve the^sA^kbly by Order in Council at any time. The Secretary of State for N^^ro^n Ireland would be speaking, before his statement on dissolutid*ryOj/&lt;  &gt;the Speaker of the Assembly and also to other politicians with a d{^c^\


   interest. In his statement to Parliament he would make clear inter alia &gt; that the Government stood firmly by the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The

Government would continue to seek contact with the Unionist parties as )) well as the SDLP.

The Cabinet -

1. Agreed that the Northern Ireland Assembly should dissolved as soon as possible. _

Agreed that the Secretary of State for Northern &apos;^&apos;S&amp;kelapd should that day make a statement to this vf&lt;  eiet in the House of Commons and lay the requisite OKAer in Council.
