   PAj/^j&amp;ViTARY 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House AFF/k1&amp;v&gt;5	of Commons in the following week. The Lord Privy Seal said that an

announcement would be made that afternoon that, subject to the progress of business, the House would rise for the Summer Adjournment on Friday ^^\25 July.

\ \

Progress of	PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Government programme in

Business in	th^Apue&apos;e of Lords was now under considerable pressure. The House had

I the House of	satMiS#!&apos;lwell past midnight on two occasions that week, and that was

I Lords	impos^ro^ome strain on the staff in the House. Progress on the Gas

Bill csmtinued to be good with no amendments having been carried against the Government and he hoped to meet the Secretary of State for Energy&apos;s timetable. He also hoped to secure Royal Assent to the Building Societies Billja^fore the Summer Adjournment. The Social Security Bill was proving	difficult Bill to handle. Report Stage had been

fixed for 14 raid llrK^July and Third Reading for 21 July. The intention was to have the /BilJ)returned from the House of Commons on 24 July; he hoped to have it^M^Vith the Commons by 7.00 pm that day, thus enabling the Coxsmo^Jtpycise on 25 July as planned. He was confident that the House of Lariij^&amp;ould accept reversal by the Commons of their amendment to frustrat^^i^proposal that everyone should pay at least 20 per cent of their dom^  ^cc rates, but the other Lords amendments carried against the Gov&amp;nmemi might prove more difficult to handle. He was in close touch with rxfce^fehretary of State for Social Services on this matter, and a major wlrumim exercise was being mounted.

I Parliamentary THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that a restructuring of the Civil Service I Allowances secretarial grades with effect fronCi^fiarch 1986 had resulted in various proficiency allowances being incorpo  acpd^within the basic salary. This had had the effect of increasing the	point in the senior personal

scale to which the Office, Secretarial vknd Research Allowance for Members of Parliament was linked. When the general Civil Service pay settlement and likely outcome of the London Weighting negotiations was taken into account, this would mean that, und^^he terms of the 1984 Resolution on Members&apos; pay and allowances, the AMowance would increase by about 18 per cent compared with 1985-86. Ttrereybuld be a similar effect on the secretarial allowance for MinisteOL^ijrAhe House of Lords; and on that part of peers&apos; allowances which covered^ecxetarial costs. This would be an unacceptable increase and rightly arrW^jrcised as an unintended windfall gain. He had therefore concludew^a^er discussion with those colleagues most concerned, that the right coujf^^would be to table an amending Resolution to	rein back	the increase^^^h\per	cent.

He would also ask the Top Salaries Review	Body to take th^a^nirk	in	the

formula into account in their four-yearly review of the Al^jk)waiuxe which was to take place in the coming	year. He	thought that the&apos;maroi^ty	of

Members would see his proposals	as fair, though there would	who

Would seek to obtain the full increase.

I .	vC^y*   HOME SECRETARY said that since his last report to Cabinet work had

S  te	&apos;v^Apeeded on tbe Procedure for handling disputes with the Prison

|DlSpU 6	0m&lt;h&amp;rs&apos; Association (POA), and the POA had balloted their membership

I -ouS	toye^t^ off their mandate for industrial action. Although ample time

Ir fVrence:	hadeJ^sed for the results of the ballot to be declared, no results had

lcC(86) 20.2 yet&lt;S^nnounced. It was, however, believed that the voting in the balloT^as^eavily in favour of calling off industrial action. In the meantime^adispute had arisen about staffing levels in a part of Risley Remand Cwtre. This minor question was the sort of thing that should have been dealt with locally under the disputes procedure that had been worked out, but the POA were making a national issue of the matter, and approachingpxt in a bellicose fashion. Xt seemed clear, therefore, that the POA v/ere)looking for trouble, and they might be prepared to try to use all the&apos;M3e^Si&gt;.ques of disruption that lay to the hand of a public sector trade uniwC^/Jtn that event it would be difficult to maintain tranquility in tnk-pz$on system or to tackle the shift system and manning practices	now been revealed to be so wasteful. He was

keeping a close eye torfiSt^situation and was considering various courses of action that he migirt^ejfed to take in the light of developments.

I FOREIGN	2. THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGiS^NDp&apos;pOMMONWEALTH OFFICE (BARONESS

I AFFAIRS	YOUNG) said that the United Kingdom^SS^ernment and the South African

-   	Government would announce	at	1.30 pm qfo^^uay that	the President of the

I South Africa	Republic of South Africa,	Mr	P W Botha\M*ould meet	the Foreign and

Commonwealth Secretary on 23 July and tnat a further meeting between I Previous	them could take place on 29 July if necessary. The Foreign and

I Reference:	Commonwealth Secretary would	also be meeting tJie^Foreign Minister of the

I CC(86) 25.2	Republic of South Africa,	Mr	Pik Botha. The mr  l:	reports of the

Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s meetings^woMr^the President of Zambia, Dr Kenneth Kaunda, on 9 July and with tn^Tnime Minister of Zimbabwe, Mr Robert Mugabe, earlier that day sho^g^^i^at these meetings had been more friendly than media reports were su^g^tapng. It had been useful for the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary	the

opportunity to counter the suspicions of the two leaw^!^Nw&gt;out British motives regarding the ending of apartheid. Both leadeg^Md been firm on the questions of substance regarding policy towards	Africa.

Neither had suggested that he would seek additional econsin&amp;y^id, if, following the imposition of further measures against South^^^Ma, the latter were to retaliate against Zambia or Zimbabwe.


   Plans were in hand for consultations with other industrialised countries about policy on South Africa. The Prime Minister herself was already due to visit Canada the following weekend and would be meeting the v Canadian Federal Prime Minister, Mr Mulroney. The Foreign and ) Commonwealth Secretary had arranged to meet the United States Secretary &apos;&apos;^  f State, Mr George Shultz, in Washington on 18 July.

&gt;$&lt;/fif/garia and Ghana had withdrawn from the Commonwealth Games, to be held ^to^ls&amp;inburgh later that month, citing British policy on South Africa as Vhev&apos;vreasons for doing so. British High Commissions had been imftnrfi^ed not to over-react to this development but to say that the Govrcam^jftt would greatly regret further withdrawals. The Permanent Underwcc&amp;tary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, had spoken to the Se&lt;tr&apos;e   ary General of the Commonwealth, Sir Shridath Ramphal, stressui^ that the Commonwealth Games were one of the most popular manifestations of the existence and spirit of the Commonwealth and that withdrawals from the Games would damage the interests of the Commonwealth ap^af the athletes concerned, without affecting South Africa. The (M^ganisers of the Games considered that the Games could go ahead if only &gt;fc5f^i^Kountries withdrew.

In discussion, tme-^m  prtance was stressed of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secrerayjp^&amp;rrying out as thoroughly as possible his mission on behalf o fC&lt;ire  we lve members of the European Community. The total number of meetingsO^o&amp;jring his European mission would of course depend in part on whethe^^kfain people and organisations representing the black population in tsdutn) Africa would decide to see him. But the Commonwealth Eminent Pers\s  i&lt;^mp had held meetings with a number of Ministers in South Africa	Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary

would no doubt need to undertted^yanumber of engagements there. This might well mean that he needeaytfer^aend the whole of the period between 23 and 29 July in Southern Afrrxfa^X^

The following points were also mad^^^^^

a.	Japan would probably follottC^Jr^example of the major Western industrialised countries with remd to the adoption of any further measures against South Africa.

b.	The President of the United States, Mr-^Ronald Reagan, was

planning to make a major speech about So6&apos;  n  frica on 22 July, one day before his Secretary of State would	fore a hearing on

the subject in the Senate. The United Sta^dspflministration was not yet aware of the dates selected for meevl&amp;^i^between the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and Presid  ift^J5J  tha. If President Reagan announced in his speech that qb^Wkited States would, or would probably take, new measures agaMfS^ptouth Africa, this would seriously complicate the Foreign and CossmOT^ealth Secretary&apos;s visit to South Africa immediately afte^rards and the subsequent meeting of certain Commonwealth Prime Minij&amp;^rejs. On the other hand, if President Reagan made a different kindwTf^s^eech about South Africa, this could be helpful to the Forei&apos;yty&amp;.h


   0	Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s European mission. Although President

Cj	Reagan himself was against the imposition of general economic

sanctions on South Africa, the approach of the mid-term elections to the United States Congress might influence the political mood in Washington towards consideration of further measures.

HE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet pted that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary might well need to v^visoAnd the whole of the period between 23 and 29 July on his European in South Africa; and agreed that efforts should be made to that any speech on South Africa by President Reagan on 22 July shoit^d^take account of the interests of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secr^^?y&apos; s European mission.

{Malaysia	THE MINISTER OF STA^/FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE said that,

despite high-level	the British and Australian Governments,

[previous	Mr Kevin Barlow, a Bt^  v?ikand Australian national, and Mr Brian

[Reference:	Chambers, an AustralianX^Konal, had been executed in Malaysia on

were pending in Malaysia{VjF*)- instance, eight British Dependent Territories citizens from&apos;siw^^^png had been sentenced to death in Penang on drugs offences arfa^a^eped likely to lose their appeals.

   COMMUNITY	3. THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE (BARONESS

   AFFAIRS	YOUNG) reported that both France and New Zealand had accepted the ruling

   -	of the Secretary General of	the United Nations^-in the arbitration which

   New Zealand	they had sought on the case	of the	two FrenctfYag  yts imprisoned in New

Zealand after the attack on the ship, Rainbow^#a&gt;rior. The New Zealand    Previous	Prime Minister, Mr Lange, had been	widely criticAsera in New Zealand for

    Reference:	agreeing to release the two	agents	to a shorter&apos;^S^  $l of detention on

|CC(86) 26.3 French territory. In consequence Mr Lange&apos;s roomO^V^anoeuvre on other nuclear issues might be further reduced. She recomM^iiie^i that the United Kingdom should make no comment on this arbitrvfi^njX There was, however, one consequence for access for New Zealand but^ej^to the British market. In line with the indication that Franc^x^ojuLd be able to agree to figures of 77,000 and 75,000 tonnes for 198/^!iw^988 the Commission had made a proposal in that sense. It was hopaa^jjidt this


   i&apos;Oy)	could be agreed in the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on

I	21 July. In discussion it was pointed out that under a recent

yConvention the United Kingdom had accepted that prisoners convicted in certain countries could serve their full sentence in their own country; /yy^S. but this did not imply any reduction in the length of sentence. It was w&apos;Jl important, in relation to the case of the two French agents, that vI^^Qthing should be said beyond the fact that France and New Zealand had ^r^Mted the Secretary General of the United Nations to arbitrate and had &apos;v/Meepted the arbitration. On butter there could be some difficulty if ^ra^^qmmission1s proposal, which was a repetition of a proposal made ^iSme/jikars ago but blocked at that time by the Irish, were not discussed in&lt;  ne/$&gt;ouncil of Ministers (Agriculture). It was possible that both Dem^rCasd the Republic of Ireland, despite some Irish assurances to New	would oppose it.

  Community	THE CHANCELLOR OS^THE	EXCHEQUER	said that, as the European Court of

  Budget for	Justice had riVWTdS^he	Community&apos;s 1986 budget to be illegal, the United

|igg5	Kingdom Presioi^nj^had had the task of sorting out the problems. The

Council of Minis(ersjand the European Parliament had now reached   Previous	agreement on a neyjw^Set. Although this agreement still had to be

  Reference:	ratified by the pletfidiw^ession	of the European Parliament, it was

  CC(86) 26.3	expected that it wouThe	new budget went right up to the 1.4	per

cent valued added tax&lt;&lt;^r^  ceiling. Although the scale of this budget was unwelcome, there was^^doubt that the United Kingdom&apos;s Presidency role had been very skiln^^yJHandled by the Minister of State, Treasury (Mr Brooke). In the new bbd   ft&amp;lXthe United Kingdom had secured an increase of 500 million ecu^^P   300 million) in the existing provision for the abatement. \&gt;pr  7Fontainebleau arrangements on the abatement had thus been fullyVa^p^ted. The budget did not, however, show the agreement on budgetaryvdis^ypline in a good light. There were genuinely exceptional circumstane^r o&amp;agricultural spending because of the large change in the dollar/ecu^  a^^but the increase in provision for the structural funds was also hUgS^^ The discussions had shown that some member states were prepared to h^ip^^bwn structural fund spending in order to spend freely on agricultur^vwhile others were willing to hold down the agricultural provision inx&gt;rder to put more on the structural funds. The United Kingdom, however, was looking for restraint on the budget as a whole. This demonstrated the importance of the discipline imposed by the VAT ceiling.

In discussion it was noted that the new budgecTyf-&apos;Y986 at this level should have the effect of reducing the potentiai^ovw&apos;ftun into 1987, and thus make it easier to keep the 1987 budget withir^rae^.4 per cent ceiling. It also honoured the undertakings given tp&apos;&amp;M^in and Portugal in the accession negotiations. It was also noted th^  &gt;&amp;r^satisfaction with the continued storage of surplus stocks might be h^gfrptyghted if, as he apparently proposed, a British member of the Europeaiv^^nli ament,

Mr Newman, encouraged demonstrations at the various stora^eo^Xes of which he appeared to have obtained details.

NORTHERN \0v4&gt;\ THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that the marching IRELAND &apos;v/vk4&amp;on Nort*:iern Ireland was now approaching its climax. 1,300 LfFAIRS	so ^ar ta^en Place 1985 and some 900 were still to come.

The^jH^k of the marches so far had passed off peaceably but a more Previous	trouhi^ome phase was now likely. As expected, the previous weekend had

Reference:	seefi  &gt;ejlfi^ disturbances in Portadown. The police had agreed to a church

CC(86) 26.4	paraa^yyy^unionists taking place along the planned route, subject to

certaiiMxmditions designed to minimise trouble and exclude troublemakers. The conditions had been broken and 27 policemen had been injured in the ensuing trouble. The approaching weekend was likely to prove even more difficult. Every precaution would be taken, but there might be at leae-frvas much trouble as on the equivalent occasion in 1985, if not more. /pieH.eader of the Democratic Unionist Party, Mr Ian Paisley, had r  3u  3t&gt;a call for all unionists to go to Portadown, to insist on their raigWo to march through Catholic areas of the town and to work to destroy tfe^m^lo-Irish Agreement. This call had, like other recent utterances	Paisley, been expressed in extreme, possibly

even seditious langii^gjey\lt had not been backed by either the Orange Order or the OfficialMwowst Party. He was confident that the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC^Mtf&amp;ild take a firm non-partisan line in policing the marches;	been much angered by recent Loyalist

attacks upon them. The Pfcov^^onal Irish Republican Army were, however, deliberately seeking to rafe  ^hfe political temperature in the Province. Two attacks had been mounteaop^wv the border in the previous few days, in the first, a policeman had^Q^^^shot dead while off duty and in the second two soldiers had been kM&apos;ie^^nd two injured in a bomb attack on an army observation point near C^fssja^glen. The Irish Garda were questioning two men and a woman in^  ^ji  ection with the death of the policeman and the RUC were questioi&amp;igoone suspect who had been detained after the bomb incident. It was	both incidents were designed

to provoke the unionist population anijuo raise questions about the effectiveness of security co-operation Tollowing the Anglo-Irish Agreement. If there was serious trouble in Portadown during the following weekend, colleagues could reply to auv criticism of the Government by pointing out that the same mard^   !    1985 had caused incidents; that the trouble on both occasion^JjaJt   b^en caused by the exploitation of this particular annual march bV/fJeaple who wished to incite Protestant hostility to Roman Catholics;Vartp&gt;&apos;flriat Mr Paisley in particular bore responsibility for what had happ
