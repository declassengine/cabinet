Minute 1

I Pensioners&apos;	THE PRIME MIN^TnR said that a Lobby by the National Pensioners

I Lobby	Convention oKVii mtcch would coincide with a debate on a motion by the

Opposition abou^/iTieS plight of the elderly. It was important that during the debaVg-^gp^in the response to the Lobby the Government should stress the amount ^^pea our ces which had been devoted to pensioners, in particular as a resvirv^eS. the commitment to increase pensions in line with inflation. The^e^e^nment1 s record in this respect stood up notably well in comparisp&lt;j2fcr&gt; that of its predecessors. All Ministers should take the opportii  W|y/V!io stress the Government&apos;s record in this area.	v^/a

I %

I British	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE&apos;   ANp^N DUS TRY said that, following the

I Leyland	invitation to other companies to	parts of British Leyland, there

had been firm indications from only5    |/jjAtential bidder. Others had I Previous	until 4 March to produce something fivra^rfnd it was possible that one

I Reference:	more bidder might emerge. In the meanvune, the Government would keep

I CC(86) 7th	all its options open. A group of Ministers most directly concerned had

I Conclusions,	been set up to consider the tactical handling of the issue. He would

I Minute 1	keep Cabinet informed of further developments.^   ..

   	Teachers&apos;	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE s&amp;ijxtyit the National

I Dispute	Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teacher^Mrad^Non the previous

day voted by a significant majority to accept the agr^^i^ivL put forward I Previous	by the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACA^a!\ The

I Reference:	Burnham Committee was meeting on the following day and ti^embloyers&apos;

I Minute 2	disruption continued in schools; the National Union of Teacf^^^fO&amp;d

agreed to suspend strike action, but were not prepared to resvdi^^ood

lilSc


   will. The employers&apos; side would probably accept the position and ratify the, agreement. In that case, the next step was to proceed with the ACAS initiative on the conditions of service of teachers and ACAS were ready J) to appoint three &quot;wise men&quot; to undertake this.

Northern v/Tjjg^ARIME MINISTER said that on 25 February she had had a meeting Ireland	li hours with Mr James Molyneaux MP (leader of the Ulster

Uq^Jy^-fc Party) and Mr Ian Paisley MP (leader of the Democratic Unionist Previous	PaShe made strenuous efforts to respond to unionist concerns

Reference:	aboul^^K^Anglo-Irish Agreement. She had offered new arrangements for

CC(86) 7th consuMSation between the Government and the unionist community on Conclusions, affairs^in Northern Ireland. Such consultation could go wider than Minute 4	matters discussed in the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and

could include security questions, for the discussion of which the Chief Constable of/  Heyloyal Ulster Constabulary could be present. She had also of fered vAiscMasions about the future of the Northern Ireland Assembly and aTra&amp;fqhe way in which Northern Ireland business was currently h an dlafl^M/^rli ament at Westminster. She had also agreed to consider the Unioiu^w/leaders&apos; suggestion of a round table conference, together with the otmfei^Northern Ireland parties, about devolution in Northern Ireland.	pointed out that under the Anglo-Irish

Agreement subjects whicn^W^e devolved to an administration in Northern Ireland would be remove^^r^Ora, the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference. The two Uls&apos;rer^dmionist leaders had agreed to reflect on what had been proposed anf^i^  et the Prime Minister again soon. They had recognised that the Gov^rrM^ift would not tear up the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The Prime Ministea^mm^ade clear that the Agreement would be implemented. The first pub^^^^atements by the two leaders after the meeting had been in line with,^^ had passed. But after their return to Northern Ireland they TradJa^en subject to pressure from more extreme supporters. Although she ^  &amp;g  ar:d nothing more from them, they had said publicly that they would naf&apos;Naeek the Prime Minister again and would support a one-day strike on Monva^o March.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IREEAND said that the initial public impact of the Prime Minister&apos;s discussison with the two Unionist leaders had been good. They had approved in advance the-^tatement from 10 Downing Street on the outcome of the meeti/wfp&apos;pjut were now denying this and presenting in public a false account\gf meeting. Their volte face created a worrying situation. The unwmiyats hoped that the strike on 3 March would close ports, airports anN^r^wfe and close down the electricity supply industry for at least part	day.

Contingency plans had been made for such eventualiti^p^tjht it would be very hard to impede the kind of action extending over^k&apos;\Irfflited period that the unionists were planning. Meanwhile, Belfast Cif^p^unil had refused to comply with a court order to set a rate and fcr^iVaw in contempt of court. The Northern Ireland Department of tlr^fiuvi&apos;ronment would set a rate and also collect the rates.


   V^rV*\	In discussion, it was pointed out that the Government had strong popular

support in its policy of implementing the Anglo-Irish Agreement.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the &apos;^   ^^&apos;^vGovernment1 s next steps in the difficult situation that had now

loped in Northern Ireland should be discussed urgently by the v^^rainisters most closely concerned.

I	FOREIGN	2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the former

AFFAIRS	President of th&amp;^Philippines, Mr Ferdinand Marcos, had now left the

---	country and haoraen offered asylum in the United States. The

The	transition fran.PJI&amp;^ident Marcos to the new President, Mrs Corazon

Philippines Aquino, had takatt^pMce virtually peacefully, against the background of sustained UniteckSSJ^&amp;fls pressure on the former President not to initiate Previous	violence. The sita^wjjx in the Philippines was now returning to normal.

|	Reference:	There had been no rMiOCT^yof harm to British subjects. The new

CC(86) 7th	Government was very i^rjjgjree^ienced, and would have to cope with a

Conclusions, substantial residue of su^rters of the former President in powerful Minute 2	official positions. Th^o^tfaS also a problem of Communist insurgence.

But the new Government wottldo4i*sioy wide public support.

In a short discussion, it waA&apos;wjt&amp;d that President Aquino seemed to be inclined politically towards	. She was likely to try to hold

off the Communist insurgence, anfl^wSSL more likely than the former President to undertake the social	ms which were needed in order to

erode public support for the ComnranLs^.

I Egypt	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there had been

substantial rioting in Cairo. A curfew had been imposed. It appeared that no foreigners had been hurt. The immedia^e-^cause of the rioting had been disaffection in the paramilitary Sec/SritY\ Police on the grounds of inadequate pay and conditions of service. &apos;JB^t^-this was not the first sign of dissatisfaction in Egypt with the Government^ Jle d by the President, Mr Hosni Mubarak. If President Mubara^p^&amp;stablished a normal situation quickly, there might be little	  im worry. But

there was also a possibility of continuing economic aMV^Xlitical

I	dissatisfaction in Egypt. There were 4,600 British	in Cairo.


   ArwQ^sel THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the speech by King Relatr  toi  	Hussein of Jordan on 19 February had marked the end of the King&apos;s

/CyGS. current initiative for peace in the Middle East, but the King had not PrevioW^\/y excluded the possibility of making further moves in the future. One of ReferencfrPvVvhis PurPoses had been to shock the leaders of the Palestinian Liberation Cc(85) 13\6v^Srganisation (pL0), in the hope that they might reconsider their ConclusiomWfcp//n  ransigent attitude. The subject had been discussed by Foreign Minute 2 ^/ImnAsters of the European Community countries on 25 February. The

and Commonwealth Secretary had persuaded his European Community vdlL^gues not to launch any new initiative but to agree that the Png^^deaicy should keep itself informed about the situation. Nothing sh&lt;5e^5^be.done by the European Community countries which might build up the M^mon of the leader of the PLO, Mr Yasser Arafat. The Syrian ForeigqlMinister would be visiting London on 3-4 March. It was important to keep in touch with the Syrian Government, but concrete results were not expected from these discussions.

Iran/lraq	THE FOREIGN ANDVQOMMjWeaLTH SECRETARY said that there had been a

I War	limited Iranian o^miixe in Kurdistan on 24 February. Iraq was

expected to retake twrepOsitions lost there. Iraq was making slow I Previous	progress against thepranSgan forces which had recently occupied the area

I Reference:	surrounding the town of^dj^v There were continuing rumours of a

I CC(86) 7th	possible Iranian threatMS^^ffywait or Saudi Arabia. A move of this type

I Conclusions,	by Iran could not be exci&amp;dejlOxbut on balance it did not seem likely.

I Minute 2	In the United Nations SecuSrt^f&apos;Oouncil, the United Kingdom had helped to

secure the adoption of a re^Dlw^ftpn which was more even-handed than any so far passed on this subject^i^rpMt body. It provided, for what it was worth, a better basis for rvirocrc  fetion in the future; but Iran could not be expected to respond helptuj/ty&apos;^&amp;o it.

I South Africa THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY&gt;Aaid that the co-Chairmen of the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group, Mr Malcolm Fraser of Australia and I Previous	General Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, accompanied by Dame Nita Barrow of

I Reference:	Barbados, had completed their preliminary visif&gt;-feo South Africa. This

I CC(86) 6th	had been successful. They had had- a wide ranaeon contacts and had been

I Conclusions,	well received by the South African GovernmentSy^AM-snembers of the

I Minute 2	Eminent Persons Group would visit South Africa fn/omja to 14 March. The

South African Government was adopting a fairly hejpjud^attitude towards this visit, perhaps because it realised that it ha4^%nji^pther options for promoting dialogue.


   I	THE ^0REIGN AND    COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the General Secretary

I oirThe*^ of, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, had I	made a speech lasting six hours on 25 February, the first day of the

I pijirty	27th Congress of the Party. The text would require close study. It

I soviet Dtwjyiv\ appeared to contain much rhetoric of a predictable kind. But there had \\^^?een some references to the question of economic reform which might V^^yprove interesting. Mr Gorbachev had appeared willing to look reasonably ^tively at the latest proposal by the United State President about v,/r^iWions in intermediate range nuclear forces. Mr Gorbachev had also vrfai^ted willingness to consider withdrawal of Soviet forces from A^^^  tan in the right circumstance. This point might be ch  rm  4ristic of Mr Gorbachev; he was willing to identify the major prob  j^^even when their solution was hard to find.

I . V - ..	/ &apos;

I Argentina	THE FOREIGN A^ff~T^SMMON WEALTH SECRETARY said that a Parliamentary

delegation f^ton Argentina had visited the United Kingdom from 16 to I previous	22 February atyfe^iVivitation of the South Atlantic Council, a group of

I Reference:	Members of Parlikmera^Aand others interested in promoting better

I cd(86)7th	relations with Arg^4/rja. The visit had passed off well. The

I Conclusions, delegation had heardrAu^rtmg presentations of the British position I Minute 2	concerning relationa^^^^Argentina and of the reasons&apos; why the

Government would not conWfiblate negotiations about sovereignty over the Falkland Islands. The ^iirSvkl by the delegation of an offer of a meeting with the ParliamraJ^afc^Under Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, had	its credibility in this country.

COMMUNITY	3. THE MINISTER OF AG&apos;^jft/TURE, FISHERIES	AND FOOD said that the

AFFAIRS	Council of Ministers (A^rooiNture) on 24-25	February had had a first

---	discussion of the CommisV^oirA-vprice proposals for 1986-87. In view of

discussions would continue&apos;^orvaALong time, possibly until the summer. Previous	The Council had reached agreesdi^Jt .^however, on certain structural

Authorities and similar bodies in any event differe&lt;y/&gt;^PJh:thermore, the judgment did not relate to the question of pensionab^^ffge&gt;but only to discrimination over the right to continue working. For tije^Jonger term more flexible practice on retirement age would need to wp^z&apos;^oteidered.

   In discussion it was pointed out that the ECJ had also decided that in this case the Directive did have direct effect, in the sense that it could be relied on against a State authority acting as employer in order to avoid the application of a national provision not conforming with the Directive.

I LEGISLATIVE	5. The Cabinet considered a iremicfrandum by the Lord President of the

I PROGRAMME	Council (C(86) 8) setting out tlie^^^mmendations of The Queen&apos;s

I 1986   87 AND	Speeches and Future Legislation romjM^ee (QL) for the 1986-87

I 1987-88	legislative programme and for advalai^^rf^pces for the 1987-88 legislative

programme.	.a

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL saicniihat the programme of legislation in the present Session was exceptionally heavy and the Session was bound to end late, with a substantial spillover after the Summer Recess. It went without saying, too, that planning for thg   qext Session should leave maximum room for maneouvre for a possiWieQaneral Election.

Within these constraints QL had compiled a re   ^oyme  4ed programme that sought to achieve the right balance in both political and business management terms, and he commended their recommgg4rf  &gt;&lt;ftis to Cabinet. Although the recommended programme was not large i^^wrajp of the number of Bills, it included a number of long and weighty	If any

further Bills were included, room would have to be	them by

dropping Bills from the present list. He drew particula^S^tention to the inclusion of two hybrid Bills, on the Channel Fixed^vpricYfand on the Broads. The second of these was expected to be popular


   environmentalists. QL wished to consider possible advance places for 1987-88 in the light of Cabinet&apos;s discussion of the programme for 1986-87, and recommendations for advance places were not put forward at present.

^/^\&apos;^he following points were raised in discussion -

a.	The Licensing Bill would be a popular measure, with benefits &gt;Ofor tourism and employment. If the Shops Bill could be

^X^jratisfactorily concluded, it should be easier to proceed with

Licensing Bill. On the other hand amendment of the licensing s would find passionate opponents as well as supporters and it ^ajj^Juestionable whether it was wise to proceed with it in a S^sion, towards the end of a Parliament, that would be starting la&amp;fe and would have much heavy business.

b.	It might be necessary to give further thought to the need for

legislatiw^to corporal punishment in schools, on which the United Kingdom Was ift present in breach of a judgment by the European Court of ifm^rtr^yights. It was probable, however, that an amendment on this matW^p^/puld be made to the Education Bill during its passage throilSK^tne House of Lords, and further consideration could not usefully	to the subject until the position was clearer

on that front.

c.	There was a stfmngvcase for including a Bill (which would be hybrid) on the DartkjS[r&lt;v0  ossing. Improvement of the crossing facilities at DartfortM^^^essential for the M25 motorway, which was now nearing comple\Aowv/tyo play its full part in relieving traffic flows around Lonaddition, the construction of improved facilities at Dar/rjjr&apos;ikwould bring employment benefits and could be presented as a prrvaJ^-Aector development project alongside the Channel Fixed vfnfc^kid the proposed Canary Wharf development. As a hybrid Bill(/^2Rasure for the Dartford Crossing would need to be based on a spOT&apos;j^^c jproposal for the works involved, and this could not be Mj^iused until the results of a competitive tender were available Neater in the year. Hybrid Bills could, however, carry over from onff&apos;Session to the next.

d.	The Merchant Shipping Bill had failed^Xo find a place in successive legislative programmes, and tW&amp;fe\Vas now a paramount need to find a way of showing the Governn^ntJs-&gt;concern to halt the decline of the British shipping industry. ILtforghnisation of marine pilotage would be warmly supported by the skJwHypift and port industries, and it would be possible to proce^^^iUj this part of

the Bill alone.	mklfe

e.	The Child Care Bill was directed at issues thaj^^ld become

very topical at any time, and it would be a genera]fty^(  d!yL-received measure. If it was not possible to include it in tn^J^^r87 Session, there was a particularly strong case for giving^^^an advance place for the following Session, so that consubftaMpfks could go ahead with the various interested groups.	  ll/y


   f.	Further legislation on industrial relations was probably most appropriate for a Manifesto commitment, and for legislation early in the life of a Parliament.

g.	The Water Authorities Privatisation Bill would provide a vehicle for legislation on land drainage and coast protection, how

. far this might go, beyond the essential provisions that flowed from the privatisation of water authorities, was a matter that needed &apos;^^^\further consideration.

MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet brdtP&amp;yr agreed with the programme for 1986/87 proposed by QL and listed in AriWp^A to C(86) 8. It was agreed in principle that Bills on the Dartfoqfd Crossing and on marine pilotage (though not the remaining contents of the Merchant Shipping Bill) should be added to the programme, subject to further consideration of timing and content. The Cabinet was no  _4isposed to include legislation on industrial relations or on amend inf^traa licensing laws in the 1986-87 programme. Legislation on child care^m^g&amp;fc&gt;&lt;well be appropriate for an advance place for the 1987-88 programifor a commitment in a General Election Manifesto). QL would now neeq&gt;-^&gt;d)pnsider both the advance places and any necessary revisions to the p^wpijxd programme for 1986-87, in the light of the discussion and of tbervd&amp;S&apos;isions that had been made.

The Cabinet -

1.	&quot; Approved the leSiadAtyive programme for

1986-	87 put forward by^K^vQueen1 s Speeches

and Future Legislation&apos;^SomprPttee in Annex A to C(86) 8, with the adc^?mw)f measures on the Dartford Crossing and/cnp&apos;nfirine pilotage, subject to discussions betwejrt^&apos;fc&amp;e Secretary of State for Transport, the&apos;   Lapd^President of the Council and the Lord Privv^ejCfron their timing and content.	v   yV

2.	Invited the Secretary of StaoA for the Environment to discuss with the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food the extent to which the Water Authorties Privatisation B-i-41 might include provisions on land drainagf&amp;ciiu   coast protection, and to report any propeqj^Ls^v for a significant extension of the Bill to jttne^J Lord President of the Council as soon as po&amp;Sj&amp;re^

3.	Invited the Lord President of the Council	\

arrange for The Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future Legislation Committee to consider the advance

places that might be given to Bills for the	\\j)

1987-	88 Session, and to review the proposals made for the 1986-87 Session in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion and decisions.

   RE6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of the PER50Nk1/O	Exchequer (C(86) 7), to which was attached the draft text of his

TAXATid  v\	proposed Green Paper on the Reform of Personal Taxation.

CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that a preliminary indication of ^r&apos;^Vthe proposals in his draft green paper had been given in the course of is 1985 Budget Speech. He now proposed to publish the Green paper on ^y/Ejiweet Day, 18 March. The main proposal was for the institution of a

of Transferable Allowances (TAs); this idea had first emerged in (  foeen Paper issued in 1980 by his predecessor, the response to which dissatisfaction with the existing system. Following the GrJw^aper, TAs and Mandatory Separate Taxation of married women (with some yra^ovements in social security benefits) had been recognised as the twimost promising approaches to reform. The Green paper would confirm^the Government&apos;s choice of TAs; under this system all adults would have standard allowances against income tax, whatever their marital status and the special place of marriage in society would be recognised bw^p^Twiiding for the unused part of a person&apos;s allowance to be transforrAAfrVhpr or his spouse. At the same time married women&apos;s right to indepenfa^nh^ and privacy in their tax affairs would be established, ana^JJa^/^Nresent situation under which the Inland Revenue dealt only with ti^im/sband on all aspects of the wife&apos;s tax affairs would be ended. Th^Aj^Jir&apos;Narrangements would end the present tax dsicrimination again    &lt;*p^en who stayed at home to look after their children, and would get jMj^of the present anomaly whereby when a wife stopped work she and he^misoand had to pay a higher proportion of their reduced income in tax tms&amp;Jmkx did when both were working. Once the new system was in place, aTI^j^wen amount of revenue forgone through increases in tax allowances\Swo  J*dShave a considerably greater impact than at present in taking one^Wj^jme families out of the unemployment and poverty traps. Finally th^^hirage would remove the actual tax penalties imposed by the present sw^m on marriage, notably through the aggregation of the wife&apos;s investifem^^ilcome with that of her husband.

As well as the main issue of TAs, tn^5&amp;rean Paper covered a number of other taxation issues which were the vji^ect of considerable public interest. These included the scope foK\integrating the tax and social security systems, and for rationalising taxation and national insurance contributions. There was also a discussion of the possible scope, after the computerisation of the personal tax system^   for simplifying the system by the introduction of self   assessment/idncbNnon-accumulation within each financial year. So far as bringi\$g^ tiSgeJher tax and social security benefits was concerned, the text made c/yeanjthe practical and philosophical difficulties; although there was fflqae^dTppe for rationalisation which would be pursued, care would^i^mWio be taken to avoid treating in the same way income which taxpayero^ijinhaed for themselves and money they received from the State. ^  N^i  en Paper made clear that there was no question of commitment to any paj^^ular cost and timescale for the change. Nothing could be done beroce^y990 because of the prior need to complete the computerisation of the &apos;j^aara^nal tax system; thereafter implementation of the changes would depeja&amp;xu^the economic circumstances at the time and on the Government&apos;s adsVji^^ent Of priorities. Phasing the introduction of TAs over a period or^y^  ^


   could greatly reduce the costs in any one year. Although there was no question of any immediate action, it was essential to undertake the consultation without delay in order to clear the way for the development )) of appropriate programming for the Inland Revenue computer system, so

that it was ready to accommodate whatever decisions the Government took ^*\V.in the years after 1990. Although the Green Paper proposals would not

ceive a universal welcome, the responses first to the 1980 Green Paper then to his 1985 Budget Speech indicated that there should be &lt;/sjAkantial support for them both within the Conservative Party and ^JmonAvoters more generally; in particular the introduction of TAs sfepoJiWenerally be welcomed by those concerned about the position of wot n society.

THE SflM  RETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that he supported publication of the Green Paper, and recognised the attraction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s proposals. He was conscious, however, that the introduction TAs could require the commitment of up to some   5 billion, jrattft might make it more difficult to meet claims for additional pMbliy expenditure in politically sensitive fields, including those for whi^tyyf  &quot;&apos;i  ias responsible. The question might well be raised whether the ver^^s^J?&lt;antial resources required by TAs were being targeted accurateJ^jfenough at groups the Government wished to help; the change would actual/^^arve more help to over 1 million one-earner couples without chitaran^han it would to one-earner couples with childen. He had therefop^suggested that a Family Tax Allowance might be grafted onto the Ch&lt;(  raP&apos;iNor of the Exchequer&apos;s proposals, which would go to help families with^Jj^Mren whether the wife worked or not. Such a system would be more erf   SexdT&apos;re than straightforward TAs in reducing the numbers of families in\xn  ^p  verty and unemployment traps, and would appropriately recognise the &apos;    ^riiy the Government gave to the family. He noted that the Chancellor o/^^i^NExchequer considered that the mention of an idea on these lines^e^d change the character of the Green paper, and did not press hYS nrf^t at this stage; but he thought it important that there should be ra^g  &amp;stion of legislation to implement the Green paper&apos;s proposrSNS  rore the next General Election.

In discussion the following further points were made -

a.	The mention of the possibility of a Family Tax Allowance would

in practice reopen the argument about the^-proper means of provision for child support which had been settledytjySBhe instuitution of the present child benefit arrangement. In SAwEaE   as the benefit of a Family Tax Allowance would go to the husbajfpr  ther than the wife, this would run counter to the main elementChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s proposals.	  &apos;ll/)

b.	Although the minor personal allowances wera^fcMraiical and

derisory, it was doubtful whether their prospective/^^eJition should be so clearly indicated.	Wik

c.	The present &quot;subsidies&quot; to unmarried couples (a allocation of mortgage interest and capital gains reliwfsK^^id the


   V	possible double benefit from the additional personal allowance)

were particualrly undesirable. The Green Paper proposals would remove the present injustices.

d.	Although there could be no question of abandoning the contributory principle, which had recently been restated in the Government&apos;s White paper on Social Security, there was a section of opinion (represented among the Government&apos;s supporters in the House

Commons) which saw scope for advantages and savings from moves ^^^owards intergration of the tax and social security systems. The ^^gxt should not exclude the possibility of some moves in this ^^yrection, where these could be shown not to be inconsistent with   p^^Sovernment&apos;s other objectives and with the maintenance of the &lt;Mntributory principle.

e.	Ending the aggregation of the wife&apos;s investment income would cost f. 100 mil 11 on a year. Although this would be a significant benefit /wTlV^tter-off taxpayers, the present situation was seen clearly \ao. mg-jnijust even by people with no prospect of ever themselvesvi^n^ning the higher rate tax brackets.

THE PRIME MINISTEI^^flftming up the discussion, said that the Cabinet approved the publicaftAtfir&apos;on Budget Day of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s proposeo^J^ei^ Paper on the Reform of Personal Taxation. Subject to further consio^^tion of the points made in discussion, they were content with the	it stood, although they recognised that it

would need to be amendedSio^rake account of any changes in tax rates and allowances made in the 19  5^l^et. Although there was every prospect that the proposals in the GreeA^pper would receive a favourable reception, there could be no	n at this stage of any commitment by

the Government to a timescale fiin^i  eir implementation. Nor could there be any question of legislation on^^iis^lines of the Green Paper until after the next General Election. WSSL

The Cabinet -

Approved the publication on 18 Mai&amp;h of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s proposed Green Paper on the Reform of Personal Taxation, subject to the points made in discusssion and in tfet Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.
