   la?&gt;MMTARY 1 The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House of Commons in the following week.

&lt;^)

..	SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that under legislation

InvaU	\\&gt;i^roduced in 1976, invalid care allowance was paid to men and single

Allowance	who were unable to work because they had to spend more than 35

    3^r  \a week caring for a severely disabled person in receipt of an Previous |	atytfgkdpace allowance. The then Labour Government had, however,

noon&apos;s	specifically excluded married women who formed the largest group of

CC(8b; *	car^^n grounds of cost and because in many cases they would not have

givengiOj^fk in order to undertake care. This exclusion had been challenged in the European Court of Justice as contravening the European Communit^Directive on Equal Treatment in social security matters. As he had previously reported to Cabinet, the Advocate General had produced in April an Opinion to the effect that the exclusion did indeed contravene the^Jit^ective. The full Court was now to give its judgment on Tuesday 24 v^ne^nd it was fully expected to confirm the Advocate General&apos;s OpiniMi^&apos;yti.nce the Advocate General&apos;s Opinion had been received he had D^a^&gt;^  nsidering the implications with the Chief Secretary, Treasury^^Styraightforward extension of the allowance to married women would	annual cost of some   55 million a year plus

a once-and-for-all csome   100 million in backpayments which would be dated from when the Eq*i&amp;. Treatment Directive had come into force in December 1984. They ha^ejrfivpred a number of options which might limit the cost but had coneludS^h^k none of these was feasible. The position was complicated bj^k^fact that an all-party amendment designed to achieve straighMOTw^rd extention of the allowance to married women had been put do6%tf&gt;the Social Security Bill in the House of Lords. This was virtually	to be carried. In these

circumstances he had concluded th^Wie best course for the Government to take was to pre-empt both the Co^KJudgment and the Lords amendment by bringing forward its own amendme^t^w extend the allowance. Subject to the views of colleagues, he proposed^?   make an oral statement to that effect on the following day. THV^Slternative was to await the Court judgment; but in the meantime th&gt;C&gt;Lords amendment might be carried and the Government would have lost the initiative.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discus^iohu said that it was regrettable that public expenditure decision^^hfculd be pre-empted by a court in this way, but that the Cabinet endor&amp;etiVtWi Secretary of State for Social Services&apos; view that in the circumstates^i^e best approach was for the Government to table its own amendment^xfcending the allowance to married women.

The Cabinet -

1. Took note, with approval of the Prime MinisteK^a^V^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Secrei^i^i^^ of State for Social Services to proceed accordingly. \\y/)


   VL( the THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONEMNT said that the Report would be o published that day of the Committee set up in February 1985 under the chairmanship of Mr David Widdicombe QC to inquire into the conduct of the	local authority business. It was a substantial document with over

  f L0C*L^&gt;\ 88 recommendations and was formidably comprehensive in its approach.

Author	ther than working Up counter-measures to extreme abuses, which did not

jB  siness NWA^ppen most authorities&gt; it took a systematic view of practice and ^CVpfcacedure across local government as a whole and recommended a \Mj45mnrehensive structure of interlocking and detailed statutory controls, flic ted with the Government&apos;s approach of improving the   cco&lt;irt^ability of local authorities to their electorate and relying on threT/^  ther than detailed statutory prescription, to regulate their actia  fe  i) He therefore intended to accompany publication of the Report by a TW^kjey Written Answer saying simply that the Government welcomed the Rep^r; proposed to express no views at that stage but would welcome commentS^pon it. He would consider the Report further in the light of the public response.

    Radioactive THE MINISTER OF AGRICW3  I&amp;&gt; FISHERIES AND FOOD said that when the cloud   Contamination of radioactive fall-out  fr^Sthe nuclear power disaster m Chernobyl had lof Sheepmeat passed over the United Kijr  d^i.during the weekend of 2-3 May there had been heavy rainfall in NoPfe*  6\England and Wales and parts of Scotland and some pasture land had tra  ^cpntaminated. As part of the Government response to the incident the^c^&amp;   been monitoring of radio-caesium levels in sheep and cattle.	Rigger level&quot; at which action should

be contemplated had been taken	becquerels per kilogram (bq/kg).

On 11 June recordings above this &lt;t  vp^&gt; were identified in North Wales in two very young lambs not yet ready^^^jc^Mrketing. As a result the Secretary of State for Wales had inYtfjZted a series of special tests on 13 June in which lambs from 20 farms &amp;    6rth Wales had been sampled.

The testing had been conducted by Amerraam International. This had established abnormal levels of radio-caesium both in marketable lambs and in lambs as yet too young to be marketable. Among marketable lambs this had in no case exceeded the 1,000 bq/kg L^el, although in- some cases it had come close to it. The reason frfr^tM   high levels of radio-caesium amongst very young lambs appear^   j  &gt;be their different metabolism and the fact that they had eaten contaminated pasture at a time of high intake in relation to their bodywe	Radio-caes ium

levels in lambs, however, approximately halved ovfe^jC^O-day period. In the light of all this information he and the Secrer  ry^f State for Wales had concluded that it would be necessary to maV  \  j  ^rder under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 prohibiti  g  fc movement and slaughter of sheep and lambs within two areas in N&lt;?&amp;*V^es and Cumbria, where high levels had also been recorded. ThisVffieii^kallow monitoring of young sheep and lambs to ensure that there

Mk


   marketing of those with a radio-caesium level above 1,000 bq/kg and that levels fell as expected. Without such an Order there was a risk that lambs would be moved out of the areas in question - for example, for fattening in the lowlands - and would not subsequently be traceable. He \ was holding a meeting that afternoon with the Ministers most concerned n to finalise the action to be taken and the intention was to lay the &apos;girder on the following day.

discussion the following points were made -

The Government should be entirely open about the problem and &lt;/\^  ould act promptly to deal with it. There was clearly a

^/a^fi&amp;tantial risk of public over-reaction to the problem, and the ^Sjieot on sales of lamb, both for home consumption and export,

  Myi \&gt;e serious; but any attempt to avoid this by suppressing inclination and delaying action would be wrong, and would be likely only to cause greater problems in the long-term.

b.	It w^W&apos;critically important to emphasise that there was no health r^ek^yrom sheepmeat already on sale in the shops and that the measUCBS^jS&amp;ing taken were cautious in the extreme. The actual consequence^oS/eating meat with high radio-caesium levels should be spelt ouV   w3KjDi.mple layman&apos;s terms. It was understood, for example, that^ap^ating meat with a radio-caesium level of

1.000	bq/kg to ^tfv  \dangerous to life it would have to be the main component of an nirthn&amp;dual1 s diet for a year. This point should be put across clearly^&gt;jid^forcefully.

c.	Despite the mos^-jia^iul presentation there was still likely to be widespread publi^^r^rm and the consequences for farmers could be serious. The&apos;^a^Sycion of compensation needed to be considered urgently.

d.	The announcement was twonpl^feo be exploited to the full by the

anti-nuclear power lobby whi    ^^i  grt.d stress that these measures were being taken as a consequCTfciJ^of a nuclear accident in a far-off country, and would use	stimulate alarm at the

potential consequences of a nuclear accident within the United Kingdom.

e.	There was an awkward problem of presentation in that-the level fixed for prohibiting imports of meat iXvfo&apos;Sohe European Community from Eastern Europe was 600 bq/kg. Thexg\wa  v however, no scientific basis for such a low level, while ^:iie level of

1.000	bq/kg had been recommended by scienrtsw^&amp;eetunder the auspices of the Euraton Treaty*

f.	Similar tests to those being undertaken ify&apos;ti^gMnd and Wales

would also be conducted in Scotland and Northern	There

could be criticism that no Restriction Order was B^a&lt;feYin respect of Scotland:	lambs came on the market much later in	than in

England and Wales.


   XHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet   ll/y	were agreed that the Government must act openly and quickly to deal with

the problem. The details of the action to be taken should be considered further that afternoon by the Ministers most concerned taking account of the points raised in discussion. Most careful consideration would need VCy)&gt;to be given to handling and presentation. In particular, the statement ^&lt;^hould make clear that all meat currently on sale in the shops was safe; ^(\fct*At tests had shown that some lambs which would not be ready for &apos;t^i^keting for several weeks might at that time conceivably have ^V%fdNcaesium levels above the very stringent safety levels adopted in tfiTa^eSuntry and that to prevent any risk of such lambs being marketed th?G0^rnment had taken extreme precautionary measures. So far as poss&lt;*&amp;Qy&gt;the facts should be presented in simple layman&apos;s language, with	illustrative examples. An oral statement should be made in

Parliam^ton the following day when the Order would be laid. A press conferen^ would follow. A simple fact sheet should be issued to backbenchers.

The Cabine^K

3.	Took&apos;^iQ^&lt;p?Ts&gt;tf*ith approval, of the Prime Minister s

summing up^  _t}jkir discussion and invited the Minister of Agricultint&apos;e^Wsheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Wal^^fejkroceed accordingly.

FOREIGN	2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMtWft^k SECRETARY said that an announcement was

AFFAIRS	expected that day that Fran^O^mk New Zealand had agreed to refer the

___	affair of the Greenpeace shiK^J%^A^ow Warrior&quot;, which had been sunk in

Relations	Auckland Harbour on 10 July lVafi^k the United Nations

between	Secretary-General for arbitraioSC/J^was possible that France and New

France	Zealand had already reached someMU^if private accommodation, which

and New	now would be blessed by the Secret^g^gsperal.

Zealand

Arms Control THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said th  Kthe General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, M/M^thail Gorbachev, had I Previous	made a speech in Moscow on 16 June in which ft^^haji^revealed some ^

Reference:	elements of recent Soviet proposals in the GeneMhn  gotiations with the

ICC(86) 23.2	United States on arms control in the fields of	weapons and

space. The Soviet Union had not published the deidiTsOof those proposals; this might be an indication of interest kplvskotiation rather than only propaganda. The central point of the SoviVt&apos;^&gt;^&gt;posals was a link between reductions in strategic arms with clarifi^^^i   f the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and agreement that neithe^si^would withdraw from that Treaty for fifteen years. This aPPro  ^^vno^ dissimilar from ideas put by the Prime Minister to the Pr&lt;atf  Mvt of the United States in February 1986. The chief United States ne^pofator in


   Geneva had authority to explore the Soviet proposals. The public [yyOS. handling of the matter by the United States as well as the Soviet Union was encouraging; the Secretary of Defense, Mr Caspar Weinberger, had Syy&apos;K not spoken out against the latest proposals. It was important that the negotiations in Geneva should now go forward; the United States response the Soviet proposals would be of major significance.

m

South Africa TH^^^SIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the South African

GovmwD&amp;nt had prevented the media from reporting events in that country previous	on lS^Me. the tenth anniversary of the riots in Soweto. The number of

Reference:	person^d^Cained on this occasion was estimated at 2,000. There had

CC(86) 23.2 been a yfery widespread one day strike by the black population. Eleven deaths hacl been reported, but there might have been more. The attitude of the South African Government to the international community was becoming increasingly belligerent. In the United Nations Security Council, the tfwited Kingdom had just joined the United States in vetoing, for bn   keeond time within a month, a resolution calling for mandatory sanctijipsHgainst South Africa. On this occasion the resolution had bA^t  &gt;pdhcerned with the South African raid against Angola on 6 June. More s^ii%5polutions were likely to be passed when South Africa carried out	neighbouring countries. France had

abstained on this occ^\  nAas on the previous one. Meanwhile, in the United States House of Reraersentatives a surprisingly far-reaching resolution had just been^ds^d, calling for a near total embargo on trade with and investmene^  u^6uth Africa. The United States Senate would no doubt take a differf^MXJposition, and the Administration still wished to resist far-reachingmeasures against South Africa.

Nevertheless, it might be moreyoWiicult than in the past for the allies of the United States to restra{f  &apos;&apos;/tjyevAdministration from accepting significant measures. When the	Affairs Council of the European

Community had met on 18 June, the	Kingdom with help from some

others had secured agreement that i^^^^cisions should then be taken to adopt measures against South Africa. A^fe^re would now be pressure in the Community itself, notably at the meet^jrfg in the following week of the European Council, and in the Commonwealth and in the United Nations for further measures. A group of Ministers was considering British policy; it was desirable to minimise confrontation at the European Council and also to preserve room for manoeuvre at the m^etriiag of certain Commonwealth Heads of Government in London	August. The

Government would work for an agreed approach amoiigythe Western industrialised countries. There would inevitab^jt^y^a period of political difficulty for the Government domes	and in foreign

relations. The presentation of the Government&apos;s p/       would be of the highest importance. The Government should make^PlVa$ its abhorrence of apartheid and draw attention to its efforts over th^/^ars in favour of reform in South Africa. The Government should sayx^Kyit wanted to see fundamental change achieved in South Africa througnv^o^g^tsiation and wanted negotiation to resume as soon as possible. The Goy^CTu^nt should point out that the United Kingdom had already taken signifAcjrpOmeasures against South Africa, indeed more than any other industrial^wj^^ountry.


   The Government should say that it was considering its position on means of helping to promote reform in South Africa.

In discussion it was pointed out that the Federal Republic of Germany was at present taking a firm position against far-reaching measures in the European Community; Portugal shared the British position, but was &lt;\y/wiot an important participant in the discussion; and Italy was not N&apos;v-^V\toopting a high profile. As for France, the President, Monsieur

vTvg^ncois Mitterrand, favoured further measures, and the Prime Minister, Jacques Chirac, who had formerly been against further measures, to be changing his position somewhat, because of pressure from the^Fw^pcophone countries in Africa and because he had been impressed byth^views of the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group. France was

adopt a position closer to that of the United Kingdom than it would&apos;Sm^under the previous Socialist Government but not necessarily an iderw^t&apos;cal position.

Supplementary THE SECRETARYkJT^TATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that the proposed Extradition Supplementary&apos;fete^ition Treaty between the United States and the Treaty	United Kingdom, wWjLearlier had been opposed by a significant number

Between the	of the members oV~^w&gt;oreign Relations Committee of the United States

United States Senate, had been	that Committee by a majority of 15 to 2. The

and the	major hurdle	on theapproval	of the Treaty by the United States

Lnited	Congress had	thus bedh ^eftessfully	passed. The Secretary of the

Kingdom	Department of Foreign	of the Irish Republic, Mr Sean Donlon, had

told him that three of 6tt  y?9Stors who had decided at the end of the Previous	day to support the Treatyv^&lt;V$teen persuaded to do so by the Irish

Reference:	Government.	This showed tKitSHihile the Government of the Irish

I CC(86) 18.2	Republic had	not been willin^i^/)^	seen to support the Treaty, it	had

not been inactive behind the	the final phase.

The Cabinet -

Took note.

COMMUNITY	3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Council of

AFFAIRS	Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on 16-17 June h^Tc^ried forward the

--	preparation for the European Council on 26   There would be

I Preparation substantial discussion	of the South African sic^atvpn and of nuclear

I for the	issues in the light	of	the accident at Chernobyi^xWere would be firm

I European	support from France	and, to a less extent, the FM^^^Republic of

I Council	Germany on the need	to	avoid a Community nuclear s4^^i^^nsPectorate   

The Council reached agreement on its response to the/aoi  PJfncement by the United States that they intended to impose unilateral^jfcjip&amp;res against some Community exports because of the assumed effect o^^^anish accession on United States cereal exports to Spain. Thl^-^^onse would consist of equivalent counter-measures if the United Stat^^N^ijI impose I	new restrictions but a determined attempt to arrive at a n\^g&lt;^^^ed


   settlement in the interim. At the Council there had also been further difficulty from the Greek Government on relations with Turkey. The Greeks would continue to make such difficulties in further discussion. The Council had, however, decided to fix a meeting of the association v Council with Turkey in September.
