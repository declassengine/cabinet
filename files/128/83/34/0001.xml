   PARyMM&amp;WTARY 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House AFFAiRav^\	Commons in the following week.

HOME AFFAIR^^a THE PRIME MINISTER said that much political capital had been made

--	/wy)e Opposition out of evidence submitted in support an application

Publication fp^Joerant from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). The of Evidence in evirJ^jice, in 17 volumes, had been compiled from submissions from local Support of an ano^tiSS*    public authorities to the Government Departments concerned and Application to had DKyn^^p-ordinated by the Department of Trade and Industry. In the European	furth  ^mce of the application for funds, the evidence had been drawn up

Regional	so as cA paint a vivid picture of need. Despite this background, the

Development documents were being represented by the opposition and media as a Fund	balanced official assessment, endorsed by the Government, of the

industrial and^g&amp;onomic situation in the regions. The volumes of evidence had fWeeii)deposited in the Library of the House of Commons and a copy sent to aiD/^Eicial Opposition spokesman on regional policy, but she understood that/they had not been considered beforehand by any Minister. She naJIPjr&amp;u in hand the preparation of a rebuttal, region by region.

In discussion the foMoS^jCa points were made -

a.	The accusatioiwfhaW the evidence contained a gloomy prognostication on r^E^raAtrends in unemployment could readily

be rebutted, as it hai^^jngly followed the usual practice in this area of making the planojiji  /assumption that there would be no change in existing level

b.	Although Opposition an^melaja attention had focussed on

particular phrases and sectiqrj  ^j&gt;f\ the evidence, other parts gave a very different picture: the figures for expenditure on infrastructure, for example, sh^we^/xhat the Government had a very good record.	vT

c.	Although, it was important that the United Kingdom as a large contributor should seek to maximisa-jts receipts from the ERDF, it was questionable, given the waXpimNwhich such funds were normally allocated, whether the evidencVkJn^sA^pport of applications had to be presented in such a highly colou/y^djiashion, or indeed in that form at all.

d.	It was suggested that the documents had i/riP^if&amp;en cleared with the Treasury even at official level.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said	clear

that the current handling arrangements for such documenc^-^M&apos;fek defective. Documents which could be interpreted as settina^oftt^ Government policies or views, and which were to be sent to&apos;Anp^Miational organisations, or to the Libraries of the Houses of Pariiamewf^Aeffc.were


   intended or likely to be made public, should be scrutinised and approved by a Minister before issue. Ministers would need to scrutinise any such &lt;^^\\documents submitted to them with careful attention. As far as the vCxAimniediate matter was concerned, it was important that all Ministers took ^/^^ytery opportunity to counter the damage that had been done. To that end vTsW&apos;Would arrange for the circulation of a fact sheet setting out the &lt;^w4^pment&apos;s record of expenditure on infrastructure.

/^il^Cabinet -

M^^^Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up ofvVng^r discussion.

2.	\^Invited Ministers in charge of Departments to ensure that documents which set out Government policies or views on a matter and which were to be sent to international organisations or to the Libraries   rjl^the Houses of Parliament, or were intended and likely to be made(pu&lt;ylic, should be scrutinised and approved by a Minister before iss^JSy^^N

Le McGoldrick THE SECRETARY OF STAT^FOR^DUCATION AND SCIENCE, said that on the Lse	previous day, Miss Maure^^ckoldrick, the Headmistress of Sudbury

Infants School, had secur&lt;^^))ruling in the High Court that the London Borough of Brent had no le^e^i^&amp;ht to continue disciplinary hearings against her concerning alleMi^pnk of racism of which she had been acquitted by the governors of^Vschool. The Council had subsequently lodged notice of appeal and the/tt^ror was therefore sub judice. It was clear, however, that the case w  re^^^j&quot;ther illustration of the deep malaise into which some Labour-co^r^H-Sd education authorities had sunk.

The Cabinet -3. Took note.

PREIGN	3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saictf/thdjf a Jordanian

pFAIRS	citizen, Mr Nezar Hindawi, was on trial in the HyRt^yOurt charged	with

attempting to introduce explosives on to an El Al	from Heathrow

| pia	Airport to Tel Aviv in order to destroy the aircraft^i^W-ight. The

trial was expected to end later that day. There was ^&quot;d^^us ive kevious	evidence, not all of which had come out in the trial, o^^J^plvement of

inference:	the Syrian authorities with Mr Hindawi. The Ministers Stas-Adlosely

fC(86) 20.3 concerned had decided on the action that should be taken&apos;^fjvwi^is	Syria

if the trial ended in a conviction. He might make an imnie^&gt;aAeJ_ statement in the House of Commons. The introduction of security measures on Syrian Arab Airlines at Heathrow Airporv^ww^. be among the measures. The United Kingdom would seek the widest fa&amp;sswti.e


   support in its actions from the other members of the European Community. There would also be representations to Arab countries, which would tend too easily to accept Syria&apos;s version of events. The threat from

&lt;V\    :rorism against United Kingdom interests worldwide would increase.

threat to British people in Lebanon would be particularly severe and of the British Embassy had already been reduced.

In^dtsy&amp;ssion, it was noted that the Government&apos;s decisions would have to h^/^jacsnsidered if the trial ended in acquittal. If it ended in convic^pran^and the defence sought leave to appeal, the Government&apos;s act ionId go ahead, subject to confirmation that the Attorney General \ikgreed.

ozambique	THE FOREIGN AN^QRMQNWEALTH SECRETARY said that the cause of the air

crash on South Afiyic^js borders on 20 October in which the President of Mozambique, Mr sSsW^achel, had been killed, was not known. There seemed to be no evi^d^&gt;of foul play and an error by the pilot was the likely explanation, /piji&apos;^oss of President Machel was a serious development for Mozamli^^^v  it would also add to the risk of instability in Southern Africa gener^diy&apos;X The Government was urging the Republic of South Africa not to take^^Kv^tage of the situation in order to encourage the Renamo guer^^W^pposition movement in Mozambique, since the consequences of such enyoo^t^ement were unpredictable and could include greater Soviet and C^aK^nvolvement in Mozambique. The likely successor to President Machel	yet known. From the point of vie^

of the West, the Foreign Minis	   aqnim Chissano, would be a

welcome choice. President Machel&lt;J^?^eral was scheduled for 28 October. Subject to the choice ja^Kjrepresentatives by other Western countries, the Minister of State,	and Commonwealth Office

(Mrs Chalker), who was well known in V^/  egion, would probably represent the Government at the funera^y^ Messages of condolence had been sent by The Queen, Princess Anne.Ahe Prime Minister and himself among others.

I	  gS

ThejPeople&apos;s THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that^JjMp^te Visit to the Republic of	People&apos;s Republic of China,	during	which he had	accfofefced The	Queen,

China	had been outstandingly successful.	The Chinese	autn^q^iQjs had	done

everything possible to show the importance they attache^^the visit.

| Previous	it had been interesting to	see how	Chinese onlookers h^a^eyome

Reference:	increasingly demonstrative	towards	The Queen as	the visn^^r^gressed.

| |CC(B6) 33.3 The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh had been very apprecia  |&amp;N^f their reception in China. The visit had underlined the value toW^h interests in China of the British-Chinese Agreement on the f^dyVjpf Hong Kong of 1984 and the extent of the opportunities for Brit^jpr^ exports in China. It was important that British exporters shoul^&gt;\&gt;


   I Vll/  	follow-up the efforts that had been made during the State Visit to

promote their interests. The representatives of the British media, who had been in China to cover the State Visit, had irresponsibly played up certain private remarks by the Duke of Edinburgh.

%

  Saudi Arabia^/CKCfOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that another example of the Wrras^onsibility of the British media with regard to the national    previous	lWej^t had been the attempt by the New Statesman and the

   Reference:	Gl^#&amp;eggyerald to publish despatches written in 1982 by the then British

IcC(86) 30.2	Ambl?i^2doA to Saudi Arabia, Sir James Craig. Action in the courts by

the Fs^r  n and Commonwealth Office to prevent publication of the despatoJyes seemed to have limited the damage to this country&apos;s relations with Saudi Arabia.

&lt;a,

|Arms Control THE FOREIGN AND (pmj)N WEALTH SECRETARY said that contacts between the

United States anstZM^^Soviet Union on arms control remained in flux and    Previous	it was not yet	jat  i the situation following the meeting in

^Reference:	Reykjavik on 11 and^f^&apos;t&amp;tober between the Soviet and United States

|CC(86) 24.2 leaders would settle v  S^n^k The continued expulsions by the United States and the Soviet UnrJ^Aof each other&apos;s diplomats were a complicating factor, ths^^rflect of which on the prospects for arms control was not clear. T      ^fii&amp;iernment should avoid criticism of the United States Government&apos;s^H  ^d^ing of these expulsions; the United Kingdom itself had experienaJs^  Vthe difficulties that were involved.

THE SECRETARY OF   TATE FOR DEF&amp;N^VSJaid that he had chaired a Ministerial meeting of the Nucle^^&apos;p^^nning Group (NPG) of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation the	s weekend. His first objective

had been to maintain the solidarit^^J^che Allies in support of the position taken by the United States   /  j5^1ent on the strategic defence initiative at the meeting Reykjavik, M^iat objective had been achieved. His second objective had been to imprest upon the United states delegation the concern of the European members of the Alliance at the idea that all nuclear weapons, or all strategi  . nuclear weapons, should be eliminated within ten years. In this, he/1rSd\\achieved limited success. During the discussions of the NPG,\fee ^Cad received support in this matter only from the Federal Republic oft  w&apos;m  Mjy. The communiqu   on the meeting had stopped short of endorsing	positions taken by

the United States at the meeting in Reykjavik. A^^  /Ahe meeting of the NPG, he had spoken to the United States Secretary &lt;rf*^fense, Mr Caspar Weinberger, to impress upon him the United Kingdom&apos;s^^^MS about the proposal for the elimination of nuclear weapons. Mr Wew^prger had understood the British arguments. In a press conferen^^^fyer the NPG meeting, Mr Weinberger had taken the more helpful positi^jo^p-a  , if major reductions were achieved in strategic nuclear weapo^^^Xf1^would be all the more important to bring conventional weapons into negotiations on arms control.	C&apos;yY/X


   in discussion, it was pointed out that the Soviet Union would be most unlikely to destroy all its nuclear weapons, even if there was a treaty J) to this effect. It would be impossible to devise verification measures &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;-^&apos;Vtwvich would enable the West to be sure that the Soviet Union had \0\^MM)lied with such a treaty. In the United States, the difficulties seeking to eliminate nuclear weapons within ten years were befeiiihing to be expressed in serious articles in the media.

IMMUNITY	4. THE FOREIG^-AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the meeting

FFAIRS	between CommuniVy&apos;jmnisters and Ministers of the group of South East

Asian countr ies^A&amp;gAN) on 20-21 October had shown the value of this | elations	link. The ASEAN M&apos;iinj  ters, in particular the Foreign Minister of

ith South	Singapore, Mr Dhah  UM0r&amp;i, had been impressive. In many respects the

ast Asian	ASEAN countries had&lt;^^i  w of world affairs similar to that of the

ountries	Western European nati^3y\ They took a robust line on issues such as the

Soviet invasion of Afj^fcn^iMtan and on Cambodia and were not easily hoodwinked by Communist wMp  ganda. Furthermore, the United Kingdom itself had a major role irf^lrauestment in the region and important commercial interests.

j |fe|:

I leeting of THE HOME SECRETARY said that the	of Interior Ministers which he

interior	had chaired on 20 October had made^^ful progress. For the first time

i linisters	there as a serious attempt by CommuT  i^i^Ministers to look at stronger

checks at the Community&apos;s external frAflpi^rs, while preserving the objective of freer movement for bona rWe travellers within the Community. In particular, there was a willingness to work together on the abuse of passports, the abuse of the right of asylum, mutual enforcement of confiscation orders relating to drug traffickers&apos; assets and co-operative use of drug liaison of f icersZ/&apos;^brd Cockfield, Vice-President of the Commission, despite th^AE^$    imPOrtance which he attached to free movement of people within the~yytfi3ynity, had been helpful.
