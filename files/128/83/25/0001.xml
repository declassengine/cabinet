   |/v//auTARY I&apos; The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House of Commons in the followin8 week*

I    	L0RD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that during the Committee Stage

focial ziWsytt   he Social Security Bill in the House of Lords the unexpected absence   Security	of the Government&apos;s supporters had led to an amendment being

I     us	1 which would have the effect of frustrating the Government&apos;s

i?reviou^	iMeatJon that everyone should pay at least 20 per cent of their

IW86) 20 2	donl^^i&gt;rates. It was quite clear that the amendment would have to be

fC^    	&apos;	overoMfedvbut there was a question of tactics whether this should be

done	House of Lords or in the House of Commons. While there was

some awantage in reversing the defeat at Report Stage in the House of Lords this would be contrary to the normal conventions of that House, gg proposed to review the matter in consultation with the Secretary of State for Social-Services and the Parliamentary Secretary, Treasury at the conclusio/yointhe Committee Stage of the Bill in the following week. This would ena^e^them to consider tactics in relation to the Bill as a whole and, in pa^I^wlar, to take account of the outcome of consideration iiVvtfi^jOjus e of Lords of the appeals mechanisms in the Bill, in which sev^T^aw Lords had shown an interest that would not be helpful to the Govei^^Sv It could be argued that by acting to frustrate a provisiori^S^s^h financial importance, the House of Lords had come close to the bo^ty of the constitutional conventions within which they operated. He^vfiowsver, preferred to think that, provided their action was not susC^WrfX it should be regarded as no more than an exercise of their acceptedas a revising chamber, to invite the House of Commons to think agAipC/

   President of	Federal Republic of Germany, Herr Do^y^on Weizsacker, would be making

   The Federal a State Visit in the following week ai^cTon Wednesday 2 July would ^    Republic of	address both Houses of Parliament. In View of the Federal Republic&apos;s

   Vuh&amp;A.	2 THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Socialist

I rfruO^	Party of Spain, led by the Prime Minister, Senor Felipe Gonzalez, had

AFFA	retained its overall majority in the general election on 22 June.

I &apos;n	Changes of policy by Senor Gonzalez&apos;s government, notably on Spanish

pain	-membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, had evidently not

previous N&quot;~^&lt;S^rmed his public position. The Popular Coalition Party, which stood on Reference:	democratic right in Spanish politics, had failed to increase its

cc(86) 17,4	seats i-n Parliament. The Social Democratic Party, led by

kyAoK\Adolfo Suarez, had made some gains.

Malaysia	THE FOKffiiiN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Mr Kevin Barlow, who

had beenvJ?orn in the United Kingdom but now had Australian citizenship, had been convicted, jointly with another Australian citizen, for trafficking in drugs in Malaysia in 1985. Sentences of death had been passed on both/^IFheir appeal had been rejected in December 1985. The British High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur had approached the Malaysian Ministry of Fobei^^ffairs in December 1985 to seek commutation of sentence on humanitarian grounds. The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Offiee-^&amp;y Renton) had reinforced this with a personal approach to the MaWrafi^. High Commissioner on 23 June 1986. The Australian GovernmenC^iid^lso been active, but the Australian Prime Minister had said pubricvV/  hat there was nothing more that the Australian Government cy&amp;ffao. Mr Barlow&apos;s lawyer was still seeking suspension of execution dmTroad filed a summons questioning aspects of the procedures in the Penatvg^P^dons Board, which had rejected the appeal. If the legal actiof^^Trad, executions could follow quickly. Every possible step had been^rtfW and would continue to be taken, but it might prove impossible to prsn^HKVthe executions.

In discussion it was noted that t^ejj^ister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, would shortly $  j  rsiting Malaysia. It would be particularly unfortunate politicall^-tfi^MrBarlow should be executed during his visit.	&apos;//y&apos;

I South Africa The Cabinet had before them the minutes of a discu^jrwp^on policy

towards South Africa in the Defence and Oversea Poli^y^J^nmittee (OD) on I Previous	the previous day. They also had before them the memo^d^Mi by the

I Reference:	Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary (OD(86) 10) on which^j&gt;^\discussion

I CC(86) 24.2	had been based, and papers by officials on aspects of tn^^fueSstion of

further measures against South Africa (OD(86) 11).


   THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that a businesslike meeting had taken place on the previous day between Mr Oliver Tambo, Acting President of the African National Congress, and the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mrs Chalker). Mrs Chalker had laid heavy stress on the need for an end to all violence in South Africa.    \She had condemned all bombing incidents in the region. Mr Tambo had Ovirged that the Western industrialised countries should introduce further &apos;^   ^knctions against South Africa; the black population were willing to ^yara^fept any effects upon their standard of living.

&apos;Ur^geoeral position in the Republic of South Africa was that, since the fai&gt;d  e of the mission of the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group (.CUfKSSffl/ there had been a strong trend towards authoritarian governraep  &gt; with many arrests and detentions and the introduction of strictorontrols on news reports.

The objectives of the Government&apos;s policy in this situation needed to be clear. They should be, first, to secure the end of apartheid through dialogue and wiSisut violence; and, second, to be seen to be acting effectively an   sensibly in the light of the universally perceived need for fundamenta^/^in^e in South Africa. The United Kingdom was widely seen as having M^J^orical connections with Southern Africa. Our economic stake in^-^&amp;Aepublic was the biggest of any other country.

Many British peopleAfl^Od there. What would happen ultimately in South Africa was not in tH^Rmiw of the British Government to decide, but the United Kingdom could inH^lnce other countries towards sensible and coherent policies on th^P^sjibXect.

Following the discussion	the previous day, a key question was

whether he should undertake^a&amp;^krly mission to South Africa. If he were to do so, it should betkjjre/^aken in his capacity as President of the Council of Ministers of th/^tfskpean Community (EC) with effect from 1 July, responding to a request op^d^pision by the European Council. It would be preferable for him to uiraejp^^ke such a mission alone, but it might be considered by some partn^^^-jtf^the EC that he should be accompanied by the Foreign Ministei^f/xlje Netherlands and of Belgium, and the preceding and succeeding PreiLd^rfts of the Council.

The aims of such a mission should be clearly and specifically related to the promotion of dialogue among the various groups in South Africa and of movement towards reform. The five objecti\fe^\set out in the Nassau declaration of October 1985 would be seen as/ief]yiing the aims of the mission. In particular, such a mission shour&lt;t3ac  3j&gt;v to bring about the release from prison of Mr Nelson Mandela and otrrerUlack leaders, and the renunciation of violence on all sides, as weij^a^ya clear declaration by the South African Government of	to end

apartheid. It would be important to obtain assuran^^^^t^v. advance from the South African Government and from the leadership^oJvtpj black communities that the mission would have proper access	South

African President, Mr P W Botha, and to Mr Mandela and &lt;^mevyblack leaders. Such a mission should not be seen as a substitut^^f&amp;s: other conclusions which would have to be reached in the EC and Commonwealth. The Government was committed in both fora to&apos;OcoJw^ider


   further measures regarding South Africa. All other members of the Commonwealth favoured significant measures. In the EC, only Portugal and, for the present, the Federal Republic of Germany, were resisting k further measures. It would be desirable if possible, at the meeting on 26-27 June of the European Council, while maintaining the commitment to O^tonsider further measures, to defer decisions on selection of measures that consultation could then take place with other important tries, notably the United States and Japan. There might, however, ^raOfSfcessure at the European Council to take decisions on an actual

of measures:	some EC countries had already taken measures on

th^rrNWn account.

A mii^y to South Africa in present circumstances would not be easy.

If it w/is/^Ih sue cess ful in producing results, that would demonstrate again traj intransigence of the South African Government. In those circumstahces the pressure for wide-ranging measures against South Africa would probably increase. In undertaking such a mission, he would need to be assured that his colleagues would be prepared to support further measur^ir&apos;i&apos;f necessary, in case the mission failed in its purpose of promoting progness in South Africa. After careful consideration of all the argumenTyy&apos;TraB judgment on balance was that he should be prepared to unde^taky^uch a mission, if the European Council asked him to do so.

At the European Counc^kOs^ere should be no controversy about the desirability of positiAre&apos;mj^&apos;Ssures to help the black population in South Africa. There was no pK#gi    iM for measures against South Africa in the field of diplomatic rela  foj)X/^As regards other types of negative measures against South Afric^O^e meeting of OD the previous day had identified some possibilitieA?^F^ would be prudent to keep some possible measures in reserve ypdItye meeting of certain Heads of Government from the Commonweal thprffvSJie beginning of August, when the United Kingdom would come under in^fl^ified pressure to adopt new measures. A voluntary ban on new inj^etment in South Africa was an example of a possible measure whicl    ffSC^ikely to be pressed harder in the Commonwealth than in the EC. Oiv\k^o&gt;fher hand, a ban on the import of gold coins from South Africa had arr^afay been adopted in the Commonwealth and could now be considered in the EC. A ban on imports of uranium from South Africa could be considered by the United Kingdom but might be opposed by other members of the EC.

In discussion of the question of a mission to/ffiou^h Africa, it was argued that the United Kingdom, when holding cfl2y^B*eidency of the European Community and with a meeting in London urfclertain Commonwealth Heads of Government in prospect, should not give&apos;^^j^appearance of being unwilling to accept the responsibility of attemptiw^^^^promote progress in South Africa. An expectation that the Foreign atvi^OTWonwealth Secretary would visit South Africa had grown up in POTlKhiMrpt and the public in this country and also in the EC. In these ci^W^ances, there would be severe disadvantages in not undertaking ro^m^tesion.

These arguments were considered on balance to outweigh tnb   

whether, following the failure of COMGEP, the time was yet^  ppJpraAine to

play the important card of a visit by the Foreign and Commonvte^itnv


   Secretary to South Africa. There was a high risk that a mission would produce little or no visible progress in South Africa. Even so, a mission would at least enable the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Government to argue that they were properly informed about the up-to-date situation in South Africa and on this basis to influence more &quot;\effectively the policy of the Western countries towards South Africa. C^jhe public presentation of the mission would be important. It should be x^Wesented clearly as an initiative of the EC and care should be taken to Ld arousing expectations of significant success.

TK^rsiklowing further points were made -

Judging from the experience of COMGEP, it might be possible voT/^Pmission to South Africa to secure the agreement of Mr Nelson M^iela to renounce violence and to work with other black leaders in^outh Africa. The mission would ask the South African President to state clearly his Government&apos;s further proposals for the dismantling of apartheid.

b.	The^udew of positive measures to help the blacks in South Africa sn&amp;TL  d&apos;&quot;M pursued. The question of costs to the United Kingdom woxkitLde&amp;d to be considered.

c.	It would tieKtfFftatly preferable at the European Council to

defer decisions&apos;^w^^y selection of negative measures against South Africa. At the sam^^wie, the Government should have in mind the risk of gaining li^i^public credit for any measures later adopted, if they apps  ?4  *.to be accepted by the Government only with great reluctancepimir&apos;^s a result of pressure from other countries.	xO/O

d.	Of the possible nega^mievteasures noted in OD, the Government could consider bans on the isrfiinct from South Africa of coal, iron and steel, gold coins and ur^nj^m. It would be difficult, with regard to a possible import bwt^flS^coal, for the Government to lay great stress on the risk of adaiy^opal unemployment in the coalmining industry in South Afi^u^rat a time when coal mines were having to be closed in this countW. The Government could also contemplate the expulsion of South African Military Attaches and a voluntary ban on new investment in South Africa; the latter measure might be more suitable for adoption in tbe^Commonwealth. Any measures identified at the European Coun^il^hould be put to the United States and Japan.

e.	The United Kingdom should argue strongi-^xiythe European Council against a ban on the import of Southfruit, vegetables and wine. This measure would damag  ^^wp  l farmers and black farmworkers in South Africa; might provokeSoi^ra African retaliation against British exports of whisky; dey  %r^the British merchant shipping industry of some of its business vrami)(given the heavy dependence of the British market on South Af r r&amp;ajKJ^Ltrus fruit between July and September) bring disadvantages\^^jpritish consumers including some seasonal effect on the Retailx&amp;ofielndex.


   v&apos;]t/3&gt;s	f. The question of introducing a visa requirement for South

Africans needed further discussion between the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Home Secretary, with regard particularly to the possibility that a visa regime might in due \Cji)	course be needed for certain countries in West Africa and should

not be seen as having punitive overtones.

r/y)&apos;	g. Sales of strategic metals from the stockpile managed by the

partment of Trade and Industry had ceased. Officials had been true ted to consider the future of the stockpile, in line with conclusions of OD the previous day.

THE piaML-SXNISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet agreecR^rat the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should be willing to undertaR^ a European mission to South Africa in the coming weeks, if he was asked by the European Council to do so, preferably on his own but if necessary with the Foreign Ministers of the Netherlands and Belgium.

The purpose of/fEfe, mission would be to promote dialogue and reform in South Africa.{(On^)advantage would be to gain an up-to-date first-hand knowledge of th^Xiiivation in South Africa, which would enhance the authority of thef^oySrnment1s views on the subject. The presentation of the mission woulcSfe^aiportant; hopes of major progress in South Africa should be discoura^eo^^t the European Council on 26-27 June, she and the Foreign and ConrarorfireS^h Secretary would argue for positive measures to help the black popiflMi#p in South Africa, and would seek to defer decisions on selecting	measures. In any discussion of a

selection of measure, sh^&lt;and)the British delegation would be guided by the discussion at this mee   fca2*&amp;&apos;\

The Cabinet -

2.	Took note, with appro^al^^ the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of the discussioiW^^^^

3.	Invited the Foreign and COTifiwiwealth Secretary, subject to the discussion at theVJW&apos;opean Council, to be prepared to seek to arrange a Session to South Africa during July, in his capacity as President of the Council of Ministers of the European Community.

4.	Invited the Foreign and Commonwealoy^Sa^retary and the Home Secretary to consider further tJ^cf&amp;eation of a visa requirement for South Africans.

\

    COMMUNITY	3. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that the^&amp;wjilts of the

I AFFAIRS	Council of Ministers (Transport) on 18   19 June had beeu^W^aopointing.

There had been little progress on aviation and shipping/^lQ^Nudgment

   	Transport	was that the prospects for significant forward movement on^a&gt;^^^ion in

the Council during the United Kingdom Presidency were not gW&amp;^yThe prospects on some aspects on shipping were better but the reiiVj^afifce of


   some member states to the liberalisation of cabotage remained strong, v More progress on the liberalisation of road transport was possible but,

/s because of poor chairmanship, this had not been achieved at this &apos;Vv\ Council. The Presidency had caused particular difficulties for the yy&gt;vUnited Kingdom by threatening to press to a vote a question of axle    &quot;^V&apos;yeights within a package of road transport measures. He had resisted \\VfcflsLs. At the resumed meeting on 30 June he would agree on axle weights on condition that the United Kingdom&apos;s current maximum axle weight /Jh&amp;fod continue under a derogation which could only be changed by Yynty, as was already the case for lorry weights. In discussion it was	that the European Court of Justice had already decided that the

com        pbn rules of the Treaty applied in the aviation sector.

Althovrett&apos;fci&gt;is question was not clear-cut, there might be a prospect of using     is judgment in order to further our objective of greater liberal action. On cabotage it was highly unsatisfactory that, while the United Kindom did not impose restrictions on othe member states, some of those member states retained restrictions against the United Kingdom shippii  pS&gt;ndustry. It might be necessary for the United Kingdom to take countef m^sures by equivalent restrictions but we should first obtain the otnBJ^/^Jw^ping measures of value to the United Kingdom which were now under discussion and decide whether we could get our way on cabotage through ^S^Epropean Court of Justice or by other means. The Secretary of State^fot^^ansport would make available for the Prime Minister for the Eurx&gt;wil^Council a briefing note on the restrictive attitudes of certain memoe*^states on aviation and shipping cabotage.
