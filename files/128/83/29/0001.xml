I6  1	had	i t possible for the House of Commons to rise for the Summer

  Previous	Adj  S^S?nt on the following day.

|c(86^28]2 THE LCMffl^PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the House of Lords would considerv&gt;the House of Commons amendments to the Social Security Bill that afternoon. A three-line whip was being imposed - a rare occurence in the House of Lords - and he would open the debate himself. He was hopeful that trf&gt;  -^l.ouse would accept the Commons amendments.

The House of Lb^d^^ilould rise for the Summer Adjournment at the end of the following wei&amp;lc^aAA return on Monday 6 October. The Financial Services Bill, th^^Sysing and Planning Bill and the Public Order Bill were the most importglw^iterns of business still remaining.

lb

  Rover Group	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOk^fc^E AND INDUSTRY said that he would be

  formerly	making a statement that afh&amp;rttofrn on the proposed sale of Unipart -	the

   British	Rover Group&apos;s parts distribu^OTA^&gt;mpany - and Leyland Bus. As far	as

Ley land)	Unipart was concerned, the Rover^iioup Board had recommended to the

Government acceptance of an ofrer^ji^a management consortium supported [Previous	by United Kingdom investment in^itj^Sons which would take a 75 per	cent

Reference:	share in the company. The Board	recommended acceptance of	the

ICC(86) 17.6 bid by a management buy out consorrt&apos;5yo  :ked by finance from investment institutions for Leyland Bus. Followorfyaiscussion with colleagues most concerned it had been decided to accep^both recommendations, that on Leyland Bus subject to negotiations of satisfactory terms. Although some redundancies were inevitable in Leyland Bus he thought that the decision would be popular with the Government^-s^supporters and that the official Opposition would have difficulty ip/^6p^sing it.

    Ordnance pic statement that afternoon on the sale of the Royal OMti^rete factory in

I	the minister of state, foreign and commonwealth office (baroness

I ~IZ Africa Bc^ki^juid the Foreign Minister, Mr Pik Botha. It had been confirmed    South A	thaS^Would have a further meeting with President Botha on 29 July.

I	He iiIV%d  a to report to Cabinet on 31 July on his various discussions

thence-	in SodihSrn Africa. The position so far could be summarised by saying

IcriL) 28 3 that th&amp;Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s task was a far from easy I	   	^ but that the ball was still in play as his discussions continued.

In a brief dix^o^sion, it was noted that there would probably be pressure in tfife     use of Lords, which would continue to sit until 31 july} for	t on the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary s

visit to Southei^Ai^ica.

In a brief discus sicMK^\the Commonwealth Games, which would start that day in Edinburgh, iV^^\hoted that 31 countries had withdrawn and 26 would take part. The nAfer of athletes who had withdrawn was only some 800 to 900, and the nu*iJ&gt;^^articipating would still be over 2,000.

This was almost the samkfaUfX as at the previous Commonwealth Games m Brisbane in 1984, which	the highest participation ever.

I

   	Turks and	THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN   NtTepMMONWEALTH OFFICE said that leaders

I Caicos Islands of other Caribbean countries were&lt;S^sa informed of the steps which the

Government would be taking followifc^e^eport by Mr L J Blom-Cooper

   	Previous	QC on the administration of governme&amp;K*h the Turks and Caicos Islands.

    Reference:	The Governor of the territory had ma&lt;f   arrangements to inform Ministers

ICC(86) 28.3	there later that day. The statement in the House of Commons, which she

had hoped would take place that day, would now take place on the morning of the following day, the first Parliamentari-opportunity after the Governor had informed Ministers in the Turk^/antt Caicos Islands. Failure to make an oral statement would be criticis^^b^Garibbean countries as inappropriate on a matter of constitutional infoferfldnce. Opposition leaders had been informed in confidence that tKg^^ould be an oral statement, and the Opposition in the House of Co^^ould be likely to express understanding for the Government s decis iq^ra^o^^

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thX^^he Cabinet agreed that the arrangements that the Governor of	and Caicos

Islands should speak to Ministers there on that day	oral

   	&apos;   k j	match were planned by Sikh organisations in Britain to take

plac	yde Park on 2 August, the day before the arrival in London of

the Pr^e^ninister of India, Mr Rajiv Gandhi, for the Commonwealth Review Treeting on South Africa. This could cause Mr Gandhi to take offence.^

In discussion, it was pointed out that the rally had been moved from Trafalgar Squ^   ~^p Hyde Park. Its taking place there could be banned only if, in tr&amp;ZvV^w of the police, it was likely to lead to public disorder. The	the police was that the rally was not likely to

cause disorder;	there might be greater disorder if attempts were

made to prevent it^f6fcLif it took place before Mr Gandhi&apos;s arrival there might be a redw  ^Visk of Sikh demonstrations against him during

his visit.

THE PRIME MINISTER, sum^rfr^yp the discussion, said that it was unlikely that the Government woula\b  ^ble to take action to prevent this rally but that contact should be jrfarf^with the organisers to see whether they would reconsider their plaril\j^^

The Cabinet -

2.	Invited the Home Secreta^^and the Minister of State, Foreign and Commomi^a^^^Office to investigate further whether theN&amp;fr^jrnment could take any action, on the lines in&apos;&amp;ie&apos;ated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.	v

I Immigration	THE HOME SECRETARY said that large numbers oKJJj^Stuans continued to

   	Controls at	arrive at London Airport, so that the strain orUtW/immigration services

   	London	remained serious. Efforts had been made to disaugi&amp;ythe Nigerian

I Airport	authorities from sending as many people to this c^u/i^^as had arrived

in the previous week.

I Previous

I Reference:	In discussion, it was noted that action could be takeq^^^yitch

   	CC(86) 28.3	arrivals of flights from Nigeria from London Airport t^UHsted

Airport, where this would be helpful to the immigrationNiagS&amp;es. There was a possibility that the number of Nigerians coming to ^j^p  Ated


   Kingdom would decline after the price of tickets for such flights went up on 1 August.

   y

gx&apos;c0	CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the debt problems of Mexico

&apos;yOWd&apos;salready been serious before the recent drop in the oil price and had /ra^r^compounded by that development. There had been protracted neg  Kvations between Mexico and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) ana tM International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

Agrraarg^ in principle had been reached on the previous day and Mexico had sm(e(ha letter of intent. The arrangements should contain the problem^&apos;in the short and medium term. There would be a contribution of $1.5 billion from the IMF, geared to the price of oil; if that price fell further, the IMF contribution would increase, and if it rose the contribution would become less. Because of Mexico&apos;s serious cash position, there^Jwid also been discussion about an international bridging loan, to ease}Mexico1s difficulties until the money from the IMF became available. TV&amp;-NlrftJ&gt;?d Kingdom was willing to participate with other countries in sucf/a )yoan. It seemed likely that the negotiations on these arrangements   -wrjuid be concluded within a matter of days, but after the House of Commofvs/tial^risen for the Summer Recess.
