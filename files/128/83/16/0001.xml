PARLIAMENTAft  ^  / The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House AFFAIRS	^&apos;yqtf^&amp;Hnmons in the following week.

TltiLP&amp;D PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that it was clear that from the pre^fy^jrotil the end of the Session there would be considerable congVsiXoV.of business in the House of Lords as they began to deal with the mayp^part of the legislative programme. The difficulties were such that heM^ad had to take the exceptional step of arranging an important debate orr Libya for a Friday. Opposition Leaders in the House of Lords had agreed to that, and that there should not be a vote at the conclusion of tjie^debate.

The Cabini^^^

FOREIGN	3. THE FOREIGN AND COmQMiEMJIft SECRETARY said that, since the debate

AFFAIRS	in the House of Commons oiK  j&gt;^krevious day about the United States

--	military action against Lib^i^orrOl4 April, there were several

Libya	significant developments to	The residence in West Beirut of the

British Ambassador in Lebanon Tfa^^ftat morning been attacked by rocket Previous	propelled grenades. The building&apos;ti^KjSbeen damaged but none of the staff

Reference:	had been injured. There were repots, &gt;  pt yet definitely confirmed, that

CC(86) 15.1 three bodies found in the hills aboyjpBgjLrut were those of the two British teachers, Mr Douglas and Mr	.d, who had recently been

kidnapped with Libyan involvement, anc^oi^m Irish hostage. There was a report that two British citizens had bMn detained in Benghazi. A girl had that morning been arrested at Heathrow Airport trying to smuggle explosives on to an Israeli aircraft bound for Tel Aviv. Following the various reports on the previous day of a militarymutiny in Libya, the Head of State, Colonel Qadhafi, had appeared ctfvlf&amp;kevision. Tripoli was quiet. The airport had reopened. The authoriWie^h^d said that foreigners wishing to leave the country would rec^iv^jexit visas.

The Italian Government, whose Embassy looked after	interests in

Libya, was privately advising Italian citizens there/M    &amp;^ave the country. The Government should consider whether to fa^ror^uit. The Government should also consider whether to allow the resuj*J$fci,on of air traffic between Libya and the United Kingdom. The next   wainArab Airlines flight to London was due on the following day ana^a^K^htish Caledonian Airways flight to Libya was due on 19 April.


   THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had that morning attended a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the 12 member countries \ of the European Community (EC) to discuss Libyan involvement in 0&apos;state-sponsored terrorism. At the meeting there had been implicit

tic ism of the United States military action against Libya but none of r&apos;Sh^use of United States bases in the United Kingdom. He had made clear when attending the previous meeting of EC Foreign Ministers on Ta/Apivil, he had not had confirmation of the United States decision to tafceOmilitary action. There was a growing feeling among EC Governments thd^thshould take non-military steps, if possible with the support of m&lt;$i  iAhe Arab Governments, against state-sponsored terrorism. While some	Ministers still seemed to think it enough to make

speeche^ri^the subject, France and the Irish Republic were increasingly willing agree with the United Kingdom that actual steps must be taken against Libyan involvement in terrorism. He had arranged for other Community Governments to receive more of the intelligence about Libyan involvement in texrorism. He had argued that Libyan People&apos;s Bureaux were command ce^Y^f for terrorism and that action against them was essential. ThdAsei^tity Directors of EC Foreign Ministries had produced a helpful&quot; reportpif^^ate-sponsored terrorism, identifying the countries that were involve^a^fl^uggesting a graduated series of possible measures in respons^^ia Foreign Ministers would meet again on

Warn vk.

In discussion the followip^S^^ints were made -

There was consiQ^tiwii^ unease m public opinion about the military action takenT^kf^ Uni ted States and the use of United States aircraft based iT&amp;t^SQnited Kingdom. But the level of public protest would prolmanageable.

b. Any aircraft flying toa^Xrom Libya would be subject to special security precautions&lt;&apos;at^  itish airports. Additional precautions were already bein^gipjrijfted in the case of flights to and from other places in the Hi&amp;ByrE&amp;st. One argument for resuming air services to Libya wA^d make transport available for British citizens there who wishedN  o depart. Against that, there could be a risk that British aircraft could be detained by Libyan authorities or that British citizens travelling on Libyan flights might be maltreated. British citizens might.be able to leave Libya on flights to other places in Western EurApeU It might also be possible to lay on special flights from	Tunisia for

British citizens who managed to cross the fmonyyer from Libya into either country. The question of resuming	to Libya should

be seen in the wider context of the Governmen&lt;^Wicy on commercial links of all kinds with Libya.	V&apos;xVv

c. Urgent consideration was being given to the

deporting to Libya a number of Libyans resident in ^C*Oy1   &apos;te&lt;*

Kingdom who were known to be active on behalf of

Government. Policy on Libyans resident in the United	had,

since the St James&apos;s Square siege in 1984, been that eA^h^dafee should be handled on its individual merits.


   (j&gt; The Libyans being trained in the United Kingdom in aircraft maintenance, of whom there were at least 280, and those being trained as pilots, numbering at least 25, formed a special category among Libyans resident in this country. Special precautions had been taken with regard to the aircraft maintenance trainees. The airlines which were training them believed that there was no risk * 0f their tampering with aircraft. But it was difficult to be Absolutely certain that there would be no tampering. It would be x^ragic if a terrorist incident resulted. In the case of the

nee pilots, the main risk was that they could become military

on return to Libya.

e.Wallowing the United States action against Libya, there might be wybetter chance of persuading other countries to take non-military measures to deter Libya from sponsoring terrorism. A major United Kingdom initiative, suggesting a package of measures, would have ixcpspects of producing some results. It would also be welcomed K^^mblic opinion in the United Kingdom. Such an initiativaNmi&apos;gLt comprise measures which the United Kingdom had taken, or willing to take, provided that other countries did the same; atfj^  6  tfier measures which the United Kingdom would take

in any case.

f Such an init^diu^e should be advanced not only at the meeting of EC Foreign MinisXj&amp;xm 21 April but also at the &quot;Trevi&quot; meeting of Ministers on Honi^f^irs of Community countries m the following week.

g.	It was suggested ft  aV^ much information as possible should b^ published on Libyan wfrdAment in terrorism, subject to the need not to publish intell/^nSh information, the disclosure of which could endanger lives ox^O^promise sources. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland w%u^  e making a speech about Libyan support for the terrorism of M^HHfovisional Irish Republican Army. Copies would be circulated to cdyyagyes. A note should also be prepared giving the number of dem? as a result of terrorist incidents, so that it could be co%red with the number of casualties likely to have been caused by the United States military action against Libya. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary would be placing in the Whips&apos; Office a letter   wing a list of terrorist incidents in which Libya had been involved. ^Public statements by Colonel Qadhafi about support for terrorV^m^rirauld be quoted.

h.	The American public reaction had been v2Sj$xi^able, and the United States Administration probably did notv#&amp;  &gt;se the extent o the political difficulties which the GovernmenO^gAfacmg as a result of supporting the United States action a^^Libya. This difference needed to be made clear to the Administryptefr* The opportunity should also be used to seek more Unit^^Jes support on issues of importance to the United Kingdom. One^^^Je might be the proposed Supplementary Extradition Treaty betw^^hfre United Kingdom and the United States; but on this the Admin ls^aj^n had been active in support and the difficulties lay among t /  /Ts.


   Democratic members of Congress. It was also necessary to continue to stress to the United States that the only legal justification for the action against Libya was the inherent right of   1	self-defence. The Administration would undermine its case if it

described the action as retribution or retaliation.

V VC/ i. It was clearly understood between the Prime Minister and

President Reagan that, if there were any question of using United JeWtes aircraft based in the United Kingdom in a further action, would be the subject of a new United States approach to the /yfeprninsnt under the Truman/Churchill understanding of 1952. It clear that the conditions for British acquiescence in aTKycji^? military action by the United States against Libya at prd&amp;^nt existed.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that everything possible should be done to minimise the risk of terrorist attacks against Britisly^itiiserests in this period of greater threat. The Libyans undergoing training/ in aircraft maintenance in this country should immediately be rebi  &gt;v  3!i from work on aircraft. Urgent consideration should be given tb^WajJOsition of the Libyans being given pilot training. It woullM^xielpful both substantively and in public presentation if theMjn^2d Kingdom made a major public initiative about non-military moves	Libya from further promotion of terrorism.

The Cabinet -

1.	Took note, with aw  r^val of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their dis^urQ6jpen.

2.	Invited the Foreign a^r^Ex/mmonwealth Secretary to arrange for the preparariop^f a new British initiative advocating non-mi^ftart measures by the international community again^^fcarte-sponsored terrorism.

3.	Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Secretary of State for Transport to consider further whether airline services with Libya should be resumed.

4.	Invited the Foreign and Commonwealtxk_S^pC  tary and the Home Secretary, in consultation as/y   chssary with other colleagues, to consider policy

Libyan nationals resident in the United King

5.	Invited the Secretary of State for Transpi

to arrange for Libyan trainees in aircraft maintenap^-. to be removed immediately from work on aircraft; review, with colleagues as appropriate, the future handling of those trainees; and to review the position^O\ of Libyan trainee pilots in the United Kingdom.


   ^Zk2\	6. Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary

to ensure that the United States Administration recognised the political difficulties which the yy^\	Government faced as a result of their support for

the United States action against Libya; and to urge the United States Administration to justify that action on the basis of self-defence.

Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary arrange for information for public use about the ^  diners of casualties from terrorism to be circulated M  ri  5tly to colleagues.

COMMUNITY	4. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that, following

AFFAIRS	the realignment^Jivcurrencies within the European Monetary System, the

way was open fop tM    French Government to allow their farmers higher Agriculture prices in natidia4^  3Krency terms even if there was no Community price

rise in ecu termsTOis might reduce the French determination to obtain Previous	a Community priceN^wK^ There would be pressure in the Community during

Reference:	the following week	rice settlement to be achieved quickly,

CC(86) 8.3 possibly by the veeV.e/^^^26 April. There would be discussion of

various aspects which	arm British interests and the Government

would need to consider th  j  \ery carefully. It would also be necessary to keep devaluation of gr^nJtWrencies in the wake of the realignment in the European Monetary	the minimum; but it would be

important to avoid the appe^fei^Vof discrimination against British farmers.
