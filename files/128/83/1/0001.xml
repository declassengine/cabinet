ll	The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House | ^	of Commons in the week beginning 13 January.

WESTLAND	THE PRIME MINISTER invited the Cabinet to consider further

   ^d^/elopments since their last discussion of the situation created by the Previous	frwkncial difficulties of Westland pic.

Reference:	,, .

|c(85) 37th	Tjie   ^Vernment had decided long ago not to put public money into

fconclusions,	Weq^arai, apart from writing off launch aid on the W30-300 helicopter

Minute 1	but j^^Tgave the company to find its own solution to its problems

throu;giFj  ne market.

When th^d5abinet discussed the matter on 19 December 1985, there were two proposals on the table for a financial reconstruction of Westland (not a takeover) involving either United Technologies and Fiat or a European consortium taking a minority shareholding in Westland. At that meeting the Cabitreis had agreed that it remained the policy of the Government thaci itywas for the company to decide what was the best course to follo^iir&apos;ilae interests of Westland and its employees, and it had agreed that, vijWflAthat that was the Government&apos;s policy, no Minister was entitEroytro* lobby in favour of one proposal rather another and that information	the implications of defence procurement for

Westland&apos;s workload slii^C^e made equally available to both groups as well as to Westland and n^^^ankers, and questions on the subject should not be answered in any v^ri^if&amp;ch favoured one group or proposal rather than another. She had an^jygjrtjtaquestions in the House of Commons on 19 December 1985 accordingtv^uflKhad written to the Chairman of Westland on 1 January 1986 a letter^Ath^bext of which had been agreed with the Departments concerned, in ^  iop^ance with those decisions.

Members of the Cabinet knew what ha$  %appened since then. Comment and headlines in the newspapers, inclolijj*^those normally favourable to the Government, had been extremely damd^wr^ The Government had entered the New Year in a way very harmful to tne\tt^j*fation of the Cabinet and to the public esteem in which the Governm^d^was held, just at the time when there were signs of a recovery in&apos;^ie Government&apos;s political fortunes. If the situation continued the Government would have no credibility left. She had never seen a clearer demonstration of the damaging consequences that ensued for the cohe^^i&gt;ce and standing of a Government when the principle of collective responsibility was not observed. It was essential now to restore theC3C^53ing of the Government and to reassert the collective respoi^bMity of Ministers for the decisions of Government. The Cabinet snov&amp;jrjvgT ee to observe in full the conclusions agreed at their meeting on	   

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said

19 December revised proposals had been put to Westland ^y^wth the United Technologies-Fiat and the European consortia. Ir^acMcase the new proposals were an improvement on their previous pro?tf*a  sv\Each involved the consortium concerned taking a minority sharehWwiJpy.n Westland. The board of directors at Westland were recommeno^^y^^

I	m


   acceptance of the United Technologies-Fiat proposal. He himself had continued to emphasise that it was for the board of directors to recommend and the shareholders of the company to decide what course should be followed. The European consortium had put their proposals ^forward direct to the shareholders of Westland. At their meeting on 14   ^/^anuary 1986 the Westland shareholders would have three resolutions to /^ToJisider;

PPjjf

the first to increase the company&apos;s borrowing limits., which ^   ^^^guired a simple majority; and

yyC the second and third to give effect to the United ^igoiift&amp;logies-Fiat reconstruction proposals which would require a 75 peV/cj^t majority.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he had very little to add. He had put his views to colleagues as clearly as he could. At the meeting of Cabinet on 19 December he had said that developments could take place whicto^wbuld call for a view to be taken by the Government. Those developma/ts$ad taken place. The situation had, however, changed when the ChairmaSb^^ilestland had made recommendations to the shareholders. Aft^r^^hat had happened, the Government clearly could not intervene. What wbirf^Be the outcome of the shareholders&apos; meeting on 14 January was uncen#s2\In the meantime he would watch developments; he had no intention oVjee^&apos;iNiring himself publicly in favour of one proposal or the otherj^tnm^J   he would continue to answer questions about procurement policywere asked. It would be very important that anything that was saiA^tJ/^he media after this meeting of the Cabinet should not be seen a-s^t^ning towards one side or another in the Westland affair; otherwise thVvreyation to which the Prime Minister had drawn attention would continue^^Cne Government stand must be one of complete neutrality, to the effe/t there was nothing to add and that it was now a matter for the&apos;^shapa^olders of Westland. It was most important for the Government now 6o pp^itself above the battle and to distance itself from the issues to l$  ^jdeiN.ded. No attempt should be made to steer press comment. In tharyay^it might be possible to create a situation in which decisions could b^  ken by the company. If the decision of the Cabinet was simply to reaffirm their conclusions of 19 December, as repeated by the Prime Minister in introducing the discussion, and that was the indication which came out from the meeting, it would look as if the Cabinet was backing the^fe&lt;*ard of directors of Westland.	(vv

In discussion the question was raised what would /happen if there was not a 75 per cent majority at the shareholders meetiirg^Mfr&lt;^4 January for the United Technologies-Fiat proposal. THE SECRETARY	FOR DEFENCE

said that there was a certain anxiety that the sharel(p^a^s of Westland were being given only one choice. The Europam^ocwsortium proposed to have documents available which could be put	the

meeting of shareholders at once, if the recommendations inrtjw board of directors on the United Technologies-Fiat proposal did notv^^p^ve a 75 per cent majority. There need therefore be no question of Of&amp;^wmpany going into receivership provided that solicitors representing^Jf^^Eland


   did not deny solicitors representing the Europan consortium access to the appropriate information. If there was not a 75 per cent majority in favour of either proposal, or if 10 per cent of those present sought a delay then decisions might be delayed until a further Extraordinary \ General Meeting. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said 7&gt;&lt;hat he understood that, if the resolutions proposed by the board of directors in favour of United Technologies-Fiat proposal did not receive support of a 75 per cent majority, United Technologies and Fiat

not then be bound by their agreement with Westland and it would be the board of directors of Westland to put forward whatever pro^aivi they thought fit to the shareholders.

The&amp;&lt;a/)general agreement that the time had now come to put aside what had haSoeo^d to leave it to the company to conduct negotiations with the twc&amp;iSnsortia and to reach their decisions, and for the Government to disengage from the issue. It would be important to demonstrate a determination to re-establish the credibility and coherence of the Cabine t.

THE PRIME MINl/inElvsuggested to the Cabinet that the time had now come for the companj^^fs bankers to be left to deal with representatives from the two conibrdL and to come to their decisions without any further interventh^/irectly or indirectly, by Ministers or by other people acting on tM^&amp;half. That must be accepted and observed by everyone and there	lobbying or briefing directly or

indirectly. Because 5i^h)e&gt;risks of misrepresentation., during this p^iod of&apos;sensitive cow&amp;Z&amp;l negotiations and decisions answers to quest ions should be clea  d3ikerdepartmentally through the Cabinet Office, so as to ensure ttfart^^answers given were fully consistent with the policy of the GovexiJwks

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEraM^Wid that it would be impossible to clear everv answer through the	Office. He did not envisage

making anv&apos; new statements. If aif^n^statements needed to be mad?, he would be ready to clear them colle&lt;H^. If, however, he was asked to confirm statements which he had alrl^made, it could create an extremely difficult situation, Partic^?y for the European consortium if he were not able to confirm them wiVkout delay. Any delay would give the impression of hesitation or uncertainty which could prejudice the commercial situation. Equally, if he were asked a question of fact about procurement requirements, he needed to b^hle to reP y W1 delay once again, any delay in answering in	consult would give

the impression of hesitation or of uncertainfuture policy.

In further discussion the following points were TKSJ&amp;O

a it should be possible to answer further qu^^^S procurement matters by reference to the Prime	indication

in the House of Commons on 19 December 1985 that m/%fc$.ssxies of procurement policy were for collective decision by ^^overnment;

b.	it was highly desirable that so far as possible a^^^tions to the Government which arose between now and the meet


   Westland shareholders should be answered by reference to statements already on the record and an indication that there was nothing to add. It was suggested, however, that even so it might be necessary to consider whether answers already given were still completely \	appropriate in present circumstances: it was not unreasonable that

))	a short time should be taken to reflect, even on an answer that had

already been	given. It should	be possible to	ensure collective

&lt;\&gt;&gt;&gt;	agreement on	any answers that	had to be given	between now and the

V/i/ ,late of the shareholders&apos; meeting; matters could be considered //^Oogain in the	light of the new	situation after	that meeting..

  O Some of	the difficulties	of dealing with	questions that called

onfirmation of existing statements or replies and of

difficult questions could be dealt with by the pp&amp;M?ation and interdepartmental agreement of an agreed fact sheet or&apos;  Tlist of possible questions and answers which could be used as a source for the preparation of answers to actual questions.

THE SECRETARY OP-STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he did not want at this stage to comm&lt;  ti  blicly on the situation that might arise after the meeting of th&lt;i^jiirt5holders and he would have no Problem about seeking agreement to anyf^ns^br that might be called for about that. He was, however concern^C^fr^t the period between now and the meeting of the shareholders on 14Va&amp;i&gt;4*v. The proposals of the European consortium rested in part on sti&amp;rffefcts which he had made, all of which had been circulated to colleag&amp;^^i f there was any suggestion that these statements were in questi^Xthat could be material to the decisions taken by the shareholder^}\ would not be acceptable to have a position in which delay i  ^&amp;&amp;ring could be a weapon to be used to the disadvantage of one side or&lt;V%^  her. He did not believe that it could be constitutionally right fo^a^partmental Minister to be obliged to clear interdepartmentally thrM$^% Cabinet Office replies on matters which fell within his Minister&amp;f responsibility. He was prepared to clear collectively any new staten^tfts^hich he might be called upon to make but he must be able to confi^^Ahout the delay implicit m the requirement to consult any statemenC^feady made. He would be ready to inform the Cabinet Office of any answ^W^hich he gave on that basis.

In discussion other members of the Cabitet considered that, in the especially sensitive period between now and the meeting of shareholders, it was of paramount importance to maintain the  overnment&apos;s decision that the matter should be left to the sharehwithout Government intervention and to ensure that all Governmeii^k^rpa^uncements were consistent with that decision. That made it neO^i^Vy to adopt a procedure of interdepartmental clearance even ld^c^Wt of confirmation of statements already made or replies already givq^^me statements which had already been made had appeared to be exjp^gg^r conflicting as between one Minister and another: in these circum^^dds the confirmation of a given response could oblige another

reassert a different position and the appearance of Go*6rtnfiAht disunity would continue.&apos; It was now necessary that all statement&gt;^^eplies by members of the Government on this matter should be cleared^OANX interdepartmentally through the Cabinet Office until af ter&apos;^^^e t ing


   of shareholders. Only that would ensure the restoration and maintenance of collective responsibility.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet \ agreed that it was for the company to decide what was the best course to /follow in the interests of Westland and its employees; that the time had come for the company and its bankers to be left to deal with wRepresentatives of the two consortia and to come to their decisions,

ut any further intervention, directly or indirectly, by Ministers o^^D^other people acting on their behalf. The Cabinet also agreed tha^fHi the interest of ensuring adherence to that decision and of restpa^rnje and maintaining collective responsibility of the Government, dur ir w particularly sensitive period of commercial negotiations and dec is ion/^hich lay ahead all statements or replies by members of the Governmatfy^ in relation to Westland, including replies which confirmed statement^ already made, should be cleared with the Departments concerned through the Cabinet Office. Consideration should also be given to the preparation under Cabinet Office auspices of an interdepartment^HV agreed fact sheet which could be drawn upon as a source of answers vo questions.

THE SECRETARY OF (  M^ZE^FOR DEFENCE said that there had been no collective respons^tt^iytY in the discussion of this matter. There had been a breakdown invtJVe  ^p^opriety of Cabinet discussions. He could not accept the decision raemi&amp;&amp;1 in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up. He must therefore leave this^^fc&gt;inet.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FCfiKj)J5  kNCE withdrew from the meeting at that point.

The Cabinet -

1.	Took note, with approvalhe Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of the discussion.

2. Reaffirmed that it was the pM^cy^of the Government that it was for the company to decide what wa^^tie best course to follow in the interests of Westland and its emplwees, and that the time had now come for the company and its bankers to be left to deal with representatives of the two consortia and to make their decisions without any further intervention, directlv^-wr indirectly, by Ministers or by other people acting on tifeir))&gt;ehalf.

3.	Agreed that all statements or replies bw^meM&gt;ers of the Government on matters relating to Westland o&amp;Eween now and the meeting of shareholders on 14 January should SeAU^ifered interdepartmentally through the Cabinet Office,C^irf  wiat consideration should be given to the preparation^ol&amp;afk agreed fact sheet on the lines indicated in the Prime Ministeri^^^ming up.

4.	Invited the Secretary of the Cabinet to make the&apos;Sup^skements necessary to give effect to that decision.

S Took note, with extreme regret, of the decision by the Secretary of State for Defence to leave the Cabinet.

The Cabinet proceeded to consider Foreign Affairs, Community Affairs and j) Northern Ireland Affairs (see Minutes 3, 4, and 5). The meeting was &apos;&lt;^^  hen adjourned for half an hour. When the meeting resumed after the w^^iWiournment, the Prime Minister said that Mr Heseltine had informed the \i&gt;  iifss as he left 10 Downing Street that he had resigned from the ^&apos;G^p^roment. Guidance was being given to the press on the following

^Jjh  \Cabinet have reaffirmed that it is the policy of the ^wrnment that it is for the company to decide what course to

in the best interest of Westland and its employees. Cabinet dismissed how this decision should apply in practice to ensure that collective responsibility was upheld. It was agreed that during this period when sensitive commercial negotiations were in process, all statemeaj^s by Government Ministers should be cleared interdepa/Ctfneintally through the Cabinet Office to ensure that all answers	the Government were consistent with the policy

decided by OaSinet.

Mr Heseltine f^imfl^imself unable to accept this procedure and left the Cabinet. Tna/wime Minister expressed her regret at his decision&quot;.

THE PRIME MINISTER inforliM^rme Cabinet that The Queen had approved the appointment of the Rt HonxJ  &gt;Mh. Younger MP to be Secretary of State for Defence and Mr Malcolm RifkradSM^ to be Secretary of State for Scotland.

FOREIGN	3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that it was almost

aFFAIRS	certain that the terrorist attacks at the airports at Rome and Vienna on

I  	27 December 1985 had been carried out by the terrorist group known as

Libya	Abu Nidhal, and that Libya had in some way beeip&apos;rofolved. Steps had

been taken to strengthen security arrangement^iatM^rports in the United Previous	Kingdom, especially those from which the Israeriy^&apos;Tiykine, El Al,

Reference:	operated. Particular care would be needed durin^J;^^&lt;yisit to the

(!C(85) 8th United Kingdom from 21 to 26 January of the Israel^Pfcijae Minister, conclusions, Mr Shimon Peres.

Minute 2

The United States had been seeking a way of showing its r^vpJsion at these incidents and the deaths in them of United StatesCM^fxfens. Some kind of military retaliation had been under consideration^hj^y/fche United States Administration had decided on economic sanctions aga^fj^t^ibya. The United States had not invited the United Kingdom to joinXiir^^iese sanctions but had asked its allies not to undercut the Uniteac&amp;TOrt-tffi

I	m


   I	measures and to consider an effort to defeat international terrorism and

the particular problem posed by Libya in the long term. The British vvV&apos;\	reaction had been to	remind the United States of the measures taken	by

this country against	Libya in 1984 and to agree not to undercut the	new

^   V^vvUnited States measures. The view of the Government regarding economic sane t ions against Libya was that they were likely to have no useful I	^&apos;   ^^&lt;Mvfect on Libyan behaviour and to make it harder for this country to

VTvua^iain its opposition to mandatory sanctions against South Africa.

V^jMhrra would be discussion among the twelve members of the European CiOojjHWhity about reactions to Libyan behaviour and to the United States mSve^&apos;^pd about greater international co-operation against terrorism.

   Southern	THE FORE&apos;reN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that two white people had

   Africa	been killed and two had been injured in a landmine explosion on

4 January in South Africa, close to the border with Botswana. The   Previous:	United Kingdom ia-fcerest was to exert influence to reduce the likelihood

  Reference:	of further inc/deons	of this kind. The Government had urged South

|CC(85) 37th Africa to seek&apos;^Qdarg^omatic solution to the immediate problem and had    Conclusions, called on Botswanfej tajdo everything possible to prevent violence of this   tinute 2	kind, despite the vlji&amp;iytulty which that country experienced in

controlling its bor

\

Nigeria	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEAaXH^&gt;fa&amp;RETARY said that the new Nigerian

Foreign Minister, Mr Akinyei^vjvoiwi visited the United Kingdom from Previous	7 to 9 January. He was an in^iLi^ent and agreeable interlocutor. In

   Reference:	the talks with Mr Akinyemi, thVyro^arnment had sought to take account of

   CC(85) 35th	the long term importance of Nigej^a^yt Africa. Efforts had been made to

   Conclusions, show Mr Akinyemi that everything gjresikle was being done to co-operate    Minute 2	with Nigeria. The Government wishe^^Co^restore the presence of High

Commissioners in both capitals; it	clear whether this would be

possible in the near future. Represeira    ^ns had been made to Mr Akinyemi about the two British enginee^Vof Bristow Helicopters Limited who were in prison in Nigeria. Mr Akinyemi had pressed less strongly than expected about the case of Major Mohammed Yusufu who had been sentenced in the British courts for the kidnap of the Nigerian former Minister for Transport Mr Umaru Dikko, and nofiyirtvwll about the case of I	Mr Dikko.

   the FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that things were going badly in Uganda. The peace agreement signed on 17 December 1985 was not being Previou^&gt;2. implemented. There was a possibility that it would not succeed, which Referen^i^\ would be most regrettable. The Government were adhering to the position j CC(85) 3  &amp;^V/^hat the United Kingdom could not become engaged in monitoring the Conclusions^^Owplementation of the agreement but was willing to help in other, ways.

Spearhead Battalion had been well received in Northern Irelafw  v^s


   Sk ..

V&apos;ILA complicating factor had been that three of the 27 recently convicted terrorists from the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) had resorted to hunger strikes. But the strikes had not been well co-ordinate   in the INLA and had been abandoned without any concessions by the \fjij&apos;authorities. One factor had been that it had become clear that the v-^^^^ppeals launched by the terrorists against conviction would be heard, v^^w^th less delay than had been expected, in about six months. The \&gt;^i  estion of the hunger strikers had been discussed in a special meeting Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 30 December 1985.

Urii^nj^ hostility to the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 15 November 1985 rem^^&amp;d^yery strong. The Ulster Unionist Party and the Democratic UnioM^J?/P^rty were at one on this. There were also ominous stirrings of theC&amp;arpkmilitary groups among the unionists. Unionists appeared to have givAn little thought to the policies they would adopt after the series or by-elections on 23 January. The number of seats where the Unionist candidate would be opposed was not yet clear, but the Social Democratic and Labour Party would probably put forward candidates in four seats. Uiftonust supporters-would turn out to vote and it was likely that tha^^n^oslst parties would win all the seats, probably with increased majoritp  sjj The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland said that he would be sjr  afcdVig at the Annual Conference of the British-Irish Association on 10 J^ifujrp^, and would emphasise the opportunities for unionists presented b^V^vvAnglo-Irish Agreement.

The situation in North  f^Meland was in general calm but there might be a heightening of tension	by-elections approached, and the

situation could become wo^  ^ni the period after that.

Einute 7	down. In the event, howd&amp;ED^epayers had used their influence only

to a modest extent and th^g^own&quot; pressures imposed by the Government had been damagin^Ofyiumber of directions. The proliferating complexity of t^%4  cial system that had been brought into being was undesirable in i^tfKand inherently vulnerable to legal challenge. Tension between cenfta^d local government had been stepped un to an almost intolerabY^d^ree. The extremist policies that were emerging in the inner cities f6  ^these features of the present situation. The business world had beyytpxced into making a vast subsidy to local government through n66^6mestic rates, while the domestic tax base only represented hal^f the electorate. Of the 36 million electorate, only 18 million were ratepayers and of those only 12 million paid rates in full. Against that background, doing nothing was not an option. Each year of local governm^vfinance was more I	difficult than the last. There must be a radteal^hange and the choice

I	could only be between more central control ofNm&amp;p&lt;j^0cal

accountability.

The proposals set out in the Green Paper rested on&lt;i$^main factors: a uniform national non-domestic rate, a new community	that would be

levied on all adults, and a simplified flat rate Gov eYntejJKg rant that would not be changed during the year. The community

clearly be controversial, but the property base of rates^^lnadequate, especially when it was considered how wide a range of ser   ^i?ca authorities now provided. The only possible alternatives 6^^mun\ty charge were a local sales tax, which could only begin to	11

there were large regional authorities, and a local income tax, ^  ^was


   open to the most fundamental objections, in particular because it would provoke a head-on clash between central and local government and would almost certainly result in higher local government spending. Against that background, a community charge of the kind proposed was, despite ) all its difficulties, the only way forward.

proposals he was making were carefully modulated, both through the net arrangements and through the lengthy transitional period ^(5d^sed, so as not to lead to unacceptably violent and sudden changes. rn^Ki^first year of the new arrangements over 80 per cent of households vdWjdy&amp;in, or lose no more than   1 a week. When rates were finally and replaced completely by the community charge, just over half^^C^lL households would be better off.

He proposed that the Green Paper should be published at the end of January, That comments should be requested for England and Wales by 1 October, and that a White Paper should be published at the end of the year. The timiMKpf the main legislation could be settled later, but there was a gqotfg^se for legislating on a new system of control of local governmei^^ capital expenditure in the next session of Parliament, and the Green Pa^erjtept that option open. Legislation on the main issues was of sucifc3^m&amp;lexity that it could not be prepared in time for the next session of^JarJ^ament, and the three months&apos; consultation being suggested in relatio^&amp;e^&amp;cotland did not appear to be enough: he would prefer that these refwft^ ^hould be considered on a Great Britain basis.	y/JA

When the Green paper was jjrtdS^toed there would be a substantial educational job to do, and	his Ministerial colleagues in the

Department of the Environmen\yp  ^posed to set about an energetic programme of speaking engagemOTij^^troughout England, with a particular eye to explaining the proposalsS^ojjanservative Party organisations. It would also be necessary to ensurq^rfitfkGovernment supporters in Parliament were very fully briefed^-^-

In discussion the following main poin  s^?re made -

a.	There should be no illusion twat the proposals would be politically attractive. More than half of existing ratepayers would see themselves paying more under the proposed arrangements, and the voices of losers would be louder/^TTah those of gainers.

The proposed community charge would be o^i  rpised, both because of its resemblance to a full tax and because di^tafe major administrative complications of registratioJv^^JJ   iorcement and rebates.	^&apos;&apos;  1/5

b.	It was important that the consultative per&lt;$*J^W  s exploited to

the full, and that the Government&apos;s case for reform^^uld be vigorously and coherently presented. Since the	principle

were identical north and south of the border, a dang^s-g^yfva 1 lowing a shorter time for consultation in Scotland than in Enr  l  n^ and Wales was that it would appear that the Government had^njQ^up its mind on the major issues within the Scottish timescale, &lt;arna^hat


   subsequent consultation in England and Wales vould appear no more than a charade; there was, therefore, a strong case for the same consultation period for all three countries.

c.	On the other hand, the last rates revaluation in Scotland had stirred up passionate feelings and an election manifesto commitment

. to legislate would be inadequate to meet the political need in .Scotland. What was proposed for Scotland was legislation that XXVould not cover all the ground, but would be more in the nature of /^a^major interim measure. In particular, it would introduce the &apos; oAflmunity charge and would peg non-domestic rates. If such ^^egi^ation were enacted in the next session of Parliament, it would n&gt;ff    n/&lt;o be implemented in April 1989.

d.	&apos;v^There were important questions still unresolved about the future of the safety net arrangements, and these needed to be given continuing attention by officials while the consultative process went ahead&lt;l&gt;.

e.	Give\k3h^h&lt;istory of earlier studies that had concluded that change of tit/ k^ad now proposed, particularly the community charge, were impossiofex^yt was important that the Green Paper itself, and the presentatiwyM^^xercise associated with it, should be able to explain the con^kferttions that had enabled different conclusions to be reached.

f.	Presentationallw^thyre would be much to be said for putting forward the arguments^5&lt;iry^ocal influence upon spending more in terms of improving loc^JTX)enracratic responsibility than as an exercise of local accoun^sMlity which might give the impression of being concerned only with yimarfreial balance sheets;

g.	Since the new communityMfhar^e was unlikely to have many

friends, it was important that&lt;xfie^honsultative period should be used to the full to disabuse	of the idea that local income

tax was a realistic alternative.	al income tax was likely to be

the device most favoured by the Social Democratic Party and it could well come to be accepted as the most attractive option unless the Government presented the arguments against it very strongly. There was, indeed, a risk that the communi^Kcharge could be converted into something closely akin toiiocal income tax if too many concessions were made to accommodate^st^CJKparticular personal circumstances. It was important that the Giwernnent should hammer home the facts about the level of local income^fcax that would be needed to support local government spending ay^Wa^iresent level.

h.	Particular difficulty could be expected fromco&amp;^tudent lobby. Students were losing out under the changes^fer^&apos;had been agreed on housing benefit, and they now stood to lo^ii^by )having to bear the community charge.

i


   i.	It was important also that capping the community charge should be seen as an integral and continuing part of the Government&apos;s policy.. It would be unsafe to rely on local accountability alone to keep local authority spending under adequate control. The

y\	present text of the Green Paper focused on the maintenance of

capping arrangements during the transitional phase.

j.	The establishment of a national non-domestic rate should bring ^//^^ery positive benefits in encouraging regeneration in the inner

\S&apos; &gt;  ities. This aspect should be presented vigorously, and it might

a part to play in deflecting negative comment on the community

THE PR^ffi^lNISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet were agreed that, despite all the acknowledged difficulties, the proposals^set out in the draft Green Paper represented the only acceptable way forward that had been identified out of the present unsustainable situation. The general principles of the Green Paper were endorsed, and syfjuTd be vigorously presented both initially and throughout theVkmi^ulration period. The Green Paper&apos;s reference to the maintenance of cawSTnra arrangements should be looked at again in the light of the disco^gxpfft and more detailed examination of the safety net arrangements, and tl^^ra^ibilities for phasing them out, should continue. The foreworjp^kthe Green Paper should be signed by the Secretaries of State fvi\  n  . Environment, Scotland and Wales, but a single statement should bjg^jiitde by the Secretary of State for the Environment at the time oi^uVIication. Comprehensive and vigorous briefing should be provideq^MJ^Government supporters at that time.

Discussion had disclosed the&apos;^ifdiybulties that were feared in different consultative periods were a1low^d^j^LScotland and England and Wales.

The political requirements in SacifiaXa,. however, were different from those in the rest of the country. ^Tne^-precise period of consultation for Scotland should be agreed with ti^ejjficretary of State for Scotland, but it had to be accepted that legis	n would be needed in Scotland

earlier than in England and Wales. (y
