   L bi	1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

[fFAIRsC^v of Commons in the following week.

L ssible V^p^VlOME SECRETARY said that the leaders of the Prison Officers&apos;

Industrial	&apos;   ^Si/^ration (POA) were balloting their membership for a mandate to take

Ltion by	irM^^^al action. The results of the ballot would be known on 17

Prison	AprLi^*wJuch money was now being spent on prison buildings and on prison

officers	stanl^at in earlier periods of management neglect the POA had got into

the po^rtSoh of virtually deciding for themselves how prisons should be run. Tlie/r^resent campaign, which should be seen as a rearguard action in defentx^if that position, was part of an attempt to claim that they should settle manning levels and the amount of overtime that was available. It would not be defensible to give in to such claims and he intended to resist them, though it should be recognised that, if the POA leaders were giv  rJCS:he mandate they sought from their members, they would undoubted!^u^e it to cause difficulties for the Government. He was in touch wiciDp&lt;S  leagues about the action that might be needed in that event.

The Cabinet -

1.	Took note.

Amending	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THB^fiSjmtONMENT said that it would be

Legislation	necessary to promote legislation/  k^^he present Session to deal with a

on Rate	defect in the provisions on the e^Tj^^tion of block grant to local

Support	authorities. This would need to t^r*aijja  )unced in a statement later that

Grant	day. The point at issue, which was	with the calculation of the

multipliers used to set &quot;safety nets	&quot;caps&quot; for block grant, had

been exposed in a case brought against^*  ^Government by Birmingham City Council. The hearing of the case was dtre^to start on the following Monday, and Mr Robert Alexander QC had acroised that the Government was bound to lose the point of statutory construction that was at issue.

The Attorney General agreed with that advice, ajid^with the view of all other colleagues concerned that the Government/yk^obst course was to avoid the litigation proceeding to judgment bjkWiAbuncing a decision to legislate to correct the defect. The Attorney Girteryi and other colleagues also agreed that it was unavoidable	legislation

should have retrospective effect, though it would ^  frsfepte the position as it had universally been perceived to be until the^jM^tent case and represented the only realistic way of stabilising the^  S^    M^ion in respect of block grant paid since 1981. His Departmentunder continuous challenge in the courts on local government	issues.

For the most part these had been successfully resisted, O^t^jHKpresent case highlighted the extreme complexity and vulnerability q^^^local government finance arrangements that had been constructed ov^r^rtft years. He was therefore asking his officials to consider wheww^ny


   V&apos;lL/O,. features with a simplifying thrust might be extracted from the proposals published in the recent Green Paper on local government finance, and enacted on a faster timetable than the remainder.

PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that the Cabinet that a retrospective Bill would be needed to remedy the defect \OwjJht had been exposed. This should be presented so far as possible as a &apos;v^aWmical measure similar to a Bill of indemnity, though it would be upc^^Kistic to suppose that it would have an easy passage through ParLraront or that it would not be exploited by those who wished to im{  &lt;ie^&gt;*:her parts of the Government&apos;s legislative programme.

Espe&amp;jbHjh in view of the by-election taking place in Fulham that day, the SedSiieiaxy of State for the Environment should scrutinise his statem     J^^ith extreme care.

The Cabinet -

2.	Agreed-frhat a Bill should be introduced in the present Session f  tM purposes described by the Secretary of State for the Emtrrerinjtent

3.	Invited xTS^xi&amp;cretary of State for the Environment

to proceed in   COTW^ance with the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their disc{^s^um.

Ik

I The Situation	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR	IRELAND said that at their	last

I in Northern	meeting he had informed the	O^tjarat that the key event amongst	the	three

I Ireland	marches planned by loyalists on^a^er Monday would be in Portadown.

The estimate he had had at that \*im^\ad been that there would be some I Previous	3,000 participants. At a late st^g^J&amp;fore the march he had been

I Reference:	informed that the number of	partici^w^s-.could rise to as high	as

I CC(86) 13.3	25,000 and that loyalist paramilitai^gMups were intending to	use	the

occasion to mount attacks on the poliro^a^W sectarian attacks designed to provoke retaliation. The Chief ConM^ble of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) had asked for a ban the march and he had agreed to this. The reaction of certain of the Unionist groups had been to assemble a group of some 3,000 people very early on the morning of Easter Monday. The RUC had been taken by surn^is^ by this move and had insufficient resources immediately to hand toynrei^ajt it. They, therefore, had allowed the illegal march to prociMtHYV He considered that this had been the right decision. The ban on th&apos;^mai&apos;et had, however, enabled police to stop people travelling by train	oaches to the

march and this had meant that trouble had been mininwi&amp;^N.

Later in the day there had been a number of disturbances^w^ich the RUC had taken action to counter. In some instances, this hwl    i5vplved the use of baton rounds and plastic bullets; a number of peop^e^jyfrd. been injured, one very seriously. This action had been used to^^ft&apos;^pp further trouble. There had since been more than 150 attad^^^op/^ policemen&apos;s homes and a number of policemen had been forced


   \///*)	house. Some 400 arrests had been made or names noted with a view to

subsequent prosecution. Some unionist leaders had been quick to condemn /  /S. the violence, others less so, but the Ulster Co-ordinating Committee of unionist interests had now condemned it and there were signs that it   X^Nmight diminish. Throughout the incidents the RUC had demonstrated a )determined professionalism and commitment to impartial policing, and &apos;^^  Skir morale had if anything been strengthened, though the situation v^n^m^ined tense.

MINISTER said that the previous evening she and the Lord PrYsireot of the Council and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland had &amp;&amp;&amp;/&amp; meeting with two unionist peers, Lord Brookeborough and Lord Moyol^/^Th   meeting had been at their request. It had been understood that tTO^uneeting was private, but one of the unionist peers had evidentl^^rven a highly distorted account of it to the press. Contrary to these Vress reports she and the other Ministers present had made it quite clear that the Government remained committed to the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Action would be taken to correct the account of the meeting. It was clear that^-tjie lesson from this was that it was not possible for Ministers to reix^cm the confidentiality of discussions on this subject to be maintainea^u*   iuture they should be prepared to publish quickly their own account M^jMich discussions.

The Cabinet -	  &apos;ll/)

4.	Took note. ^&apos;  /s

Disabled	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SO^JAL^&amp;ERVICES said that the Disabled

Persons	Persons (Services, Consultatiori^liAjk&amp;epresentation) Bill - a Private

(Services,	Member&apos;s Bill introduced by Mr T^pa^C^arke MP - was to have its Report

Consultation	Stage	in the House of Commons on	t^t^Lcfklowing day. The Bill in its

and Represen-	current form was unacceptable to	the .government. Negotations were

tation) Bill continuing with Mr Clarke on amendmen$2^raat might be made but even if

these	were accepted by Mr Clarke	the	the Bill would still be too

high.	One possibility, on which	he haaOreen in touch with the Chief

Secretary, Treasury, might be to defer commencement of the Bill, or significant parts of it. Once the outcome of the discussions with Mr Clarke was known, he might need to consult further with those colleagues most closely concerned.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discus si&amp;r^said that the Government had an excellent record on the provisilaQ^^-Jiad made for the disabled. The costs of the Bill - some   100 milliqi^Ajere unacceptably high; but, even if the money could be made availabley/ii^could be used in far more effective ways to assist the disabled. Tl^M^jas considerable sympathy for those who cared for disabled rep^&amp;ives, and a number of voluntary arrangements were made to assist     Mj^exkmple, to take disabled persons into hospital so that relatives cou^L^ra}&amp;e a

m


   ^/!//\	holiday -	but to make such	voluntary arrangements a	statutory right went

v^Vv	too far.	It was important	that	very clear briefing	should be given on

the Government   s position on the Bill, drawing on these points.

&lt;tk

The Cabinet -

  /25.	Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s

lyr gumming up of their discussion.

   

FOREIGN	2. THExtfOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that two people had

AFFAIRS	been kil^d and more than 200 injured in an explosion at a night club in

__	West Berlin during the night of	5 April. There was	firm evidence that

Libya	Libya had	been involved in	this	outrage. There was	also evidence of

Libyan complici^y^in the recent kidnapping in Beirut of two British Previous	citizens. Theme v^re clear indications of Libyan plans for further

Reference:	terrorist attaci&amp;^-^wo Libyan diplomats had been expelled from the

CC (86) 13.2	Federal Republic {bt&amp;kjmany and two from France. This action was in

line with that taRej^y the United Kingdom in 1984, when the Libyan People&apos;s Bureau in LamM.had been closed. It was desirable that countries opposed to&apos;-t^rt  ism should take measures of this kind, which were directed specifical^^kt countering the threat. There had been press reports that the	States was planning military action

against Libya. The Goverfmne^iwere considering what position to take on this in contacts with the orpraSA. States.

.

Change of	THE FORE 1GN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Mr Viktor Popov would

Soviet	be leaving London in the following&lt;i^jak&apos;^t the conclusion of his

Ambassador	appointment as Soviet Ambassador. cftf&amp;ovDv was not a man of stature and

in London	his departure was no cause for griefhad invited large numbers of

people to his farewell party on 14 Ap^W; there was no reason why Ministers who had had dealings with the^Soviet Union should not attend. Mr Popov would be paying farewell calls on the Prime Minister among others. It was worth noting that the treatmen  -&gt;he was receiving contrasted sharply with the poor treatment a^eoroyd to the previous British Ambassador in Moscow, Sir Iain Suthek   lanp^before his departure from the Soviet Union in 1985. Mr Popov would h&amp;s)*:ceeded by Mr Leonid Zamyatin, an able man with long experience at ttv^&amp;  tftre of power in Moiscow. Although he was not a close personal assof the new General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Sov^a^^laion, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, Mr Zamyatin&apos;s appointment to London repre^^J^L an upgrading of the Soviet Embassy. As a former head of the InternaV^nal Information Department of the Central Committee of	Communist

Party, he was skilled at dealing with the media, and wou^d^fe\doubt be active in this direction.


   THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had visited India Pakistap^2\	and Pakistan in the previous week. A major purpose in both countries

vyyfyi had been to promote opportunities for British trade. His discussions in India had been dominated by the Sikh question. There was great concern &gt;^0^t the situation in the Punjab. The Sikh issue as a factor in \0s^)&apos;glo-Indian relations had been described by the Indian Prime Minister, ^   Wp^Rajiv Gandhi, as a series of pinpricks; but the Ministry of External fV^rs and the media in India had been much less helpful. The issue (Lgf&amp;dybecome a serious one, and he was in touch with the Home Secretary aoma^various aspects of it, including the question of deportation of Si&amp;^&amp;iS&amp;emists, It would be important to convince India that the Governmejvpwas doing everything possible about Sikh extremist activity in thMviiountry. With the agreement of Mr Gandhi, he had proposed that each Go^prnment should appoint a Special Representative to deal with this problem; the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr Timothy Renton) would be the United Kingdom&apos;s Special Representativa^INie had also discussed the control of drugs with the Indian author^xie^; they were reluctant to accept the British proposal to appoint Dro^lrfSi  on Officers in India but Mr Gandhi himself was well disposed to the (idea/

In Pakistan, the (?  w^tfjj&amp;ent&apos; s attitude on drugs was co-operative, although the converaJttftMApm poppy growing to other crops posed a real problem for the authOTiw^y He had discussed the problem of Afghanistan with the Pre^^&amp;t of Pakistan, General Zia-ul-Haq.

Pakistan had every reaso^xgJjLook for a way out of the problem, given the severe human problems3^0i^. presence on her territory of three million Afghan refugees. Hffwjjtwieless the Pakistani position remained firm. There was no real	believe that the Soviet Union would

make any serious change in poiiqe^eha Afghanistan. He had spoken to President Zia and others in PaRar^i^Nabout the sale of British frigates to Pakistan, reaffirming the Unil^ed     igdom&apos;s commitment to the sale. Certain points were still outstand^rjjg^^and he was in touch with the Secretary of State for Defence aboi^Ctfa5   to clinch the deal.

Gibraltar	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Spain did not recognise

the United Kingdom claim to territorial water^axbund Gibraltar. It was Previous	in practice very difficult for the two sides va^1v    p out each other&apos;s

Reference:	waters. Spanish vessels often made incursionsjffrCSYlBibraltar&apos; s waters

CC(85) 36.2	and, to preserve the British position, the GoveAMae^^protested when

this happened frequently. On 20 March, a Spanish	flagship had

made an incursion to within li miles of the shore ovk&amp;fa&amp;Ytax and launched two helicopters. The United Kingdom had mat^^V^prmal protest. It was possible that the incursion had not been deliberaj^^it was understood that the commander of the ship had been repiwwp&lt;i  d.


   S&lt;w8&gt;y  vica THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the response of the South African Government to the proposals of the Commonwealth Eminent PreviW^r^ Persons Group was still awaited.

STATEMENT ON 3.	Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of State for

THE DEFENCE	Defen&amp;^xTC(86) 12) seeking approval for the draft of the Statement on

ESTIMATES 1986 the Defence Estimates 1986. They also had before them minutes dated

7 April 1986 from the Secretary of State for Defence and the Secretary Previous	of State for Transport to the Prime Minister about merchant shipping and

Reference:	defence needs.^^.

CC (85) 12.4	CiU

THE SECRETARKgR^^TE FOR DEFENCE said that the draft Statement highlighted the{ampirtant arms control negotiations of the past year and the continuity oi^&amp;jjrtOGovernment&apos; s defence policies. The draft also signalled clearly vfy^^with the ending of real increases in the defence budget, there were l^^tf^ffecisions ahead on spending priorities. An important essay entiw^^^She Seamless Robe&quot; had, however, been included to rebut any revival of^H^criticism that a major review of the defence programme would be nece: Soil

In discussion, it was note^vbfta1^ while defence requirements for merchant ships in tension an^	could in general be met,

nothwithstanding the decline	British merchant fleet, the

provision of sufficient merchai\i&gt;^h)  ps for civil resupply of the United Kingdom in any long period of cootfe&apos;fiPjonal war would be more difficult. While there appeared to be more thai^iufficient shipping resources within the North Atlantic Treaty Orgjfi^&amp;ation as a whole to cope with such resupply requirements, the subjept^^oused considerable Parliamentary and public interest and	dependence on other European

allies in this respect was not easy to &gt;^)cplain.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet approved the draft Statement on the Defence Es&lt;rf2hates 1986. The Secretary of State for Defence should providefra sneaking note and briefing material for Government spokesmen neawi^i^ time of publication in May. The Secretary of State for Hrapypprt should report to the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee (OD)^ae^^^yon as progress in his current examination of possible ways of stemmin^^li^British merchant fleet&apos;s decline allowed. This should take Naj^tirot of the significant matter of the decline in the numbers of	seamen.

The Cabinet -

1.	Approved the draft Statement on the Defence	\Ovjx\

Estimates 1986.


   2.	Invited the Secretary of State for Transport to (t\	report to the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee on

the implications of the British merchant fleet&apos;s decline and possible ways of stemming it.

PRIMARY	Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of State for

HEALTH CARE roc^e^Jervices (C(86) 13) covering a draft discussion document on ptvifmj^health care.

THE   BwwTAEY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that the Government had taken	to improve the management, cost-effectiveness and financial

control &apos;w the hospital service. Hospital management had been completely revitalised, and savings from competitive tendering and sales of land had greatly increased. On all significant indicators the hospital service^ould be demonstrated to be operating more effectively than in 1978. /mitSmost contacts -that members of the public had with the National Healtn^Sepj^e (NHS) were with the medical, dental, pharmaceutical anfl(aravthalmic services provided outside hospitals.

These services wer^i$J*rt.ke the hospital service in that they operated on a cost-plus basis aiieAra^e not cash limited. They had not been comprehensively revie^e^JWJice the NHS was set up, though many important matters had changed siw^d^cpen, especially the numbers of doctors in general practice. The Go^^^hent had taken some action to sharpen delivery and improve comp^evtiveness, notably in the ophthalmic service, but much needed to be donexI^pnJ\services had the strength of being generally popular, accessibl^p^f l^xible and a relatively cheap filter to the expensive hospital servicNK^^yt they displayed widely varying standards, inadequate choice aira^djab^tition, lack of published information about service, insurfd!ci^jrt incentive to teamwork and difficulty in establishing adequafi^corarol over expenditure. The Government&apos;s key objects should the^zi)p  vbe to raise standards, to make the services more sensitive to consuifi^^o&apos; to promote health care and to pursue value for money. These themes	the main thrust of the

discussion document for which he soughtvtQie Cabinet&apos;s approval. The main proposals affecting the medical service were that information to the public should be improved; it should be made easier to change doctors; elderly doctors should be made to retir^r there should be an increased involvement in preventive medicine; jmtTyjie doctors&apos; contract, last restructured in the mid-1960s, should be $ubs  aqtially revised to introduce new performance-related rewards and to pjityipTe emphasis on capitation fees rather than the basic allowanceswas little evidence of a direct link between the size of a doc^Si^re^ist and the quality of care offered, and it was important that an/^^K&amp;tive towards competition should be developed in that way. The prop^si^s^for dental services similarly emphasised the importance of better pu&amp;Sp\access and information, retirement of elderly practitioners, and enerapitaament of preventive services. An extended role was needed for phan^seiw6 to provide better advisory services, and the document also cont^aisfea^ proposals for improving value for money by making better usesing and other skills. Proposals were developed for simpler and faw&apos;ajp^^.


   complaints procedures, for improving services in the inner cities and for establishing teams to monitor the quality of services that were J* offered on the ground. The discussion document was also intended*to open up debate on the whole question of charges, in which it would be important for the Government to preserve its room for manoeuvre by   iy^iyoiding any further pledges on the maintenance of exemptions.

discussion document was drawn up as an agenda for discussion rather blueprint for action. It would be his intention to use it as the Wsi^for a broad debate during the consultation period, in which he irwfndieJV to hold a series of meetings chaired by Ministers at which thej^^wid be representation from consumer organisations and other intercro&amp;a croups. Many of the proposals canvassed in the paper should prove x/y&amp;kttT&amp;c tive to the public, and would find much support in medicalcircles outside the more traditional professional groups. He therefore^intended to put off detailed negotiations with the professions until the public debate had gathered momentum. He proposed that the consultation process should go on until about the end of the year, and that the prepa/afiTpta of more precise proposals should then be put in hand. Legislak&gt;an)^w  yld not, however, be possible until after the 1986-87 Session. //liisnproposal had already been endorsed by the Home and Social Affairs	and he now sought the Cabinet&apos;s approval to

publish the discus s^risAjyument in the following week.

In discussion the foll^^^^j&gt;oints were made -

a.	The Government&apos;,K  &lt;f|hcceeded in introducing a significant number of extra docto^g^yrtsQ the NHS. This had led to smaller lists but had not fed triuwgji into better services. General practitioners often toofc^iJli^h-handed attitude towards patients, for example, in refusing vdyjU^tow them to make appointments rather than queue in a general sui^tfTy^X Any move to deal with such matters or to make it easier cpange doctors would be welcomed.

b.	It was important that the ftfZm&amp;sals to make remuneration performance-related should work in^a^i a way as genuinely to reflect the very wide range of quatf^ty amongst general practitioners. To enable this to bv done it was highly desirable that those conducting the assessment should include people drawn from outside the profession.

c.	The cost of drugs was enormous. The\\  acV_  hat people did not

know the true cost of individual items ledt/p&apos;i5OT}ious waste, with too great a quantity of drugs being prescribwL^aik this excess simply being stored by the patient or thrown	than a

quarter of recipients paid full prescription ch^ge^Vand this situation was increasingly difficult to justify,	time for a

full debate on charging and exemption policy.

d.	It was notable that, while private hospital care^ws/A flourishing, relatively few people chose to see generaL^O^


   practitioners privately. This was partly due to the fact that such ^	patients were not entitled to obtain their medicines through.the

^	NHS. This was a clear anomaly.

.//  THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet proved the draft consultation paper. Although the document did not Mfviwelf propose fundamental changes, it was hoped that it would stimulate VXa/AjJJndamental debate. The document would be carefully scrutinised by /  ^Government&apos;s opponents in the hope of creating scare stories and it wa^aO^t important to ensure that the Government&apos;s supporters were well brcef/^Pto respond from the outset.
