   ?0iI THE F0REIGN A80 COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the United States Administration had asked 25 named members of the Soviet mission to the

___	United Nations in New York to leave the United States by 1 October. The

IfiaHBE&amp;fn announcement of this move had been made on 17 September, the day when Relation^^^&apos;*\the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, had arrived in the y^T^lnited States for his meeting, due to begin on 19 September, with the previous &apos;vv^VTOiited States Secretary of State, Mr George Shultz. That meeting was Reference:	V^pa^ended to prepare the way for a possible Summit between the United

CC&apos;(85) 28.1 (jiSzap&amp;s President, Mr Ronald Reagan, and the General Secretary of the Gdrtfnupdst Party of the Soviet Union, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev. It was dififj^ujj: to unravel the motives of the Soviet and United States Gov^5?fffii&amp;Tits in the affair of Mr Gennady Zakharov, a Soviet member of the Uniteil/4w  ions Secretariat in New York, and Mr Nicholas Daniloff, the Moscow^kotrespondent of the journal &quot;US News and World Report&quot;, each of whom haw been arrested and charged with espionage and subsequently released into the care of his country&apos;s Ambassador; but it seemed clear that the arrest of Mr Zakharov had prompted the Soviet authorities to arrest Mr DaiThis Soviet move must have been ratified, though possibly aft^rttve event, at a high level of the Soviet leadership. It was typical o r&apos;m&apos;fjk&quot;&apos;yt i t for tat&quot; approach of the Soviet Union in matters of this kind. TJngye/jaad been severe criticism in the United States of the agreement wict^^ke Soviet Union on the release of Mr Zakharov and Mr Daniloff. Thisy*s  ^fw) doubt the background to the decision to expel 25 Soviet diplomats &apos;^SmT&apos;^Jpw York. Yet the United States Administration had asked the Soviet autjK^ities in March 1986 to reduce the excessive size of the Soviet miss^^kvi   the United Nations in four steps of some 25 persons each over a ptwo years. The first cut had been due by 1 October 1986. It waspai^Nrs hard to choose the time to act in matters of this kind, so asonVt/^o damage the long-term aim of improving relations with the other cou1^  r^^&gt;oncerned. The United States Administration expected that tee^Scfolet Union would retaliate for the 25 expulsions, and&apos;would no doubt be^   qdy to retaliate in turn by expelling more Soviet diplomats

He had been taking the line in pubi53^th*f these were matters between the United States and the Soviet Union^^md that he hoped that the long-term aim of improving East/West relations would not be inhibited.

It was not clear whether the planned meeting between Mr Shevardnadze and Mr Shultz would go ahead. If it were cancelLeji^x the likelihood of a United States/Soviet Summit in 1986 would be/ffed^ced. The trouble between the United States and the Soviet Unio^OwdS^certainly a setback to East/West relations, but the size of the setfl/acWywas not yet clear.

Meanwhile, the Conference on Disarmament in Europe/&apos;^v$tockholm was due to conclude on 19 September. There were reasonabl^,j  ri  fi  ects of some headway being made in the development of confidence-%uiaa  ig measures in Europe up to the Urals.

In a brief discussion, it was recalled that Mr Gorbachev&apos;^^^M)ld the Lord President of the Council, during the latter&apos;s visit t^^o^e^Soviet Union in May 1986, that he wanted a Summit with President Ksfegan/but not at any price. President Reagan&apos;s position might well be very At^Msar.


   &lt;ylLo	Ic appeared that Mr Gorbachev was continuing to keep open his options

regarding a Summit. He might have to take a decision during the next few weeks. If there was no Summit in 1986, Mr Gorbachev might be tempted to wait to hold one until a new United States President was in office.

South Africa (^SE^PQREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, following the position

United Kingdom had taken at the Commonwealth Review Meeting on   revious	Soufcly&apos;Africa from 3 to 5 August, the Government had not been obliged at

  Reference:	the ^g^rtting on 15-16 September of the Council of Ministers (Foreign

CC(86) 30.2	AffaiiWL&lt;2&gt; the European Community (EC) to advocate the adoption of new

restriafcfve measures against South Africa but equally had not been free to oppose a consensus to adopt such measures. At the Council there had been consensus on the adoption of four of the five measures identified at the European Council in The Hague on 26   27 June, namely bans on the import of iron^5&lt;K steel and gold coins from South Africa and on new investment inf^ia^)country. The Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and Portugal had rY^T^^pposed the adoption of the fifth measure - a ban on the import of coi&amp;jjnm South Africa. The Netherlands, with some support from otheW^  ad argued at length for a ban on coal. Agreement had been reached oir^aq  Maon of the four measures coupled with a statement that the PwvWttcy would continue to seek consensus on the question of a ban on TOd^pAports( The FRG and Portugal had made clear that they would not drop^;6re  Nr opposition to this measure. Some participants in the Coun^j^Jrad argued that the measures on gold coins and investment ^:hat had bee  ^!^^pted should be enforced on a Community basis rather than nationall^^&apos;^Tws United Kingdom opposed this. The question had been remitted f cw&gt;^  yther examination by officials. The Council had also stressed the Imfemnce of positive measures to promote political progress in South Afrvda^/Jle had given no support to any idea of a further political intiative	members of the EC:	the recent

series of visits to South Africa, i$  fjiding his own mission, had exhausted the scope for this, and tKe\$Mted States Secretary of State, Mr George Shultz, would shortly be	South Africa.

In a brief discussion, the following poiwts were made -

a.	There was growing realism among the front line states and other non-aligned countries about the efS  cT^\ that sanctions against South Africa would have on theirvtconjinn.es.

b.	The two Houses of the United States Co1 UL

iad agreed in

supporting a list of sanctions against Sou thTgptLa. which went much further than those adopted by the EC. The Pres/    j  e\of the United States was expected soon to veto this Bill; but&apos;*ra&gt;^6o^ld have to judge how many of the proposed sanctions to accept ya^Srder to avert the risk that a two   thirds majority in both ltmi&amp;e5\of Congress could override his veto.


   THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the current outbreak of 1	terrorism in France was on a formidable scale. There had been eleven

/yy\ major incidents so far in 1986. Five of these had taken place in Paris V( y&apos; within the previous few days. Eight people had died and 150 had been jured. A French Military Attache had been murdered in Lebanon. It clear that the organisation responsible for the upsurge of terrorism France was an extreme left-wing Christian terrorist group, the C&apos;/V^l*  toese Armed Revolutionary Faction, the leader of which, Mr George \i#rajBlm Abdullah, had been in prison in France since 1984. France had bq^nCSK:lined, under the present Government and its socialist pred^zegaors, to give the impression that it was willing to negotiate withC^jfrorists. This misguided policy might have exposed France to a higherXrj^lc of incidents., The French Government was now taking a firmer line.   6me new measures had been introduced, including the imposition of visasvon the nationals of all countries except members of the European Community (EC) and Switzerland. At French suggestion, there would be a meeting on 25 September of the Ministers of the Interior of the EC countri^5^\ The United Kingdom should take advantage of this in order to secui4improvement in practical co-operation and to demonstrate that serious er?bi   t5\\to make progress against terrorism were being

In discussion, the oimraroance of achieving progress in co-operation among the EC countrie^^a^)rinst terrorism was stressed. Co-operation was generally good, but tnererVjks room for improvement. The forthcoming meeting of Ministers of ^ke/Tnter ior would provide the opportunity to try to bring to fruition^^ryous ideas which the United Kingdom had been advancing for some time. &apos;   

l &apos;

lbya	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECREtfAfcpsaid that the trial was taking

place in London of two persons who ^eje     ccused of receiving explosive revious	grenades in September 1985 from a p  ^&apos;wearing the uniform of Libyan

eference:	Arab Airlines. Since then, the securjypf^jHeasures surrounding aircraft

C(86) 26. 2 of Libyan Arab Airlines at London Airport had been made much more

rigorous. Officials were looking closely at this case, to see what further lessons could be drawn. Meanwhile, the Government could not comment in public while the trial continued. _____

hlle	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that ,^|  MLfo&gt;uing the attack

on the President of Chile, General Augusto Pinochet ,/  jk^v September, there had been a major tightening of security in Chil^wnikch had involved the detention of a far wider group of people tha^^as likely to have been involved in the attempted assassination. TheMfe^faH States Administration was sufficiently worried by political deves  &lt;ipmej*ts in Chile to begin questioning whether that country&apos;s relations^^  l\the international financial organisations should be affected. iKe&apos;^af&amp;rgence of a non-communist alternative to the Pinochet regime, which i^^^^ome


   I /vy\ to power after the President&apos;s departure, was becoming increasingly unlikely.

ddle East\s^&amp; FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the meeting between the Vy&amp;bz Minister of Israel, Mr Shimon Peres, and the President of Egypt,

I yious	ft^nwsni Mubarak, on 11-12 September, had confirmed the agreement to

Inference:	subjirfV the border dispute about Taba to arbitration. Mr Peres wanted to

|c(86) 30.2	malce^eadway in relations with Egypt before ceasing to be Prime Minister

in C(gt56^r, and Mr Mubarak had wanted to increase his chances of securiruMliJkited States support in countering Egypt&apos;s economic problems. But tow^ehad been little progress on the main issue of peace in the Middle fikst. The succession of Mr Yitzhak Shamir as Prime Minister of Israel in October would make progress on this more difficult.

Relations	THE SECRETARY O^ZSTATE FOR DEFENCE said that on 15 and 16 September he

kith France	had had a suc  ssiyl first meeting with the new French Minister of

Defence, MonsrelDy^nSrS Giraud. It appeared that the French Government, principally for financial reasons, was becoming more realistic about the difficulty of mar  3E  TO^ng a full range of defence capabilities on a purely national ba^^^^his provided an opportunity to seek some improvement in Britiy^French relations on defence matters.

kith the	between the Prime Minister	J&amp;k Federal German Chancellor,

federal	Dr Helmut Kohl, on 16 Septemb  ?y^a&lt;  &gt;gone exceptionally well. No major

Republic of	decisions had been necessary, b^i^u^ev the two Governments had common

Germany	positions on a wide range of ques^^^tijji^ On 17 September the Prime

Minister and Dr Kohl had made a suc^^e^ful visit to units of the British forces stationed in Germany.

COMMUNITY	2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said (th^jthe Council of

AFFAIRS	Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on 15-16 September hadj^acpe some further

progress towards concluding the agreement which haa^p^S^negotiated with Trade	the United States on trade disputes on citrus produ&amp;fcV^ft^pasta. The

Relations	Council had also edged forward towards settling the manaap^ for

with the	negotiating agreements with a number of Mediterranean c^ufK^^s.

Countries	VX//

   Confe^Wv	THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER recalled that in July the Council of

BudgetN&amp;Qjk	Ministers (Budget) had been unable to reach agreement on the Community&apos;s

1987	draft budget for 1987 because of a fundamental difference of view

between Northern and Southern member states. At the Budget Council on previousvi^&gt;\8-9 September there had been the same division of opinion. The United Referenceand other like-minded member states were determined to maintain CC(86) 29.Jv^^espect for the budgetary discipline framework. The Minister of State, ^/p^   &amp;snxy (Mr Brooke), as Chairman of the Council, had played an

(   important role in achieving at this Council a satisfactory agreement on tsjie 15^7 draft budget which both respected the framework for budgetary di^^^Line and included the full figure proposed for the United Kingdom abaS^^rat. The European Parliament would no doubt seek to add to the draf t^/bj.roget in excess of the Council&apos;s rules on budget discipline but the satisfactory result in the Council on 8-9 September made it more likely criat the line could be held.

Agriculture THE MINISTER OF/AGRrpULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that the Council of Ministers (Agrii^j    wj?tO on 15-16 September had taken five decisions, of which four were r^eftejkby majority vote. The Council had agreed to a devaluation of the lri^ij\green pound, so that Irish monetary compensatory amounts^Mte^reduced by 6 per cent for livestock products and for 3 per cent for c^ripMiroducts; the United Kingdom and France had abstained on the grouni^^mthe change was untimely and excessive. The Council had not been abls^i^rvach agreement on a long-standing problem of monetary compensatory aarptrac^ for eggs and poultry, on which there were opposing views from Fran^^nd the Federal Republic of Germany.

The Council had adopted the dirajpg)ements for carrying out the agreement reached with the United Statesmanimports of maize and sorghum. They had also agreed on arrangements gpSm&amp;iit residues:	the United Kingdom

had voted against this measure on M^eground that a proposal relating to the protection of human health shot^KPiipt be based solely on an agricultural provision (Article 43) yytipz Treaty. The Council had also had a first discussion of a number orrs&apos;tr ingent proposals from the Commission for correcting problems in lyae milk sector. Butter stocks had continued to rise excessively. In addition, because of the way in which the rules had been operated some farmers were still finding it profitable to produce above the level of the Afptik quotas. The United Kingdom had broadly supported the Commissioni&apos;^ objectives. Most member states recognised the seriousness of the prohfehrfpHiht had raised various objections to the solutions proposed. This wouiX^J^^a difficult task for the United Kingdom Presidency to carry forwatTj^/An discussion it was pointed out that some dairy farmers were appare  HP  \reducing the impact of the quota regime and the milk marketing aYrJim&amp;ejnents by &quot;hedge-hopping&quot; or private sales of milk without any rec#  d.


   EnTHfi SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that he had taken the opportunity Nucl^vFPyer at t^ie formal meeting of Community Energy Ministers on 15-16 September fter /ys\ to Pro^e intentions on further investment in nuclear energy. It was Chernowy) clear that Portugal did now wish to have some nuclear power and Spain &apos;^^  ^\was also concerned to move ahead in this field. It seemed, therefore, (/&apos;Vv&apos;^hat there were only four member states - Denmark, Luxembourg, the &apos;\&gt;fi/public of Ireland and Greece - committed against nuclear power.

energy consumption represented only about 5 per cent of the vCommuoity&apos;s total. It was remarkable that the Soviet Union had now made a^ful/kdis closure of the errors which had led to the accident at Che^miyl, admitting that there were faults of reactor design and engSa^y&apos;ing as well as a failure of management. The design faults now admitM&amp;^were the same as those which British engineers had identified. WithinMihe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna it would now be possible to move forward on international safety measures in full recognition of the errors which had brought about the Chernobyl accident. In discussion of international inspection it was pointed out that the Unity^dTalngdom would support a role for the IAEA in liaising with nationalwjns^lactorates, where the essential expertise was concentrated, arjmf^Tyl not therefore see a case for any new international inspectorate. TjW-^p&apos;fVjrt of the Sizewell Inquiry might now be received at the end of the	week of October.

HOME AFFAIRS	3. THE HOME SECRETARY said tj^c frfte decision, announced on

   	1 September, to apply a visa regi^era the nationals of Ghana, India,

Immigration Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nigeria h^d/not led to any sudden Control: Visa further build-up of visitors from S^rtwH^countries. The Home Office and Regimes	the Foreign and Commonwealth Office ftaa^herefore been able to press on

quickly with the necessary preparation^:	No problems were foreseen

except in the case of Nigeria, where tnyjre were no existing staff dealing with settlement work. The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr Eggar) would be visiting Nigeria in the following week to explore what&lt;^5e^.ded to be done to enable early operation of a visa regime there   $*ie announcement and debate in Parliament of the application of vi^^tnXthe 5 countries would require careful handling in Parliament, aW^hy^would be discussing that with the Lord Privy Seal.	Ssll ^

Jg

Disturbance THE HOME SECRETARY said that the disorder that had takehXg)Atein the St ln   ristol Paul&apos;s area of Bristol the previous weekend had been on nTjiaGrtl^lower scale than the disturbance there in 1980. It had foil owe	for

drugs by the police in which firearms and other weapons had&apos;^ml found. 88 arrests had been made and 32 policemen had been injured. pJuyrfob&amp;a


   St Paul&apos;s would doubtless remain one of the more difficult inner city vlyfc.	areas, it was noteworthy that on this occasion the police had been given

open support by leaders of the black community: in that respect, as well as in the police handling of the affair, it was clear that valuable lessons had been learnt since 1980.

Environmenta^^WvSECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the announcement in Issues	^e establishment of Her Majesty&apos;s Inspectorate of Pollution

na^^aeen generally well received, as had the announcement of the

retrofitting filtration equipment to three major power stationjs^as a contribution to resolving the problem of acid rain and the annoumrement of proposals to simplify the planning system. In general, he beloved that it would be necessary for the Government to be seen to be taking more energetic action on issues of environmental protection; and the problem would be to resolve the tension between that objective and the deman&lt;dj?^f economic efficiency.

Hi

Northern	THE SECRETARY OF ST^^^^R NORTHERN IRELAND said that the marching

llreland	season in Northern	had passed off rather better than had

generally been feared,	the summer, however, the IRA had

maintained terrorist ac^Pw^Cw against the security forces and contractors working for ^x  Hf/^%They had now extended their threat to virtually any civilian whoTnis^O^yen the most tenuous links with the security forces and had delS&amp;era&apos;f^ly provoked the protestant community. The shooting of a sergeant in^fc&apos;me^Jlster Defence Regiment in the Shankhill Road area of Belfast a^sro&apos;Vkiggered a sequence of tit   for-tat murders between the two communitie^i^VAlthough a number of people thought to be responsible for earlre^murders had been caught, the situation was tense and might not	to restrain.

T

Education	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE said that the schools

had reassembled peaceably; but the teachers&apos; n^y-^esue remained to be resolved, and some vital decisions would be niede^gyer the following few weeks. Polytechnics, however, were a succeOT^rory. At one time during the year it had looked as though places aijVpe^A^echnics might have to be cut but, in the course of discussions oa^Wal authority finance, arrangements had been made that would allow/r^rSght increase. Since 1979 the number of places in polytechnics had m^nArtvcreased by 140,000. Great credit should be claimed for this during fcl$  *coming year.	&lt;%YY\


   THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that the harvest T	had been bigger than in the previous year. Farmers&apos; incomes, however,

/yx\ showed only a small increase. The continuing negotiations on beef and Y/y milk in th Euopean Community would be crucially important. THE &apos;^^/  kNSECRETARY OF STATE FOR WALES said that the most obtrusive Welsh

kv\VM:ricultural issue during the summer had been the after-effects of the N\ .rfybrnobyl disaster. Radioactive contamination was lingering for longer had been expected, especially on high ground in Gwynedd, and it was QjdW^Xpected that the problem might persist until the end of the year.

   	m

resentation	THE PRIfflE&apos;MINISTER said that Ministers should	pay	special regard	to	the

If Government	effectiv^presentation of information about their	areas of

Policies	responsibility. The Department of Employment	had	been conspicuously

successful in advertising their programmes to those at whom they were aimed, and in n^e^enting the facts on unemployment. Other areas&quot; which stood to beneff/t npom greater dissemination of information included the National HealtrN^^^ice, where the reduction of waiting lists for treatment was a ]{syjsV&gt;iective.

CONOMIC	4. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXSsiaUER said the economic outlook was

LFFAIRS	generally goocl. Inflation had^ra/^Mi to 2.4 per cent in the previous

   	month but a slight increase in che pare could be expected the following

eneral	month as the benefit of the previ&lt;s6df v^ar&apos; s reductions in mortgage

conomic	interest rates fell out of the Reta  k  piee Index. There were also

rntlook	signs of a return to growth in the w^	onomy following the

dislocation imposed by the fall in the^o^ce of oil. A resumption of growth was already recurring in the Fe&lt;^val Republic of Germany (FRG) and the first signs of a similar revivai^ere appearing in the United Kingdom. The United States Government, concerned at the limitations imposed by its balance of payments and budget deficit on its own capacity to fuel continued growth, had been piy^tTtyr pressure on the FRG and Japan to reflate at a faster pace than those cpimtries wished.

Their resistance had strengthened the yen and ttlayOehtschmark at the expense of the dollar. The pound had tended to AoLJ^&amp;&apos;ythe dollar. He had taken the opportunity to strengthen the reserve^^yxaising a loan of $4 billion at a highly favourable rate of interest/kv^he success of this operation showed that the United Kingdom&apos;s stanal^JgoaSo overseas financial markets remained high. The benefits of the faiJ^Kk the price of oil for the debts of non-oil producing countries provv^Jrati opportunity for banks to strengthen their balance sheets.NAfiwme^xoncern had been expressed about the level of personal debt in the Kingdom, but he did not see this as presenting a major problemi/^^ was true that the debt to income ratio was higher than it had


   before but it was still lower than that in the United States and was largely attributable to the increase in those taking out mortgages for //y\ house purchase, which was a desirable trend. Savings were also

increasing. His principal concern was that wage settlements should \^&gt;^Veflect the fall in the rate of inflation. The local authority manual //&apos;&apos;XwOTkers settlement was not encouraging but he hoped that private sector v^sjiytlements would set a different trend. If they did not, then this

have an adverse effect on the United Kingdom&apos;s competitiveness in XeiawVn to other countries.

THE ^  ^R&amp;TARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the high level of the s&amp;fcttiement of the local authority manual workers pay claim had been most dy9^a  pointing. His discussion with those concerned had shown that even th^fjovernment&apos;s supporters on the negotiating panel had been more concernea^with the relative levels of wages in this area than with affordability or the wider economic consequences of their decision. It raised the question of whether it was desirable to continue with arrangements fp^^ntral negotiation of such claims.

0  

lemployment	THE SECRETARY OF STalil/f^k EMPLOYMENT said that the unemployment figures

gures	to be published that	encouraging. For the first time this

year the seasonally adjusrod^figures would show no increase. Vacancies continued to rise and cun^ik&amp;v stood at over 200,000. Although it was too early to make predic t^ms/in public, over the next five months he expected the seasonally adigure to fall month by month; the extent of the fall would dep^^  oop^underlying economic trends. This showed the success of the Renrogramme in tackling the problem of the long-term unemployed. The iiii^n^iew programme was now running at some 30-40,000 interviews per week./&apos;Jrtiitial figures of removals from the register were most encouraging&apos; A^ubstantial proportion had not subsequently returned to the registajp^yv-a later month, and this proportion was likely to rise still raider as the programme became fully operational.

ivatisation, THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that th^^kspective flotation of   regulation British Gas was attracting considerable publicyilit^tqst on a scale

the	comparable to that attracted by the flotation orj  fThish Telecom. With

fjection of	six weeks still to go before flotation, more thanV^-^n^JSLion inquiries

lvate	into share purchase had been received.

ipital into THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that, follov^*A^he successful Hlc	conclusion of negotiations with the United States GovernmprfPU for which

ojects	he was indebted to the Secretary of State for Foreign an^e^tmbnwealth

Affairs, the legal problems which had held up the privatisAJLron^of British Airways had now been resolved, and it was intended ta^rfrwceed with privatisation early in the New Year. This would be of okmyj^fkrable assistance in maintaining the momentum of privatisation policy
