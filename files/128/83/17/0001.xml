PARLIAMENTARY 3. The Cabinet were informed Vx t^sVbusmess to be taken m the House AFFAIRS	of Commons in the following week.^^

Invalid Care	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that under legislation

Allowance	introduced in 1976 invalid care allowance was paid to men and single

women who were unable to work because they had to spend more than 35 hours a week caring for a severly disabled/V^Pwpn in receipt of an attendance allowance. Married women were spe$J^i    lly excluded from receipt of the allowance. This exclusion had beancraallenged in the European Court as contravening the European CommVfflid^/&apos;Directive on Equal Treatment in social security matters. The Advocat^^miMral to the European Court had now produced an Opinion to the ef  j  p  that the exclusion contravened the Directive, and this Opinion^Wjj^xpected to be confirmed by the full Court in June. The likely annual	of

extending the allowance to married women was of the orde^^yfy  100 million. Although no immediate action was necessary, he^as^l*  scussing the implications of an adverse judgment with the Chief Seci^Mr^


   Treasury. In the meantime he would respond to criticism from the official Opposition by pointing out that the legislation challenged ,X  x\had been introduced by the last Labour Government.

The Cabinet -

1.	Took note.

\

Auxiliary	THE PfCiMjJoMINISTER said that the Ministry of Defence were embarking on

g^er	the proe^Mja^nt of a new fleet auxiliary vessel - the Auxiliary Oiler

Replenishment Replenishment Vessel (AOR) - which had its own weapons system, thus yessel	enabling m: to operate without the defensive protection of other armed

vessels. The Ministerial Sub-Committee on Economic Affairs had agreed the previous week that the contract to supply the first AOR should be placed with Harl^trtNand Wolff; and that Swan Hunter Shipbuilders should be invited to tkmdeV later in the summer for a second AOR as a follow-on to the Harland aira^W5Vff design, on condition that no extra cost would be involved, and	ract terms would be no worse than if the order

had gone to Harland^a^Twolff. She had invited the Lord President of the Council to consiaefoytfah the Ministers concerned how the public expenditure implicatioM^i^he timing of the building of AOR 2 could best be accommodated withm^cisting public expenditure provision.

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE yvlJNOTL said that earlier that morning he had held a meeting with the ChiVf^&amp;Msetary, Treasury, the Secretary of State for Defence, the Secre&amp;r&amp;pdi State for Trade and Industry. Bringing forward the cons true	AOR 2 would impose additional costs

of   49 million on the defence budgj^e&amp;n the period 1987-91, the bulk of which would fall in 1988-89 and r98^9&lt;k there was no provision in the defence programme for this expendiclir^^^and the defence budget was already under serious strain. The ttfit^^Ministers had agreed that the   2 million additional cost in 1987-8	be borne by the Ministry of

Defence; that for 1988-89 (  16 millionj^^duld be shared between the Ministry of Defence (  6 million), the Detriment of Trade and Industry (  5 million) and the Reserve (  5 million&apos;each); that for 1989-90 (  30 million) would be shared equally between the three contributors, and finally that for 1990-91 (  1 million) would be hoJtne by the Ministry of Defence.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, saMlnat the Cabinet were agreed, that although bringing forward the av^i4  &lt;  f the AOR 2 contract and awarding it on a single tender basis w^a^nj^pnsistent with the Government&apos;s emphasis on competition in defence p^p^wstnent, and exception was justified in the particular circumstanc^Os^aXon the conditions that had been agreed. An oral statement annoujtf&gt;jirg the Government&apos;s decision on the award of the contracts shouia^ie\iiade by the Secretary of State for Defence in the House of Common  &lt;^fc^\ afternoon. Even with the award of the AOR 2 contract, redui^6^c\)es at Swan Hunter Shipbuilders would be reduced rather than comple^^lv^y prevented. There was serious over-capacity in the shipbuildin^y^M&amp;stry


   Bv&gt;vCv affecting both the privatised warshipyards and British Shipbuilders&apos;

I	merchant shipyards, and this caused particular problems in the North

^oA\East. In accordance with the decision of the Sub-Committee on Economic fairs, the scope for targetting Government job creation initiatives on N&apos;   ^Swe worst hit areas of the North East was already under consideration by Secretary of State for the Environment, the Secretary of State for &apos;^^Tjoyment, the Chief Secretary, Treasury and the Secretary of State for &apos;w^deyand Industry.

&amp; Cabinet -

Bomb	THE MINISTER OF STATE, HOME OFF lfc*l&amp;^id that at 4.45 that morning a

Explosion	bomb had exploded at a side   entrai\^e^j^the offices of British Airways

in Oxford	in Oxford Street. The building was&gt;J*krgd with American Airlines. The

Street	explosion had damaged the building atC^^^rarted a fire. The flats above

the airline offices had had to be evacW  ^. . Nobody had been injured but one of the occupants of the flats raMi)een taken into hospital suffering from shock. Oxford Street had&apos;^been temporarily closed but had been reopened at 10.00 that morning. There was no indication of Libyan involvement, although there had inevitably been speculation in the media to that effect. Private Notice Questions had b^SKtabled by Mr Gerald Kaufman, MP and Mr Alan Beith, MP. He would iMiccMe the guidance of colleagues on whether he should volunteer to mafe^^a^^tatement or await the Speaker&apos;s decision on whether to accept a Pr^vaj^/Notice Question.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, safia^hat it was agreed that the balance of advantage lay in not voluiwi^t^f^j a statement but awaiting the Speaker&apos;s ruling. There had been a stecrayOgrowth in the number of Private Notice Questions tabled by Opposifi^jyw^ocont Bench spokesmen and the exceptional nature of the procedure

undermined. It was important to avoid creating the imprestlWvThat a statement would be volunteered if a Private Notice Question \^u^^?abled.


   \^yfjThe Cabinet -

5.	Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.

m

FOREIGN ^M^^THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there was no AFFAIRS	of reports in the press that the Libyan Head of State,

__	Q^KonJH. Qadhafi, was now sharing power in a junta with four other

Libya	peo*  re&gt;--N Following various contacts in recent days with representatives

of disunited States Administration, it was clear that the I previous	Admin^^^axion now recognised the debt that it owed to the British

Reference:	GoverniMnt for support in the action against Libya and the political

CC(86) 16.3	difficulty that this had caused for the Government. There were also

indications that the Administration realised that a further United States approach^about renewed military action against Libya would pose major difficulriesN for the Government. The United States Administration were exerting\infaience in favour of a positive vote in the Senate on the proposed Sup/yfem)=Wary Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United KYj^rtiorff) but the outcome on this remained uncertain. The Government were pri^^^^y advising the British community in Libya to leave the country ano^M#^. were doing so steadily and without panic. Libya had announced tMt^iBritish journalists, and about 200 from the United States and other Eraebean Community countries, must leave the country. There was no COTvfinmation that the British citizen held in Lebanon since March 1985Collett, had been killed; but reports to this effect might well b^fc^rK. There were threats to the security of British Embassies and peopOkp^in several countries. Steps were being taken to improve security but Wwgwere limits to what could be achieved.

The leaders of the Libyan Revolutiogi^y^&amp;tudent Movement (LRSM) in the United Kingdom, who were to be deporosroy&apos;would leave the country on 25 April if, as on balance was expectdA/ifc&apos;ne scheduled Libyan Arab Airlines flight from London to Tripoli&apos;oook place. It was important that these people should leave the country as soon as possible, so as to reduce the risk of detention of British subjects in Libya in retaliation. The Libyan Interests Section of Lhe-^Saudi Arabian Embassy in London had access to them.	})

The Ministerial Group on Libya (MISC 102) had di/^ussjbd on 22 April various questions of policy, including the futurev  i^  Yr services between the United Kingdom and Libya. The Group hda^j^Xconcluded that air services should be discontinued. The Libyan Aras flight from London to Tripoli due on 23 April had not taken plai^^ut another flight was due on 25 April. Because Libyan Arab Airline^/Jraiwiot flown on 23 April, British Caledonian Airways (BCal) had cancel^^d^cijeir flight to Tripoli which had been scheduled for 24 April. Th^^^\  xt flight was scheduled for 26 April. It seemed unwise to ternr&amp;cNfce/&apos;ttir services so long as a considerable number of British citizens&apos;^?^wauied in Libya and might wish to depart. BCal would like to resume smA^cj  , subject to the risks involved. If the Libyan Arab Airlines fligXt^Bfe^


   \	on the following day took place, the basis would exist for BCal to

Vn resume flights on 26 April. Ministers should keep this subject under review from day to day.

Ministerial Group had decided, with regard to Libyan trainees in ^/&apos;viiycraft maintenance and Libyan trainee pilots in this country, that the &apos;vS^retary of State for Transport would issue a directive to the British ^i^^^concerned that the trainees should have no access to aircraft.

XWis&gt;effuld be expected to cause their training courses to cease. The rea^dnjrar their presence in the United Kingdom would then have disapjje^^ed, and the Home Secretary would be able to ask them to leave the cfiattby. There might be a question of claims for compensation from the Briti^t^:ompanies on the grounds that the courses had ended prematurely. Officials were considering the position with regard to Libyan students of other subjects in this country. The numbers had fallen very considerably and students were now given visas lasting for only one term at a time. Overall visa policy towards Libya was also being considereyyl5Vvofficials.

Although the Unita^TTyngdom was not moving towards the introduction of a range of economic \&amp;a  ^Aons against Libya, officials were considering the question of an jjraftrnational embargo on the purchase of Libyan oil. The United Kingdom, asr/&amp;j/^il exporter, would be suspected of commercial motives in&apos;w^^^g forward such a proposal. But the Government might be able t^Sersuade others to advance it.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEA^TO^pRETARY said that he had raised in the Council of Ministers (Foreign^frairs) on 21 April the question of Community subsidised food saLasv  j0\Libya. There were no special arrangements for export refuno^^iAj*j.bya for cereals and beef, these products being sold with the norj^Kfisfund to world markets generally. Other member states would not suppa^^ general embargo on refunds for products which might go to Libya. ^TJy^&amp;ommission, however, had now assured him that they would hold up ^my^ibrther subsidised sales of dairy products to Libya.	s&apos;)

In discussion, the following main pointaSwere made -

a.	All 22 of the leaders of the LRSM in the United Kingdom who

were to be deported had now been detained^*   All but one had agreed to waive the right of appeal against depofofatwon. If the last one continued to refuse to waive this right, Vqg	ture would

have to be deferred, but the appeal procedural would be completed as rapidly as possible. Efforts would be ma*s^^^j0^\iinimise publicity for the departure of the 22 Libyans ^irn^he United Kingdom. If the Libyan Arab Airlines flight to Q^n^Li due on the following day did not take place, other means of ^   ^ji^ture would need to be found for these Libyans; this would not be  i  ifcsy.

b.	The United Kingdom still imported some oil and d^i^fehducts from Libya. It was for consideration whether this couqfM^oould give a lead to the international community by moving uni^a&amp;^nally to cease such imports. This would have to be done by recftre^^Jig


   British companies to act accordingly. The involvement of United States companies in the oil industry in Libya did not make such a British move inappropriate. The work by officials on this subject rv&apos;y&apos;	should be accelerated.

/      Xv c. The question of Community subsidised food sales to Libya was a particularly sensitive point for public opinion, and the United ingdom should pursue it vigorously. The Prime Minister might wish C&lt;	raise it herself at the next European Council.

im The President of the United States had said that, if the

Government continued its campaign of terror against American ci^^*^s, the United States would &quot;act again&quot; against Libya. The Go&apos;iwnment should consider what action the United Kingdom should take^if British people were killed in further terrorist attacks sponsored by Libya. It would be most important to avoid the criticism that the response when Americans fell victim to terrorism was diffey^in^VErom that when British people fell victim. Yet if the UniteAkStales again asked for the use of aircraft based in the United Kin^^Tm action against Libya, the doubts among many people in th\is_^A*otry, including some responsible sections of opinion, about^M^efficacy of air strikes as a means of countering terrorism woula/&gt;e^*pressed with greater force. If there was a further United S&apos;Mjb^S&apos;^request for the use of aircraft based in this country for action ^a^st Libya, all the factors prevailing at the time would need to	idered. Officials were already

considering what furk^gj/&apos;Aeasures by European Community countries might be possible if UTMaftNierror ist activity continued.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing ufc^  ircdiscussion, said that work on the various matters discussed shouli^piekompleted as rapidly as possible. Measures which the United Kingdonfp&lt;Jja% undertake alone, as well as those which would be multilateralKst^ld be considered. Thought should continue to be given to the way the&lt;^^CSii Kingdom would respond if there were further terrorist attacks^b^nsored by Libya.

The Cabinet -

1.	Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.

South Africa THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that tlj^Wrnment of the Republic of South Africa had tabled on the previous   a^/  heislation Previous	which would terminate the Pass Laws. The South Afric^rf^oi^ernment had

Reference:	also published a White Paper which foreshadowed a very substantial

CC(86) 14.2 easing of influx control. Although these measures did	the

basic features of apartheid - the Group Areas Act and the^g^g^tration of persons according to race - they represented a major re^dii^^in line with the demands of world opinion.


   THE F0REIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the State Visit of King Juan Carlos and Queen Sophia of Spain was going well. The Lord previousOo Chancellor and the Speaker of the House of Commons were to be Refererfwv^v congratulated on the speeches they had made when King Juan Carlos had CC(86) VL2// addressed a joint session of Parliament on the previous day.

The Cabinet    

Took note.

COMMUNITY	5. TOB^F&apos;OREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that a major current

AFFAIRS	issue within the Community was trade relations with the United States.

___	The United States were maintaining the threat of retaliatory actions

Trade	against Community exports because of the presumed effect on some United

Relations	States trade of^-the accession arrangements for Spain and Portugal. They

With The	would, howevenj^ptofetpone the date for such retaliatory action and it was

United States not expected V^t)4feere would be any effect before the Tokyo Economic Summit. The Cov^minhay should maintain a firm position. The United Previous	States were contsjrt^frd*)accept the political bonus of Spanish and

CC(86) 10.3	some of the trade efffj&amp;ipX In fact, the member states, not third

countries, would be	the main burden of this accession.

\

Agriculture THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECR^XA^reported that the Council of

Ministers (Agriculture) was still 1^&apos;SS^ion. It seemed likely that the Previous	price package itself would be tough, ^omp^tsing a freeze on Community

Reference:	support prices, some measures to limicrifie effect of intervention and a

CC(86) 16.4 co-responsibility levy for cereals. Tn^Minister of Agriculture,

Fisheries and Food had clearly done well in removing elements which discriminated against United Kingdom producers of beef and sheepmeat and in making some changes in the proposed operati&lt;j5IN&gt;f the cereals co-responsibility levy. The cost of the package q)as being held down.

The Commission was now proposing that there	an additional

change in green rates which would have the ef fecf^o^/increas ing prices in national currencies by about 1 per cent on crofKWMflucts and 2 per cent on some livestock products in countries with neg^^ve monetary compensatory amounts, including the United Kingdom. v^^faMneral, the Commission appeared to be holding to a firm line. Tire	problem was

that, apart from this price package, the fall in the	gainst the

ecu and the effects of the recent monetary realignment l^^u^bpe would in any event be adding substantially to agricultural experateji&apos;^re. It was very important that Britain should get from the CommisM^^a^lear assurance that the price package and the additional agricult\te^i^osts


   v would be financed within the available own resources. The Council of Ministers (Economy and Finance) should also look at this point at its meeting the following week.

discussion it was agreed that the problem of agricultural expenditure ^\Wa  . very serious; even with a tough price package, the Commission&apos;s y fWirps showed that the increase in agricultural spending resulting from ^th^&amp;Jl in the dollar and the monetary realignment would take the Otmmm&amp;ty budget in 1986 and 1987 above the limits set by the 1.4 per cei^rV^oie Added Tax (VAT) ceiling. This was unacceptable. The Comm^^otk must be pressed to confirm that the costs would be contained withi	4 per cent VAT ceiling in 1986 and 1987, and the matter

should ra/^xamined in the Council of Ministers (Economy and Finance). Discussals on financing of other policies, for example the Social Fund, had showir^that some other member states, in particular the Federal Republic of Germany, were committed to maintaining respect for the 1.4 per cent VAT ceiling in 1986 and 1987. It was also said that the problem of adoowmpolicies to the large growth of agricultural production was (  jjroiilem on a world-wide scale, with substantial protection and su^sidxteation in the United States, Japan and elsewhere, as well as in theVkorimiMtity itself. The problem of trying to maintain a stable rural commun^y^pv face of the technological changes was a real one and could not be	quickly. It was to be expected tha the

problem and the need c^    ^ect the operation of agricultural polices would be discussed at the^Pj&amp;vo Economic Summit.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summin^jooAfehe discussion, said that, although the price package itself was a todgfi^qne, the additional expenditure resulting from the fall in thfiTwc^rtar and the realignment of currencies might be as high as 1,300 miir^rf^fejeji in 1986 and that the Commission had stated that, in order to main  ain\the 1.4 per cent VAT ceiling, about 520 million ecu would have to^^pushed 1987 or found by other reductions in expenditure. It was nme^^to be preferred that there should be off-setting reductions invfxp^Hiiture, since the other solution would merely intensify the prw^taw; on the 1.4 per cent ceiling in 1987 and add to the financing problhte^n that and later years. The Cabinet agreed that in the circumstanced^, t was necessary that, before agreeing to a price package on the lines that seemed to be emerging at the present meeting of the Council of Ministers (Agriculture), the United Kingdom should have assurances from the Commission that the expenditure in 1986 and 1987 would be financec^/^it^in the 1.4 per cent VAT ceiling. The Minister of Agriculture, FisXgjiesvand Food should make it clear that this was a matter which would(tfava)to be considered by the Council of Ministers (Economy and Finance/va^^&amp;s meeting on

28 *prii-	&lt;m

on the price package.


   BRITlSlr\v 6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on the privatisation of Land Rover (UK) Limited &lt;g^\(C(86) 14).

Previous

Reference	SECRETARY OF STATE FOR	TRADE AND INDUSTRY recalled that, following

CC(86)	13.4 \Cwjpkstatement on 25 March,	the British Leyland (BL) Board had been asked

&apos;v^^Vraconsider all the potential bids for Land Rover. The Board had a/epfwngly invited the submission of fresh bids by 15 April, and this hacT^p^uced four responses: Schroder Ventures (on behalf of the maiMgem^it buy-out), Lonrho, J C Bamford and Aveling-Barford. The Board had dLOTl^jitered these bids at their meeting on 22 April; those by Bamford and A^ii  wk?&lt;  arford were clearly inferior, and had been ruled out. The Board hira^fcnen considered the Lonhro and Schroder bids against the alternative of retaining the Land Rover and Freight Rover businesses within BL with a view to a	flotation or trade sale in 18-24 months.

There could be no absolute	guarantee of the price these businesses would

fetch at some future time,	but BL&apos;s best estimate, which was endorsed by

both their and mleSibepartment of Trade and Industry&apos;s financial advisers, was	present value of the future proceeds was of the

order of   200 million)) Taking both financial and industrial considerations inNtjux&apos;bunt, the Board&apos;s strongly felt view was that retention of the bus^ti|4tf  s within the Company for the time being was the preferable course/^iriKthey had recommended accordingly. The Government had in ef fe^t&apos;^reeady overruled the Board in rejecting their preferred purchaser, Gene^^Motors ; there could be considerable difficulty if the Governm  Ar^rare again to overrule the Board. If the Government considered it e^&amp;&lt;pyfal to sell Land Rover at that time, the BL Board would be likely to a^^a  ^end Lonhro rather than the management buy-out. In all the circumsc^n  elOhe considered that the course recommended by the Board was	one, and he sought his colleagues&apos;

agreement to it. His intention ^artil^Sbe to announce it by means of an oral statement in the House of ConjsS^ifl^later that day, a draft of which was at Annex A to his memorandum.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a briefSpl^ussion, said that the Cabinet endorsed the BL Board&apos;s recommendation^Vfhey noted that Land Rover and Freight Rover were projected to have positive cash flows over the following two years, so that there should be no question of the Government having to undertake any additional financial commitments. Leyland Trucks and Leyland Bus were facing a ve^|  ^difficult market situation, and the BL Board would need to consr^dei^Jthe future of these businesses in the course of the following few we  j^^at was particularly important that steps should be taken as soon as jW^ss/ple to deal with th   problems of Leyland Bus. There could be advah-  ij^win making the Freight Rover business more distinct from that of I&amp;n^^^yer, in order to widen the options for eventual disposal of that bixr  nel^s as a going concern. No time should be lost in bringing the presfffit&apos;^jfcertainty to an end, and the Secretary of State should therefore makq(|^  fe  jroposed statement on 24 April. Subject to the deletion of the tV^f^  aragraph, and to other minor changes, the Cabinet approved the drafr^  ix^of the statement.	y^vy\


   The Cabinet -

1.	Agreed that the Government should accept the J/. British Leyland Board&apos;s recommendation that Land Rover and Freight Rover should be retained within British nOvK/&apos;X Leyland for the time being, with a view to flotation trade sale in 18-24 months time.

lyy\

Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and ^Lrfjiustry to make a statement accordingly in the House y^t^iminns that afternoon, taking account of the points maw^A discussion and in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.
