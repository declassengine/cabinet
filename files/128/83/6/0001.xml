British vTvrafi SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that discussions with Beyland	\^0^ral Motors (GM) about the sale of the truck and Land Rover divisions

Ar/lH?itish Leyland (BL) were proceeding. Heads of agreement might be Brevious	exnerjrts^d by the end of that month. The publicity surrounding GM&apos;s offer

Reference:	hsa a^ptsed the interest of other companies, including some other

Rc(86) 5th Eurd^arj^hiotor manufacturers. They were not all interested in both    Conclusions,	divisi&apos;OTus^^md only one firm was interested in the truck division alone,

   inute 4	There wa^^lso a possibility of a management buy out at Land Rover. He

did not&apos;ihink that these offers could be ignored, even though they were late in tne day. He had therefore asked the BL Board to give those now interested sufficient financial data to enable them to make firm offers, if they wished k  -&gt;do so. It would be important not to put the chances of an agreemenJD^winh GM at risk, and other contenders should be allowed only two weeksV^jj^anTNto make up their minds.

THE PRIME MINISTEK^M&amp;&apos;ffo that the Cabinet agreed with the tactics proposed by the Sec^e^y?^ of State for Trade and Industry.

   OREIGN	2.	THE FOREIGN AND C0MM0NWEALTH^e6*RTARY said	that the armed forces

  FAIRS	of the United	States had not, in rec^imilitary	exercises	in the

I---	Mediterranean area, entered the Gulj^3^Jiirte, to which there was a

llibya	disputed Libyan claim. The United St  t/^  ad, however, now given formal

notice that an exercise lasting from iV/fo 15 February would take place    revious	partly in the Tripoli Flight Information^Region, which included the Gulf

Reference:	of Sirte. There was thus a tense situation, with possible potential for

   C(86) 5th	conflict. The prospects were still being analysed, but the provisional

Bonclusions, view	was that	the President of Libya, Colonel J0^3feafi, was	unlikely	to

   inute 2	risk	conflict	with the United States.	((	v

Re	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the  ^Mft^clearly been

Biilippines widespread intimidation of voters during the PresidentiaV^e^ection in the Philippines on 7 February. The counting of votes -	could

speak of &quot;counting&quot; in the present context - was continuirf^y/Jf seemed almost certain that the incumbent President, Mr Ferdinand	would

be officially declared the winner. It seemed equally certain^wi^k the opposition candidate, Mrs Corazon Aquino, would have won the ia  ^tion,


   /*vv\	if it had been genuinely free. Mrs Aquino&apos;s supporters were planning

demonstrations. There was risk of violence from the extreme left of the political spectrum. The situation was calm at present but could deteriorate. Unrest could create circumstances in which the armed &apos;^^/   Nforces might seek to take over the Government. The United Kingdom had &lt;&apos;0\VS^|p active role to play in relation to the situation in the Philippines, the United States faced a difficult problem. President Reagan ^/2&gt;gti&gt;ed to have been influenced by the evidence of intimidation during (Ofe Vlection towards a position which was more critical of President The United States would clearly keep a close watch on the situ^fon but it was hard to see what positive action the Administration couI^  3fee.

llran/lraq War THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there had been a minor Iranian offensi^SNagainst Iraq across the Shatt-el-Arab waterway. Iraq    Previous	had now regained a(^l the territory to the west of the waterway except an

(Reference:	area around the^fc^i  \of Faoi, which it was still trying to win back.

   CC(85) 13th	The Iranian of fen^rye/had not done serious military damage to Iraq or

   Conclusions, increased the Irah-t^iothreat to Kuwait. It was not clear whether the fcinute 2	offensive would be ^aQ^^ed up by further Iranian attacks. Iraq had

called for a meetingC^ir^Oe United Nations Security Council in the week beginning 17 February.

louth Africa THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH^B  j    TARY said that there had been discouraging developments in 5owwp  ifr ica in the past week. The previous	President, Mr P W Botha, had reVtok^Xis Foreign Minister, Mr Pik Botha,

Reference:	for speaking of the possibility o6at Jrouth Africa might one day have a

KC(86) 5th black President. The South Africai^^^sternment&apos; s commitment to equal Conclusions, educational opportunities for all r    ^5ynad been qualified. Chief llinute 2	Buthelezi, a black leader, had declin^/^   join the proposed Statutory

Council. The United Kingdom had encouMged President Botha to create a momentum of reform. The Commonwealth Group of Eminent Persons was preparing for a first visit by some if its members to South Africa, perhaps in the following week. It appeared that both the South African Government and black South African leaders warfredxSthe visit to go ahead. The important question of the release from pnw^n^af Mr Nelson Mandela, the former African National Congress leader, haaoBe^n discussed in meetings between Mr Pik Botha and the United Stax^ea^^istant Secretary of State, Dr Chester Crocker. South Africa was ap^^wmAly linking this question to that of the release of an officer of the/Kdfah African armed forces held in prison in Angola. It was not clear wt^roei&amp;

Mr Mandela was insisting on staying in South Africa, if &apos;p^^*ere released. It was possible that South Africa would likev^i^fWease him from prison if a satisfactory formula could be found. Me^oWn^e, Mr Pik Botha and Dr Crocker were also discussing the question of Hirf*(fiT^fr ican


   withdrawal from Namibia in the context of withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola; despite optimistic reports in the media, it was not clear whether progress had been made.

   WASTE	(H) on the disposal of radioactive waste.

THE LORD PRESBBENlpylF THE COUNCIL said that an effective nuclear policy depended on a cr   a&apos;Q&apos;fFyfe policy for radioactive waste management.

Following exhaus Cs  ue^xP&amp;s cuss ions of the matter the former Secretary of State for the EnviMjwWni had made an announcement in January 1985 that set out the GovernmeofrJ^Juroposals for the disposal of low level and intermediate level wa^peVvThose proposals involved the Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Executrj^  (NIREX) in submitting at least three alternative sites for tHe^  ^5  osal of low level waste which was the only type of waste currently a&amp;Jwhte. The proposal was that these sites should be subject to geologi&lt;^Cvycploration under a Special Development Order made under negative re  oMjir^on procedure. In the light of the explorations, the number of	^J&gt;bat would then be put forward to a

full planning inquiry might be	NIREX had now formally

submitted Elstow (Bedfordshire),	(Lincolnshire), Bradwell

(Essex) and South Killingholme (LTncjy^nshire) as the sites to be explored. The final two sites on	st were coastal ones and there

was a variety of reasons for this, inM^awjg the need of the Ministry of Defence to have a coastal site for theod^posal of reactor chambers from decommissioned nuclear submarines. It Iras crucially important for the Government not to be shaken off its nuclear power programme, and anything that could be reasonably construed as weakness in the face of anti-nuclear sentiments could have very damagiogispnsequences. On the other hand, the four sites in question were n  1 ia)remote areas and proceeding with their exploration for radioacrvJCe^S^ste disposal could create a political ferment. As it happened all me hjites were in constituencies held by Government supporters:	processing with the

exploration of the sites might well cause the polittaj^^f the Labour Party and the Alliance parties to consolidate yet mov^^vpngly against the nuclear programme; Government support might well p^ov^wnreliable in the House of Commons; and there would be a distinct poss^W^ty of an unmanageable political situation both within and outside^rarjjiament.

This was an issue of major national importance that H hadxEw^Mlt able to resolve. The, very difficult, choice identified by H ap^a^e  . to be between proceeding with a Special Development Order for the


   submitted sites and avoiding the damaging controversy he had described by establishing yet another strategic review of radioactive waste disposal.

/.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that he fully agreed V^hat whatever was done should not prejudice the Government&apos;s nuclear vorogrammes. The proposal to proceed with several site investigations, line with his predecessor&apos;s statement, would on the face of it hf&amp;meT the most cost-effective solution. He doubted, however, whether Vhe^^yernment would command support for the necessary Special DweLroihent Order. Since it would not be feasible to compress the geowfgis3ft explorations into a shorter time scale than the 12-18 months propoi^yh^ NIREX, he concluded that the possibility of exploring these sites ytyytne present time should be dismissed. The alternative of establishing an authoritative new review of waste management was also profoundly unattractive. It would suggest that the Government had no confidence in the policies professed by Governments since 1976; it would be seen as a repeat in the face of the anti-nuclear lobby; and it would risk provoking/zie^ignations from the Government&apos;s advisory bodies. He therefore pro^gjd^-tH^t his colleagues should consider a new suggestion, not so far put t(//ilV)\hat NIREX should be instructed to undertake an urgent feasibilir^^ldy of the possibility of constructing disposal facilities in under^/fea/^galleries such as were about to be brought into use by Sweden. Such/gafferies would be much more expensive than the relatively simple factt^Tes for low level waste envisaged in current policy (the Swedish gallp^^Sy. which were about to open, took three years to excavate and cff^^iaaut   100 million) but a main purpose of a feasibility study would bK^tp^^plore their cost in more detail. He believed that NIREX would a^ete&amp;a decision on these lines, since disposal in under   sea galler^es^ias not contrary to consensus scientific opinion and it should be poss  oys  ^b. argue that this latest technological advance needed to(&gt;e^6  essed before final decisions were taken. A feasibility study might^  iift^anything up to two years.

However the matter was resolved, theiressure for an early statement was now very great.

VS?

In discussion the following points were^nade-

a.	Past and future investment in the nuclear programmes was on a very large scale, and could not be jeopardised. Immediately, a prime concern must be to ensure a satisfa^^^y outcome for the Sizewell Inquiry, on which present plans(iorva developed nuclear power programme depended. The report of ct^^trxNiiry was due in about two months. Detailed evidence had be  j__&gt;g&lt;jfcjnitted on the Government&apos;s waste management policy; if this&apos;prai/undermined there was real risk that the Inquiry might be reopen^t^Kx^iniilarly, any question mark over the maintenance of an effecti^^^^te disposal policy would jeopardise a successful outcome to the&apos;o^&amp;uiry, due to start that April, on the proposed facility at Doun^&amp;^\

b.	Any way forward should take account of the MinDefence requirement. At present one nuclear submarine had beenA\^/\


   decommissioned: by 1992 there would be two more. Facilities would be needed either for docking them or for disposing of their reactor chambers.

))	c. It was important that no indication should be given that the

sites put forward by NIREX were immune from further consideration. The results, including the financial aspect, of any feasibility study were by definition uncertain and no options should be /  ^discarded.

There were obvious attractions in limiting the concern about &lt;^joejrear matters to the smallest number of localities. But there ^5^a-distinction to be drawn between looking to existing nuclear si^er^to provide disposal facilities if they were suitable for geological and other similar reasons, and moving to a policy of storing nuclear waste on the sites where it was generated. The on-site storage of waste would represent a major shift of policy that would ja^ovoke great controversy in the scientific communities. It would Mimry damaging for the idea to gain currency that the GovernmenV^jja^-ccjntemplating such new policies at a time when the Sizewell rejraiVwas awaited.

e.	Any new w^M^isposal initiative must, at all cost, be part of a credible	That implied that a feasibility study for

under-sea gallerxpSoswould be presented not as a departure from the policy announced in J^aary 1985 but, rather, as a positive development of that^ppiipjjy.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing^pO^ discussion, said that Cabinet was in no doubt about the need to s^ie^^rd the nuclear programmes, but that proceeding at the present time^wi^^the exploration of the four sites proposed by NIREX would provoke^&apos;iieg^ee of political turbulence that was not acceptable. In these cirojjBf^^^ices, the alternative of a feasibility study of the use of undersea galleries had a great deal to offer. Since the idea had not been^c^rpinised by all the colleagues who had a close interest, and the cosft implications in particular needed further study, a final decision could	be taken at the present

meeting. The Secretary of State for th^Environment should urgently consult with the Secretaries of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Energy, Defence, Scotland and Wales, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Chief S^c^etarv, Treasury, to see if it was possible to prepare an announcement(pf the feasibility study that would reflect the points made in di  c^^5^n. In particular, it would be important that any such study should(6eie^n as a development within existing policy, rather than ab   j^pVesenting a new policy that would displace the assumptions on whiclP&apos;aysr&apos;^nt nuclear proposals were based. The Secretary of State for tha^^^^^onment should bring forward his proposals for urgent clearance in	approved,

a statement could be made in the following week.

.	Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment

to consult with the other Ministers concerned and to &apos;jl	bring forward his proposals to the Home and Social

Affairs Committee, as indicated in the Prime
