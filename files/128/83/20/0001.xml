PARLIAMENTARY 2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House IaFFAIRS	of Commons in the following week

f	   k

House of	THE LORD PRESIDENlS35^$IE COUNCIL said that, in accordance with the

Commons	decision at the preW/^eek&apos;s Cabinet, he had reviewed the handling of

Privileges	the forthcoming debat4^VW  e Privileges Committee report with the Lord

Committee	Privy Seal, the Chance^V&gt;   the Duchy of Lancaster, the Secretary of

  Report	State for Trade and Indus^^^^uid the Parliamentary Secretary, Treasury.

Their main conclusion haa^iee^J to confirm that the overriding I Previous	consideration must be to     S^Kclear that this was a House of Commons

  Reference:	matter, and to ensure that Kh^i^rnment remained disengaged. This

ICC(86) 19.1 would best be achieved by leaw^J^Iabinet Ministers and other members of the Government entirely free trTvpri^on either side of the issue. That would be in accordance with theVp^e^^nt of what had been done in the case of the recent debate on telex^im proceedings in the House of Commons, and with the handling by t^Ujen Government of the debate in 1975 of the report of the PrivilegesCwwittee in the case of a leak involving The Economist. A free vote $&amp;^erfectly acceptable to the Lord Privy Seal and the Attorney Gener&lt;k   as members of the Privileges Committee.	^

Amendments had already appeared to reduce or remove the penalities proposed by the Privileges Committee. Additionally, he and his colleagues had concluded that it would be welWwojfcch ensuring that the opportunity was taken of using the debate to verthe question of Select Committees being enabled to deliberate inywjWw:. At present they could only take evidence in public. A changfc^ar/leliberating in public would be in line with ideas of open governm?nf/^*pi might induce a greater sense of responsibility in Select CommitteesS^T^fhe Cabinet agreed, a backbench amendment would be tabled to exposeJx^^issue, and steps would also be taken to ensure that the debate too^^ia, account of recent occasions when privilege had been abused to make ^^j^ga^ions of criminal conduct.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet were grateful to

President of the Council for supervising the handling of this	and

agreed with all his recommendations.

to handle the forthcoming debate on the lines proposed by tbe Lord President of the Council.

Social	THE SE&amp;M^WptY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that the Social Security

Security Bill Bill hadvtfeen successfully negotiated through 160 hours of debate in

Standing\  ommittee without any concessions of significance having to be made. It was likely, however, that the Report Stage in the following week would prove more difficult. In particular, an amendment had been tabled by Sir R^jftlon Rhys-Williams MP proposing the indexation of child benefit. Thisf(nad(/a certain amount of support amongst Government backbenchers.	fully seized of the importance of resisting such

an amendment and mad/i reasonable expectation of success.

Presentation THE PRIME MINISTER said that\  hf^yGovernment was facing increasing of Government criticism in areas to which ttftr/wravdevoted substantial additional Policy:	The resources. The most notable ex)amp}  S/as the National Health Service

National	(NHS). It was clear that health,v^o&amp;e^her with education and

Health	unemployment, were the issues thatbecoming increasingly dominant

Service	in the public mind. It was vital	measure of the Government&apos;s

achievements was put forcefully acros^/^r co-ordinated operation was needed to ensure that the facts were m&amp;(e more widely known, and all members of the Cabinet would need to participate in such an exercise.

In discussion the following points were made -__

a.	It was important to involve the Govm^jim6ol   11 s supporters both

in Parliament and outside in such an exercij&amp;d      &quot;lknd to see that it had a strong local dimension. Photographs	hospitals and

indicators of local improvements with which pep^e^could identify made a greater impact than quotations of natioivaa^&apos;hatistics, impressive though these were.

b.	An obstacle to effective transmission of thisMafcifSAge were the vested interests within the NHS who would always catraa^rpsfor whatever provision was made. The Opposition parties om^u^always promise better provision, and the Government faced thevprab&apos;bem that their achievements were now being taken for granted.

necessary to counter the lobbying of Members of Parliament/&amp;y yv


   various NHS interests, by ensuring that they were in full &apos;V^T&apos;v	possession of the facts relating to their particular areas.

ms	c. Part of the problem stemmed from the underlying reallocation

of resources between health authorities:	it was a classic example

of the losers in such an exercise being more vociferous than the gainers. More might be done to mobilise support amongst the Vy1	latter. It was also important to stress that this reallocation was

long-standing, coherent and deliberate policy to match resources A&apos; jm need.

Other areas of Government success would also benefit from such Waa^nent - for example, the provision for pensioners. It was a n^able achievement that the Government had been able to protect the^position of pensioners despite a severe economic recession and a substantial increase in the number of pensioners. The continued reduction in inflation was of particular benefit to pensioners.

The Gover^iniaht also had an excellent record on provision for the disabledLi v

THE PRIME MINIS^^^^pynming up the discussion, said that the Cabinet agreed that there^ijmjJ be a concerted effort, involving all members of the Cabinet, to ensuro^eiaat the facts of the Government&apos;s achievements in providing additiorc  l0^sources for the NHS were presented as effectively as possible^/^here would need to be a strong local dimension to such an	Other areas of Government achievement

might benefit from simif^o^T^tment, but the immediate concentration should be on the NHS. SheptfMfW discuss how best to carry this forward with the Lord President of&apos;wifer/j8bunci 1, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Secretary of   $^fi  e/  or Social Services and the Paymaster General.

The Cabinet -

3.	Took note, with approval osyfhe&gt;Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion,

4.	Noted that the Prime Minister, in consultation

with the Lord President of the Council, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Secretary^jE^vState for Social Services and the Paymaster General, ^Duld consider further how the Government&apos;s achievemenc&amp;Dmigfrt best be presented.	((	))^

Channel	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that opponeng^jiXthe Channel

Tunnel Bill Tunnel Bill had been exploiting procedural dif f icultiesM^iirder to

prevent its progress. He had been working, in close conshri      Myon with the Parliamentary Secretary, Treasury, to overcome these ji^ob^epss and he hoped that it would be possible to complete consideration os^hfer Bill by the Standing Orders Committee early in the following week, so I^Nthe


   Syy\ Bill could have its Second Reading in the House of Commons soon after ^Y/Y\ the House returned from the Spring Adjournment.

PRIME MINISTER said that it was essential that the Bill made \SJPl  9&amp;ress     The opponents of the measure needed to be reminded that the   &lt;?t  ^&gt;ruction of the Channel Tunnel would stimulate private sector ay^eMiture on infrastructure of some   3.5 billion and create 65&lt;^0&apos;Uman-years of work spread through the country.

Demonstra- THE HOME SECREtARY^said that demonstrations against Mr Rupert Murdoch&apos;s tions in	printing enterpS^^-ih Wapping continued every few days. The violence

Mapping	of the demonstratt^n^J^and their demands on police resources, were

rising, and the sitrttJraLon appeared to be getting beyond the control of the Society of Grapff    jM^md Allied Trades (SOGAT). It would not be right for the Governnfcj)  rt\seek to influence the dispute that underlay the demonstrations, but cWle was a need to bring SOGAT and the police into closer liaison. At^Jmekting the previous week with SOGAT representatives and LabourOlempers of Parliament the Minister of State, Home Office, had asked SOG  Wr^  y^ecognise that violence was the inevitable outcome of theseVo^raued demonstrations, but SOGAT&apos;s response was that they had ntf^Wrway to promote their cause within the law.

m

Prisons	THE HOME SECRETARY said that talks had^^tinued between the Permanent

Dispute	Under Secretary of State, Home Office, ^nd representatives of the Prison

Officers&apos; Association (POA). The Government&apos;s position had now been Previous	set out in a letter, which had been made available to Parliament in a

Reference:	Written Answer. The POA were claiming that thevjaad won the right to

CC(86) 19.1 negotiate manning levels that lay at the hear fiytfTvtheir campaign, but

the Home Office letter made it clear that thiSyWa^-aot the case. It was expected that the POA would ballot their members/ro^Wll off their mandate for industrial action after their annualV^gf^g^ence the following week. The report by PA Management ConsuJ&apos;Mfirc^ on shift systems and complementing in prisons had confirmed tn^^e level of waste was of the order of 15 to 20 per cent. The pub^rt^Mon of the report had been timely. All in all, the situation was dp    j&quot;oping in a reasonably satisfactory manner.

   3- THE F0RE1GN AN0 COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that a Jordanian FFAIRS	citizen, Mr Nezar Hindawi, was in custody, having been charged with

&amp; 	xonspiring to commit murder through the destruction of a passenger

&apos;s   -^VVLrcraft in service. The case was sub judice. The trial might not take V^\WpL;e for some months. In the course of the investigations, the police .obtained evidence which suggested the complicity of the Syrian dfifemodties. The Government had asked the Syrian Ambassador to waive ttie^/da^Lomatic immunity of three members of the Syrian Embassy in Loiraop^so that they could be questioned by the police. The Syrian Gove^raailib had refused to waive diplomatic immunity, and had placed unacceMpote conditions on any police interviews with the three members of the NEarassy; they had therefore been asked to withdraw these three officiary In retaliation, the Syrian Government had requested the withdrawal of three members of the British Embassy in Damascus. The action taken by the Government was generally seen as sufficient. There had, however, baeiksome first reactions, for instance in the United States and Isr^el7)\hat this incident showed that Syria was just as much involved in spoq2A*jl*g international terrorism as was Libya. Snap judgments of this(/icin)a could lead to suggestions that the international community should fc^g^^asures against Syria on the lines of those taken against Libya. The^q^s^ion of Syrian complicity in international terrorism was now, ho^ero^. being considered more carefully in the United States. Any qtfeii^cra. of measures or action against Syria would be very difficult for the/^K&amp;ted States, as well as for other countries. For one thing, the UniteO^VfaMis needed the help of Syria in seeking the release of hostages still	Lebanon.

Nuclear Power THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECR^CRY^aid that the broadcast on the Disaster in previous evening by the General Secr^^^ry of the Communist Party of the the Soviet	Soviet Union, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, ^S^TOe Chernobyl disaster had not

Union	added significantly to the available v^fon^fcation about the affair. The

broadcast had been an attempt to restoi^the international credibility Previous	of the Soviet Union. Mr Gorbachev had proposed international

Reference:	arrangements for early warning of nuclear accidents; in this, he

CC(86) 19.1	appeared not to have gone further than ideas already in the minds of

Western governments. He had extended the morat^?JiiiD on nuclear testing by the Soviet Union until 6 August, the anniv  sa*  of the nuclear bomb in Hiroshima; this was a transparent propaganda^foiwwhich might not arouse much response.

In discussion, the following points were made -

a.	The special monitoring arrangements introduce&lt;r^Kj&gt;the United Kingdom as a result of the Chernobyl incident wouiqv^eBably be discontinued before the following weekend. The lev^is^ai^some individual readings from the monitoring in the periou-^xh^^V^^1   disaster might attract attentibn. In general, the polxiro^lN repercussions in the United Kingdom of the disaster seem^^t^Jmve been less great than those in the Federal Republic of Germaety^Cv . where the Green Party had gained considerably in the opinionajp^s.


   &apos;em b. Mr Gorbachev&apos;s broadcast had been well calculated to give an impression of concern at the disaster, and there was a possibility SS ))	that its propaganda effect would be considerable.

South Africa THB^FQR&amp;IGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Commonwealth Group of	Persons was currently visiting South Africa. It was too soon

Previous	to preto^t^he result of the visit.

Reference:

CC(86) 19.2	^

In(jia	the FOREIGN AiWx^OTOiONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Prime Minister of

India, Mr Ra j ivOafiHln., had reshuffled his Cabinet for the third time in Previous	18 months. The i^w-TOfteign Minister, Mr Shiv Shankar, retained his

Reference:	existing portfolio ^^/cpmmerce; he was thus likely to be influenced

CC(86) 18.2 considerably by	the Ministry of External Affairs, who were

notably critical of t   ^p&apos;vHr&amp;ted Kingdom.

%

Visit by the	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NflRTJlERN IRELAND said that during a visit to

Secretary of	the United States, which had^M^yn the previous day, he had been well

State for	received and had met consideratj/M^wi^ers of key political figures,

Northern	including some of the leaders of bije^emocratic Party who were most

Ireland to	interested in Irish affairs. He Tia^^Tgued that, against the background

the United	of the specific mention of extradithe declaration on terrorism

States	issued by the Tokyo Economic SummitByvoJ^y, it would be a serious

matter if the proposed Supplementary	ition Treaty between the

United States and the United Kingdom w^ke not concluded. It was now generally recognised among politicians m Washington that the proposed Treaty should be concluded but the debate continued on the form it should take. One possible compromise, which wa^&gt;currently receiving attention, would be to bring the text closer /interline with the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. vtri^^Hnuld a presentational rather than a substantive change^ TM outcome of the debate remained uncertain.

Another aspect of United States attitudes to Northe^p^P^land gave cause for concern. In various State Legislatures in the UM^^j^^tates there were moves to pass resolutions forbidding the pension fuww^of the States concerned from investing in companies whose subsijtfianaes in Northern Ireland did not observe the so-called McBride prsfcEw^^les.

These principles had been put forward by Mr Sean McBride, l^a^ie^of the Lenin Peace Prize as well as the Nobel Peace Prize and some\ti*Je/Chief

vTvL&gt;r\a short discussion, it was noted that the visit by the Secretary of pf for Northern Ireland to the United States had received positive in the British media.

United States In dissttssjon, it was noted that the Government were doing everything Tourism in	possibie^&gt;o counter the very serious reduction in the numbers of United

the United	States tourists visiting the United Kingdom, caused partly by absurd

Kingdom	exaggerations in the United States of the risks from terrorism in

Britain and on British airlines. The Prime Minister had raised the matter with the^Bfiited States President during the Tokyo Summit and had spoken on Unitjadanates television, stressing that British cities were far safer placV^wrafl many American cities. The Foreign and Commonwealth Seci/etaDT had also spoken to the United States Secretary of State, Mr George	The British tourist authorities were working

to persuade more Am^XcaJis to visit this country. This would be difficult; for one t^ujg^othere were vested interests in the United States, such as the ddarf^^rc tourist industry and the retail petrol companies, which would g^di^Srom a boom in domestic tourism. The drop in American bookings on l&amp;rtnah airlines had contributed to decisions by British Airways and Britis^v^dXdonian Airways each to declare 1,000 staff redundant. The record&apos;^o&amp;&apos;^ritish airlines with regard to safety and to air piracy was to dat^impeccable, and far better than that of other airlines, such a AlitalMy^WCLch some Americans considered more safe. The good record of Briti4  a^r&apos;lines should be stressed as much as possible in public.

Workers&apos;	Electricity Coupe-il and the unions in the electricity supply industry

Negotiations had now reache/vastalemate. Public presentation of the situation had concentrated oV^^he   sejection by the unions the previous day of the 6.2 per cent pay /offer from the Council but the real area of difficulty was the lack of	on the question of a new bridging grade between

industrial staff antPxnepengineers. This was being strongly advocated by the Electrical El qcj&amp;ptiLC, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union, as they wanted their membief^Ki allow to do certain work traditionally the preserve of the engineers    or that reason the grade was being equally strongly resisted by the^dji^cnricity Power Engineers Association. It was still possible that	might be found to accommodate both

parties, though it was diffra*  r^to see what this might be. There was, however, still time to explo^HfClD possibilities, as the first step in industrial action - a nationalvfn^a^ime ban - was not due to take effect until 25 May. For the present l(p&apos;&apos;tnfcWht it would be counter-productive for the Government publicly to be^afejwivolved in the dispute.

In discussion it was argued that if&apos;^K^^eal cause of the problem was an inter-union dispute, there might beVM^kntage in publicising this fact. The current media concentration  *! pay levels was more likely to lead to blame for the breakdown of talksoand possible future industrial action being attached to the Government. Against this, such publicity would lead to the two unions becoming entrenched in their positions and thus make the dispute more difficult to resolve^^It was not thought that the unions concerned wanted to take industrial action if it could

be avoided.	COL

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion saftfrKwLC the Cabinet agreed that the inter-union dispute should not be	epdy&apos;ghted at the

present time and that the Government should not becow^mro^icly involved in the dispute. The situation, however, needed to be monj^sred carefully, and urgent attention should be given to the jg  jK  e    ation of the Government&apos;s position on the issue.	\\v/.
