   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House of Commons in the following week and that the House of Commons would ^FFAIR  &apos;	rise for the Spring Adjournment on Friday 23 May until Tuesday 3 June.

%	SB

f	PRIVY SEAL said that a Report from the Committee of Privileges

f101186	wSid^e published that day concerning the leak	to The Times in December

Commons ^	198g/6t&gt;$he draft Report of the House of Commons Select Committee on	the

l^tee	Envit^toent concerning radioactive waste. The Environment Committee had

Commit	refer^^he matter to the Privileges Committee	when they had been

ReP  rt	unable^^Stentify the source of the leak. The	Privileges Committee	had

cons iderecthe matter and taken evidence from	the	Chairman	of the

Environment Committee (Sir Hugh Rossi MP) who	had	reported	the view	of

the Committee that the leak had caused &quot;substantial interference&quot; to its work. The Committee had also examined witnesses from The Times. They had admitted th^?~tihey were fully aware that in publishing their leak they were comUtirfL breach of privilege but they had offered no apology and no rri]raTCT\ information as to the source of the	leak and	had

refused even to erclOT^vany category, such as	the	staff of	the House, as

the source of the le^rf/Jhis attitude had much influenced members of the Committee, and thagreed, with Mr Tony Benn MP dissenting, to recommend that Mr Ricft^Os^ans, the author of the original article, should be excluded from tfo^alace of Westminster for six months; and that Lobby passes for Thd^frfl&amp;s should be reduced by one for the same period. The voting in th^^prf&amp;ittee reflected cross-party support for this action. Mr Benn&apos;s diss^mi^ad been based on his opposition to the Lobby system and to the appliia^Hi of Parliamentary privilege to this area as a matter of principlethan as a comment on the particular circumstances of this/^  K He proposed that the Report should be debated shortly and in a^  fl^-key fashion. He would make a purely narrative and factual speecn	would stress that it was a House

of Commons, rather than a Governmen^P^mgfcter. It was important, however for the credibility of the	Committee that its

recommendations should be carried, gi  6  *he strong feelings expressed not only by Chairmen of Select Committe^ but also by the members of the Privileges Committee itself.

In discussion the following points were made

a.	The Report would provoke strong adve&lt;2ie^  I*nment in the media, and it would be difficult to avoid the GoveWnm^Ht being drawn in.

It would, not unreasonably, be presented as&apos;s*n-^ey^r-reaction and as an instance of the House acting in a self-impW&apos;V&amp;^and pompous fashion. There were frequent leaks from Goveriterav^epartments which also caused serious problems and it was diMfi&amp;tfW: to see why leaks from a Select Committee should be regarded a^^Jtferently.

b.	The attitude of the Labour Party towards the Re^B^&amp;ould no

I	doubt be conditioned by the current industrial disput&lt;^OPimes

Newspapers.	I


   &amp;11/P	c. The action proposed, and especially the penalty on Mr Evans,

seemed over-severe. One course of action might be to ensure that an amendment was tabled to reduce the penalties.

V/O)	d. The whole question of the use and abuse of privilege might

bear further examination. To defend privilege in this instance, in the wake of recent cases where Members had abused privilege to make allegations of fraud and other crimes, reflected badly on the /  ^Rouse.

TH^PRifte MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet full^cejj^gnised the very difficult position in which the Lord Privy Seal ^SSyoeen placed by the voting of members of the Privileges Commit	The Report would, however, generate adverse comment in the

media aiiijCit was important to ensure that this did not reflect on the Government. The matter would need very careful handling and this should be considered further by a small group under the chairmanship of the Lord President af-^the Council, consisting of the Lord Privy Seal, the Chancellor of   Ke&apos;nuchy of Lancaster, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry ai^tfcs^Parliamentary Secretary, Treasury. The group should consider t/He^Vrangements for, and timing of, a debate on the report including xb^rfOestion whether an amendment should be tabled; it should also conside^j*p    her it would be helpful to stimulate a wider consideration of Par^&amp;ifektary privilege. It should report back to the Cabinet at its next

I	The Cabinet -

1.	Invited the Lord   We\)ient of the Council, in conjunction with the Lo^dJP|5^.vy Seal, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaste^TpJ&amp;Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and thd^Par&gt;Wmentary Secretary,

Treasury, to consider furth^^ilraUhandling of the Report, taking account of the points	discussion and

in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing^j^/ and to report back to the Cabinet at its next meeti^g^&gt;

Hong Kong	THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that th  r^\was a serious risk of

(British	a Government defeat in the House of Lords on (l(heJHong Kong (British

Nationality)	Nationality) Order when it was considered by tira^Swse on Friday

Order	16 May. The House of Lords rarely divided overytjpojAon to approve an

affirmative instrument or to annul a negative insT^FjjWitf but there was no set convention and there were a number of preceaeW^ior a division. In this instance the Opposition did not wish to be	divide on the

Order itself. They had, therefore, proposed to move a Mp&amp;on calling on the Government to withdraw the Order. The effect of tKe^&lt;J^on, if carried against the Government, would be to require theWfWawal and re-laying of the Order. The Opposition&apos;s particular conc^OA this instance was only with that element of the Order which aff^c^e^^pthnic minorities. The non-Chinese ethnic minority (mainly IndianS^/^j^


   concerned at their future status once the Lease expired and wished to be &apos;   ^\Yv granted British citizenship, whereas the Order granted them British

S/y\overseas citizenship. The business managers in the House of Lords would VX)Vio all they could to avoid a division and to win the vote if a division called. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Home /^&apos;Se^retary were assisting him in this objective but he must warn the that feelings in the House ran high on the issue and the 4ra  M|Ajlity of a defeat could not be ruled out.

In dJ&amp;cOAsion the following points were made -

position of ethnic minorities was one of three issues that hatfXejpl raised by the Hong Kong Legislative Council. On the other two^Pthe grant of British citizenship to some 500 former servicemen who fought in the Second World War and the question of a special endorsement on passports - accommodation satisfactory to both parties had been reached and this had assuaged opinion in Hong Kong to a e^raiiderable extent.

b.	It was^ri&lt;iP~^tossible to give selective treatment to this particular eOMiliAJninoTity. Nor could it be argued that the numbers involv^j^yere small in immigration terms. If all who had a possible avenue	present status of British dependent

territory citizew^SreM taken into account there would be some

80,000	potential immrjg  ^its.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summin&amp;jjo/^he discussion, said that the Cabinet agreed that the Government iff$i  i^wroceed with the Order while noting the difficulty that could occur	House of Lords. The Home Secretary

and Foreign and Commonwealth	should give what assistance they

could to the Lord President of OT^U&amp;uncil in persuading backbench Peers that rights of ethnic minorities^lp^H^pg Kong were already safeguarded and the additional protection of	citizenship was neither

required nor justified.

The Cabinet -

3.	Took note.

Prisons	THE HOME SECRETARY said that following the endinfefofljindus trial action

Dispute	by the Prison Officers&apos; Association (POA) the pre^Mjjre^week,

discussions had taken place between the Permanent tui^^ppSecretary of Previous	State, Home Office and the national executive of the(5ji^\ The

Reference:	discussions had gone reasonably well and were continirafig^k^&apos;urther

CC(86) 18.1 developments would be influenced by the approach of the^iWXonference at the end of that month.

The Cabinet -	  

4.	Took note.


   THE MINISTER OF STATE, DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT, said that, &apos;   Clea&gt;&lt;0&amp;\S contrary to the indications reported at the previous week&apos;s Cabinet, the clQud of radioactive fall-out from Chernobyl had reached the United ih   S0V1   ^V^Kingdom on 2 May. The radiation was generally nowhere near the levels Jnl0tl	which there was any hazard to health, but as a result of heavy rain

^-^ftVjorthern England and Wales and parts of Scotland it had been previous	riate to warn people against drinking fresh rainwater over long

r0161   18 2	19*?&apos; The latest information was that the ultimate residue of the

:!C(86&apos;	*	raraiiktive cloud had returned to the United Kingdom, but in so

atiep^Qad a form that even heavy rain would not lead to any significant incraa&gt;  ?in radiation levels. The Secretary of State for the EnvirOTafi^b had made a statement in the House of Commons on 6 May setting\WV&lt;he arrangements for keeping the situation under review and making     /  fear that there was no significant threat to health in the United Kingdom. Co-ordination between Departments was now working well. The Department of the Environment had set up arrangements to provide a clearing house for information put out by the Government on the matter and the Ministry^-crK Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which was responsible forf  h  jmonitoring and control of foodstuffs, had set up an incident room. X&amp;ir^binet Office, through the Civil Contingencies Unit, had establi^hed/arrangements for the interdepartmental consideration of pa3&amp;jrayissues.

In discussion the foloints were made    

a Radioactivity was^Gtely seen as mysterious and threatening, and it was very diff  &amp;l  )to present the facts in a way that was both scientifically v  tM^hd readily understandable by the general public. Telling illust^db^Ms of radiation levels, and easily grasped explanations of	levant scientific concepts could,

indeed, be devised, but tfnV/^&amp;d of public education exercise could not be done in a hurry^^X

b.	There was no reasonable doj$  ^h.at the type of reactor at Chernobyl was far more dangerou^^^Wi anything that would be authorised in the United Kingdom.X^2er the less, the view was being put about in the press that there wre similarities between the Russian reactors and the Magnox realtors in the United Kingdom, m respect of their provisions for containment. That was to ignore a number of important differences, particularly the fact that Magnox reactors operated at a far lower temperabdreXthan did the type ||| reactor at Chernobyl. If, however, a pu^VicV^mpaign against Magnox reactors gained momentum, there wouT|y1&gt;w\serious implications for British energy policy. OnV^pAfot that could prove difficult was that Italy and Japan both had	amount of power

produced by Magnox reactors: and it was possibl^^frat they might be forced by public opinion into closing them downwould be little more than a gesture in the circumstances of&gt;^^.countrieS but it would greatly increase the difficulties of fl^fidung Britain&apos;s own, much larger-scale, use of Magnox reah^rV^ The Secretary of State for Energy had asked the Chairman	Central


   Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) to prepare a statement as soon as possible, defending the Magnox reactors against false comparisons drawn from the Chernobyl disaster.

c.	Although Magnox reactors in the United Kingdom had a very good safety record, and were operating well within their margins, they were now some 30 years old and were giving rise to frequent minor episodes. Any campaign against them would be likely also to involve the reprocessing plant at Sellafield with which their fuel    V^upply was intimately related.

Domestic and international responses to the implications of Chernobyl incident interacted in a complex way. This was     rf^dially difficult to predict while the full scale of the disaster might not yet have been appreciated. One case in point was the European Community regulation for a temporary ban on the import of certain foodstuffs from various Eastern European countries :^-fchis might not have been altogether soundly based in scientif  ftayms but it had been inescapable politically. It was possible\^haj^&gt;as better information became available about the disaster, p|  s^jre would build up for a closure of all similar reactors invfcjl^/Sfoviet Union. As international activity developed, so domestic	might increase and change their focus. A

further signif ic|w^Pternational factor was the forthcoming election in the itfih^e^lands, which had led the Government there to suspend all decisioj*^a1i their nuclear power programme until more was known about thlv&amp;iMent at Chernobyl. The harmonisation of Government lines in Xy^wfese dimensions needed subtle handling.

e.	While it was impor^otr^hat the nuclear energy programme in

the United Kingdom shouli&apos;W/^igorously defended, it could well be counter-productive simply (//wt on Britain&apos;s good record, and to blame the Russians for what	happened. Public confidence in

nuclear energy generally had ujj^wHrtedly been shaken and the best way forward, with which the CliSo^^ of the CEGB agreed, would be to aim to restore confidence thrOTcj^ sustained programme of education. The Government&apos;s presifoistance should be to avoid complacency and to await full analj^is of the Chernobyl incident before making statements or giving reassurances which subsequent developments might prove to be ill-founded.

f.	The Government would shortly have tf/talka line on a further

development in the energy field when the	the Severn

Barrage project was published. This projec^RjgpVW be very expensive and uneconomic by normal criteria^-^J^yATliance parties had already indicated that they were attracteda non-nuclear energy project that would also creae^^^^rge number of jobs. It could figure largely in criticism of the ^^ear programme, and it would need to be handled with gra^M^wie as the end of the present Parliament approached.	V-&apos;VO&apos;N.


   THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up Che discussion, said that the Cabinet had noted a wide range of implications of the Chernobyl disaster, and further ones would certainly become apparent. It was essential that   ^oA\the Government&apos;s nuclear energy policy should be defended and preserved, yC^v^bilough it had to be recognised that genuine public anxieties had been \^6Kkrked off by the Chernobyl incident. Those anxieties would be played vTorodft by the opposition parties; in particular the Labour Party would do could to impede the nuclear programme in an effort to strengthen t^^Xkition of the coalminers. Satisfactory interdepartmental arraijggwgnts for co-ordination had now been established, but Cabinet colleagues would need to keep the developing situation under careful revie&lt;25*&gt;ensure that vital interests were protected. It was very importaoV^pttBt critics of nuclear energy should not be allowed to make all the ^Wining, and that Ministers should give careful attention to the presentation of the scientific facts in language that the public could understand*

FOREIGN	2. THE FOREIGN AND COMM^^^TH SECRETARY said that Mr Babrak Karma 1

AFFAIRS	had been replaced as the Uadjkjc   i the People&apos;s Democratic Party of

---	Afghanistan by Lieutenant ^^LNajibullah. The new party leader was

Afghanistan	young. He was a hard liner.^ad earlier been head of the secret

police in Afghanistan. He clWW had Soviet backing. His appointment was unlikely to alter the policww^^ituation in Afghanistan or the prospects for Soviet withdrawalcountry.

%&gt;

South Africa THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY\Xaid that the Commonwealth

Eminent Persons Group had met in London&apos;from 30 April to 1 May. There

Previous	had been talks with a senior South African official during the meeting.

Reference:	The meeting had gone well. The Group saw some hone of progress in the

CC(86) 18.2	reply which the President of South Africa, Mr/T^5iypotha, had sent to

their proposals. The Group would shortly visH^S  *^ Africa for detailed talks with the Government,. They might Msdjvisit Lusaka to talk to the African National Congress. MeanwhilV^BMsident Botha had been in touch with the seven Heads of State or Gov^wfe^t who had participated in the Tokyo Summit the previous weekeq^^his South African approach had been discussed among the ForeignC^T^Uiters of the seven countries participating in the Summit. It had beepg&amp;eaT that the seven countries were unlikely to agree on a statement whS  if)iould be acceptable to President Botha or to the Commonwealth couft^Ws\ The outcome had been a bland reference to South Africa in thp raa^ifcan&apos;s


   summing up at the Summit, which had called for a peaceful end to apartheid and expressed support for international efforts in this direction.

% ...

MINISTER said that the Economic Summit in Tokyo the previous

The Economic	^	the most successful that she had attended in this

Summit m	seRiS?&gt;NThe fact that several topical subjects had required discussion

Toky0	had wJgJiL in making the Summit effective. The points about economic

Dolic^S^ch the Government had for years been proposing for inclusion in thee%*i^hic declarations at such Summits were now included as a matter ot&lt;course. There had, however, been no progess on the problem of Japan&apos;s t&amp;de imbalance, although the recent appreciation of over 40 per cent in the value of the yen would have useful effects in this reeard. The Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone, had wishe to set a limit	appreciation of the yen, but this had not been

aereed. There (had&lt;bgen discussion of the problem of protectionist pressures in vart^^puntries. It would be important to secure a new round of negotiatSW/*der the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Tradeshould cover inter alia trade in services as well as in products^    JsfcouId cover the trading aspects of intellectual property^rfl^: at present many countries were able to ignore with impunity pate&amp;A^ranted under the law of other countries.

On the question of agric&lt;i^% surpluses, it had been very helpful that the Summit had not producl^JLrsarial debate between the United States and the European Community^^&amp;tskies; instead, all the participating countries, including Japan, \  ^COgnised that they supported agriculture in various ways,	they should seek together a

solution to the common problem .^^icultural surpluses. On terrorism, the draft declaration which had oi^j  %lly been submitted by officials of the seven countries had been u&amp;acp^tably weak. The United Kingdom had put forward an alternative dra*  &lt;fl&amp;ficials had then proposed a mixed version, which had been strengTi^fe^further at British insistence. The resulting declaratioA^f represented a significant step forward. On the disaster at the   %iet nuclear power plant at Chernobyl in the Ukraine, the Summit had issued a sensible declaration, which had pointed out that each country engaged m nuclear power generation bore full responsibility for the sa^E  ** of	design, i

manufacture, operation and maintenance of ltsr^ns^a a 1.0 s, states had responsibilities in the field of nc^ie^r&gt;?a e y no their own public but also to the international (^mmjMity.

In discussion the following points were made -	&lt;&apos;7^\

a.	The considerable achievements of the SummiMisi^ot been fully recognised in the British media. In particular,

between the seven powers on the question of terrork  rfs  ould be welcome to public opinion. It would be helpful if	wou

seek to draw wider public attention to the achievemen^O^the

Summit.


   vll/?	b. The 40 per cent increase in the value of the yen, which had

taken place over recent months, had been caused very largely by the depreciation of the United States dollar from the very high level it had reached in February 1985. There was, however, scope for some autonomous appreciation of the yen in relation to Western European currencies in the coming period.

\

nf THE^fGflk MINISTER said that she had visited the Republic of Korea (ROK) lepublic	f	^ aJ; the end of the previous week on her way to the Seven

Korea	Power^sS&amp;iX in Tokyo. The Prime Minister of the ROK, Mr L S Yong, had

told hev&gt;&lt;irat it was hoped that the country would catch up with Japan&apos;s Tfl^nce:	standard^ living in 15-20 years. Modern, efficient industrial plant,

12	2 coupled with extensive automation and excellent management, was more *	important among the reasons for the ROK&apos;s economic progress than were

the lower wages pa4  d to workers there than in the industrialised democracies. Twttfoople of the ROK remained immensely grateful for the part played by&apos;iheJ    ited Kingdom in defending their freedom during the Korean war. It w^fwojrth remembering that 1,100 British lives had been lost in that war,in the Falklands conflict. The ROK today lived on the frontia^^fc/^reedom, while North Korea was a closed society where the people were/ttStt&amp;pusly denied information from outside. With a population of 40 mil&lt;  %%pd a rapidly growing economy, the ROK represented a significant^^et to which the United Kingdom should pay more attention. During	Minister&apos;s visit to the ROK, orders

for naval command and comm^ji^^.ons equipment worth   30 million and for the refurbishment of two bla^bv^naces for steel making worth   3.5 million, had been clinched. \\

   

Saudi Arabia THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE	he had just paid a visit of

three days to Saudi Arabia. He had reW^d a very warm welcome, and Previous	the attitude of the Saudi authorities &apos;t&amp;Zr&amp;s him had become even more

Reference:	favourable during his visit - apparentl^ecause of the rejection by the

CC(86) 7.2 United States Senate of the sale of United States military missiles to Saudi Arabia. The objective of his visit had been to mark the delivery to Saudi Arabia of the first six of the Tornado^krcraft to be supplied to that country. It was impressive that thes^fai^raft had been delivered within 60 days of the signature of tlie^dpfeement and that Saudi pilots and crews had been able to lay on aW^fellent air display of the aircraft&apos;s capability. The Saudi authorifie^Wd agreed that British service personnel attached to the Saudi anfen/^^ces could maintain the same legal status as before, under whickgji^were not subject to Saudi laws. It was significant that none isf WiJ&gt;Saudi interlocutors had raised with the Secretary of State f01  M^Pce the recent United States military action against Libya.	\^)y\


   In a brief discussion, the following points were made -

a.	The Saudi authorities were clearly conscious that, given the fall in the price of oil, they would have to think very carefully * about what imports they could afford. But it was not clear that they had yet adjusted fully to their new financial circumstances.

There were prospects of further important defence sales to /^/&apos;S&amp;udi Arabia, notably for Challenger tanks, submarines, aircraft artillery.

m ttie Tornado sale had originally been seen as a cash deal. The Saw^S/bad later sought other arrangements, including payment by meaM/vf oil supplies. Saudi Arabia would be likely, in the contact of further possible sales, to press for offset arrangements and perhaps for further payment in oil. The Government would need to adopt a very cautious attitude on the question of accepting payment in   ij.
