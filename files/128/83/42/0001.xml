THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that the Scottish teachers&apos; unions had now informally agreed to a package on teachers&apos; pay and conditions, the^be^nns of which were acceptable to the Government. It was likely tha^/the) package would be formally agreed by the Scottish Joint NegotiatiQgy^jmmittee the following day. This progress towards a resolution of the/TissUe was most satisfactory.

HOME AFFAIRS 2. THE PRIME MINISTER said^harjw^he Cabinet had discussed on

-   	23 October the difficulties crthe publication of the United

Publication Kingdom Regional Development Prdgiamijk that had been submitted to the of Evidence	European Commission. She had now&lt;p^ca|yed a	full report on the process

in Support	of preparation of this programme an^^fje^way	in which it was made

an	public. It was clear that those in	in	the preparation of the

Application programme concentrated on its main pur^s^of making a case for support t0 the	from the European Regional Development wnd,	and that only two of the

European	ten Departments concerned took steps to Wake	sure that the document was

Regional	read with an eye to the fact that it was in due course likely to become

Development	public in this country. Part of the problem was that so many

Fund	Departments were involved and that the materi^&apos;wAk so voluminous. She

had drawn two general conclusions from the repoct^^i-First, material Previous	being prepared for publication should be scrutrSya^dYlfor its political

Reference:	sensitivity, as well as for accuracy, comprehensr^  rta^A and clarity,

CC(86) 34.2	bearing in mind the likely reception of the materia^^^all the

audiences that would read it. Second, responsibilitj/^p^Nthe final clearance of material for publication should not be de^Cwiwi below a certain level and officials to whom such material was suhrfrcted for clearance should consider whether the content and sensiti5/Ky) pf the material required it to be cleared by a Minister. These c^trM^kions applied both to material produced by a Department which it MMMied itself and to material produced for incorporation in a publiMt^Um by another Department.


   There was a further and deeper question as to whether it was necessary or justifiable to commit so much time and effort to the preparation of the programme for submission to the European Commission, and she believed that an approach should be put in hand to persuade the V-&lt;&gt;xSommission to scale down their demands for information.

PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that the Cabinet ^am^kd that material that a Department proposed to publish should be submitted for clearance to Ministers and should not be cl^rfecjikfor publication without reference to Ministers at a level lower thatr^rajlfi 3. Material for publication should also be cleared with the Depa  f  ^c&apos;s chief press officer. Material for Ministerial clearance should )be/  abmitted with a note on anything in it which seemed likely to be poliwpally sensitive and difficult. The Cabinet also agreed that the amount of paper demanded by the European Commission in the context of the Regional Development Fund was altogether excessive, and that an approach should be put in hand to persuade them to scale down their demands.	//n

The Cabinet

1.	Took note,^om^pproval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of the^rajteussion.

2.	Invited the Secrp^rary of the Cabinet to draw departments&apos; attentM$n/fa\the arrangements decided for scrutinising deparciHBjvfcal publications, and to arrange for an approady^O^e European Commission

to be put in hand, as indiwftd in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.

Unemployment THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT&amp;ri^hat he would be announcing Figures	that day the seasonally adjusted &quot;headiiw^&quot; figure for unemployment had

fallen by 20,000. This was the first ye^jr since 1973 when unemployment had been lower as than at the start of the year. Job vacancies had also increased again. His own view was that unemployment would probably continue to fall, but he did not expect it to edPShlow a total of 3 million by summer or autumn 1987, and nothing Bmouu   be said to encourage reports that the Government might entfe^^friNsuch hopes.

In discussion, it was noted that the fall in unempTtS  Mfeoit had on this occasion taken place across the country, including t(oikyi&amp;&amp;n Ireland. Moreover, the figures for long-term unemployed and fOT^wS^qployed young people had begun to fall.

   FOREH^C^	3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the affair

AFFAIRS	concerning United States arms sales to Iran and the diversion of money

__	t0 the Contra rebels in Nicaragua was still receiving great attention in

United SbA  pG/y  the United States, though the position of the United States President ^-^V&quot;&apos;  eemed to have strengthened recently. There would be further Previous vCva  iasational reports in the media if suggestions were confirmed that Reference:	&apos;v^f^4*itenant Colonel Oliver North, formerly of the White House staff, had

CC(86) 40.3	u&amp;etivsome of the money from arms sales to support right wing candidates

Yny^e^recent elections to the United States Congress. Meanwhile, the Urn/ted&apos;/States Secretary of State, Mr George Shultz, had been able at the meeMftg^f the North Atlantic Council on 11 and 12 December to give an effecty^elemons trat ion that the United States Administration intended to main  ^n business as usual.

North	THE FOREIGN A  WuCMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the meeting of Foreign

Atlantic	Ministers of tKgvj^SIhers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation

Council	(NATO) on 11 and ( 12 December had issued a communiqu   which, like the

Meeting	communiqu   from &apos;^K  i^  eting of NATO Defence Ministers a few days

earlier, had upheldv&apos;rtt  /  osition on arms control which the Prime Minister had set outv^KHistatement following her meeting with the United States Pres ideirtsbtYl^mp David on 15 November. This represented the best outcome on armv^Mphrol that the Allies could have achieved in the wake of the meeting ari^ReWjavik between the United States President and the General Secretary	Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

The North Atlantic Council Ot  &lt;^jvhad also made clear the concerns of the Alliance about the imbalance x^f^aonventional forces in Europe and the the need for arms control in rt  ygM  eld. There might nevertheless be some people among the European Gdvajraments who hankered for the visionary idea discussed between vfe frftited States and Soviet leaders at Reyjavik of abolishing nuclear weap^^^within ten years. Indeed, Mr Shultz himself did not seem entirel^-^5^nave abandoned this idea. At the NAC meeting, he had reaffirmed tha(Ai*^ted States commitment to Europe, saying that this involved threevVibligations:	to maintain a

surviveable strategic force able to strike the Soviet Union, to maintain credible United States forces in Europe and to consult closely with the European Allies on policy matters.

Suriname	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that cq^kMteyable upheaval

was taking place in the small South American state 0  ^5*  (name. The left wing dictatorship was faced by growing insurrectvrt^&apos;vThe United Kingdom had minimal interests in Suriname; the few Unitpd^^gdom citizens there were included in United States evacuatioir^ni&apos;ans which would be put into effect if necessary. The United Kingdos^  a&gt;k&apos;&apos;6upported the Netherlands in an approach to the United Nations Secret^lpyrS^neral about evidence of widespread atrocities during the troubles &apos;in^Suriname.

%


   ak of	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Government of the

&lt;5 uttS^  ^ca	Republic of South Africa had imposed new restrictions on the media and

  U	undertaken widespread arrests. The State President, Mr P W Botha,

Previw^o  /\ seemed to be in a very instransignet mood. In a South African raid on Referen^^^^ Swaziland on 12 December, two people had been killed and four abducted; CC(86) 4xG^&gt;Othose abducted had included two Swiss citizens who had quickly been &apos;^^f/p*le as ed.

&apos;   &apos;^d^febwe and Zambia had not yet enacted the sanctions declared at the yjomrfg  wealth Review Meeting on South Africa in August 1986. They had see the economic effects that would result for themselves, and th^^W^Lognised that Swaziland, Botswana, Lesotho and Mozambique could not Q^raSduce sanctions, and that Kenya was against them. There were now retorts, howevet, that Zimbabwe and Zambia might make a move towards the inrerruption of air links with South Africa in the near future. The nature of the move might be influenced towards moderation by President Moi of Kenya. There would be a South African response to such a move, but it might/for^be an unrestrained one.

m

Anglo Soviet THE FOREIGN AND C^^W^LTH SECRETARY said that the British Ambassador Relations	in Moscow, Sir Bryan^^fMedge, had called on the General Secretary of

the Communist Party OTWi^goviet Union, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, on 15 December to convey the ^^^NMinister1 s reply to a message about arms control. The call, whiow1ia)0 lasted li hours, had been the first by a British Ambassador on a SW^cNLeader since 1963. It established the important principle of rec^ri?wc&amp;v of access for Ambassadors, though this would not be easy to ma^nj^Cyi. Mr Gorbachev&apos;s remarks to Sir Bryan Cartledge had shown his respe^^Wj^the Prime Minister as a figure in international relations. The nfciiT^bviet message had been dissatisfaction with the positioi^OT^he United Kingdom and France regarding nuclear arms control since^Mr Gorbachev&apos;s meeting with the United States President at ReyjaviK^-&apos;^fi^Gorbachev had used some vigorous expressions in making his poV^l^^and Sir Bryan had responded effectively. There had been no sign inOlr Gorbachev&apos;s remarks of concessions from known Soviet positions^ But it was healthy that a lively dialogue was taking place between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union.

International THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Ex    wO?^ Board of the Monetary	International Monetary Fund (IMF) would that day ch^^A new Managing

Fund	Director to succeed Monsieur Jacques de Larosi  re. Trni^^faad been two

candidates for this position, which traditionally was ^^W^ed by a European. But after a &quot;straw poll&quot;, in which he had receuf^only 28 per cent of the votes, the Finance Minister of the NetheW^^VV Mr Onno Ruding, had decided to withdraw. The new managing directaX^^a^ihe IMF would therefore be Monsieur Michel Camdessur, the present G^  jniwcof the Bank of France. This would mean that three major interna^w^kk


   posts - the Managing Directorship of the IMF, the Secretary Generalship yp of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the

Presidency of the Commission of the European Community - would continue to be held by Frenchmen. Mr Ruding&apos;s disappointing result in the V-l^oXstraw poll&quot; had been caused by changes of position by the Anglophone \V^A&amp;ican countries and by Saudi Arabia. Most of the European members of NV/$l/j   und would have preferred Mr Ruding. Monsieur Camdessus did not nWgKth.e. calibre or strength of his predecessor. The departure of

de Larosi  re, and that of Mr Paul Volcker from the chairmanship ofMfh^Smerican Federal Reserve Board in 1987, would remove two most effes^pjjtfSleaders at a time when the difficulties concerning interrnrt&amp;oijal debt problems were likely to become even more intense.

COMMUNITY	4. THE FOREIGN USs  &amp;f  IMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the agreement

AFFAIRS	which had been reacfe^i^ the Agriculture Council at its session on

---	13-16 December, under(&gt;^^Ahairmanship of the Minister of Agriculture,

Agriculture Fisheries and Food, wav^^jost important reform ever achieved in the operation of the common ag^  j&lt;hltural policy. The result was a very remarkable achievement byVwieyMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and by all his team.	f icult negotiations on milk and beef

had been brought to a conclu^ar  m&gt;^T t would be necessary to ensure that the decisions now taken were x)pH#^ed through and that during 1987 further attention was also giv  $yM^  he cereals sector. Furthermore, the fact that the Council had rev^ec^hi the invocation of the Luxembourg compromise by the Republic of Irel^f  a^   one stage on the complicated negotiation on beef showed that the ^wcgjnbourg compromise retained its value and, despite this, an agreemenC^j3*/ still been reached in the end.

The Cabinet -

1. Recorded its warm appreciation of the successful efforts of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisjigries and Food as Chairman, the Minister of State, tteffratry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr Gummet\Lr)  ^  e sen ting the United Kingdom and their official team ufy    nieving substantial reform of the operation of the cxWson^s agricultural policy at the meeting of the Agri^iytmxe Council on 13-16 December.	/

Fisheries	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had just^  ^ived a

report that the Fisheries Council, again under the chairmansn^^o^ the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, had reached a sat^Sd^r  ory agreement on total allowable catches and quotas for 1987.


   Trad  v&lt;^\ THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Foreign Affairs Relatidia^Hv Council on 15-16 December had received a report from the Commission on with theX^o\the negotiations under article XXIV.6 of the General Agreement on United St%    s)Variffs and Trade (GATT) with the United States about the effect of the and Japan x^r^l&amp;pession of Spain and Portugal on certain United States exports to

countries. The present deadline for a settlement was 31 December \&gt;LVfw and no settlement was in sight. The Foreign Affairs Council had

that negotiations should continue; had suggested an extension of tne^^dline to the end of January 1987; and had reaffirmed that the Com^  ni  ^ would respond with retaliatory action if the United States unil^^errgJrly imposed restrictions on Community exports. It was impor6art  /to maintain the firm stance if the negotiations were to be broughtsuccessful conclusion.

In discussion it was said that the United States might not agree to an extension of the deadline. If so, the Community would clearly have to respond to any Uijjj^ed States action, but should do so in a measured way. In due course Lyiniraht be necessary to consider whether binding arbitration migt^t- oft-proposed but this question did not arise immediately.

THE SECRETARY OF STATRADE AND INDUSTRY said that he had had a further meeting with lyje^i^panese about their response to the Community demand for removal of   Ul^rMninatory elements in the Japanese tax structure on alcoholic drirf    &gt;. He was doubtful whether the Japanese offer would be satisfact(^^in)d, if this proved to be so, the action under the GATT should be pu^rfr^dN.

In discussion it was said tha^o^iier recent contacts with the Japanese had shown a risk that they miglMfy^p^kider that the recently announced order by All Nippon Airways for vHe^MVbus allowed the Japanese Government to be less forthcoming ^ircmaning up the Japanese market in other respects. This would need to^lj^rgsisted.

   

Employment THE PAYMASTER GENERAL said that the Social Affairs Council had now

agreed on an action programme on employment in tgrms which were wholly satisfactory to the United Kingdom. The Commis^rfra   would be putting forward proposals in relation to long term uneMdOTniient, training, small businesses and deregulation. The work would be d&amp;frytd forward by the Belgian and Danish presidencies in 1987. An impo^t^uj^Vresult would be that the Social Affairs Council would no longer be ^ji^pping its attention to the earlier unsatisfactory proposals on/e&amp;k&amp;sive protection for employees.

In discussion it was said that some trade union interest^^anOohe Community had been opposed to the new approach. It was vejy&gt;v&apos;\ satisfactory that it had now been adopted.

w.


   ydgtfSSrt	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that the Transport Council on

15-16 December had taken a step forward on the liberalisation of road haulage. On aviation there had been a modest advance; there had been a unanimous position in favour of some action on airline capacity and greater support for the United Kingdom position on easing the conditions vO^J^applicable to cheaper fares, with both the Federal Republic of Germany vi/^r/and Belgium attacking the French position on this point. The Council reached an important agreement on the liberalisation of shipping, adpAiing all the measures under discussion with the exception of that on vdabp  age. The Council would return to this point under the Belgian I^  ^d  tficy. British shipping interests were pleased with the result and ttK   ral Council of British Shipping had sent a warm letter in suppMiOtff it.

AIRBORNE	5. The Cabinet had before them a nosVJppthe Secretary of the Cabinet

EARLY	(C(86) 24) covering three memoranda byv&apos;fife Secretary of State	for

WARNING	Defence (OD(86) 20, 21 and 22), and the^iinutes of a meeeting	of the

AIRCRAFT	Defence and Oversea Policy Committee (OD) on the previous day	(OD(86)

9th Meeting), which had also discussed the choice of an airborne early warning aircraft; as well as a letter from the JMsmaging Director of The General Electric Company PLC (GEC) to the Prit/a&apos;^Mi^ttister dated 17 December, and a draft for a statement by the S^ejeiiaisv of State for Defence in the House of Commons.	(QL

THE PRIME MINISTER said that OD on the previous day^il^r^greed to recommend to Cabinet the proposal set out in the memq  ^jira\by the Secretary of State for Defence.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that an efficien	ne early

warning capability was essential to the nations&apos;s security^Vs^fc   it would enable the Royal Air Force (RAF) to respond in time to&gt;^Trtweat from aircraft or missiles approaching the United Kingdom. GrNourw-r^adars


   were inadequate, since their range was limited to 50 miles. The Nimrod \ system, produced by GEC, presented significant advantages:	it was

^\British, it was cheaper than the American alternative and the Government /jnad already spent a great deal of money on its development. GEC i^&gt;^^cognised that it did not meet the RAF&apos;s requirement at present but ^   ViVimed that it would do so by 1989. It was, however, the unanimous &apos;WjiW of the military and technical experts in the Ministry of Defence XMqfe&amp;that Nimrod would not attain the standard before the mid-1990s, if tM&apos;n^/Jiy 1989 the production of the alternative United States system, the&lt;#6e&gt;&lt;&gt;g E-3A, would probably have closed down and no alternative would^^^available. It would be wrong to take the risk that the RAF might ^r^wrece ive an adequate system.

The Managing Director of GEC had called on the Prime Minister and on the Secretary of State for Defence himself. The Company had asked to see the MoD&apos;s assessments of Nimrod or at least that independent assessors should lie appointed and a decision delayed while they produced a repo/xT&apos;Y\But the MoD&apos;s assessments had been undertaken by highly qualifieaN  e)  ie and had been based on the same information as the assessments bV/GEOl

The customer must ul&lt;  ima  Aly decide which product to purchase. His conclusion was that tb(  ^  ^ks to British and NATO security in continuing with Nimrod were unaccd^f&apos;^pt^. The Government should decide to cancel the contract for Nimrod and!/{&gt;&lt;&gt;n elude negotiations with Boeing to purchase six 3-A airborne&apos;^^rcTw warning aircraft, with an option to buy two more within six months&gt;&lt;^&gt;w  Nof these aircraft would just be adequate to fulfil most of ttf  ^onvted Kingdom&apos;s share of the NATO requirement for airborne earlj^jMfJ&amp;ning capability. The money to buy the E-3A&apos;s would be found from the &apos;  yJtefing allocations of the Defence Budget; the decision whether to	the option to buy two more of

the aircraft would be taken in the&lt;iigfr   of further study of the budgetary implications.

In discussion, the following points weMipe -

a.	The arguments for purchasing E^oA aircraft set out in the Secretary of State for Defence&apos;s memoranda

were extremely strong. The RAF must be projiided with reliable equipment which met the requirem^nrfTyV

b.	The United Kingdom&apos;s existing airborne /e&apos;^rM warning capability, which consisted of Shack&apos;ijetpp^aircraft with detection equipment of very old design, wgir^oj/Avery little use against a threat from modern fast aiircJpMjKor from missiles. In addition, the Shackleton aircraft n(igi^Miot remain useable over the period until Nimrod aircraft of adearabe performance became available, assuming that ever hap&amp;CTiem.

c.	The Secretary of State for Defence would say, in statement announcing the purchase of E-3A&apos;s, that the co^t^  &lt;xuld


   be met within the Defence Budget. The difficult question whether the money could be found within that budget for an additional two E-3As would be a matter for the Secretary of State for Defence.

d.	B ing had offered a contractual obligation to place orders in this country worth 130 per cent of the cost to the Government of buying E-3A&apos;s. B ing&apos;s record in carrying out obligations to &lt;\ make offset purchases was very good. The orders they would place X&lt;^in this country would include high technology work. Some of the orders would create jobs in the regions, and not only in the more ^p^gr&amp;sperous areas of the country.

^e^^/&apos;xhe Secretary of State for Employment would be ready to issue, a^Ker an announcement by the Secretary of State for Defence, a statement showing that the effect of switching from Nimrod to E-3A&apos;s on employment in this country would at worst be neutral and could be positive.

f.	ThMpreventat ion of a decision to buy E-3A&apos;s would be very

importanr^^trsNSecretary of State for Defence would make a statement &amp;A.ain the House of Commons, immediately after Question TimS^^He would then give a press conference and would record interviewp^ror television and radio. He would be available to spejMCrfiXa debate in the House of Commons that evening, if one wervMrald. He would write a letter to all Members of Parliameife^^Bout the decision and would provide speaking notes for	ulse of all Ministers.

g.	In presenting a d^i&apos;^pin, the Government should refrain as far as possible from cr&amp;j^    ing GEC. References should be made to the Company&apos;s high standwig^t^Xa supplier of other systems to the MoD, and to the high volum^^of^chnt business.

| h. The Government would be askpn why a decision to abandon Nimrod had not been taken sooner. A fterga-CM.e reply would be that the Government had been reluctant to }apap&lt;J)Dn the possibility of buying British. There would be stS^e^stions that the management of the project by the MoD as well GEC had not been satisfactory. The Secretary of State for Defence could admit this, and could say that the MoD would not nowadays enter into a contract or management arrangements of the types thpi&quot;j*ad applied in this case.

i.	A decision by France to buy the E-3A was/praftable, particularly since a demonstration of NimrodFrench Ministry of Defence on the previous day appeared to have^beep^insuccessful. The Government could point out publicly that sucl/a^djhsision by France could somewhat reduce the cost of the E-3AUnited Kingdom. It would be desirable to warn GEC, when thej^wp   informed of the Cabinet&apos;s decision, not to refer to demonstration on the previous day since it would not D^-idJ/iHae Company&apos;s interest for the negative impressions of the Fj?^ircn\ customer to become known.	vV


   In discussion of the draft of the Secretary of State for Defence&apos;s y\statement, various amendments were suggested, including that simple    ^language should be used and expressions capable of misrepresentation ^xg^ould be avoided. The point should be made that the contract with (^  qaiing would denominate the price of E-3a&apos;s in sterling.

MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that, despite the adj^ntaaes of purchasing a British system, the risks of renewing the cont^kccs&gt; with GEC on Nimrod were too great. The RAF must be assured of gettin&apos;^  q-H.ipment to the required standard as soon as possible. The Cabine^^&amp;reed t;hat six Boeing E-3As should be purchased, with an option to buy t^o^pore within six months. The costs would be found from the existing ^jfrovisions for defence. The Secretary of State for Defence&apos;s statement rn the House of Commons that afternoon should be amended in the light of the discussion. Ministers should as far as possible avoid criticising GEC. -They should be guided by the Secretary of State for Defence&apos;s stateniaffEyand the briefing material which he would provide. Ministers appeaK^Ae^oo television and radio in the coming days should ensure that they waferaully briefed.
