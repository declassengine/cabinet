AFFAIRv&apos;v&gt;&gt; of Commons in the followin   week.

leutt Reporw&amp;^PRIME MINISTER said that she understood that there were unresolved &lt;t^i&gt;(  &gt;J.ssues arising from Mr David Calcutt&apos;s Report on the iv^Tp^iations carried out by the service police in Cyprus in 1984. It was^wipwtant that the Government should have a clear line on any signi^Kdaiit matters raised by the Report before it was published. If that	that its publication had to be delayed for a week or so, no

harm woSva^  fesult. The Secretary of State for Defence should take this forwardVrconsulation with the Attorney General as necessary.

Civil Service THE CHANCELLOR OF THE^fejtEQUER said that agreement had now been Pay	reached, subject to fd^^^tification, with the main Civil Service

unions on an increase	pay of 6 per cent as the pay settlement

for 1986-87. This was sl^gJw&gt;MC more than he had hoped but was less than settlements in recent mont5   ^__jin^. local authority manual workers and teachers and was below the\y^gNe of settlements in the private sector. He realised that this would &amp;i\p)passure on departmental running cost limits but he must emphasise c^^jMjprtance of maintaining these limits, particularly in the first year of/^ftation of the new scheme. It had been recognised when limits had	for 1986-87 that pay increases

might create pressure upon them, ttejje^ieved that the limits would hold if colleagues took offsetting actioix^w^N If there were exceptionally difficult problems for any particulaM^partment the Chief Secretary, Treasury would be prepared to considerin the autumn but he would have to resist any but the most exceptional cases. To prevent further pressures on limits, he must ask colleagues to resist further claims for additions above the agreed level of pay rates for particular groups on management grounds. If, however, there were casgs where increases were necessary, these must be included within the mairfr^y settlement for

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion\^-e^&lt;ft that it was essential that running cost limits were maintained	lep*peptions to

this should be avoided if at all possible. It was	for^

Departments to take offsetting action so as to be able&lt;^n^^ve within limits. The Cabinet noted the Secretary of State for	and

Science&apos;s concern at the implications for the science	fh  

knock-on effects of the settlement for the pay rates of sd^e^&gt;  ^s employed by research councils and universities. He should	this

further with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

   The Cabinet -

2.	Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.

3.	Invited the Secretary of State for Education and Science to discuss further with

Chancellor of the Exchequer the consequences \rortAthe settlement for the science budget.

   Disturbances THE HOME^ECRETARY said that serious disturbances had taken place the lin the Prisons previous day at Northeye, Lewes, Wymott, and Bristol prisons, and

Erlestoke youth custody centre. The disorders had been brought under    Previous	control at all these establishments except Northeye, which had been

   Reference:	badly damaged by^tye and where prisoners still remained on the loose

IcC(86) 14.1 within the pris  m_perimeter. Prisoners had escaped both from Northeye and from Erlestoici/v^h5mie had been recaptured, but others were still at large. At Br istolUthke/police had quickly and effectively taken control of the establishment

The cause of the disorqd^T^d been the decision by the Prison Officers&apos; Association (POA) to ban o^^^ime working by their members. This action, in furtherance of&lt;i^^YOA&apos;s industrial relations objectives on which he had reported to CaAipej^at their meeting on 10 April, had raised tension, encouraged inja^^^ to disorder and depleted the resources available to deal wwEvp&lt;\ The key industrial relations issue was the way in which manning le^M^jjere settled. There had been hopes of reaching an agreement the pre\/ro&lt;reOweek which would have avoided industrial action, but these had oepji^qs&amp;shed when the POA refused to call off their action. The most tffetypik POA had been prepared to do was to offer to suspend their action(^hri    &amp; talks continued. They had not disowned industrial action that	up at Gloucester and

other prisons. In the circumstances h&amp;Arpa had no choice but to call off his talks with the POA while they marotained their present attitude. There had been a mixed response to the requests that Governors were now making to staff to resume normal working, but it would be unwise to underrate the lengths to which the POA would go^--&amp;r the tradition of loyalty to the POA among prison officers.

He had made a holding statement to the House of CmimoHs the previous evening and would now need to make a fuller one, esSjjijH^ing the background, offering reassurance about the maintena*Ce^%?&amp; security, and dealing with the questions that would doubtless be ra^s^d^^bout the need for some kind of inquiry. The main point on security wi^epsuring adequate liaison with the police, who would need to keep .  jipf&apos;icient manpower and anti-riot equipment available. If it was nefr&amp;dsaVy to operate armed forces camps as temporary prisons, emergencyxi^ppi^lation would be needed, as it had been in 1980. One matter that wori^^njEed careful consideration as the dispute developed was the fact CMjkw through an unintentional result of the drafting of the Act, thvrypjp


   I	lacked immunity from civil action for damages under the Trade Union and

Labour Relations Act 1974. It would be a delicately balanced judgment whether to exploit that adventitious situation by seeking an injunction ^^)iagainst the POA pending the trial of an action for damages against

vjE*fc/PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that contingency ^^  iements had been activated under the Cabinet Office to co-ordinate tW$^ernment1 s handling of the situation in the prisons. The Lord Pre&amp;aefo of the Council would chair a group of Ministers to supervise these&apos;^rirpangements, in her absence at the Tokyo Economic Summit. In additMJ^n the Home Secretary, the Secretaries of State for Defence and EmploymMK^he Chief Secretary, Treasury and the Attorney General would need to involved. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland would also be cbhcerned since the POA had extended their industrial action to Northern Ireland, where there had been minor incidents at the Maze and Belfast prisons on the previous day. The widest range of responses I	would need to h^a^hlysed, including the point mentioned by the Home

Secretary aboutUthd/  OA&apos;s lack of immunity under industrial relations legislation.

The Cabinet -

4.	Took note, W^^&lt;A^proval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing i^^^^their discussion.

5.	Noted that the	Resident of the Council

would take charge of tfe^^ordinating group of Ministers that the PrimAVfwv^ster had described.

I FOREIGN	2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SKrajdiJgp said that the recent

I	AFFAIRS	accident at	the complex of nuclear	poWw/^j^tions at Chernobyl in the

--	Ukraine was	a very serious event.	Thevta^e in one of the reactors was

I Nuclear Power probably still burning. The Soviet Unioi bad released too little I	Station	information	too late. It would be	a blow to the credibility of the

I	Disaster	in	General Secretary of the Communist	Party of the Soviet Union, Mr Mikhail

I	the Soviet	Gorbachev.

I Union	if

It was not yet clear how many people had been	The Soviet

authorities were still claiming that the figure \/asj^nly two. There was a high risk of widespread damage. An area of twradius around the accident could remain uninhabitable for two yea^^^/^^t much greater distances there could be risks, for instance through Mr^^onsumption of milk; but the levels of radiation outside the Soviet H^i^j^p^ere unlikely to be harmful. The United Kingdom and other countries had^j&amp;fered advice and assistance to the Soviet Union but these offei^^iaj   not so far been taken up. The Government had advised British&apos;^fe^^eiHts at Kiev and Minsk to leave the Soviet Union. The Soviet autho^^&amp;^^^were not placing obstacles in the way. The British Embassy in Mo^cjy^would


   be willing to advance the travel costs of students, if necessary. The f students should be able to leave the Soviet Union that evening.

h THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the type of nuclear reactor ^    jSyolved in this accident, which had originally been developed by the /Wai^itary in the Soviet Union, had always been thought by the Central &apos;v&amp;  #^tricity Generating Board to be dangerous. The heat in the reactor levels more than double those in any British nuclear power sThere were some 15 reactors of this type operating in the So\&lt;i  rj^9ion. Reactors of this type would not be approved for use in they^Ksdv. Kingdom. He had confidential information that a British firm had bifliirji&amp;^ked two years previously by the Soviet authorities to evaluat^/xi^h type of reactor and had produced a very critical report.

He wouldCbe making clear in public the differences between the Soviet reactor i&amp;question and the types of reactor in use in the United Kingdom. He would also be pointing out the relevant differences between the political systems in the Soviet Union and the West: in the Soviet Union there were^ir^vpublic inquiries and no pressure groups which insisted on safey2) The safety record of nuclear power in Western Europe - where &amp;V/^\:ent of electricity in France, 55 per cent in Belgium, 25 per cU^Muthe Federal Republic of Germany and 25 per cent soon in the UnitedSgp^jBom was provided by nuclear generation - was extremely good.

In discussion the two majVjx^ifferences between nuclear power in the Soviet Union and in the	further brought out. On the one

hand, the Soviet reactor   fc^hhe disaster had taken place was of a type*which was quite differfeTp^i^om any in use in Britain and would never have been approved for\^s^^vo this country. Secondly, the contrasts between the politic^^fetems in the Soviet Union and in the West had many implications relev^/Co nuclear safety. The public in the Soviet Union was told very lYtt&gt;  ^bout matters of this kind. Inquiries, such as that concernin  ^Si^&gt;ell, were out of the question there. Furthermore, since the publj^jja^he Soviet Union was in no position to insist on safety, the sa^S^measures adopted were far less rigorous than in the West. The contrait^tween the Soviet disaster and the nuclear accident at Three Mile IslatTO. in the United States, where the plant had shut down of its own accorV, was clear. The public in the West, but not in the Soviet Union, was also in a position to insist on proper maintenance of nuclear power stations.

It was felt that the main objective of the Gov^cmnjiat in commenting publicly on the Soviet nuclear disaster should baYfo^aounter the view, which would inevitably be expressed, that the Bri^-i^^clear power programme should be cut back because of the Soviet ^a^^er. The Government should bring out the technical difference^f^een the Soviet reactor in question and the reactors used in the Unitsj^&apos;&apos;^^p  gdom. It would also be appropriate to draw attention to the relevgfft^Ufferences between the political systems together with their implicidgdnA; but this should be done in a way designed to avoid any appearance the nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union in order to make p^G^al points.


   The following further points were made in discussion:

a.	There was no sign and no likelihood of fall-out from the

y\	Soviet nuclear disaster reaching the United Kingdom. Thorough

monitoring was taking place, notably of the atmosphere and of milk.

b.	The Soviet Union had plans to increase by more than 100 per nt its generation of electricity by nuclear power. Despite the

aster at Chernobyl, it was likely to press ahead with those

The Soviet Ambassador had informed the Prime Minister on &gt;j  ^f  revious day that reactors at other sites in the Soviet Union, liS^^&apos;were of the same type as those at Chernobyl, would not be c lA^d^lown.

c.	vrhis event would intensify the demand in the West that the Soviet Union should accept proper verification of arms control treaties. If the Soviet authorities misled their public and the world aboii&lt;^r\&apos;civil disaster, they must be expected to be even more secretive \abpiit military matters.

d.	The Sec  tar^Nof State for the Environment had on the previous day announcedt^Krfyer controls over discharges into the Irish Sea from the SellariajM^power station. He planned to publish on the following day the^otfh^nment1 s reply to the report on Radioactive Waste Disposal bythe^J&amp;use of Commons Select Committee on the Environment. The Gagii^ffljent1 s reply was due to be debated in the House of Commons on iAJJIt might be for consideration whether to delay the publicatibTj/^i^the reply and also the debate, since reactions in present ci^^um^yences were likely to be artificial.

e.	It was interesting thac/  tte, authorities in Poland were being open with public opinion aboup^^ Chernobyl disaster and its effects, in contrast with thiVS^jH^t authorities.

f.	The London Festival Ballet^oSjSpajyr was due to visit the Soviet Union during the following weeken^/^d was considering cancellation of the visit. Cancellation of theN^ntire visit, including the company&apos;s performances in Moscow, was not justified by the nuclear disaster and would appear alarmist. It might lead to suggestions, for instance, that the British Embassy sta  f^in Moscow should be withdrawn. If the company was due to vis^yC^lmother city, where nuclear contamination had taken place, io^magfrfeybe appropriate to propose to the Soviet authorities that the Vrs^Ej should go ahead but include only Moscow and that, if this w4^ira^ssary in order to make the tour financially viable, they should ^d^e^ayments to compensate for the cancelled performances.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that^w^of the most important aspects of this matter was that nuclear contaimM      Qn crossed international borders and that international standards mu\fe-^p^refore be observed. As she had told the Soviet Ambassador on the prey^s^^^day, the Soviet authorities should agree to international inspecc^or^&lt;^E the disaster area.


   The Cabinet -

1* Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion,

2.	Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation with the Minister of State, Privy Council Office, to arrange (J/r Vvfor the London Festival Ballet Company to be v^^^iven appropriate advice about their imminent v^fisit to the Soviet Union.

Change of	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the new Soviet

Soviet	Ambassador in London, Mr Leonid Zamyatin, had now arrived. The Prime

Ambassador in Minister had c^E&amp;ived him, most exceptionally, on the previous day since London	he had brought^ a ^personal message from the Soviet leader, Mr Mikhail

Gorbachev, fo^21^35&gt;ery before the Seven Power Summit in Tokyo the following weekend. ./Mr Zamyatin was a totally different type of Previous	Ambassador from tH^^raredecessor. He was forceful, accustomed to take a

Reference:	hard line, and a ]&amp;a  p^&amp;ional propagandist. He would seek exceptionally

CC(86) 14.2 good access to Britia^KMisters. It was important that colleagues

should bear in mind, ^meih&gt;e^&gt;nsidering requests for meetings with the new Ambassador, that the Br,i^xf  i\Ambassador in Moscow had great difficulty in securing access to seifvfor/party figures and Ministers in the Soviet Union.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing \k&gt;^w/brief discussion, said that colleagues should not agree to see Mr Zamyq^fe^^vexcept when there was a specific reason.

Libya	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETAR&apos;MSaid that Libya had expelled 20

British citizens, who had been engaged&apos;  ! consultancy work in Libya. Previous	This had been undertaken in explicit retaliation for the deportation

Reference:	from this country of 22 Libyans who were revolutionary activists.

CC(86) 17.4	Members of the British community in Libya wey^&apos;Ca^tinuing to leave the

country, without panic. The Government had infprjnad British Caledonian Airways (BCal) that it had no objection to thet^umbtion of services to Libya; but BCal had not resumed flights because\th^y^iyad been unable to make satisfactory insurance arrangements. He wouTa^jM^discussing with colleagues later that day other possible measures wl/irw^liuropean Community countries might take towards Libya.	&lt;/vs&apos;v


   th/f&amp;&apos;&amp;e	THE FOREIGN AN0 COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Commonwealth

Eminent Persons Group on South Africa was meeting in London. The South previous	African reply to the Group had been reasonably positive.

CC(86) 17^^brief discussion, it was pointed out that the South African

/VvfiS^ernment had introduced important reforms during the period since the &apos;\Sjjiralonwealth Eminent Persons Group had started work. Members of the Vfomit^were hopeful of achieving worthwhile results; this would encourage

India	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that security forces had

entered tlvte Golden Temple complex in Amritsar on 30 April but apparently Previous	had avoided the sacred buildings themselves. This had been done with

Reference:	the agreement of the moderate Sikh government in Punjab. The operation

CC(86) 14.2 appeared to hav^S^en reasonably successful but it was not yet clear whether the extiremiUt leaders had been arrested or were merely in hiding, or whetne^^th^re had been casualties. The authorities in this country had been Mejted to the possibility of demonstrations or violence by Sikh re^M^iits here.

Protection of THE FOREIGN AND C0MM0NWEAM|^8^RETARY said that, although the United Intelligence States and United Kingdom Gbv^f^ents had revealed carefully selected Sources	intelligence information in ^  raeption with Libya&apos;s support of

terrorism, it was most importcolleagues should continue to be as careful as before not to reve/*^2wtelligence information or to compromise sources.

Supplementary THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN I REMIND stressed the importance of Extradition the proposed Supplementary Extradition Treaty between the United States Treaty Between and the United Kingdom being approved by the United States. It would be the United	helpful if the Prime Minister could raise this wj^h the United States

States and	President during the Seven Power Summit in Tokj^^   Nve following weekend,

the United	      v.

Kingdom	In discussion, it was noted that the United Stata^   AiJministration was

strongly in favour of the proposed Treaty and was^orojiite major efforts to secure the approval of the Congress. The latest^^^^^jjmation from Washington was that the Administration was delaying Ijtt^y&amp;te in the Senate, in the hope of securing a better result.

3.	Took note.	(/Vvv


   r/Z\ 3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the agricultural price settlement which had been reached in the Council of Ministers f -	(Agriculture) on 21-25 April, must be regarded as a considerable

T ituMul/7Auccess&gt; not least for the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Ag51CU ^^^Kere would be a freeze on Community support prices for most products; a Pric   nt ^C^elyction in milk quotas; further curbs in the cereals sector; and Sett eme &apos;v^weat adjustments of monetary compensatory amounts, with a small

in support prices in national currencies in some member states Previous	the United Kingdom. The package as a whole was clearly a cut

rri86)ni7!5 in%c#t in real terms. The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food&lt;&amp;|2^2hicceeded in removing from the package those elements on cereareS^Dfftf and sheepmeat which would have discriminated against Unitedlridguom farmers. The package would reduce the cost of the common agricultural policy by about 320 million ecu (  205 million) in 1986 and about 450million ecu (  290 million) in 1987. This saving was greater than in the Commission&apos;s original proposal. Because of other factors, however, a seriojiSs.budget problem remained. The Minister of Agriculture, Fi&apos;^fieVies and Food had made quite clear that overall expenditure in&apos;^U-aod 1987 must be kept within the 1.4 per cent value added tax (VAT) c&amp;Lim*.

\

Finance	THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCMMP&amp;ER said that the Community budgetary

situation and prospects fra^fjetn discussed in the Council of Ministers (Economy and Finance) on	Although the agricultural price

settlement itself was good,	pressures for higher expenditure on

agriculture and the structuri^Ju^ftis would overturn important elements of the budgetary discipline pa^&amp;Mp^that year; total Community expenditure would go above the	by the reference framework and

the agricultural guideline, althougJP&apos;bAe 1.4 per cent VAT ceiling must of course be respected. In order to^jfc&apos;event a real risk to that ceiling in 1987, further savings must be fon^^^There had been a difficult discussion on settling the reference iranp^ork for 1987 expenditure, but agreement had been reached. The handl&apos;&amp;fe^of budgetary issues during the United Kingdom Presidency in the second^alf of 1986 would be difficult and the European Parliament was not disposed to discuss budgetary discipline.

&lt;0k

Trade	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY	he exPec5ed that

Relations	after the Tokyo Economic Summit the United States wdijQw^ake action

with the	against some Community exports because of the allegeQ^i&amp;^^s to Unite

United States States agricultural exports from the accession of Sparn&gt;  np^Portugal.

He thought, however, that the United States, whose nego^aj  hg position Previous	was not acceptable, were now trying to find a way througl^Thisdispute.

Reference:	More generally, he expected that the President of the	!

CC(86) 17.5 Mr Reagan, would raise at the Tokyo Economic Summit the wid^N^d^stion of agricultural trade and protectionism.	I/)


   \ In discussion it was said that this should not be presented as only a \ problem of the common agricultural policy. It was important to secure as wide a recognition as possible that the rolling back of excessive /j\support and protection in the agricultural sector was a task for all oped countries including the United States and Japan.
