EONOMIC	3. ThSwEJ  ETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the unemployment

FFAIRS	figures 1^%e released later that day were disappointing. The

unemployment total was up by 135,000, which was the largest monthly increase since 1981. More significantly, the seasonally adjusted figure had increased by 21,000. It was still too early to say whether this indicated a chang^Ln the trend, but it would certainly bring the Government undenjpr^ssure. He intended to reply to coscaent by acknowledging tna^/iSis was not good news, but pointing out that it was still too early tcHt^il^whether the trend had changed; certainly other economic indicatorV-jM  fliot suggested that there would he such an increase. There wereAa^articular regional variations which might give an indication of the 6^^^\pnd vacancy figures were down. He intended to point out that when un^p^oyment had been decreasing, the Government had waited for some month^^jwMhvre concluding that there was a new trend.

In discussion it was pointe^-^GT   that the unemployment figures did not take account of the self-empb^yajd/Ar the armed forces. When these were included, the rate of 14.1 per^C^t/xame down to about 12.5 per cent. However, the figures for self-em/rcy&apos;Mnt were only produced once a year on a survey basis and it was difHow^i^to include them in the monthly totals. It was not clear whether ptobJ^Shed unemployment rates in other European countries took account of ^w  ipihatures. In addition, some at least of those countries did not have^aMinjK&apos;aphic patterns similar to those in the United Kingdom. It was aifrd/iuggested that the statistics were an imperfect reflection of the real-world. Both in terms of unemployment and vacancies, there was increasing anecdotal and partial evidence to suggest that there were more people in work and more vacancies than the published statistics indicatje^^. Pi^ot exercises conducted by the Department of Employment in sMec^ed areas had resulted in considerable increases in those admitting tn-ent, although the primary purpose of the exercises was to deal withHtheJproblems of the long-term unemployed. It was also pointed out thafc^K^p employment measures announced in the previous year&apos;s Budget werfy^^. yet fully effective. The reductions in National Insurance con&amp;?viin-ions for the low-paid had only taken effect in October 1985 and th&lt;r   iftfc^ased period for the Youth Training Scheme would not begin until Apri^vv/\

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that tW^ir-rent month&apos;s figures were difficult to explain and would no doub^XSvV^ytise to political controversy. It was, however, important to make^e^faj. the forthcoming impact of the budget employment measures ard the facMr^rw^t


     &apos;ll/? the self-employed and armed forces were not included in the totals.

Further consideration should be given to improving the statistics of ^V^^both unemployment and vacancies in order to reflect what was actually   /i^  iappening. It was always difficult to choose a time to improve the ^r^iasis of the unemployment statistics, since the Government would &apos;^^raeNiitably be accused of doing so for political advantage. If

\&lt;(ie^e  sary, figures could be published which included self-employed at Vbi  /i/ame time as publication of the existing series. The long-term une^afe^Ved pilot experiments currently being conducted by the Department of TSmo^yment in nine areas ought to be extended nationally as soon as possMil^^

dREIGK	4. THE FOREIGN   fe^  jMaONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the National

JFAIRS	Resistance Army (NEal-Wed by General Yoweri Museveni, had in the past

I! 	few days succeeded ra-^e  ming control of Kampala and of substantial

laanda	parts of the remainde^d^Oganda. Elements in the previous r  gime had

defected to the NRA.	was now consolidating its position and

   revious	seemed	to	be gaining as	V  Kfe  ^Lve and geographically widespread a hold

teference:	in Uganda	as any r  gime	had^    &amp;Leved for some time. General Museveni

  0(86) 3rd	had on	the previous day	beewswMrn in as President of Uganda. In his

  (inclusions,	speech	he	had spoken of	the ne&lt;j0^ror self-discipline, the importance of

limite 2	human rights and his wish to	the economy of the country. He

had described himself as a radrwiri^jiut no Marxist and had said that he favoured a mixed economy. While, ^K^rae light of recent events in Uganda, any observer would hesitaret  Af optimistic, there was a possibility that events would now ma more hopeful direction.

The United Kingdom Government had maiffOiw^&apos;ed. their position of non   involvement in the troubles of UgandA^/&apos;ihe Government had good contacts with General Museveni and the Nftithrough the British High Commission in Kampala and also through Major General Pollard, the leader of the small British military advisory team, who was now in Kampala.

The Government should now seek to consolidate th^**vinfluence, and be ready to provide help, for instance with militar/tnaining, on the lines already offered. In dialogue with the Ugandan G^gjaarTraent, the United Kingdom should emphasise the importance of human r/xghos and of stable government.

Plans for an evacuation of British subjects from Ugand^^    ^heen prepared the previous weekend, but it had not been nec^fsair^^fo carry them out. Charter flights were now operating to and from^w  ^^be   n Uganda, and scheduled flights were expected to resume soonw^JJjnLtish subjects in Uganda were therefore in a position to leave tnh&apos;-^^iwtry if they wished.	/v


   Il  m  vCv	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the statement of the

I	Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the European Community countries of 27

Iprevi^VV^n January about combating international terrorism had resulted from their I Referen&amp;+oV\ discussion that day of the United States&apos; request for European sanctions ICC(86) ls^wC^gain8t Libya, in the wake of the bomb attacks on 27 December 1985 at IconclusionvJ&apos;^/&apos;ty   -enna and Rome airports. He had been concerned that Mr John Whitehead,   Minute 3	United States Deputy Secretary of State, had gained, or at least put

(  Kfafot, the impression that the United Kingdom was less willing than o^J  WJluropean countries to take measures against Libya. The statement of\2^^Tanuary now made clear that Governments which behaved like that of LiaigiiSSbld not have normal relations with the member states of the EuroOT/m^  &gt;mmunity; that the Community countries would not export arms or mryiMry equipment to countries clearly implicated in supporting terrorisa; that they would not undercut United States measures against Libya; and that they would establish a permanent working body, within the context of European Political Co-operation, to monitor and give impetus to imni  ISentation of measures against terrorism. It had not been possible(/at  ie meeting on 27 January to reach agreement that Libya should be menh  t  .n^aCS  y name in the declaration. Nor was the wording of the declaration /axaynly as the United Kingdom would have wanted. But the declaration wa^^i-easonable result, satisfactory to the United Kingdom. The Euro^anj^Jbmmunity countries now had a rather more effective posture ag^w^HWvterrorism; and it had been made clear that the United Kingdom was nci  i$s)k willing than the other Community countries to act against terrorism^J^N.

In a short discussion, awas drawn to a report in the British press that morning, which	that Libyan secret agents were among

Libyan ^&apos;students&quot; working atWJj/d^ish airports, notably Heathrow and Gatwick. It was recalled thaV^me^Xnterested Government Departments had earlier considered this matter.v/  h^Nso-calied &quot;Students&quot; were trainees in aircraft maintenance, who werq^rfO  je United Kingdom under commercial contracts between British firms and^tfsja. The Libyan trainees were individually vetted. To break off^He  pprofitable contracts would be against the commercial interests of	firms and of British

Caledonian Airways in particular.

   I	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that there had on the

previous day been talks involving the Chairman of the International Tin ; r	Council about the need for a rescue operation for the Council. The

|C J^2vatter would also be considered that day in the European Community. The I v  ous &lt;?OLestion at issue was no longer whether there should be a settlement but Iference:	much money each participating country should provide. There would

I Dispute	. .

THE SECRETARY 0P^OATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE said that a provisional Previous	agreement had X^BT&amp;^ached, with the help of the Advisory Conciliation

Reference:	and ArbitrationltefvMe (ACAS), to the long-standing teachers&apos; pay

CC(86) 2nd dispute. This ha&apos;^twde main elements: first, a pay increase from Conclusions,	1 April 1985 of 6.9&lt;^^ent, rising to 8.5 per cent from 31 March 1986;

Minute 2	second, an end to di^^Jt^on; and third, an ACAS-managed negotiation for

1986 across pay and oltfid^&apos;wmditions of service, with ACAS appointing a panel of three individuals^** assist the negotiations. The 1985-86 settlement was more than^rf*e\hocal education authorities (LEAs) could afford, and it had been mi^Xl^r to them that there would be no Government contribution towa^dA/^ts cost in 1985-86 beyond the amounts of Rate Support Grant alread^apifi^ided; and a major uncertainty remained in that the largest teachers&apos;	the National Union of Teachers

(NUT) was not a party to the se{tie^nt. The LEAs were expected to ratify the settlement the followi$i&apos;w  k, and the largest union which had been a party to it, the NationaP^Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers (NAS/UWT) would baC^gXioting its members over the next three to four weeks. Thereafter the yp^S^^ment, so far as pay was concerned, would be ratified through ti(cBurnham machinery. Subject to the views of the Cabinet, he proposed tut the Government should welcome the settlement achieved by ACAS, while recognising that it might not be ratified, and that there was a risk of it breaking down at any stage during the wider 1986 negotiation to be underwith the aid of the three-man panel. There remained a very wide gAjJLf^i^tween the unions and the employers on pay levels and the nature of CaMliMS&apos; duties. The Government would need to be ready to step in wit\^_pj^posaIs for some other kind of review or review body if the ACAS se^^wnent broke down or produced unacceptable results. Meanwhile he intendM^i^N^ibe that day to Mrs Harrison, the Chairman of the Burnham Managem^t^Mel, welcoming the procedure worked out by ACAS, reaffirming the GovernpadiVs refusal to provide extra money during the current financial yeaV^^rfiw making clear that the	billion over four years previously	by the

Government would be made available in the event of a 1986 ^  fe^Wjaent which met the Government&apos;s conditions.	syl


   In discussion the following main points were made -

&gt;	a. There was at present no prospect of a settlement in Scotland

corresponding to that achieved by ACAS for England and Wales. The

jj	main Scottish teachers&apos; union, the Educational Institute for

Scotland, was adopting the same line as the NUT, and both unions and employers were agreed that there was no point in negotiations . unless the Government were willing to provide additional money. /v&apos;Y^ie Secretary of State for Scotland would be preparing a paper, for discussion in a group of Ministers particularly adeemed, about possible options for Government initiatives there; vjjejS^se of the risk that a very early initiative in Scotland might uW/etw-atification of the ACAS agreement, no action could be taken uv&amp;Uc the prospects in England and Wales had become clearer.

b.	The Government&apos;s representatives on the Burnham Management

Panel would present the Government&apos;s views firmly and clearly; although UtJJVv could readily be outvoted, the ACAS panel would be aware of /tme/Qovernment&apos; s position. The terms of reference for the ACAS-spons!t0feji^k986 negotiation were generally sensible, and the possibility(of. reasonably satisfactory outcome should not be altogether (rtsmra^ed, particularly in view of the split between the NUT and the	the Government could not afford simply to

wait and see vhij^k^rzed from the new negotiation; they would have to review the prKrv^s to be attached to their various education objectives, and th^^raftld have to consider what their reaction should be to an outd^meJwhich gave more money to the teachers than was justified by the ae^o^ated changes in conditions of service.

c.	A Government-sponso^ew,/nauiry, whether confined to Scotland

or established in England	after the failure of the ACAS

process, would present serrou^d^ngers of repercussions elsewhere in the public sector. One	approach, which might be put

forward either during or afte^^^A^end of the ACAS process, was the institution of a Statutory Revra  ^io  v to determine teachers&apos; pay and conditions of service. The   a^lSTishment of such a body, which would mean setting aside the existing pay determination process, would need far-reaching legislation, and would only be effective if the unions and employers were willing to accept it. On the other hand, if both sides accepted it, and teacjiei^s committed themselves not to strike or engage in further disru    ichi, it could offer the prospect of a better atmosphere in schoov^aajKavoid the need for a collective bargaining process which had cle|arlvJproved to be unsatisfactory.

d.	The whole system of education was in many q#  y  wery

unsatisfactory; too many children were taught	hools by

inadequate teachers, and the LEAs all too often abd&amp;xfed their management responsibilities. Although the populati^^a^) large held the Government responsible for the performance of tlns-ew^ation system, effective control remained in the hands of	who

could not be relied on to act in accordance with Goverr  ^  /policy. One approach would be to establish a national education Vdcfr^CA.


   analogous with the National Health Service, whereby the Governemnt would become directly responsible for running schools and employing teachers. Such a step would, however, be inconsistent with the Government&apos;s general approach towards local government. Despite the unsatisfactory record and performance of the LEAs, it might    \ still be possible to secure improvements as compared with the

present position by means of new legislation which clarified the y/*) duties of teachers and LEAs and required the latter to discharge &lt;y/lls/ytheir managerial responsibilities more effectively.

Too much attention was focused on the negative aspects of /  dvgxnment policy towards education. The Government had formulated objectives for improving the quality of education, but rffQfe^&amp;d little credit for these initiatives. Instead the Goye^nment were seen as constantly reducing the resources available to c&amp;e service in pursuit of wider economic policy objectives, and the atmosphere so created was progressively alienating good teachers and responsible parents. It was essential to get across the positiw^spects of the Government&apos;s policy, and not least that they explyqitvy favoured higher salaries for teachers of proven good qualitw^^u

f.	The GoveraMfetis posture so far had been to refuse to provide any additional rLkaptces through the Rate Support Grant to meet the costs of educatitm^vwXfctever pay settlements were reached for teachers. The Ell/^^^lion over four years might well not prove adequate to secure v$Se/6  Vjectives the Government had attached to it; and the refusal o*wap^\additional Government funding to meet the costs of a less th^A^sfactory 1986 pay settlement would have serious consequenc^^xa^ rate bills in 1987-88. Although some LEAs continued to spend w^d^ffclly, many other authorities, particularly in the shire rfit^Nes, ran efficient services but could still not find the resodr^M. they needed to meet minimum needs. Although the Government^rould need to maintain every pressure to enforce acceptance&apos;^f^^rtter management of teachers, improvements in the career strueand so on, sooner or later some selective relaxation of the pwisent squeeze would be essential if good teachers were to recover tn^ir morale and enthusiasm.

g.	The Secretary of State for Education and Science would be sending his letter stating the Governmeny^-^ttitude towards the settlement reached with the help of AC AS (Cmm&amp;Q i a t e 1 y after the present Cabinet meeting. There had been prrvfe^Troe from the Government&apos;s supporters for a statement in ttig^tfpwse of Commons, which might conveniently be made on Monday iT&amp;fohaxy. This would give the Government an opportunity to emphasise/aOT  \positive aspects of their policy towards education, while^JpAimi clear their attitude towards the provisional settlement of the J^^ters&apos; pay dispute.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that tha^iK^iet endorsed the approach to the provisional settlement of the c^ct^&amp;s &apos; pay dispute put forward by the Secretary of State for Education an^^^^snee.


   They attached great importance to the need for progress towards the achievement of the Government&apos;s education objectives, and to the recovery of the support of good teachers and responsible parents. For k the time being the 1986 negotiation with the assistance of ACAS offered    Y\ the best way forward; but there was a high risk that the results would O^rove unsatisfactory or incomplete, and the Government would need to &apos;   Vuvidertake preparatory work on the further steps they might take when the    &apos;k J^ytiative returned to them during or after that negotiation. The ^Qw^qment&apos;s representatives on the Burnham Management Panel should kf&apos;suiSkthat their education objectives, and the conditions attached to th^fjfer of additional funding of   11|| billion over four years, were full^ujlderstood by the negotiators and the ACAS panel. The Secretary of SC  ^^for Education and Science should arrange for further work to be done o^/^d^ible improvements in Government control over the education system, ^d on possible alternatives to the present teachers&apos; pay determination arrangements including the implications of establishing a Statutory Review Body to settle teachers&apos; pay and conditions. This further work wouM.be considered in the first instance by a small group of Ministers m^fyiosely concerned, and appropriate reports would be made to the CabJUe^^.Me an while the Secretary of State for Education and Science should wr/ifeas he had proposed to the Chairman of the Burnham Management Panel,\gn^dViouId make a statement to the House of Commons on 3 February, the tex^^^^jhich should be cleared with the other Ministers directly concerned.
