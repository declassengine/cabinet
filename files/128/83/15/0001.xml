Libya		

2. SHOPS BILL kO.		5


   jJ xhe Cabinet considered the military action taken by the United States forces during the preceding night against specific targets in     Libya as a result of Libyan involvement in terrorism against United

Libya ^C^States citizens.

Previous	PRIME MINISTER said that, as she had reported to the Defence and

Reference: ^Ov^ea Policy Committee on the previous day, she had received a message

  CC(86) 14.2 ^^  WPresident Reagan on 8 April, indicating that he had decided to

^spond to the latest Libyan terrorist acts against American citizens by attacking specific targets in Libya. The message sought British support for this action and for the use in it of American aircraft based in the United Kingdom. The President had asked for a quick response. After discussion^kth the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Secretary of State      ibefence, her initial response had raised a number of questions ^fc^lhncerns about the scale of the proposed American action and the risin^^^it might not deter Colonel Qadhafi but rather incite further terror^P^^cts, so endangering the lives of British and American citizens. The^farindent1 s powerful and well argued reply had stressed the incontrovert3f^^^vidence of Libyan complicity in recent acts of terrorism, had in^*6*d that American action would be directed against specific targets phavCfcng direction and support for terrorism, and had blamed the lack of ikrcr^Western response for building up the prestige of the Libyan leader. ^M^President had also underlined that the request for support came at a crucial moment in Atlantic relations when lukewarm or no support from closest allies for action to curb terrorist crimes would have a profound effect on the American people.

In considering her response witl^te Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Secretary of State for      ice and the Attorney General, she had felt obliged to take into accoi^8|tf^konly doubts about the effectiveness and consequences o^C^^^an attack but also the implications of refusing the Pres^ent^^ request for the long term relationship with the United States	defence of Europe, as well as

the inherent right of self-defence o^^j^^Inited States in the face of Libyan terrorism against American citi^^H^^nd the evidence that more terrorist acts were planned. The case	use of Fill aircraft from

bases in the United Kingdom was that it	Maximise the accuracy of

targetting, minimise collateral damage and ^uce the risk to United States service personnel. Despite all the ^Kervations, it had been agreed that the reply to the President should state that the United States could count on United Kingdom support for &quot;action directed against specific Libyan targets demonstrably involved in the conduct and support of terrorist activities&quot;, wording which the A^orney General had advised was consistent with Article 51 of the Unitec^^^Bons Charter.

The Prime Minister&apos;s reply had also informed the Pre%.dent that the United Kingdom Government would be ready to agree to t^  ^^ of United States aircraft from bases in this country against targ^^ which fell clearly within this definition, if he concluded that that^^ns^p^cessary. The reply had made clear that the Americans could not cou^JJ^ritish support for more generalised military action which was less^^*g^^ directed against terrorist targets.


   THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY emphasised the difficulties which t had been faced in reaching the decision to give the Americans the Lk support which they had requested. Given the indisputable proof of % Libyan guilt and the right of the Americans to take action in J5(kelf-defence against specific terrorist targets, it would have been

to deny the Americans the use of bases within this country and, ^^^eteby, the means of maximising the accuracy of their targetting and of ising civilian casualties. It was clear that the United States had Thosen targets linked with terrorist activities. Detailed information on the results of this action was not yet available but it had been reported that about 100 civilians had been injured, with damage to residential accommodation and to the French Embassy which was in the vicinit^gAthe Libyan intelligence headquarters. It had also been reporte  MIL two sons of Colonel Qadhafi had been injured. There had been no r  por^te of street demonstrations against the British community. The Briti^Pl^^donian Airways flight that day had been cancelled because of The insure of Libyan airspace. It had not yet been possible since the United^States military action to convey advice to the 5,000 British resideqgf^ Libya. There was no question of them leaving Libya quickly because^Jj^^wisas were needed and took ten days to obtain. The best advice to them   Aid be to stay at home.

THE SECRETARY OF ST^E|^%t. DEFENCE said that incontrovertible evidence existed to indicate Sat the United States Administration were confronted by a long term and carefully planned Libyan campaign of terrorist acts against American targets. Faced with the dilemma of deciding how to respond in an effective way, the Americans deserved British support in the action g^ had taken. Furthermore, to have repudiated the actions of a AM^lly in these circumstances would have done enormous damage to the ulS^kingdom&apos;s long term relationship with the United States, especially ^%%umstanees where she had provided unstinting support to the United^KinAm at the time of the war in the South Atlantic.

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL sa?         he had fully supported the decision which had been taken by the TOi^iinister, is consultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth SecrelwW&apos;d the Secretary of State for Defence, in responding to President llagan in the manner described. There had been no middle course available Wtween giving or withholding support, and the consequences of denying support to the Americans in such a crisis would be far-reaching, particularly in circumstances where the United States Administration enjoyed strong backing from American public opinion.	g^

In discussion, the following points were made    

a.	Although there were doubts about the handl^^^g^timing of the President&apos;s decision, there had been no alternEi^e to giving support to American action within the terms of Artll^g|L of the United Nations Charter. It was important, however, SHtiBhe Americans should not be drawn into further military action irtiich might lead to an escalation of ever increasing violence^^Wv greater influence with the Americans which United Kingdof  ^jp^prt


   had gained should be used against this and against any further JL	American decisions which might embarrass this country. This was

A	particularly important in circumstances where events in the period

  L immediately ahead could have far-reaching effects on transatlantic relations and on the Soviet Union&apos;s opportunities for undermining the cohesion of the Alliance.

b.	Despite the clear justification for American military action in self-defence, there would be adverse public reaction within the United Kingdom and other North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) countries. Convincing proof of Libyan complicity in terrorist acts s^4lVve brought into the public domain, based on Colonel QaaUfi^k public statements as well as information from int^SlEttce sources, so far as this was possible.

c.	Althpugli it was clear that the Americans would have attacked with or u^houk United Kingdom support, and without it there might have been I^H^^ivilian casualties, presentation of this point was difficult because J.t would be argued that use of bases in the United Kingdo^HBWased the threat to British lives. It would be important to re^alMkhe evidence of previous Libyan attacks against the United Kingd^^rotably the death of Woman Police Constable Yvonne) Fletcher in St James&apos;s Square, and to expose the failure of critic  ) of the American action to suggest other ways of deterring terrorist violence.

d.	The fact that the Ur^ffmKingdom had no quarrel with the Libyan people but only w^Jn^e engaged in terrorism should be stressed, not least because^Tkjje current danger to the 5,000 British residents in Libya.^^Kufl||^was no realistic prospect of a rescue operation against oppos^^^^^ for these United Kingdom citizens and the other large nuQfc&amp;rskof Europeans and Americans in

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discU^R^k expressed gratitude to the Cabinet for their support of the diff^^u^Mdecision which she and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and ^   ^^recretary of State for Defence had faced following the approach made by President Reagan. In her Parliamentary statement that day, she would give the fullest possible justification for this decision, stressing that the British Government had agreed to the use of bases in this country for action taken in self-defence against targets demonstrably ^^^^ed in the conduct and support of terrorist activities and had mA^red its position on the question of more generalised militar^^SKion. Close contact with the United States Administration would be^Hfc^^ined in order to influence their decisions in the critical periOTj^^^*d and to co-ordinate the presentation of information about the pur|^  ^Cdnd effect of the United States military action. European NATO partnersC  uld be consulted as far as possible in the interests of maintaining J^EjLarity within the Alliance and of safeguarding the security of Europ^^M^^k residents in Libya. The Secretary of State for Defence should^^^p^^. plans for the possible evacuation of British citizens from Libya under the closest review.


   The Cabinet -

Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.

   i	2. THE HOME SECRETARY said that, as the Government had been defeated

EHOPS^ the House Qf commons the previous evening on the Second Reading of     q X%\the Shops Bill, the law relating to Sunday trading, including the Shops re/10	T^j\ct 1950 would continue in force as at present. The enforcement of the

was the responsibility of district councils, although an ordinary rC(86;	*1 ^rttb^payer who could not persuade his district council to act could make

&apos;vp^OTtesentations to the Attorney General that he should do so. It was Yf^M^that there would for the time being be an increased number of p&amp;fseflSba.ons, but that thereafter matters would revert to the state in whi&lt;Jrl^  gy were before the Auld Committee had reported. He had no propoXM^JE^r the introduction of further legislation on this subject: there wSed to be no prospect of any kind of consensus on a reform of the law^m*^ fell short of the abolition proposed in the Shops Bill.

The Cabinet -

Agreed that there should be no further attempt to reform	on Sunday trading in the

lifetime oKthsLpresent Parliament.
