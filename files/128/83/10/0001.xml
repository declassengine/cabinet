the Fulham constituency would be moved that afternoon, the by-eledtion to ta^e place on 10 April.

   British	THE^OTCRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that the bids

iLeyland	utentip^pd in his last report to Cabinet were being examined by the

Brf^isja^eyland Board, their bankers and financial advisers, and by his Iprevious	own fepartjnent. There was a possibility that a further proposal would

   Reference:	be subfl&amp;Dted by Lancashire Enterprises. The position on that would be

   	CC(86) 9th clearervMje following week, when he would make a further report.

   Minute 2	THE PRIME MINISTER said that a period of intensive negotiations was

about to start. The press would be informed that the Cabinet and the Ministerial group   that had met that morning had heard a report from the Secretary of Stfatenror Trade and Industry, that no decisions were reached, and	Cabinet and the Ministerial group agreed that

further discussion^ would be needed with the interested parties.

   	Crime	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TmMME DEPARTMENT said that the notifiable

BFigures: Rape offences recorded by the policpiA^agland and Wales for 1985 would be

published that afternoon. Over^jii tftey showed a 3 per cent rise in total recorded crime over the pre^ima^wear&apos; s figures. That was a drop in the annual rate of increase from/i^Mr cent in the previous year. Within the total there was a 3 per c^jTF^eduction in offences of burglary, which must have some connect)Lop^i^ith the efforts that had been put into crime prevention. Violent crm^ however, had increased by 7 per cent. Press publicity and public cowcern would focus on the increase of 29 per cent in offences of rape. A contributory fact in this was a change of statistical practice by the Metropolitan Police who now recorded offences of rape at the time of tKir~ff&apos;irst complaint made to them. The Home Office press release would touoh &lt;mthis, but leave it to the police to fill in the details.

He would in any event need to make some public commra/about the anonymity rules applying to rape offences. Recent c^y^/bad highlighted the anomalies in the present law which provided that a^rap^ victim&apos;s anonymity only began when a charge was brought, while aSartranity also applied to the defendant. He would need to say that he wa^lvboking at both aspects of the rule.	.

In a brief discussion the point was made that there was a cooi&apos;rji&apos;h between causing avoidable distress to the victims of rape anI


   publicising sufficient information to catch rapists. Although public feelings very understandably ran high in the direction of extending anonymity for victims and removing it from alleged rapists, the matter could not be free of controversy.

PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that it was most ortant that the Government should not appear to lose the initiative /4rtiybis matter and the Home Secretary should quickly work up proposals: should not be confined to standing the mattter over until respiration could be enacted in the Criminal Justice Bill in the next SesMtjS^bf Parliament.

&lt;X  

Scottish	THE SECRETARY OF S^m^PR SCOTLAND said that, following the

Teachers&apos; Pay Government&apos;s announ^jf^niNrjf the setting up of an independent and wide Dispute	ranging inquiry into^S^J^pnditions, duties and responsibilities, the

teachers&apos; unions in Scot^^H^Khad accepted the pay offer put to them by Previous	the local authorities, ^^ihaugh the leadership of the teachers&apos; unions

Reference:	had initially been hostisetting up of the inquiry, they had

CC(86) 9th	realised that opinion on a^^wes was very much in its favour and they

Conclusions,	were accordingly now presen^p^^vt as a victory. The terms of the pay

Minute 5	settlement for 1985-86 were jrcara^^ally the same as those for England

and Wales; the only differenceCilis^^Xsmall amount equivalent to a i per cent which arose from applying a^^e^^pus arbitration award to Scotland. The 5i per cent offer for 1986-87 ^f^jiithout prejudice to the outcome of the inquiry and would have to b	ced by the employers from

within existing resources. Local aut^wpd^ies had been informed that if they chose to award more than they cod^iafford, the Government would not make up the difference.	V

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that it was important that the impression now.being giveiv^^^the Scottish unions that they had secured a better deal than their Enplish counterparts should be quickly countered. There was a dangfey^tTwt otherwise the present negotiations with the Advisory, Concilis^tifljAy1*! Arbitration Service in relation to a settlement in England an3^  ^[es would be adversely affected. It must be made absolutely cleaF^^^t the 1986   87 settlement in Scotland would be constrained by the G^^O^jpnt&apos;s overall financial limit and that the Government were free to	*:o

outcome of the inquiry in whatever way they saw fit.	way of

setting out the Government&apos;s position would be to arrang^t^/pnswer a Written Parliamentary Question, setting out in full the pcT^  Q^ in Scotland as compared to that in England.	xO/O


   The Cabinet -

^	3. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s

summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to be guided accordingly.

Sellafield	THErS&amp;K^ETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the Report of the Select

Reprocessing	Commwi  l  ^&gt;n the Environment on Radioactive Waste was highly critical

p^ant	and qu?yyian^d the need for reprocessing at Sellafield. He was

arrangii^Xor a series of press briefings and speeches to emphasise the positive&apos;^pects of Sellafield. The Central Electricity Generating Board would shortly be signing a large reprocessing contract which would be used as an opportunity for emphasising the importance of Sellafield. In addition, a nejjxChairman and Managing Director were shortly to be appointed to h^kd British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL); he was sure that they would makev^jrjSHjiiderable contribution to the improvement of BNFL&apos;s public relations. ((He/ Viad been planning to wait for the Report of the Sizewell Inquiry oiifare/launching a wider ranging pro-nuclear publicity campaign. That Rep($ry%&gt;&lt;  bld not be produced before September and he had therefore concluded ttw^ioe campaign would have to go ahead without delay, although it woura^hM not be able to refer to Sizewell or pressurised water reactor^vv^X

THE PRIME MINISTER, summingvaH^aXbrief discussion, said that it was essential that the Governmen^li^owld present the best possible case for the nuclear industry and for	ield in particular. The comparison

between the safety record of tne/pdzXeaT industry and that of, for example, coalmining was not ade^tM^ recognised. The current campaigns against Sellafield had G^tie^a^great deal of harm to the economy of Cumbria although there w^  ^  jL.11 much support there for BNFL. Every opportunity should be taken toC^^asise the positive aspects of the nuclear industry, and the Secretarg/prfPstate for the Environment should join with the Secretary of Stat^^or Energy in the publicity campaign that was proposed.

   NorraE SECRETARY 0F STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that the Anglo-Irish IrelaIntergovernmental Conference had held a meeting on 11 March, its second ^	in Belfast. The meeting itself had been encouraging and there hacf been

Previous	less hostility towards it in Northern Ireland than on previous

Reference	^ccas ions. Nevertheless, the situation in Northern Ireland was

CC(86) 8thx&apos;   ^/^  wrying, not least because the politicians there seemed to have run out Conclusions \Vv&amp;ideas and their influence for restraint might be consequently eroded. Minute 1

FOREIGN	2. ifli^OJWSIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that in the referendum

AFFAIRS	in Spaivo^hie previous day on membership of the North Atlantic Treaty

---	OrganisaoS^m (NATO), there had been a substantial majority for continued

Spain	membership of the Alliance. This was good news. The terms of the

question put to the Spanish electorate had attached conditions to Previous	continued NATO membership; the Government would be discussing the

Reference:	implications wiftfa l)pain and the other allies.

France:	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEaWH^BCRETARY said that, while prediction was

Parliamentary risky, it appeared likely	the Parliamentary elections in France

Elections	on 16 March, the parties of	democratic right would together win an

overall majority in the NatioroJ^Msembly. The recent improvement in the prospects of the Socialist^djp^y^appeared to have ceased. It was not expected that the President France, Monsieur Francois Mitterrand, would resign as a result of the e^cxipo of a right wing majority in the Assembly. It would be necessary to^Jz^jKJw the unprecedented situation of &quot;cohabitation&quot; between a SocialisC^F^sident and a right wing Government would operate. It might ber/np^^ven more difficult to forecast French positions on foreign anwaefence matters and in other fields. The Foreign and Commonwealth Orvice would provide advice to other Departments on the handling of business with France in the new circumstances.

Terrorist	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that FMj&amp;iwas facing

Incidents	various problems concerned with terrorism. It was poirMjBrle that there

Concerning were differences among French leaders on the handlingi^Cc^rrorist France	incidents, with the Prime Minister and the Minister of tme^nterior

favouring a firmer line than the President. France was	to secure

the release of four French hostages held for over a year&apos;w^a/Shi&apos; ite Moslem group in Lebanon. Following recent bombing incidents^wwParis, two Iraqi Shi&apos;ites, who were opponents of the Iraqi regime,&apos;ha}rjo&amp;en expelled from France. Subsequently, and perhaps in retaliatfq$i^&apos;&gt;\


   four French television journalists had been taken hostage in Beirut. It was possible that some of the groups concerned in these incidents had been seeking to take advantage of the imminence of Parliamentary elections in France. The events showed that the British policy of N^XA^ntering into no bargains with people who took hostages was the right &gt;^v*6me. The relative uncertainty of the French position in this regard &apos;yv&apos;mi^ht have contributed to the taking of French hostages.

^hort discussion, it was noted that the risk of a terrorist inci^reh^ against a Western country could increase when that country was approaching elections.

Ilrian/Iraq	THE FOfalTCipAND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the military situation

Iwajr	in the &apos;vMn/lraq war had not changed in the past week. The slow Iraqi

advance cowards the town of Fao, held by Iran, continued. There was a |Previous	possibility of further Iranian attacks in the same area, but Iraq should

Inference:	be able to withstand them. Iran continued to make statements

|CC;(86) 9th	threatening the/    31.f States, especially Kuwait. Saudi Arabia was

I Ccinclusions,	concerned about^th^s. The United Kingdom had prompted the Secretary

   	Minute 3	General of the wJ^SlXNations to make a public statement expressing

concern at any extten^o/on of the conflict between Iran and Iraq. The Government was a1strawy contact with the Gulf States. The Government had proposed a diplomatt^/MSi^pach to Iran by the member countries of the European Community, s&apos;&amp;fiesl^ng the need to respect Kuwaiti territory; but the view of the diplomStr^/rfission in Tehran of the European Community countries had been that w&amp;y&amp;Ti approach would not influence Iran.

Ill

I S&lt;|)uth Africa THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SEGH^ftRY said that the visit to South

Africa by the Commonwealth Eminfffrt^P^^ons Group would end on 14 March.

I Previous	It had been handled with great di  &lt;ireH&gt;&gt;n. The Group&apos;s contacts with

   	Reference:	the South African Government were a^^&lt;Ritical stage. The British

1 C&lt;p(86) 8th	Government had urged the South Africat^Zovernment not to rebuff the

I Cijnclusions,	suggestions that the Group were makin^A^^ne South African response	to

1 Minute 2	the British approach had been reasonably^encouraging. The prospect	was

that the Group would be able to continue^to play a useful role in the coming period.

   Chann/r/^t^ed THF. SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that the concession agreement   Link	between the British and French Governments and the Channel Tunnel Group

and France Manche (CTG/FM) on the construction of a Channel Fixed Link Previous^/O&apos;yt was due to be signed during that week, before the French Parliamentary I Reference N^^v^AJ-ect ions on 16 March. It had not yet been signed because France had cc(86) 2nd &gt;df&lt;  eoeged on three points that had been agreed before the announcement in Conclusions ,\v&gt;tarfyiary 1986 of the choice of CTG/FM as promoter of the project. The   Minute 6	were -

The French national railway company, Soci  t   Nationale des ^Gliemins de Fer, was seeking to pay less for use of the Fixed Link &lt;*  ergsyT.TG/FM and British Rail considered right; if conceded, this wowio/Affect the financial prospects of the Fixed Link.

b.	Wrance was urging that construction contracts let by the promoter to firms in association with it should be confirmed only when the concession agreement entered into force in a year&apos;s time.

c.	Franad wanted the period during which CTG/FM would have an exclusive &amp;HfecJi2Xion to end in the year 2010 instead of 2020.

The French Governmfen^^ad been told that the British Government adhered to the arrangements xin^fef&amp;se points that had been agreed before January 1986 and that the con    jii  w agreement could be signed only on that basis.

In a short discussion, it^ijw  greed that the Prime Minister should that day send a message to the WejxiSPresident seeking to persuade France to adhere to the arrangements	agreed and to proceed quickly to

signature of the concession agbeatoent.

The Cabinet -

COMMUNITY	3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY sa/dT^at the Council of

AFFAIRS	Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on 10-11 March had\^i  sjte&lt;l a firm statement

---	on the Community&apos;s relations with Japan. This edaorsad the approach

Relations	which the United Kingdom had been advocating. IrCw^Xfbow necessary to

with Japan make sure that the Commission followed up the speci^  Vp&lt;jints, including the question of Japanese imports of alcoholic drinks^roi  re the Economic Summit meeting in Tokyo.

#5)


   RelatZTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Council of . h t^vCv Ministers (Foreign Affairs) had also reached agreement on the basis on I UnitedStA^&amp;\ which the Community should resist United States demands on certain bilateral trade issues and, in particular, on the effect of the \&lt;T_I   pssion of Spain and Portugal on United States trade. The Community ready to engage the normal procedures on this point under Article of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The United States &apos;&apos;VjrtS^xLon was misconceived. The United States would make gains in i/rCrfsVrial trade as a result of the enlargement of the Community and thi^^^ded to be taken into account as well as some potential losses on agrCcuttural trade. Furthermore, the United States had given strong poliWeiCfiyfeupport to enlargement. The recent visit of the Minister of Agricuijyr&amp;x Fisheries and Food to Washington had been helpful in putting&apos;vfotiie of these issues in perspective.

In discussion it was pointed out that the United States had certainly misinterpreted some of the effects of the accession of Spain and Portugal even io^Ehe agricultural sector. More broadly, however, there was a serious d^nge): of increasing trade difficulties with the United States on agricuXLrfpaiv products. United States legislation would now make mandatory the( expenditure of at least $1 billion on the subsidisation of	States&apos; exports. This could lead to a price war

in some markets. TMtt^^tween the Commission and the United States were planned but the	hould not be underestimated.

It was also pointed out ^tfa^&amp;hese problems were the result of the strong growth of agricult&lt;rTal)  roduction in many parts of the world. It had been estimated that th^-   jitoknity&apos; s grain surplus could quadruple by the end of that decade if siraA^rcnt measures were not taken. The Treasury would pay out in 19o&gt;^^6ymore than         billion on the storage and disposal of cereals in theMmfc^dk Kingdom under the common agricultural policy, while at thV&apos;^sapX time farm incomes fell by 43 per cent in 1985. The problem of adfarm support to the changing agricultural circumstances was real^^ijid&apos;-&apos;^he solutions difficult to achieve in many developed countries.^Ijy&apos;was necessary, however, to keep up the pressure for improvements in th^a^dration of the common agricultural policy.	NX&apos;

Intergovern-	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH	SECRETARY said th^^aH^ember states had

mental	agreed that they would try to ratify by the end   /r^tbat year the texts

Conference	incorporating the results of	the Intergovernmenta^^iJjiSerence. It had

also been agreed that, in order not to prejudge the^/fia^i?ions of Previous	national Parliaments, there would be no formal implem^nraXion in advance

Reference:	of ratification but that, if	progress could be made i^fb^jn  lly, member

CC(86) 9th	states would make their best	endeavours to achieve it.

Conclusions,

Minute 4	&apos;


   EnvirTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that at the Council of Ministers (Environment) on 6-7 March the Minister from the Republic of Ireland had focussed attention on the control of nuclear waste at Sellafield. This issue could become more difficult in relations between he United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The Dutch Presidency also kept attention on the draft directive on emissions from large &apos;v\&apos;cpii)Dustion plants:	no decisions had been taken but the question would

at the next Council of Ministers (Environment) in June and during ttnKWited Kingdom&apos;s Presidency in the second half of 1986.

JI  

Energy Levy THE SECK  ^l(RY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that it was necessary to keep a

close wac^h on the possibility that the Commmission might propose a levy on energy. In discussion it was pointed out that there was no proposal and that the United Kingdom was not advocating such a policy. Others would in any evsrtJENbe opposed to such a proposal and at this stage there could be disadvantage in taking a high profile. The pressure for an oil import levy in c  ^^B5i&gt;ted States seemed to be receding.
