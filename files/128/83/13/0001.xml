Criminal	THE LORD CHANCELL,QR said that the Bar&apos;s case against him in respect of

Legal Aid	payments for ba^Tvters&apos; services under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme

had opened the lacewjjus week before the Lord Chief Justice. The Bar had argued that theyaproen denied their legitimate expectations of consultation and K_-ejxp  ditious handling of the matter. These arguments had appeared to finc^ra^n^. favour with the Lord Chief Justice, who had adjourned the hearing/r^wvan indication that he would like to see a timetable for discussrapoagkeed between the two sides. Agreement to such a timetable would nozS&amp;volve the payment of any money on account or any commitment for an^i^^Vase over and above the 5 per cent which had already been of fered. \XEJ&gt;^flar &apos; s suggestion was for a timetable involving a decision by himT5^&lt;T&lt;k July, which would be in time for the Annual General Meeting of thh\B  j^)n 26 July. This would be a tight timetable and the resolution a^fcle^ssne was complicated by the analogous problems with the paynsolicitors, the complementary discussions on payment for work un^^^t^ken for the new Crown Prosecution Service and, in the background, tMto consider the implications for civil legal aid. Nevertheless,seemed in the circumstances to be no realistic alternative to his ac2&apos;e^ci&gt;j*g the timetable.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the CabineB^ioted that the timetable involved no commitment to a higher offer and were content for it to be agreed on that basis. A co-ordinating committee of officials was to be set up to oversee the handling of the Governmen^-s.ide of the discussions with the Bar:	the Department of Employment aiwtlM Treasury should be

involved in this.

The Cabinet -

1.	Took note.

I Easter Recess THE PRIME MINISTER reminded colleagues that a Minister shou^&apos;Ae^on duty in each Government Department during the Easter Parliamentar^Bp  ^sss, to


   speak as necessary in public for the Department in question. One Cabinet Minister should also be on duty each day. Advantage should be taken of opportunities to issue positive statements during the Recess.

The Cabinet

NVV/S 2. Invited the Lord President of the Council o co-ordinate arrangements for Ministers to be duty during the Recess

FOREIGN	2. THE6fj0REIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the President of

AFFAIRS	Libya, Colonel Qadhafi, had for many years claimed a large area of the

___	Gulf of Sirte as Libyan territorial waters. This claim was not accepted

Libya	by the United States or the United Kingdom or by the international

community. It wa  -&gt;United States policy to assert the right of passage Previous	in internationa^/waHers. In 1981 the United States had shot down two

Reference:	Libyan aircraftVfflar^bhe Gulf of Sirte. Since then, units of the United

CC(86) 6.2	States armed force/shaa entered the area claimed by Libya on seven

occasions. The pre^J  tt  yUnited States military exercise in the area was larger than earlier	It had begun on 23 March. The United Kingdom

had been notified on 2^|^^ra^Kh. Late on 24 March, Libya had fired six SA5 missiles from battd^i^iMin the shore, which had missed the United States aircraft. The Unib^&amp;tates had then attacked two missile sites - and had sunk a Libyan fas^^tWol boat bearing missiles. The United States had warned that any&apos;^j^HK forces approaching United States forces would be treated as	Libya had informed Italy and Spain

that United States bases in th^e^ountries could be at risk. The Soviet reaction had so far conMsro^flf public criticism of United States actions. The Arab countrie^^re already giving verbal support to Colonel Qadhafi and were likely^ojMntinue to do so.

The United States action in assertinfc^j  /right of passage in international waters and of exercising/Jmp^right of self-defence was fully justified in law. Its political Virfects might, however, be mixed. It would be suggested that the United States, by engaging in a major exercise in the area, had been seeking to provoke Libyan retaliation. International reaction might be perverse:	Colonel Qadhafi might gain in

stature from the affair, as well as securing wide  ivread Arab support.

There were 1,000 United States subjects in LibyJpbrfilPiS, 000 British subjects. There was no reason in present circumsMgnp4/sj. to expect action against the British community. There might also bfection against the American subjects, whom Colonel Qadhafi would reg^(p&lt;^^as defying the United States policy that American citizens should leSaW^C^ya.

There was a risk, however, that the situation would esca4  ^  \\ One serious possibility was that Libya would mount or encouragx_Jj  ^orist attacks as a means of retaliation.


   The United Kingdom reaction to the events in the Gulf of Sirte should be to state that the Libyan claim to territorial sea in the Gulf of S,irte was without foundation, that the United States had been justified in upholding the right of free passage and that the United States reaction \C//^gainst the&apos; use of force by Libya was justified as self-defence. It /  wht be desirable to qualify the last point by speaking of the need for NA.tions to Libya&apos;s use of force to remain proportionate.

MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that the Gov^^rtrant1s public statements must avoid any appearance of siding in thvsmd$:er with Colonel Qadhafi. The Government should endorse the United States to maintain freedom of movement in intermreioijAl waters and airspace and the right to self-defence under Articlev^^of the United Nations Charter. There was a possibility that Libya woO^l inspire terrorist attacks against British interests or United States bases in the United Kingdom.

NORTHERN	3. THE HOME SECRETARY said tli^b^^^bad made a statement in the House

IRELAND	of Commons on the previous day o^itapSdifficult question of the failure

AFFAIRS	to secure extradition from the Iri^R^ublic of Miss Evelyn Glenholmes,

who was suspected of involvement in ar^fupber of acts of terrorism by the Extradition	Provisional Irish Republican Army. l    ^iilure to secure extradition in

Case: Miss	court hearings in Dublin at the end of\*r^revious week had arisen

Evelyn Glen- essentially from three factors. First, &lt;irevised warrant for the arrest holmes	of Miss Glenholmes, which had been issueckin November 1984, had been

prepared without the magistrate in the United Kingdom having required that the relevant information be formally laid before him for a second time. Second, the court in Dublin had refused /^Te^juest, which normally would be considered reasonable, for a delay toUlld  _the difficulty about the warrant to be settled and a revised wa^afiT\V&gt;repared.

Thirdly, the Dublin court had not been satisfied,evidence of telephone conversations between the authorities in I^^Zn.and London, that a further warrant had been issued in London.	Government

could not be blamed for the actions of the Irish court^Srfc^ he had been careful in his statement to the House of Commons to avoidj&gt;    ticism of the Irish Government. Had the request for extradition bd  iK*iw\eld in the Dublin district court, Miss Glenholmes would probably Tfog/rfJLeaded in the High Court in the Irish Republic that the alleged offence^&amp;vke


   political. Since the Irish Republic had only signed, and had not yet ratified, the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, such a plea might well have been accepted.	&apos;

ATTORNEY GENERAL said that the court in Dublin had been justified in &apos;-^^dVnding a flaw in the warrant dating from November 1984. But the M^ve^sons given by the court in refusing to allow time for a new warrant produced had been far from convincing. He planned, if he had to a/isj^vva Private Notice Question on this matter to reveal that the Diree^ok of Public Prosecutions (DPP) had informed him that disciplinary prorie^gs would be instituted against the senior official who had made the   jeSgtffc mistake of allowing the warrant of November 1984 to be flawe  o^^f^o Private Notice Question needed to be answered, the DPP would hvm^Lf announce this by lunchtime that day.

The Situation THE SECRETARY O^S^TE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that there was in Northern continued uniorf^i&amp;goosition to the Anglo-Irish Agreement of Ireland	15 November 1985.(T  h  )Northern Ireland Assembly was being misused by

unionist members, yfi^^fbnen of the 26 District Councils in Northern Ireland were suspend^d^Ojfhe Government had intervened to set rates as necessary, without	e of the powers that had been taken to

appoint Commissioners #?fc^rois purpose. Following the by-elections in Northern Ireland on 23 Jawiapv and the Prime Minister&apos;s meeting with the . leaders of the Ulster Uni  rf*  V\Party (UUP) and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) on 25 Februarys^-fepp&lt;se had been talk of a loyalist campaign of civil disobedience to mak  ^w3^  hern Ireland ungovernable. There were no signs that this was in pro^aep^at this stage. On 3 March, however, there had been a &quot;day of actio^^/j^olving much intimidation to persuade people to stay away frc  P^f  ^. One effect of this event had been that some people in the loya^^^&apos;^eramilitary groups now thought that it might be possible to obst^cfe^Rfe in the Province. Another effect had been that many unionists^Ewrdi  )feen shocked by the intimidation and were now more definitely opposed&apos;&quot;&quot;?o^iw  gal action and more interested in talks with the GovernmetiwThe Prime Minister&apos;s letters of 21 March to the leader of the UUP, Mis  mes Molyneaux MP, and of the DUP, Mr Ian Paisley MP, had been received by them on 24 March. The letters had made clear that the Government would not suspend the Anglo-Irish Agreement but was willing to talk w^Hk the unionist leaders on a range of subjects. The letters had not Iwen^published, so as to reduce the risk that Mr Molyneaux and Mr Paislb  \wjE54 be forced by their supporters to return a negative answer.	resPonse from

the two leaders had been that the Prime Minister V^^ysrs were disappointing and that they would need to consult W^^^pl le agues before giving a definite reaction. This was the besv^^^^R^nse from Mr Molyneaux and Mr Paisley that could have been

There would be significant events in Northern Ireland du^rfg)  he Easter holiday. Roman Catholics would be marking the 70th   nniv  ^M  ^sof the Easter Uprising by a march on Easter Sunday at Carrickmore.^jl^r^. could be a difficult event for the police to control. On the Prot  ^ete^side,


   there would be three marches by the Apprentice Boys of Londonderry on Easter Monday. The key event would be in Portadown, where the marchers would probably wish to march through a strongly Roman Catholic area vCx//\knows as &quot;the tunnel&quot; from which the police had debarred them when they N&apos;   ^YYlast marched in Portadown. It appeared that 1,000-1,500 Apprentice Boys \V\&gt;yNuld travel from Belfast to Portadown for the march and that 500 to &apos;^&lt;!LyX)0 others, who might be potentially more prone to violence, might /jeft&amp;Sthem. The Ulster clubs, which had been formed to promote ojrtjJySvticm to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, might be involved. The marcit^rs appeared to be considering three routes, of which two would Pfor the police. The Royal Ulster Constabulary now feltffiit^sheir policy of avoiding contact with Protestant participants of the&gt;*#ay of action&quot; on 3 March had been inadequate. They were determi^fed to control the march at Portadown effectively and were confident of being able to do so. Given the rather low participation that was expected, this confidence was no doubt justified.

In a short di/kmsilon, it was noted that the advertisement correcting misrepresentac&lt;33n8  3i the Anglo-Irish Agreement which the Northern Ireland Office hap placed in newspapers in Northern Ireland on 20 March had had a useful&apos;^ld*^:	consideration was being given to placing

If

BRITISH	THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY introduced the discussion

LEYLAND: LAND of the report of the Ministerial Group on Land Rover-Leyland (MISC 126) ROVER-LEYLAND (C(86) 10). He/  5id he had had extensive discussions with General Motors (GM) witilittip objective of reaching a compromise which would Previous	secure the main^S^ke?i  s of the Salton proposals while retaining a

Reference:	controlling UniteMKjA&amp;dom interest in Land Rover. It had eventually

CC(86) 12.1 become clear that GM^Wld insist on an arrangement which would give them immediate contiW^&amp;Land Rover, both as regards management and strategy, and would a&amp;Kmwvedge explicitly that they would achieve majority ownership of t  r&amp;Jfc&gt;ver in the very near future. He had told GM that he was unable to^^^wmend such an arrangement to colleagues.

He had asked whether GM w^tfWjk prepared to consider a deal restricted to Freight Rover and LeylafWrJl&amp;ikks, but they had rejected this. The British Leyland (BL) Board, &amp;i%B&gt;Mr Graham Day, the Chairman-designate, would shortly be joining, show^pw be invited to make recommendations to the Government about the	the Land Rover-Leyland (LRL)

businesses in the light of the o&lt;tfiep&gt;Mds they had received and of other possible routes towards the privat&amp;SaUpn of Land Rover on a realistic timescale. It was doubtful if the	m Lancashire Enterprises

Limited in respect of Leyland Trucks^mmhave the necessary financial strength; but the BL Board would need	seen to consider this offer,

as well as other possibilities, in maki^ further recommendations to the Government. Meanwhile negotiations on tfcfe disposal of Leyland Bus and Unipart were continuing separately.

In discussion the following main points were m^  Ss\V

a. The original Salton proposals and they^^&apos;tions subsequently put to GM were preferable on balance from t\k_^5  uercial, industrial and employment standpoints to all lii^/pyier alternatives, although no solutions to the prob^ra/of the commercial vehicle industry were without some sp^^^^^ disadvantages. But the Government had to take accoup^^f political constraints, and in view of the events of recent d^yjp^lyire could be no question now of reverting to the Salton deal, nothing should be done now to rule out further discus siA&amp;^jith GM in advance of the review of the options for LRL.


   b. The Government&apos;s aim should be to establish a private sector \	company with assured long-run viability from the LRL businesses.

y&apos;\	While consideration should be given to the separate privatisation

M?Y\	of different	businesses, the	risk that these could prove	vulnerable

to undesired	take-over would	need to be borne in mind in	deciding

   V&apos;AV	the best way	forward towards	the Government&apos;s objective.

The Government would need to have regard to the interests of (/OjjVority private shareholders, and the legal requirement to treat fairly, in reaching decisions on the future of the LRL sj^jtesses. No decisions could or should be reached until the (So^^nment had received the recommendation of the BL Board.

Detailed&lt;Aoints were noted on a draft statement to be made to the House of Commons^ by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on 25 March.

THE PRIME MINISTEfL summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet agreed, on balaifei5\and with regret, with MISC 126&apos;s view that the original SaltorSyWc^la^als could not be pursued in present circumstances though the possiiyii  y\ of further discussion with GM at a later stage should not be ruld^-^U^i) The BL Board should now be invited to make recommendations to t$er  p*iernment: about the future of the LRL businesses, with a vi/v/^\their privatisation on a commercial basis, m the light of the other^ttJG&amp;or expressions of interest in one or more of these businesses which wer/E^^lready on the table. The Board, including Mr Day, should also consf&amp;^he possibility of alternative approaches to the privatisation of La^jL-ft^v&apos;er on a realistic timescale which might prove preferable to acceptane^^any of the bids previously made. The way ahead would not be easy,&apos;wrp^ularly for Leyland Trucks, and some assurance would need to be giv&lt;  jr^roijfhout undertaking any new commitments, that the Government  y&lt;Suyi continue to support it in accordance with established plans./^  Secretary of State for Trade and Industry should make a statement to tlj^nouse of Commons later that day along the lines agreed in discussion^^^
