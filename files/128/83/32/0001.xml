Al	The Public Order Bill, the Housing and Planning Bill and the European

Y/y) Communities (Amendment) Bill would be considered in the first week.

L	the FOREIGN AND COMMCd        TH SECRETARY said that an attempted coup

d&apos;  tat in Togo between^?^ctfid 25 September appeared to have been foiled. French troops had been sepj^isO the capital, Lom  , at the request of the Togolese President. It fefe^esible that Ghana had been involved in the

attempted coup.

I	%.

Ist/West	THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRE^ffvsaid that the successful

| lations	conclusion of the Conference on Dfsa^Snent in Europe in Stockholm, like

the preparations for the next stage&lt;  f^e Conference on Security and [evious	Co-operation in Europe which would bVienna in November, formed

iference:	part of the background to the intensive-^ttscussion in the previous week

C(86) 31.1 between the Soviet Union and the United\  tates. Those discussions had led to agreement on a meeting between the United States President,

Mr Ronald Reagan, and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, in ReyHaxik on 10-11 October, which was seen as a preparatory meeting for a(^ul\) Summit between the two leaders. This arrangement had been a gooa&lt;Sa^2K putting an end to the difficulties in United States/Soviet relatioHfe^dtfosed by the arrest in Moscow of Mr Nicholas Daniloff, a correspondeftfc^qiffis News and World Report, who had now been released. Both sides hadviy^p^tly tried to find a way of overcoming the difficulties in their r^i^G&amp;ns such that neither need lose face. The Prime Minister had receiVCdV^essage about the proposed meeting in Reykjavik from Mr Gorbachev and^pj  ^ be putting views on the matters for discussion there to Mr Reagan, ^tfet  roposed meeting was a positive sign that futher improvement in EaVl^^t relations might be possible.


   THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the trial had ended in London on 26 September of two Arabs, one of whom had been convicted of /yy\ conspiring to engage in terrorism and the other had been acquitted but would now be deported. It had come out in the proceedings that X^AAfragmentation grenades had been handed over in the offices of Libyan /s  Sba\&gt; Airlines (LAA) at London Heathrow Airport by a man wearing the \v^liyi.form of an officer of that airline. That man had been confirmed to member of LAA aircrew, who had arrived at London Airport on an LAA

This^fioxed that Libya was likely to use LAA in support of terrorist act, and might be even more likely to do so in the absence of a Libyan/i^Aple&apos; s Bureau.

The Ministerial Group on Libya had agreed on 1 October that the services of LAA to London should be terminated by the non-renewal of the airline&apos;s current operating permits, when they expired at the end of October. This/^oilld be done on grounds of national security. Stricter security contnals (jiould be applied to LAA flights at Heathrow until they ceased. These^S^^^^ons would be announced by the Secretary of State for Transport	day. Care would be taken not to create a

public impressionthe action taken against LAA would always be necessary when a fOT^k^^irline was accused of being implicated in terrorist acts, sinc&amp;^rraCvcircumstances and degree of involvement would vary. He and the Secrettfp^of State for Transport would seek the support of other countrrai&apos;^k the European Community (EC) for the actions against LAA, forM^siince in the form of a statement that the other Governments were exate^flk. the implications of LAA services to their countries. In any fuw^Jrases, efforts would be made, through early contact with EC countri^M&amp;hd with the countries participating in the seven power Economic SummitiSK^^X 1secure parallel action by as many countries as possible.

Jternational THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said t&gt;fct, during the informal meeting inancial	of Finance Ministers of European Communrxy countries at Gleneagles the

iscussions previous weekend, discussion had focussed on the avoidance of public dispute with the United States about national economic policies. The United States Ambassador in the Federal Repub|yi&apos;c~&apos;  f Germany (FRG) had put pressure on the Bundesbank to reduce inteS^e^es by 0.5 per cent. One reason for this clumsy move had been that thY^United States Secretary of the Treasury, Mr James Baker, was	jLy concerned about

protectionist sentiment in the United States Congr^^^/jjAd wanted to be able to point to reflation in the FRG as a means of ^^    J^ering such sentiment. The Federal German authorities had reac	   

This had been part of the background to the annual MiniM^iW meetings in Washington of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) an^--^Wiorld Bank, which had begun on 28 September. These meetings had ^^^\&gt;*sll; there had been some agreement on fundamental issues. The ei^npiiw of the FRG was in fact doing well but, if it was necessary after the^%4*l&gt;al


   [yy\ elections in 1987, the authorities there would be willing to take action to stimulate growth. The foreign exchange markets had expected the meeting of Finance Ministers of the Group of Five to produce some new agreement on exchange rates. When this expectation had proved mistaken, markets had reacted very nervously. As had happened before in such /^V^ituations, there had been pressure on sterling, fuelled on this &apos;\Y^rttasi  n by an element of apprehension related to the approach of an ion in the United Kingdom. Earlier that week there had been (^fftenke pressure for a rise in interest rates in the United Kingdom. Tfe  ^6raKicellor of the Exchequer had seen the Finance Minister of the ^Gy^0rGerhard Stoltenberg, and the Chairman of the Bundesbank,

Dr	Poehl, on 30 September, and the German authorities had

joinev/yi^British in intervening in the market to support sterling.

This harKcalmed the market somewhat. But the situation was still precarious and would continue so for some days to come.

Negotiations between Mexico and the Central Banks about Mexico&apos;s debts had come close^  e\collapse but in the end had produced a satisfactory agreement. Ntteerva had reached agreement with the IMF and the World Bank but needed-^b^niking finance until that agreement could take effect. The Federal GernL{nJu  horities had been reluctant to participate in bridging finance injured eventually been persuaded to do so. Nigeria had been grateful ro^^role played by the United Kingdom.

In discussion, it was^n  ^ that the turbulence in the foreign exchange markets had been caused^K&amp;hrt by disappointing figures on the United Kingdom trade balance.	most important that nothing should be

said which could add to the^pp  sure on sterling. This reinforced the need for Departments to relidi^gjaeement with the Chief Secretary, Treasury in the current publv^^xpenditure round. A Ministerial Group on Public Expenditure was now beinfgp^^jt up to discuss matters which could not be agreed between Departmen&apos;C^^.^^3^ the Chief Secretary, Treasury and would make recommendations tfx^^epCabinet.

COMMUNITY	3. THE HOME SECRETARY said that the meetingCofVLiiterior Ministers of

1FFAIRS	the twelve member states, which he had held on	ptember, had been of

I	value. Although the French Government had askeV^^y^/^his meeting, they

terrorism	had brought no new specific ideas; but they were ^  fiV*to act with their

partners. Most of the ideas for improved co-operatA    ^&amp;gainst terrorism had come from the United Kingdom and the Federal Ref^J^^&apos;^of Germany.

The meeting had agreed that the exchange of counter   teirpd^^st intelligence should be put into higher gear and that desirable to concentrate co-ordinated action on a priori^^/j/j^t of undesirables. A decision had also been taken on the   staKwV(wnt of new secure communications between the police forces of theS^twVji^e member states. There were other difficult issues ahead, including


   strengthening of the external frontier controls of the Community, and he would be holding a further meeting in October. There was now, however, a much greater readiness among all the twelve member states to give f/Yi serious attention to European preparations against terrorism.

gfeig

discussion it was pointed out that the public would expect the operation between the twelve member states after recent terrorist ^iV^iks to be very close. It was important to be absolutely sure that Clie\a^ximum was being achieved. In response it was said that the

for such co-operation was fully in place and that the United KingdistaJ^ad taken the lead in accelerating the maximum use of the mach	in &gt;ractice by agencies and police forces. One beneficial

outcot^/^Sm recent developments was a greater readiness to accept the need fd  ^co-operation, both between countries and between the various security^agencies within each country.

o

LtT Trade THE SECRETARY	FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that the results of

Lotiations the recent meetiUwJj&gt;unta del Este, Uruguay, had been very

satisfactory. Tthr^W round of trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tarifr^J^Trade (GATT) was now launched. The issues to be covered, includiife^^Xculture and services, included all those which the United Kingdom wat5tS&amp;&gt;&gt; There had been difficulties in Community co-ordination and more ^    SNilly because of the French position on agriculture ^ut he had b6jiriM&gt;le to resolve them. In discussion it was pointed out that importan^&amp;kiculties with the United States, Brazil and other countries had al^T&apos;yjJWJ overcome. The round was an important counter-weight to protectiof^fWressures. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry was to be cOTMi^^tulated on his contribution to the launching of these internationif^t^^e negotiations.

Fisheries	THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIE^AND FOOD said that the Fisheries

Council on 22 September had successful!^ adopted a complicated and important measure on the conservation of fisheries. The Dutch, whose record in this respect was not good, had opposed, but he had considered it fully justifiable to go forward on the bas^s~^vf a qualified majority.
