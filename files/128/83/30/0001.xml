   PARmffit^ARY lm THE L0RD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the House of Lords IFFAkSv/&apos;)	would rise for the Summer Adjournment later that day and return on

Monday 6 October. Of the Bills remaining to be considered, he expected Jj the Financial Services Bill to take up a considerable amount of time, as v^^omany peers were expert in this field. The European Community

Mkmendment) Bill might also prove more troublesome than had been hoped. \$yntde. other main Bills to be considered were the Housing and Planning bill ir^the Public Order Bill. Neither would be without difficulty.

TitfrSJ&amp;RETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that he would like to pla^Kgp-vrecord his gratitude to the Lord President of the Council and the ^&lt;  &amp;ain of the Gentlemen at Arms for their success in securing the House QK/yor&amp;s&apos; agreement to the House of Commons&apos; amendments to the Social^ecurity Bill. The Bill had now obtained Royal Assent.

FOREIGN	2. THE PRIM^CmIMASTER said that the Defence and Oversea Policy

AFFAIRS	Committee (OD)^yS^avtaeeting which had just concluded, had thanked the

   	Foreign and Commjmw^aAxh Secretary for the dignified and persuasive way

iouth Africa in which he had coffiKMMEed his mission to Southern Africa on behalf of

the European Communetty^puntries. OD had expressed dismay at the manner Previous	in which the State Preiirf^t of South Africa, Mr P W Botha, had received

Reference:	the Foreign and CommonweM^ro Secretary, and especially at Mr Botha&apos;s

;c(86) 29.2 remarks to the press af^^H^ptosir second meeting on 29 July, and at the discourteous behaviour o^jihpyPresident of Zambia, Dr Kenneth Kaunda.

OD had agreed the approach wimui^&amp;he and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should adopt at the^Btf^&apos;lPrng from 3-5 August of seven Heads of Government from the Commonweal tl//    &lt;J:eview the situation in South Africa following the report of the Comm^n^^^h Eminent Persons Group (COMGEP).

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETgg^-eaid that he had received very different impressions from his vari&lt;5  ^3iscussions in South Africa. The State President&apos;s attitude had been c&lt;vW^rnd dismissive. Though the attitude of the Foreign Minister, Mr Px^TBotha, was very variable, he appeared to have understanding of and some sympathy for the approach that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had been advocating, but to be unable to persuade his colleagues in the Sou  h African Government. Moderate members of the Nationalist Party and /xKeVlaead of the Broederbond sympathised with the concept of pMtgres-s.by negotiation and recognised the need for the release of Mr Nelson/Manila and other political prisoners and the unbanning of the Afr^s-ai^iational Congress and other political parties, as a basis for a politj^wfl ^dialogue. The ability of Mr Mandela to take part in dialogue was, miff^oyer, a precondition for Chief Buthelezi&apos;s participation. Tne^Ksr^ign and Commonwealth Secretary did not expect early progress in Sp^gh Africa, but his visit to the area had sown seeds and lit candle^W^i^K might foster progress in the future.	&apos;v   vvA.

In discussion, it was noted that the South African GovernmentnajarSbeen claiming in public, to some effect, that Mr Mandela&apos;s continul&apos;$  11


   (yy/s\	imprisonment was due to his own refusal to renounce violence. This was

a deliberate over-simplification; the Foreign and Commonwealth /yY\ Secretary&apos;s discussions in South Africa had taken place on the basis that political leaders in custody should be released so that all \^yCSao\itica\ parties could participate in talks and violence should be (/Vv&apos;yuspended or renounced on all sides. The real point was that Mr P W ^sjidtha was not willing to release political prisoners or legalise ^yto^tical parties so as to enable dialogue to take place.

  sjpys. Cabinet -

Ml &apos;hanked the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary frbr^^ne dignified and persuasive way in which he hid^conducted his European mission in Southern Africa and^expressed dismay at the discourtesy of Mr P W Botha towards him.

2.	Reafrirraed their support for the policy conducted in recent(moiv:hs by the Prime Minister and the Foreign and Commomra^m Secretary on the question of South Africa.

3.	Endorsed^tl/^epnclusions of the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee^dawe United Kingdom&apos;s position at the forthcoming ^mmhffSrealth Review Meeting.

fiddle East THE FOREIGN AND COMMOnWeaLTH^Z^EJARY said that the recent visit on 22 and 23 July of the Prime Minist^r^afKIsrael, Mr Shimon Peres, to    revious	Morocco, was not likely to lead&apos;vxo//^V break-through concerning the

eference:	problems of the area. But the vivit Jfcr^d been of some value to both

C(86) 9.3 sides. It had given a boost to Mr &lt;jj  pas-(s position in Israel.

Morocco&apos;s gain was improved relatioife\J$  th the United States. Egypt&apos;s isolation in the Arab world through it&apos;^^ntacts with Israel had been reduced. But Morocco&apos;s relations with^ither Arab countries were suffering because of Mr Peres&apos;s visit, v

audi Arabia THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thaETfaryjpter Hall, a

British national, and his Irish wife had been arres^a^Kin Saudi Arabia Previous	on 15 July and were said to have confessed to	/Jhere had been

reference:	difficulties in securing consular access to Mr Hall,/M^^*the Minister of

rc(86) 19.2 State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr Renton) ha^^^K^en on the

previous day to the Governor of Riyadh and access would tpp^Sably now be obtained. The outcome of the case was unclear. Saudi	law

provided for capital punishment for premeditated murder, &apos;wit/tjae extreme penalty would not necessarily be applied in this case.


      urfc^^W&gt; THE F0REIGN AN0 COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the potentially aicosK^%3^s difficult situation in the Turks and Caicos Islands had been

O&apos;YSsS successfully handled. The Government had moved quickly but carefully to |reviou^y([yy ..deal w^t*1 t^ie situation revealed in the report of Mr L J Blom-Cooper QC. [eferenceV^^wie military forces which had been kept in reserve had not been needed. ic(86) 29.1\v$ve Government&apos;s decisions had been well received in Parliament and by media in the United Kingdom, as well as in the Islands themselves /am  &lt;khere was no criticism from other Caribbean countries. The &apos;(iqp^w;utional Commission was being set up.

lORTHERN	3. THE SECRBwiRY\OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that a special

IRELAND	meeting of tha\^ei  ^-Irish Intergovernmental Conference had been held on

IfFAIRS	29 July. The me^rin  \ had taken place in a friendly atmosphere, and had

passed off well. X^He^Attitude of the Irish Foreign Minister, Mr Peter Previous	Barry, had been moP^&amp;Merate than hitherto. It was clear that Mr Barry

Reference:	appreciated that his/c^i^cism of the Royal Ulster Constabulary&apos;s

CC(86) 28.5 decision to re-routev(^Me   than ban certain unionist marches near Catholic areas in Portadow^on 12 July had been unhelpful to the Government in its effor w  ^5yiecure acceptance of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The next foca&amp;jv^zp&apos;t of tension in the Province would be the Apprentice Boys&apos; March in Lorfiroiuierry on 12 August.

The general public order posi^myMw) Northern Ireland remained relatively calm, although there/KanOteen some particularly nasty sectarian attacks by unionist extremists, including one on a Northern Ireland Electricity sub-station.
