The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord President said that, in view of pressure on parliamentary time, it was for consideration whether it was necessaryfor the Selective Employment Payments Bill to go through all itsremaining stages before the Summer Recess, or whether the third reading might be deferred until the House resumed in October.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour, said that inview of the possibility of the Bill being amended in detail thenecessary administrative preparations for its implementation,including the printing of the forms required, could not be begunbefore the Bill was passed. Delay until October would, therefore,entail substantial delay in making payments to industry under theprovisions of the Bill.In discussion there was general agreement that the selective employment Payments Bill (and also the Industrial DevelopmentBill) should pass through all their remaining stages before the summer Recess.In further discussion reference was made to the proposed publication of the White Paper on Transport on Wednesday of thefollowing week, on which day a statement was also due to be made about the rationalisation of Post Office tariffs and the future of thePost Office. It was suggested that there would be advantage if thesetook place on different days, but the general view was that, subjectto the Cabinefs discussion on the last item of their agenda, thebalance of advantage lay in maintaining existing plans. NoParliamentary statement need however be made in respect of theWhite Paper on Transport.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the remaining stages in Parliament of the selective Employment Payments Bill and of theIndustrial Development Bill should be taken before the summer Recess.(2) Agreed, subject to their conclusions on the last item of theiragenda, that the statement on the Post Office and thepublication of the White Paper on Transport should takeplace on Wednesday, 20th July.secret. The Foreign Secretary said that the recent meeting of the indonesian Peoples&apos; Consultative Assembly had not been whollyfavourable to our interests. It had resulted in only a partialdiminution of the powers of President Sukarno and in a failure to ratify the Bangkok Agreement on the ending of confrontation. Itwas clear that the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr. Malik, was anxious that the Agreement should be ratified as soon as possible,but General Suharto had so far not been prepared to enforce

In discussions withthe Indonesian Economic Mission he proposed to emphasise theimportance of such ratification to any further improvement of relations between Indonesia and the United Kingdom. It was proposed that we should withdraw United Kingdom troops fromBorneo as soon as possible after the implementation of theAgreement and the Secretary of State for Defence would, on his return from the Far East, propose a timetable for doing so. Thediscussions with the Indonesian Economic Mission had been friendly,but had so far made little progress. The Mission was seeking furtherUnited Kingdom aid and a rephasing of Indonesian debts to theUnited Kingdom, neither of which was acceptable to us. We forour part were pressing the Mission on United Kingdom claims for compensation in respect of the nationalisation of property owned by united Kingdom individuals and firms in Indonesia. He was hopeful that some progress might be made on this.The United States Government had given a general welcome tothe proposals put forward by the Indian Prime Minister, Mrs. Gandhi,for a peace initiative in respect of the conflict in Vietnam though they had some misgivings about the provision in that proposal for atime lag between the cessation of military activity by the UnitedStates on the one hand, and by the Viet Cong on the other. TheIndian proposal had, however, not been favourably received by theSoviet Government during Mrs. Gandhi&apos;s present visit to Moscow.The Cambodian Government were pressing for an increase inthe staff of the International Control Commission, coupled with a renewed international declaration on the integrity and neutrality ofCambodia. We were urging the Soviet Government, as theco-Chairman with ourselves of the Geneva Conference, to agree thatwe should seek acceptance of this proposal.The judgment of the International Court of Justice on theposition of the South African Government in relation to the mandate for South-West Africa would be published on 18th July. Althoughthe South African Foreign Minister professed to be confident thatthe judgment would be favourable to South Africa, this was doubtful.If it were not and the South African Government did not complywith it, it was possible under the United Nations Charter for thematter to be brought before the Security Council, which had powerto consider the taking of action to enforce compliance. The UnitedStates Government had proposed that we should make a jointdemarche to the South African Government to seek their agreement in advance of publication to comply with the judgment. Our own view was that such an approach would have no effect but as soon asjudgment was delivered we would consult with the United Statesand South African Governments and urge the latter to comply with it and seek meanwhile to avoid precipitate international action.The discussions held during the previous week with the french prime Minister and Foreign Minister had, as was expected, littleconcrete. result. We had at least mitigated the French suspicion that our firm policy in NATO was motivated by hostility to theFrench Government and there had been further agreement in respect
SECRET*3. The Prime Minister said that, as had been agreed at thelast meeting of Cabinet, he had now discussed the economicsituation further with the Ministers principally concerned. It hadbeen decided to increase Bank Rate to 7 per cent and to increasethe call on the Clearing Banks for special deposits proportionately;and this action was being announced that morning. Sterling had recently been under serious pressure, which seemed to have begunat the time of the United States bombing of Hanoi and Haiphongand had been intensified after the announcement of the reserve figuresfor June, which reflected the effects of the seamen&apos;s strike.Underlying these factors was a fundamental shortage of liquidityin Europe, as was shown by the rise in interest rates in other countries,which made it inevitable that after a certain point we should allowour own Bank Rate to rise. But it was necessary, in addition, toadopt a more fundamental approach to the solution of our economic problems, particularly since there seemed to be sufficient publicrealisation of our difficulties for the country to be prepared for firm and positive leadership by the Government. In particular the labour shortage was impeding the achievement of economic objectives and consumer expenditure on less essentials remained too high. he therefore proposed to make a statement in the House of commons that afternoon, reinforcing the increase in Bank Rate by anannouncement that the rate of Government expenditure overseaswould be reduced to a 1967-68 level which would be  100 million less than at present, on the basis that half this saving might be* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRETof the construction of the Channel Tunnel in the sense which theCabinet had previously approved. We had also attempted to persuade the French representatives of the desirability of reviewing the programme for the construction of the Concord, in view of the rapid increase of its cost, but it appeared that the FrenchGovernment remained determined to continue with the project.Our relations with the United States Government were passing through a difficult phase. They were for understandable reasonspreoccupied with the conflict in Vietnam and, although our oppositionto the bombing of the oil installations near Hanoi and Haiphonghad been expected, there had been an adverse reaction to our public statement. Our position over the sale of arms which might be usedin Vietnam had also been the cause of some friction. Although wemust maintain our right to disagree from time to time with thoseaspects of United States policy of which we could not approve, itwas important to our interests that there should be no majordisagreement between us.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.
secured in the European and half in the Eastern theatres. Thestatement might also foreshadow further and more far-reaching decisions in about two or three weeks&apos; time as a result of the majorreview of policy to which he had just referred.It would not be possible for this further statement to be madeforthwith because the measures which it would include would need further consideration. Moreover it would also be desirable, beforethe final decisions were made, to take account of any new factors which might emerge during his forthcoming visits to Moscow and washington. The discussions in Washington would be particularly important, in view of the close links between the dollar and sterling.Examples of the measures which might be included in the subsequent statement were:(a) An extension of the restrictions on office building from london to the whole of the country, although with less severity inthe development areas.(b) A further intensification of building licensing by a reductionin the exemption limit from  100,000 to  50,000.(c) A total freeze of wages and prices on the basis that, althoughit could not be made fully effective and some latitude might have tobe permitted in the case of the lower paid workers, it would have tobe rigidly applied in the public sector and especially on salaries overa prescribed limit. The freeze would have to be maintained for afull 12 months.(d) Some reduction in public sector investment, which wouldbe necessary both in itself and as a counterpart to the intensification of restrictions on construction in the private sector. Moreover, theless essential activities of the nationalised industries, e.g., the competitive advertising of the gas and electricity undertakings, shouldbe reduced or eliminated.(e) Measures to restrain imports and to promote exports;possibly on a selective and discriminatory basis. It would also benecessary to reduce the large and increasing deficit in respect of tourism.These and any other appropriate proposals would have to bethe subject of a considered report to the Cabinet before the furtherpublic statement could be made. It was for consideration, however,whether the initial statement which he proposed to make that afternoon should foreshadow the subsequent announcement. against this it could be argued that this might lead to speculation andforestalling. On the other hand it was necessary, in order to sustainconfidence in sterling, to avoid giving the impression that the increasein Bank Rate and the further call for special deposits represented thesum of the remedial measures which the Government had in mind.The balance of advantage seemed to lie in arranging for the initialstatement that afternoon to include references not only to Bank rate and special deposits but also to the proposed reduction in overseaexpenditure and the intention to announce further measures in thenear future, although no details of these proposals would be disclosedat this stage.
In discussion it was suggested that it would be unwise to include in the initial statement an undertaking to reduce the annual rate ofGovernment expenditure overseas by a figure of  100 million by theend of the financial year. If a cut of this size were to be achieved,the greater part of the economies would have to fall upon our defence expenditure; and a reduction of the order of  70 or  80 million perannum in this category would necessarily involve a more or lesscomplete withdrawal of forces from one of the three main theatres-Europe, the Middle East and the Far East or some combination ofpartial withdrawals. Such a change in policy would be contrary tothe commitments which we had indicated, when discussing the resultsof the Defence Review with our allies, that we would continue todischarge; and, if it were decided that the withdrawal of forces wasto be largely from Germany, this would reverse the priorities decided upon in the Defence Review. Moreover, a decision to withdrawforces on this scale from any of these theatres could hardly fail to doincalculable harm to our international standing; and both thedecisions and the damage would be irrevocable. There had not been sufficient time to work out precisely how reductions of this magnitude could be made; and, it was inequitable that there shouldbe a firm decision in principle to reduce overseas expenditure before any comparable decision had been taken in relation to domesticexpenditure. Moreover, an initial statement of the kind proposed,which would include, by way of reductions in expenditure onlyeconomies overseas and not at home, might well affect confidence in sterling adversely.The Foreign Secretary and the Commonwealth Secretary saidthat, while they did not dissent from the proposal that an examinationof both the possibilities and the implications of securing a reductionof  100 million in Government expenditure overseas should beundertaken, they regarded the potential consequences for our foreignpolicy as so serious that they must reserve the right to reopen thediscussion of any decision to this effect if its results, when examined in detail, appeared unacceptable. It should be possible, however,to use the threat of such a reduction as a bargaining factor in theforthcoming discussions between the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the German financial authorities about the costs of UnitedKingdom troops in Germany, provided that a suitable form of wordsfor this purpose was agreed interdepartmentally in advance.On the other hand it was argued that it was impossible to restoreour oversea account to balance without substantial reductions inGovernment expenditure overseas, for which, indeed, the figure of 100 million should be a minimum rather than a maximum. Ingeneral the Governments from whom we had received financialassistance did not view favourably the extent of our overseas commitments which their money was helping to finance. Moreover,it was essential to avoid a position vis-a-vis the United States inwhich the maintenance of our present level of international commitments and the consequential overseas expenditure might have
to be given such priority as to require a greater degree of severity in domestic economies than would be consistent with the Governmenfssocial and economic objectives. We should be in a stronger positionin the forthcoming discussions with the United States Administrationif we had demonstrated to them, before the Prime Ministers visit,that adequate steps to restore our economic position had alreadybeen taken and announced.In further discussion it was suggested that, even if it were rightto take a decision in principle to effect substantial economies inGovernment expenditure overseas, predominantly on defence, theallocation of those economies had still to be considered. It wouldnot therefore be possible to announce at this stage more than thetotal of the savings to be achieved; and even this might not be advisable unless some corresponding announcement could be made about economies at home. There was a considerable measure ofagreement that, if an initial statement had to be made that afternoon,it should not include any figure for the total reduction to be madein Government expenditure overseas but should rather foreshadowat an early date a further statement in which economies, both athome and abroad, would be announced as additional reinforcement of the Governmenfs economic policy for restoring the stability ofthe economy and the strength of the pound.Alternatively, it might be possible to dispense with an initialstatement that afternoon and, instead, to advance the majorstatement. On the other hand before a wide-ranging statement onthe lines indicated by the Prime Minister could be made it might benecessary to have at least some consultation with leaders of bothsides of industry. Moreover, it could not be taken for granted thatevents would wait upon our convenience; and there was little doubtthat in order to maintain confidence in sterling an initial statement should not be deferred.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, emphasised thegreat importance of preserving complete secrecy about the Cabinet&apos;discussions on economic policy until final decisions had been taken and announced.The general view of the Cabinet was that an initial statement should be made that afternoon in the House of Commons, whichwould refer to the increase in Bank Rate and to the further call forspecial deposits, would emphasise the determination of theGovernment to take any action necessary to restore the strength of sterling and stability of the economy and would indicate that to thisend it would be necessary both to achieve substantial economies inGovernment expenditure overseas and to restrain domestic demand.No details of the savings to be achieved should be given at this stage;but interdepartmental study of measures to restore the economicsituation, on the lines considered in the discussion, should now beput in hand and should be completed in time to enable the Cabinetto consider the policy and presentation of the proposed further statement in the early part of the week beginning 25th July, before
CONFIDENTIALReorganisation       4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first of the Secretary of State (C (66) 105) on the reorganisation of the Post Office.Post office the Postmaster-General said that before the last election the ministerial Committee on Economic Development had come to theconclusion in principle that the Post Office should be reorganised onthe lines of a nationalised industry, but that further consideration was required of the structure of the new organisation and of theposition of the staff before a decision could be taken. These issueshad since been further considered by the Committee which had nowconcluded that the case had been made for changing the status ofthe Post Office to that of a public corporation, primarily because assuch it should be able to develop its managerial and technologicalefficiency more effectively. Such a change would also facilitate animprovement in the competitive efficiency of the electronics industry.In some respects the corporation would be unlike the existingnationalised industries, in particular because of the need for a closerrelationship with the Government in respect of the agency services which it provided for them. It was important to provide by legislation that the reorganised Post Office would continue to havea responsibility for comprehensive national telecommunications andpostal services, so as to avoid public and Parliamentary fears thatthe change in status was a prelude to a reduction of services,particularly in outlying areas, in the name of efficiency and viability.The Committee favoured the establishment of a single corporationresponsible for telecommunications and postal services and for theday-to-day management of the savings and banking services as the agent of the Treasury. It would be particularly important to give a7545-2bCC 36 (66)his forthcoming visit to Washington. It was also the general viewof the Cabinet that measures should be taken to reduce the annual rate of Government expenditure overseas by  100 million by thebeginning of the financial year 1967-68, on the understanding thatthe Ministers of the External Departments must not be taken asendorsing economies on this scale until their implications had been examined in detail. In the meantime the Foreign Secretary and theChancellor of the Exchequer should agree the terms in which theFederal German Government should be informed that unless theyrelieved us of the foreign exchange costs of our troops in Germanywe should have no alternative but to withdraw them to the extent necessary to provide us with the economies which we judgednecessary.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
substantially greater degree of independence to the tele-communications services and to the postal services in relation to each other than they possessed at present.The change of status should be acceptable to the staff associations concerned, though they would no doubt seekassurances that they would retain at least the pay and conditions ofservice which they now enjoyed. It was proposed that this change should not itself be something to be negotiated with the staff: therewould thus be no price to be paid for union acceptance of it. Thenew corporation would be subject to the same restraints as other nationalised industries in subsequently negotiating pay andconditions, but they might in practice well find themselves obligedto pay higher rates of salaries in the senior posts in the interest of efficient management, and this would have repercussions on the pay of junior staff.The new corporation would manage the savings and bankingservices on the Treasury&apos;s behalf, the latter remaining responsiblefor financial policy. The Government would retain the power torequire the new corporation to provide other agency services to theGovernment at cost. It was envisaged that the Ministry of public building and Works would continue to provide building services tothe Post Office as at present and the Committee had taken the viewthat this arrangement could be safeguarded by an administrativeagreement that neither the new corporation nor the Governmentwould do anything that would result in any substantial amount ofthe work concerned ceasing to be done by the Ministry without adequate notice and full consultation. The Minister of public building and Works had, however, taken the view that the position should be safeguarded by means of a reserve statutory power to give directions to the corporation on this matter and had in the Committeereserved his position.Subject to the Cabinefs approval, he proposed to announce on20th July a decision to make these changes on the lines of the draft attached to C (66) 105 and at the same time to publish his annual report and Accounts and his proposals for Post Office tariffrationalisation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that while it might be stated that the change of status was not of itself negotiable with theStaff Associations concerned, there would in practice be heavy pressure from them for consequential increases in pay and improvements in conditions of service: it should be on record that ministers were agreed that the change of status should be effectedwithout additional expenditure. As regards the banking services ofthe Post Office it was essential to the Treasury&apos;s control of a unifiedmonetary policy that they should be able in practice to exercise full control over the operation of these services. It might be that the specific power of Ministerial direction which was proposed wouldnot be adequate for this purpose and further consideration shouldbe given to this detailed aspect of the change in due course. this need not, however, delay the statement that the proposal was inprinciple approved.
CONFIDENTIALDiscussion showed general agreement with the proposals beforethe Cabinet.  The following points were also made:(a) In view of the present close Parliamentary interest in thework of the Post Office it would be essential to the effectiveness ofthe change of status that Parliamentary concern with its affairs should thereafter be strictly limited in precisely the same manner asin respect of other nationalised industries, since otherwise one of theimportant objectives of the change would not be achieved.(b) The policy of the new corporation should have regard to political considerations arising from our long-standing close links with Commonwealth countries in postal and telecommunicationmatters.The Cabinet (1) Approved C (66) 105.(2) Invited the Postmaster-General to make a statement in theHouse of Commons on 20th July on the lines of the draft attached to C (66) 105, subject to further consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer in respect of theneed to provide for adequate Treasury control of thefinancial policy of the savings and banking services ofthe new corporation.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th July, 1966.
