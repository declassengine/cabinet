SECRET 3       380CC 60 (66)secret parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.secret oversea AffairsSouth Arabia(previous reference:CC (66) 41stConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the HighCommissioner for South Arabia had come to London for consultations with the Foreign Secretary. One of the most difficultissues for discussion was the action which should be taken on thereport by Mr. R. Bowen, Q c, on the procedure in Aden for the arrest,interrogation and detention of persons suspected of terrorist activities.The report made it clear that there had been no recent substantialallegations of improper practices in these respects, but allegationswhich had been made about a year ago had not been adequatelypursued by the staff of the High Commissioner. The publication ofthe report in the near future might prejudice our prospect ofobtaining satisfactory agreement to a United Nations Mission to south arabia.The Secretary of State for Defence said that the allegations in mr. Bowen&apos;s report particularly related to three men who were nolonger in Aden, but who were subject to military discipline. He was considering whether there was a case for military proceedings against them. It was possible that action which the Government might subsequently think it right to take might in certain circumstances have repercussions which would prejudice our prospect of successfullydisengaging ourselves from South Arabia and of leaving behind an organised State.In discussion it was the general view that the issues arising fromMr. Bowen&apos;s report called for further consideration by the ministers primarily concerned.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Defence, to circulate a paper to the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee on the issues arising from Mr. Bowen&apos;s reporton the procedures in respect of detainees in Adensuspected of terrorist activities.United Nations(previous reference:CC (66) 56thConclusions,Minute 4)The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the UnitedKingdom Representative at the United Nations and the staff of the delegation had recently been under exceptional strain because of the highly contentious series of debates in the General Assembly and inother United Nations organs on South-West Africa, Rhodesia, south arabia and Gibraltar. We had been under severe attack in the courseof these debates and the United Kingdom Representative and his staff had shown great skill and resilience in rebutting them.
The Cabinet (2) Took note with approval, of the tribute paid by the Ministerof State for Foreign Affairs to the work of the UnitedKingdom Representative at the United Nations and thatof the staff of the United Kingdom Delegation.SECRETRhodesia 3.   The Cabinet considered a note by the Commonwealth(Previous       Secretary (C (66) 172) covering a draft White Paper on Rhodesia.Reference:CC (66) 55thConclusions, The Prime Minister said that the reply from Mr. Smith, the headMinute 1) of the illegal regime, to the three questions which we had put to himReply from the was cleverly drafted with a view to influencing opinion in Rhodesia,Illegal Regime the United Kingdom and South Africa. It amounted however to acomplete rejection of our terms. On the constitutional arrangements the regime had resiled from their position before the illegal declarationof independence. The 1961 Constitution had never been intendedto be a basis for independence and successive United kingdom governments had insisted that there must be additional safeguards for unimpeded progress to majority rule before independence couldbe granted. The regime now rejected these safeguards and wereinsisting that there should be provision for 15 European reservedseats to be added as Africans gained &quot; A &quot; Roll seats, the effect ofwhich would be to impose an additional delay before majority rule of perhaps 10 years. They also proposed to abolish cross voting.They refused to entrench Section 37 of the Constitution and could thus delay majority rule indefinitely by creating additional &quot; A &quot; Roll seats which would be won by Europeans. The position adopted bythe regime on the constitutional arrangements was the main groundon which a break must now be regarded as inevitable. They alsorejected our proposals for a return to legality; this was also animportant issue of principle since there could be no adequate test ofRhodesian opinion, in accordance with the fifth principle, while the illegal regime was still in power.The Governor had strongly urged that the commonwealth secretary should again visit Salisbury before the break with the regime took place. He maintained that Mr. Smith&apos;s reply indicatedsome move in our direction, although on this occasion the chief justice took a less sanguine view. If, however, the Governors requestwere refused he might well resign and claim that the United KingdomGovernment were responsible for the failure to reach a settlement.This could be very damaging on the eve of our recourse to the united nations and the Ministers principally concerned had therefore agreedthat the Commonwealth Secretary should pay another brief visit to salisbury in order to demonstrate that even at the last momentbefore our time limit expired at the end of November we had kept open the possibility of a settlement. Ministers had been confirmed in this view by the invitation to Mr. Smith to appear on anIndependent Television programme in the United Kingdom. there could be no question of giving him a safe conduct; in any event
proceedings against him could be initiated by a private citizen and notonly by the Government. In these circumstances it was unlikely thathe would come to the United Kingdom, but the case for a visit bythe Commonwealth Secretary to Salisbury was strengthened. TheCommonwealth Secretary&apos;s visit would be to the Governor and hewould seek to persuade him to remain at his post. If the Governornevertheless resigned when mandatory United Nations sanctionswere imposed, we should need to consider what course to adopt underthe 1961 Constitution. Under the 1961 Constitution the Chief Justicewould act as Governor in the absence of the holder of that Office, butthis might not prove the best longer term solution. There would beno question of the Commonwealth Secretary negotiating with the regime, but he would indicate his readiness to see Mr. Smith if thelatter had any communication to make to him. If Mr. Smith askedfor a meeting the Commonwealth Secretary would make it clear thatwe were not prepared to alter the timetable we had established andthat unless, during his visit, Mr. Smith accepted our terms, we should go to the United Nations to seek approval for mandatory sanctions.It seemed in the highest degree improbable that Mr. Smith would accept our terms, including the assumption by the Governor ofcontrol over the Rhodesian armed forces and police, and theacceptance of a British military presence in Rhodesia; a break must therefore now be regarded as inevitable. The reasons for theCommonwealth Secretary&apos;s visit had been explained by the UnitedKingdom Representative (Lord Caradon) at the United Nations andby the United Kingdom Special Representative in East and central africa (Mr. Malcolm MacDonald) to the Heads of Government in kenya and Uganda.Lord Caradon and Mr. Malcolm MacDonald had advised thatwe could not hope to restrict oil sanctions against Rhodesia toMozambique. The Ministers principally concerned therefore took the view that the initial resolution which we would sponsor should deal only with selected Rhodesian exports but that we should beprepared to accept an amendment extending the resolution to include a general ban on oil supplies to Rhodesia. At the sametime we should have to reserve our position on enforcement if theban on oil supplies were not observed by Portugal or South Africa.We might contemplate enforcement action against Mozambique buteconomic war with South Africa could cost us over  200 million in exports (as well as further substantial consequences for our invisibleearnings) and we could not contemplate damage to our trade of that order. A number of countries other than Portugal and South Africahad however failed to comply strictly with the voluntary ban onRhodesian exports and a mandatory resolution should make thesesanctions more effective.In discussion general support was expressed for the visit by theCommonwealth Secretary to Salisbury on the basis described by thePrime Minister.On the question of our attitude towards enforcement measuresit was suggested that if we stated publicly at the United Nations that
we could not agree to any measures against South Africa, this wouldbe severely criticised as being likely to nullify the effect of mandatoryoil sanctions against Rhodesia. It might therefore be preferable forour position to be explained privately to Commonwealth countriesrather than stated publicly. On the other hand if our position werenot made clear to the South African Government they might wellretaliate against our economic interests. It was pointed out that wehad made our position clear at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos;Meeting and this was on record. Moreover, the question wouldcertainly be raised in Parliament and would have to be answered.We could therefore indicate our position to the South african government but need give them no commitment; we could draw attention to the risks which would arise if the Rhodesian problemremained unsolved, including the possibility that the Soviet Unionmight offer forces to the United Nations for use against Rhodesia orto enforce sanctions. There was an indication that the South african government were very much concerned at these dangers and mightbe prepared to put pressure on the Rhodesian regime to reach asettlement acceptable to us.In further discussion the point was made that by invokingmandatory sanctions at the United Nations and by the declaration that we should no longer be prepared to grant independence before majority rule, we should be starting out on a road the end of whichwas not clear. In particular, we could no longer expect to be ableto reach a settlement with any European regime. Furthermore,although the immediate effect of mandatory sanctions on selectedRhodesian exports should not add significantly to the economicburden which the United Kingdom was already bearing, the risk of developments in Zambia which would interrupt copper supplies would remain, though attention could not be drawn to this in public and itmust be expected that the new phase of the Rhodesian situation would add to our economic difficulties. If we were to retain thesupport of opinion in this country it would be necessary to explainas simply as possible the issues of principles which made a breakunavoidable.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet would wish to consider the terms of the draft resolution on selected Rhodesian exports which we intended tointroduce at the United Nations, and also on the embargo on oil imports into Rhodesia which we would be prepared to accept. a paper should also be circulated by the Commonwealth Secretary onthe implications for the United Kingdom economy of the mandatoryUnited Nations sanctions which were envisaged and of theconsequences of economic confrontation with South Africa.TimetableThe Prime Minister said that the Commonwealth secretary would leave that night and would return to the United kingdom on the morning of 28th November. Assuming that our terms had notbeen accepted he would himself make a statement in Parliament that afternoon. There would be advantage if the White Paper were issuedsimultaneously rather than on the following day. He would propose
CC60(66)to make a television broadcast on the same evening and there shouldbe the fullest briefing of the United Kingdom and foreign Press.The Government had undertaken not to embark on any irrevocableaction without affording an opportunity for discussion in parliament and the Opposition might be offered a debate on 30th November and1st December. If they chose to postpone the debate the Governmentcould not be committed to deferring the action which we shouldhave to take at the United Nations. Lord Caradon might initiateconfidential discussions on our draft resolution on selective mandatorysanctions on 1st December and at the same time call for a meeting ofthe Security Council on 7th December. This would allow time fora meeting of the Commonwealth Sanctions Committee on 5th December.The Cabinet then discussed the draft White Paper and thefollowing main points were made (a) It should be made clear that, as the Prime Minister had pointed out, the illegal regime had resiled from the position adoptedbefore the illegal declaration of independence on future constitutional arrangements. This might be brought out both at the end ofparagraph 19 and in the concluding section.(b) The final message to the regime, the draft of which was circulated at the meeting (the text of which is annexed to these minutes), should be included as Appendix F and a reference to itshould appear in the main text, perhaps in paragraph 37. The message should include a refutation of the accusation in Mr. Smith&apos;s reply tothe three questions about the British assistance to Zambianbroadcasting.A number of other amendments were also agreed.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to circulate a paper on the resolution to be introduced at the United nations for mandatory sanctions on selected Rhodesian exports and a general oil embargo and on the implications ofUnited Nations action for the United Kingdom economy,on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up of the first part of their discussion.(2) Took note, with approval, of the forthcoming visit by theCommonwealth Secretary to Rhodesia.(3) Approved the timetable for future action indicated by thePrime Minister.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary and the Attorney General,would approve additional passages for the White paper on the lines agreed in their discussion.(5) Subject to Conclusion (4) above and the other amendmentsthey had agreed, approved the White Paper.Draft white paper
PROPOSED MESSAGE TO THE REGIMEThe British Government have studied the answers given to thethree clarificatory questions which they have raised.2. They note that, despite the insistent arguments on the rhodesian side throughout the exploratory talks since last May onthe need for safeguards against the premature advent of African rule,this is no longer advanced as the reason for not including Section 37of the 1961 Constitution among the specially entrenched clauses: butthat it remains Mr. Smith&apos;s position that Section 37 should not be soincluded. The power to use this section to control the pace of progress towards majority rule would therefore exist.3. They note that Mr. Smith is not prepared to discuss orcommit himself in any way on matters regarding the restoration of constitutional government &quot; until the constitutional settlement hasbeen disposed of and acknowledged by the British Government as having passed the test of acceptability &quot;. This also can only mean that Mr. Smith considers that the test of acceptability must takeplace before there has been a return to constitutionality.4. No British Government which adhered to the fifth principlecould possibly undertake in advance to impose a constitutional settlement if this had been shown to be unacceptable to the people of rhodesia as a whole. The possibility of opinion expressing itselfagainst the proposals for a settlement must be inherent in any fair and free test. In that event there would of course be a legalGovernment under the 1961 Constitution, appropriately modified.5. It is also noted that, as regards the circumstances in whichthe testing of opinion might be carried out, Mr. Smith is preparedto go only as far as to recognise &quot; the need to modify censorship &quot;and the possibility of permitting persons in detention to make knowntheir views to the testing authority.6. In the light of these replies, the British Government are obliged to conclude that Mr. Smith is not ready to contemplate a constitutional settlement which would ensure unimpeded progress tomajority rule, or to accept what must be the minimal requirementsif the opinion of the people of Rhodesia as a whole is to be properlyascertained.7. The matter now becomes a question for the british parliament, to which the British Government v/ill shortly becommunicating full details of the recent exchanges and the positionnow reached.
