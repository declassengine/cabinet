SECRET &apos;    3 425CC 67 (66)confidential parliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the first week after the Recess.OverseaAffairsForeignSecretary&apos;visit to NATO(previous reference:CC (66) 27thConclusions,Minute 4)discussions on Europe(previous reference:CC(66) 64thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that the Ministerial Meeting ofthe North Atlantic Council had gone well. Agreement had beenreached on nuclear planning machinery which should strengthen the alliance. It might also help to remove the obstacles to a treaty on non-proliferation since the Soviet Foreign Minister had indicated tohim that the Soviet Government would not object to such machinery in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). Herr Brandt,the new German Foreign Minister,. had made an impressive speech and was clearly not seeking a solution to the nuclear problem whichwould involve common ownership of nuclear weapons or a Europeannuclear force. There were, however, likely to be differences ofpolicy in the Federal German Government now that it was a coalition of the two main Parties. The move of the North atlantic council from Paris to Brussels had also been agreed. The Italianproposals for technological co-operation had aroused great interest;the study of this subject need not be confined to NATO and wecould make use of it in the context of our approach to the european economic Community (e.c.). The Belgian proposal for a study onthe future of the alliance had been accepted. There had been press reports about differences between ourselves and the United States on defence policy; but these were much exaggerated.He had discussed our approach to the e.c. with a number ofForeign Ministers; and the French Foreign Minister had arranged for him to meet President de Gaulle. Their conversation had beenin general terms; and the President had not referred to agricultural policy, the position of New Zealand or any points of detail. He had expressed concern about the position of sterling as a world currency,but more from the point of view of the privileges and prestige whichthis might be held to confer on the United Kingdom than in relationto the liabilities it imposed. It was difficult to form any conclusionabout his attitude towards our entry into the e.c.; and it was unlikely that he would give any definite answers until we were ableto put forward firm proposals. He had, however, 3poken of hisgoodwill towards the United Kingdom; and we need not thereforetake it for granted that there would be French objection to our entry into the e.c. on acceptable terms.In discussion the point was made that President de Gaulle&apos;attitude towards sterling differed from that of some other membersof the French Government who professed to be more concerned about the liabilities which sterling imposed and about the possibledisruption of the e.c. which might be caused by the entry of theUnited Kingdom and other members of the European Free trade association.   But, although sterling conferred privileges as well as
Gibraltar(previous reference:CC (66) 51stConclusions,Minute 4)imposing burdens, it need not necessarily constitute any barrier toour entry into the e.c..In further discussion reference was made to the need to keepother Commonwealth Governments closely informed about our approach to the e.c.. We should seek to avoid a commonwealth conference; but a visit by the Commonwealth Secretary to Australiaand New Zealand in late February would fit in well with the timetable for the visits by the Prime Minister and the foreign secretary to the e.c. capitals.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Foreign Secretary and thepoints made in discussion.The Foreign Secretary said that for the first time an amendmenthad been adopted to a resolution in the United Nations general assembly about Gibraltar which recognised the importance of theinterests of the inhabitants in any solution. This was a considerable advance and was in great measure due to the influence at the united nations of Sir Joshua Hassan, the Chief Minister of Gibraltar. TheSpanish Government had now rejected our proposal for a referenceto the International Court of Justice; but their reply contained noconstructive counter-proposals. We should need to consider our future policy early in the New Year; meanwhile, it would be best tomaintain the line that the Spanish reply was still under study andto avoid any public statements which might exacerbate the situationor might lead to further Spanish measures against Gibraltar andparticularly against our use of the airfield.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Rhodesia(previous reference:CC(66) 66thConclusions)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that the resolution finallyadopted by the Security Council had been on the lines we wished:and all the amendments which were unacceptable to us had been defeated. This satisfactory result was mainly due to the skilful way in which the United Kingdom Representative to the United nations and members of the United Kingdom Mission had handled thematter. The Commonwealth members of the Security Council,Nigeria and Uganda, had admittedly joined in sponsoring the amendments. But they had been under great pressure from othermembers of the African bloc; and they had acted against the viewsof some of the more extreme African States in voting for theresolution at the final stage. They could reasonably claim,therefore, that they had given effect to their undertakings in theCommonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; communique of the previousSeptember.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that in reply to parliamentary Questions that afternoon about Rhodesia the PrimeMinister intended to confirm that we would no longer be prepared
NewspaperIndustryThe times and TheSundayTimesSECRET4. The President of the Board of Trade said that the monopolies Commission had now reported on their investigation intothe proposal for The Times and The Sunday Times to come undercommon ownership. The Commission had concluded, with onedissentient, that the proposed transaction would not operate againstthe public interest. The majority of the Commission had notrecommended that any conditions should be attached to the Boardof Trade&apos;s consent to the proposal. The one dissentient, however,had recommended that, in order to minimise the risk of future developments which might be contrary to the public interest, theThomson Organisation should accept as binding on itself the assurances given to the Commission by Lord Thomson personallyabout the preservation of the separate identities of The Times andThe Sunday Times and the maintenance of the independence of theireditors; and that the proposed new company should give a similarundertaking. On these two questions he had felt that the majority report of the Commission was not entirely satisfactory; and he had therefore &apos; sought, and had now received, satisfactory formalassurances from the Thomson Organisation as to their intentions inthese respects. The proposed transfer was the only practicablecourse to ensure the future of The Times; and he proposed, if theCabinet agreed, to give his consent to it.Two subsidiary issues arose. First, The Guardian and TheObserver relied for their printing on presses owned by The Sunday times and The Times. They had now secured, however, legalagreements that they could continue to use these facilities for the next10 years; and this arrangement should constitute adequate protection for their legitimate interests. Second, the Thomson Organisation had insisted that the present Editor of The Sunday Times should havethe title of Editor-in-Chief in the new organisation. This title usuallyimplied that the individual concerned controlled editorial policy aswell as other matters; but the intention in the present case was that,while controlling all other matters affecting the two newspapers, the editor-in-Chief would not control editorial policy. In view of the assurances given by the Thomson Organisation on the main issue ofto grant independence before majority rule. But the answer wouldalso make it clear that, although the Governments policy would nowbe*as set out in paragraph 10 of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos;communique, the objective of that policy would still be to achieve a satisfactory settlement with a legal Government of Rhodesia.The Cabinet  1Took note, with approval, of the Foreign Secretary&apos;sstatement and invited him to convey to the UnitedKingdom Representative at the United Nations their appreciation of the way in which he and his staff hadconducted the debate on Rhodesia in the Security Council.
maintaining the separate identities of the two newspapers and theindependence of their editors, he had concluded that it was not necessary to press them on the formal point of nomenclature.He therefore proposed to announce, in reply to a writtenParliamentary Question on the following day, that he accepted themajority conclusion of the Commission and had accordingly givenhis consent to the proposed transfer. He would also refer to the formal assurances given to him by the Thomson Organisation aboutthe preservation of the separate identities of the two newspapers andthe maintenance of the independence of their editors.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal.The following points were made:(a) The newspaper industry was facing increasing difficulties asa result of the effects, first, of commercial television and, more recently, of the Governments economic measures on advertisingrevenue, superimposed on more deep-seated difficulties arising frominefficient management and restrictive labour practices.(b) In these circumstances it would not be surprising if theindustry itself sought to promote a full enquiry into its future; but itwould be wrong for the Government to anticipate any proposal ofthis kind. Meanwhile, if there were a demand for a discussion inParliament in the new year on the general position in the newspaperindustry, it would be right to accede to it.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, having regard to the assurances given by theThomson Organisation, the President of the Board of Trade should give his consent to the proposal for common ownership of the twonewspapers. If there were a demand in Parliament for a general debate on the newspaper industry in the new year, this should beaccepted.The Cabinet (1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to give his consent to the proposal that The Times and The Sunday times should come under common ownership on thebasis of the understandings which he had described.(2) Invited the Lord President, in dealing with any request fora Parliamentary debate on the newspaper industry, tobe guided by the points made in discussion.MotorIndustryRootesMotors, Ltd.secret. *The Minister of Technology said that Rootes Motors, Ltd.were in serious difficulties. They had incurred substantial lossesover the last two years; and an injection of further capital wouldbe essential by the end of January 1967 if the company were tocontinue. They had applied to the Treasury for permission for the chrysler Corporation to increase their already substantial holding in the company to an extent which would give Chrysler complete
&apos; 7   42 7CC 67 (66)control. There were, however, serious objections to this proposal.It would mean that, of the five major motor manufacturers in theUnited Kingdom, three would be subsidiaries of United States firms.It was doubtful whether as many as five major firms could be sustained in this country in the long run; and the British firms were more likely than the American subsidiaries to be eliminated in thefuture. To allow Chrysler to take over Rootes might therefore havegrave long-term effects on the structure of the industry and might reduce to an unacceptable degree our control over the industry&apos;operations, which were vital to employment and exports.In view of past assurances given to Rootes, it would be unacceptable simply to frustrate the Chrysler takeover by refusingexchange control permission, unless there were a feasible alternative method of keeping the Company in business. He had thereforeexamined, in consultation with the Ministers immediately concerned,the possibility that a consortium of the British Motor Corporation(BMC) and Leyland/Rover might acquire control of Rootes. BMCand Leyland/Rover were interested in this suggestion; but they werenot prepared to come to a decision until they had had an opportunityof considering Rootes&apos; present position and future prospects in detail.Rootes / Chrysler had not at first been prepared to release this information; but they had later agreed to disclose it to the industrial reorganisation Corporation (1958-59), who were now urgently analysingit. The Government would have the right to bring BMC andLeyland / Rover fully into the negotiations, if this analysis showed that a British takeover was likely to be a realistic proposition. Ajoint operation of this kind by BMC and Leyland / Rover would help to develop closer co-operation between the two companies, whichwas particularly desirable in the export field. Bridging finance bythe Government and assistance from the 1958-59 were likely to berequired. But, if a British takeover proved in the end not to be feasible, it would be necessary, before giving permission for atakeover by Chrysler, to impose appropriate conditions as regardsthe direction of Rootes and the future of their plant at Linwood.In discussion there was some support for the suggestion that atakeover by Chrysler should be allowed, since they were in a stronger position that the British firms to supply the major injection of capital and the more efficient management which Rootes required. Therewas a danger that a British takeover would require assistance fromthe 1958-59 on such a scale that a major part of the Corporation^resources would be pre-empted for what might prove to be anunprofitable venture. The employment prospects at Linwood neednot be prejudiced by a Chrysler takeover and might conceivablybenefit. There could be no prospect that the Government itself mightundertake a major role in running Rootes; and it was important toavoid causing Chrysler to lose interest if there was a risk that no alternative course would subsequently prove to be feasible.On balance, however, opinion favoured a solution which would ensure British control of Rootes, provided that this could be arranged at an acceptable price and that BMC/Leyland were prepared to
assume the management responsibility. It would be inexpedient toallow another major manufacturer to fall under American control;and there was no guarantee that Chrysler would always operate ina way consistent with our national interest, as the other Americansubsidiaries had hitherto done. Moreover, it would not necessarilyenhance our prospects of securing entry to the European economic community to allow a major extension of United States control ofour motor industry. As regards the danger of pre-empting theresources of the 1958-59, it might be possible to interest other sources,such as insurance companies or merchant bankers, in helping toraise the necessary capital.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said theCabinet agreed that negotiations should be pursued for a takeoverof Rootes by a consortium of BMC and Leyland/Rover with appropriate assistance from the Government and the 1958-59, although we might in the end have to revert to the alternative of permittinga takeover by Chrysler. The Minister of Technology should pursue the negotiations urgently, in consultation with the First Secretary ofState, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of theBoard of Trade. The Secretary of State for Scotland should be kept in touch with developments. If progress warranted it, the Ministerof Technology should make a further report to Cabinet on Thursday,22nd December. Otherwise, if a decision became urgently necessaryduring the Recess, he would arrange for it to be taken in consultationwith the Ministers mainly concerned. Meanwhile, particular care should be taken to safeguard the confidential nature of the cabinets discussion in view of the untoward financial and commercialconsequences which might follow any premature disclosure.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Technology, in consultation with theMinisters mainly concerned, to pursue negotiations withthe object of maintaining British control of RootesMotors, Limited, and to report further to the Cabinet onThursday, 22nd December, if developments so warranted.(2) Took note that, if a decision became urgently necessaryduring the Recess, the Prime Minister would make thenecessary arrangements for this purpose in consultationwith the Ministers primarily concerned.Prices andIncomesPolicyService doctors and Dentists:Amount of pay Increases(previous reference:CC (66) 21stConclusions,Minute 4)confidential. The Cabinet considered a note by the First Secretary of Stateand Secretary of State for Economic Affairs (C (66) 184) on the pay of Service doctors and dentists. .The First Secretary of State said that the Ministerial Committeeon Prices and Incomes had been unable to reach an agreedconclusion on the amount of an increase of pay for Service doctors and dentists. The pay of Service doctors and dentists had not been increased at the time of the general increases in Service pay earlier in the year; but the Government had undertaken to take accountof increases awarded to civilian doctors and dentists engaged in the
National Health Service in reaching decisions about the pay ofService doctors and dentists. Since 1962 the pay of Service doctors and dentists had been determined by reference to a 16 per cent leadover the average net career income of civilian general practitionersin the National Health Service. Since 1964, when the pay of Servicedoctors and dentists was last increased, the average net income of civilian general practitioners would by 1st April, 1967, have been increased by about 44 per cent as a result of the recommendations ofthe Review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration. these recommendations were designed to stem the loss of doctors fromgeneral practice by improving the attractiveness of the service; andthere was general agreement that it would not be right to concede a comparable increase to Service doctors and dentists.The British Medical Association (BMA) would, it was believed,be ready to accept an increase of 20 per cent, conditional, however,upon a further increase later on corresponding to the secondinstalment of the general practitioners&apos; increase, due on 1st April,1967. The Secretary of State for Defence had proposed to concedean increase of 20 per cent, without any commitment to a secondinstalment. In discussion three other possibilities had beensuggested:(i) An increase of 18 per cent, which could be justified by reference to the increases for general practitioners(excluding from the reckoning additional payments whichremunerated features of general practice that had nocounterpart or were otherwise rewarded in Service life)and would preserve the former relativity with otherserving officers.(ii) An increase of 13^ per cent, based on the average increase for hospital doctors.(iii) An increase of 10 per cent, based on the increase for seniorhospital doctors.Most members of the Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomeshad favoured an offer of 10 per cent (payable from 1st July, 1967,with effect from 1st October, 1966) and were prepared to agree thatan increase of this order need not be paid in instalments. TheSecretary of State for Defence, however, remained of the view thatthe offer should not be less than 18 per cent, which he was preparedto see paid in instalments. The First Secretary of State said that hisown view, and that of the other Ministers, was that an increase ofthis order would have such serious implications for the government&apos;s policy on prices and incomes that it could not be contemplated atthis time. The matter had therefore to be submitted to the cabinet for a decision. ( iThe Secretary of State for Defence said that the proposals beforethe Cabinet concerned some 2,000 doctors and dentists in theServices. The maintenance of a sufficient establishment of doctors and dentists was vital to the morale of the Services. Nevertheless,medical branches were under-manned; and recruitment had fallen
short of the requirement, particularly since last April. The cadetentry, on which the medical services so largely depended, was runnin at less than half its earlier level; and at the rank of Captainand Major the medical branches of the Service were now 33-]- percent under establishment. An increase of 10 per cent would beregarded by Service doctors and dentists as wholly inadequate.There was a real danger that the staffing situation, which was alreadyserious, would become catastrophic: doctors would leave the medicalbranches of the Service and it would become impossible to recruit.There was even a threat by the BMA to blacklist Service medicalappointments. If these fears were realised, the Government wouldbe faced with an extremely serious situation, the remedies for whichwould be considerably more expensive. Service doctors and dentistswould have had to wait for 15 months after other serving officers fortheir increase, which would be effective from a date six months later than the increases for other officers. An increase of 18 per cent would convert the former lead of 16 per cent over the general practitioner to a lag of over 5 per cent. None the less, he would beprepared to defend an increase of 18 per cent, which would preserve the relativity with other serving officers and could be justified by reference to the increases for general practitioners. An increase of10 per cent, however, could not be justified by any analogy andwould be under one-fifth of what Service doctors would considerthey were entitled to receive. An increase of 18 per cent in basic pay could be expressed as an increase of 13^ per cent in totalemoluments; and, if phased in three payments, it would amount to only 4^ per cent on each occasion.In discussion there was a wide measure of agreement that anincrease of as much as 18 per cent would have serious implications for the policy on prices and incomes. One of the necessary implications-tions of maintaining such a policy was that less weight could be givento traditional analogies than in the past in determining wages and salaries; and wider considerations had to be taken into account. Anincrease of 18 per cent would add greatly to the difficulties of dealingwith forthcoming claims in other public services, where the level of salaries was lower and the problems of recruitment no less great.In further discussion the following points were also made:(a) It was questionable Whether the analogy with the civiliangeneral practitioner had ever been valid. Although the work ofsome Service doctors resembled that of general practitioners, thework of Service doctors generally was more like hospital doctorsthan general practitioners in that they were salaried employees,working in premises, and with equipment, provided directly by theemployers. By comparison with hospital doctors, the young doctorsin the armed Services were already well-paid.(b) While it was true that in the Services there was a ratio ofone doctor to every 400 men, this could not be directly comparedwith the doctor-patient ratio in civil life: Service doctors dealt notonly with Servicemen but also with their families and undertookfunctions which in civil life were carried out by public health doctors.On the other hand some reorganisation of the medical branches of
SocialServicesFamilyEndowment(previous reference:CC(66) 58thConclusions,Minute 4)SECRET7. The Cabinet considered memoranda on family endowmentby the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Minister without portfolio (C(66) 181) and by the Minister of Social Security(C (66) 183). They also had before them a note by the Secretary ofthe Cabinet (C (66) 182), to which was annexed a report by officials on this subject.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that, at their previous discussion on family endowment, the Cabinet had invited him, inconsultation with the Minister without Portfolio, to give further the Services should make it possible to reduce the number of Servicedoctors and dentists; in particular, the number of base hospitals inthis country appeared to be unnecessarily large.(c) In this, as in other cases of public service pay, there was a conflict between the Governments responsibility as an employer andtheir wider responsibility for economic management. It was clearlydifficult for the Cabinet to act as a final arbiter in cases of this kind.Considerations of this nature had led to the establishment of independent arbitration arrangements for the Civil Service and many other parts of the public services. Bearing in mind that this was a highly complex issue, that in any case no payment would be made until July and that the pay of Service doctors and dentists was insome sense the corollary of the genera! increase in Service pay, itmight be best to refer the pay of Service doctors and dentists to theNational Board for Prices and Incomes. On the other hand therewould be some difficulty in adopting this course in that it wouldbe difficult for the Board to reach any conclusions on this matteruntil the criteria for the policy on incomes for the second half of1967 had been determined and promulgated. Moreover, a referenceto the Board could cause confusion in relation to the increases whichwere about to be offered to university clinical teachers.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, on balance, the Cabinet supported the view of the Ministerial Committeeon Prices and Incomes that Service doctors and dentists should be offered an increase of 10 per cent in basic pay, to be paid in fullfrom 1st July, 1967, with effect from 1st October, 1966. they recognised the strength of the arguments advanced by the Secretaryof State for Defence for a higher figure; but they judged that in thecircumstances considerations of the policy on prices and incomes should be overriding.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to inform theBritish Medical Association that the Government wereprepared to offer an increase of 10 per cent in the basic pay of Service doctors and dentists, payable from 1st July, 1967,with effect from 1st October, 1966.
consideration to an acceptable family endowment scheme. Therewere, in his view, three overlapping problems the problem of childpoverty disclosed by the recent Ministry of Social Security Survey;the question whether there should be some redistribution of incomeboth between families in different income groups and as betweenhusband and wife; and the question whether the charges for school meals and welfare milk should be increased. The more immediate problem was posed by the indication given by the Ministry of social security Survey of the extent of poverty among families with children. It appeared that some 160,000 families, containing500,000 children, might have incomes below the new level ofsupplementary benefits. No practicable increase of family allowances,even if associated with a reduction of income tax child allowances a &quot; give and take &quot; scheme could solve the problem of child povertyas efficiently and economically as could the introduction of an income-tested allowance. While objections of principle had been urged against the latter, there were equally objections of fiscalprinciple to the &quot; give and take &quot; type of scheme. Nor was it clearhow wage-earners would regard the reduction of their take-home pay which would result from a reduction of income tax child allowancesor whether they would in general regard this reduction ascompensated by the extra family allowances paid to their wives. Anysuch scheme would represent a major and controversial innovation;and the Cabinet should be satisfied, before reaching a decision, thatsuch a scheme was socially justified and sufficiently assured of public support. An informed decision could not be taken until the full report by the Ministry of Social Security on the Survey they had made was available for consideration by Ministers and until therehad been wider discussion of the implications of the &quot; give and take &quot; approach with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and the confederation of British Industries (CBI), who had already expressedmisgivings about it. It would not, in his view, be possible tointroduce a &quot; give and take &quot; type of scheme involving a reductionof income tax child allowances in 1967-68 except by drastic actionof an emergency nature. This would not be justified, since both heand the Minister without Portfolio considered that public pressure for action was unlikely to develop further until the Ministry of social Security report was published at the end of May and thatthe position could then be held until 1968 provided that theGovernment could show that they were actively in search of an acceptable long-term solution. In the meantime, in order to enablethe increased charges for school meals and welfare milk to be made from September 1967, consideration should be given to extendingfurther up the income scale the present concessions which enabledfamilies with incomes below supplementary benefit level to obtainschool meals and welfare milk without charge.The Minister without Portfolio said that, accepting the difficultyof introducing a &quot; give and take &quot; type of scheme from April 1967he had considered various possibilities of introducing such a scheme in June or July, after a post-Budget recoding for Pay-As-You-Earn(PAYE) tax purposes, or in October.  Any such scheme, however,
would either involve hardship to the families concerned or formidableadministrative difficulties for the Inland Revenue and employers orfor the Ministry of Social Security. It could not be recommendedunless emergency action were judged essential. But it was bothunnecessary and undesirable to reach premature decisions on thelong-term scheme to be adopted. No interim increase of family allowances, within the limits of public expenditure for 1967-68, could make any worthwhile impact on the problem of child poverty; andthere was even stronger objection to the introduction of any schemeof income-tested allowance, even as an interim measure. Widerdiscussion was essential if a generally acceptable scheme was to beevolved; and this discussion might best proceed on the basis of a white Paper, which might be published early in the new year,explaining the problem and setting out possible courses of action. Allthe necessary factual information on the various alternative schemeswas sufficiently available for the purposes of a White Paper of thiskind. Discussions with representative organisations should proceed in order to enable a decision to be taken, and announced at the timeof the Budget, on a family endowment scheme to take effect from april 1968.The Minister of Social Security recalled that in their election manifesto and on repeated occasions subsequently the Governmenthad given assurances that integration of tax allowances with social security benefits, and in particular family allowances, was beingurgently considered. It would be very difficult now to publish a white Paper which confined itself to promoting further public discussion. Sufficient information to enable a decision in principle to be taken was already available from the results of herDepartment^ Survey and from subsequent studies by officials. any extension of means-testing into the field of family endowment was unacceptable in principle, would be difficult to operate and wouldbe destructive of incentive. The objection made by the CBI to the&quot; give and take &quot; type of scheme was based on a misapprehension;taxpayers below the surtax level would not be significantly worse off. Such a scheme, in addition to helping all families belowsupplementary benefit level, would help also the many families withincomes only a little above that level. Such families benefited neitherfrom the higher supplementary benefit nor from income tax allowances; and their relative position would be further worsenedas rents rose and national insurance contributions and school mealcharges were increased. An increase in the income level at whichfree school meals were provided would not be sufficient, since manyparents were deterred from availing themselves of the concessionbecause of the stigma thought to attach to it. If no &quot; give and take &quot; scheme were possible in 1967-68, an interim increase in family allowances, perhaps of 5s. a week for fourth and subsequent children,should be given within the ceiling of  10 million which the Chancellorof the Exchequer had previously indicated might be available for additional expenditure. This would be an earnest of the government&apos;s future intentions.
In discussion it was suggested that inadequate provision inrespect of child poverty represented the biggest single gap in thesocial services. There was general agreement that a scheme involving a reduction of tax allowances was not practicable in 1967-68 andthat a White Paper might be published as early as possible in orderto inform public opinion, provided that it incorporated a decision by the Government on the form which improved family endowmentshould take. While there might be a reasoned case for makingadditional provision subject to a means test, there were strong objections in principle to such an approach and also to theintroduction of direct supplementation of earnings. It was suggestedthat, while all the factual information necessary to enable a decisionto be reached was now available, the implications of alternative schemes required fuller consideration. In particular, the justification for financing families in the lower income group solely from otherfamilies with children should be further examined. It was not evidentwhy families without children and single persons should not alsocontribute, although any modification of a &quot; give and take &quot; scheme on these lines would make it more difficult to distinguish the scheme from a straight increase of family allowances financed from general taxation. The fiscal effects should therefore be further examined;and it would be desirable to have regard to the possible consequences of any redistributive scheme on the emigration of professional people in the income groups affected. It would also be desirable to take into account the forthcoming report by the Central Advisory council under the chairmanship of Lady Plowden on primary education,which would survey the area of social deprivation in this field.In further discussion it was pointed out that the Cabinet had previously decided that the proposed increases in the charges for school meals and welfare milk in September 1967 should be conditional on the adoption of an acceptable family endowmentscheme. It was therefore suggested that, if no family endowmentscheme were possible before April 1968 the increased charges shouldbe similarly deferred. On the other hand there were still strong reasons, in terms of the control of public expenditure, for increasingthe charges in September 1967; and the case for doing so had been strengthened by the recent report of the Select Committee on estimates, which had been critical of the present level of charges.Moreover, by raising the income level at which families might qualify for free school meals and welfare milk, the position of those abovesupplementary benefit level could be adequately safeguarded. before a final decision was reached, however, it would be desirable toconsider, in relation to the cost of deferring increased charges by six months, the cost of a small increase in family allowances confined&apos;to the later children of larger families and the effect of such anincrease on families paying the higher charges.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that no increase of family allowances, associated witha reduction of income tax child allowances, was possible in 1967-68.Nor, on balance, did they favour the introduction, even as an interim
&apos;15   431CC 67 (66)scheme, of means-tested allowances, although the Chancellor of theExchequer would wish to give further consideration to the possibilityof an acceptable scheme on these lines. There was strong support for a &quot; give and take &quot; type of scheme, particularly from the pointof view of incomes policy; but, before a decision could be reached on the acceptability of any scheme of this nature, furtherconsideration should be given to its fiscal and redistributive effectsand also to its social effects, including the extent to which the costof the increased family allowances for the lower income familiesmight be financed by single persons and childless families as well asby families with children. It would be helpful if the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, the Minister without Portfolio and the Minister of social Security would circulate further memoranda on these issues;and in order to enable decisions to be reached before the estimates for 1967-68 had to be finally settled the Cabinet should consider these memoranda during the first half of January. In additionarrangements should be made to provide the Cabinet with information on the cost of deferring by six months the proposed increases in the charges for school meals and welfare milk, on thecost of possible small increases in family allowances for largerfamilies which might be introduced in 1967-68 and on the effect ofsuch increases on families paying the increased charges.The Cabinet agreed on the need for wider discussion of thesequestions in order to inform public opinion. Since discussion on a confidential basis with the representative organisations might not be practicable, it was desirable that a White Paper should be publishedearly in the new year, setting out the problems and indicating the government&apos;s own intentions.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Minister without Portfolio, to circulate amemorandum on the fiscal implications of schemesinvolving an increase of family allowances, associatedwith a reduction of income tax child allowances orpersonal allowances, and on possible increases of theincome qualification for free school meals and welfare milk.(2) Invited the Minister of Social Security to circulate amemorandum describing a range of schemes involving anincrease of family allowances associated with a reductionof income tax allowances, including particulars of their cost and of their effect on families with incomes belowsupplementary benefit level.(3) Invited the Minister of Social Security to circulate amemorandum on possible increases in family allowances for larger families, to operate in 1967-68, including
particulars of their cost and their effect on families paying the proposed higher charges for school meals and welfare milk.(4) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting in thelight of the memoranda to be circulated underConclusions (1), (2) and (3) above.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,20th December, 1966.
