(previous reference:CC (66) 31stConclusions,Minute 2)CC 32 (66)SECRETIndustrial 1.   The Prime Minister said that, since the Cabinefs lastDisputes discussion of the strike, the Trades Unions Congress (TUC) hadSeamen&apos;s Strike persuacied the Executive of the National Union of Seamen (McManus) toagree to Lord Pearson mediating between themselves and theowners. The moderate members of the Executive had secured a vote of 31 to 11 in favour of resumed discussions. Under Lord Pearson&apos;chairmanship the owners had made proposals for improvedproductivity, i.e., that essential work done on Bank Holidays at seashould fall within the normal monthly payment and not rank asovertime. This would justify a further 4-jr days leave entitlement.The McManus had then made their own suggestion, justifying a further4-1 days leave for reducing deck watches on ships of over 2,500 gross registered tons from three men to two. These two proposals wouldtogether yield a cost saving of 1 - 8 per cent, equivalent to a furthernine days leave entitlement. A settlement on this basis could beaccepted as being in line with the prices and incomes policy. Aresolution in the McManus Executive the preceding Saturday to end thestrike on these terms had, however, been amended in order to make these proposals no more than a basis for further negotiation with theowners in a meeting starting that day, Tuesday, 28th June. In themeantime, the more militant members of the Union had taken theline that the Union should ask for further improvements; andbranches of the McManus in a number of ports had passed resolutionsdemanding the full 40-hour week at once. The outcome of the resumed discussions was therefore uncertain; but the moderatesection of the Union seemed now more likely to assert themselves,and the militant members had received a setback as a result of the response of the International Transport Workers Federation (ITF)to the McManus&apos;s request for support, since the ITF had limited their assistance to an appeal to help the McManus financially. Those who wished to end the strike were in the majority on the negotiating committee of the McManus; but the final decision lay with the fullExecutive of the Union and might be complicated by proposals fora ballot or for meetings of all local strike committees or possibly for arecall of the Conference of the Union.In discussion it was suggested that the strike now seemed to bemoving to a settlement on the basis of improvements in conditionsaccompanied by improvements in productivity, whereas at an earlier stage the Government had given the impression that they were notprepared to endorse such a settlement because of the policy on prices and incomes. Was it now proposed that the Government shoulddeter the shipowners from accepting whatever settlement might nowbe agreed between them and the Union? On the other hand the government&apos;s good offices in settling the strike on terms consistent with their policy had been used whenever opportunity offered. TheGovernment had suggested that the most fruitful area for asettlement lay in a bargain such as that now under discussion,whereby improved leave conditions would be justified by increased productivity; and they had brought the parties together to discuss
this possibility. The owners had initially resisted attempts to persuade them to accept the Pearson Report, to consider thepossibility of a settlement based on increased productivity, and toany resumption of discussions with the Union under Lord Pearson&apos;smediation; but the Governmenfs pressure on them had been successful. Having been pressed so far, it was unlikely that theywould be prepared to concede more than the additional nine daysleave now contemplated. Indeed, several members of the executive had told the owners that they regarded this as a basis for asettlement. The summary manner in which previous proposals for settlement both those of the Court of Inquiry and of theGovernment had been rejected after only a brief discussion showed that the strike had ceased to be concerned with conditions of workand had become a struggle for power within the Union.The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial Committee on emergencies had recurrently, during successive phases of the strike,postponed emergency- action where it might have provoked anextension of the strike. At their meeting on the preceding Friday,the Committee had postponed until their meeting on Tuesdayevening action to requisition two ships and to provide them ,withRoyal Navy crews, in order to ensure essential supplies and services to the Orkneys and Shetlands. Now that further discussions betweenthe McManus and the owners were taking place it was for consideration whether the action contemplated should be postponed still further.In discussion it was agreed that it would be sufficient to postpone the decision for a further 24 hours, at the end of which timeeither the strike might be over and it would be possible to concertimmediate arrangements with the McManus or if the strike was tocontinue, the case for action would be clear.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Prime Ministers report of developments inthe strike.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Home Department toarrange for postponement, for a further 24 hours, of adecision to requisition ships and to use Royal Navypersonnel on services to the Orkneys and Shetlands.SECRETReform of the 2. The Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the LordHouse of Lords chancellor and the Lord Privy Seal (C (66) 87).The Cabinefs discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately in the Bound Volume of Most ConfidentialRecordjheld by the Secretary of the Cabinet.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th June, 1966.
