EconomicSituationCreditRestrictions(previous reference:CC (66) 38thConclusions)The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by theChancellor of the Exhequer.SECRETEurope(previous reference:CC (66) 34thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Prime Minister said that, as the Cabinet were aware, theMinisters primarily concerned had discussed at Chequers on saturday, 22nd October, our future relationship with Europe. Thediscussion had been held for the purpose of clarifying the problems;and it had been made clear that decisions could only be taken through the Cabinet machinery. It might be convenient to theCabinet if he began by summarising the Chequers discussion.This had been in two parts. During the morning sessionMinisters had considered with senior officials and with expertadvisers the effects which joining the European economic community (e.c.) might have upon the United Kingdom. The main points of the morning&apos;s discussion had been as follows:(a) Perhaps the major danger arose from the provisions of theTreaty of Rome regarding freedom of movements of capital. a requirement to dismantle our foreign exchange controls would endanger our balance of payments in the early years of membership,and we should need to secure adjustments, which we might well do,to safeguard our position, particularly in respect of portfolio investment; in respect of direct investment there might be rather lessneed for protection.CC 53 (66)confidential. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the cabinet would wish to know that, in agreement with the Ministers principally concerned with economic affairs, he had authorised a statementconcerning a slight easement of the current restrictions on credit tobe made at noon by the Governor of the Bank of England. Thefigures of bank advances for October, at lOl-j- per cent of their level at the base date of March 1965 were well within the permitted limit of 105 per cent. The Bank of England was now satisfied, thoughthe clearing banks were still inclined to be cautious about this, thatthe latter had sufficient funds to meet calls on them for prioritycategories of borrowing (exports and productive investment in industry and agriculture) and also for bridging finance for the sale and purchase of houses, especially in connection with theredeployment of labour. The statement would say this; and would thus encourage borrowers in the priority categories who neededcredit but were not asking for it, whether from fear of refusal or of excessive deflation, to approach the clearing banks. This v/as not ameasure of reflation, but a limited step aimed at avoiding an excessivedegree of deflation, and it was important that in any public referenceto it Ministers should give it that emphasis. It was not possible forthe time being to go further.
(b) The second problem was that of agricultural policy. TheCommunity&apos;s present policy and price structure might well in theaggregate prove profitable to United Kingdom agriculture, but atthe expense of unbalancing its production, e.g., as between cereals and dairying, with consequential effects on the farmers concerned.Other effects upon us of the common agricultural policy might be toincrease our balance of payments burden by some  175- 250 million;to damage our trade with the Commonwealth, and to increase thecost of living and so wages and export costs.(c) The effects of membership on our competitive ability,however, were thought to be less serious; we should gain from theabolition of tariffs in Europe and still more from the resulting verylarge market and economies of scale. These advantages might,however, be partially offset by changes in other markets, such asthose in Commonwealth countries from whom we should no longer be free to take so much of our food.(d) Membership of the Community would affect our ability tocontrol our own economy; concern had been chiefly expressed lestwe should be inhibited from using our industrial developmentcertificates (i.d.cs.) to foster diversification in development areas.Within the Community, we might still prevent our industrialists fromsetting up businesses outside the development areas; but we couldnot stop them from doing so on the Continent. Against this, we might use the i.d.cs. to bring American and European enterprises who wished to invest in the United Kingdom to do so in the development areas.(e) The constitutional, legal and political effects of membershiphad also been examined; and especially the anxieties which had been expressed about majority voting, about decisions reached in Brusselshaving direct legal effect in the United Kingdom and about thepowers of the Commission not only to enforce unpopular decisions,but also to delay action which we might wish to take. Expert advicehad been that whilst such provisions were indeed a feature of theTreaty of Rome, they were not in practice applied rigidly, no majormember country having yet been overridden on a point it regardedas fundamental. It seemed that this flexibility in practice, reinforcedas it had been by General de Gaulle&apos;s attacks on supranationalismin the e.c., would enable us to join without undue anxiety or risk ofbeing overridden. On that basis Ministers had been advised thatit would be unnecessary to seek to have the Treaty of Romeamended before we joined the e.c. and such a proposal would inany event be rejected by the Six.if) The Chequers discussion seemed to have established thatthere need now be little fear lest membership of the community would inhibit the independence of our foreign policy. There were no provisions in the Treaty of Rome to that effect, and it was quite clear that General de Gaulle had been free to follow a policy of hisown choosing. There was no reason to think, therefore, that wecould not do the same.
755-4 2CC 53 (66)(g) It had not been possible to reach a conclusion whetherGeneral de Gaulle would be prepared once again to impose a vetoupon our joining the e.c.; or to insist upon our first jettisoning our special relationships, whether in the Atlantic area or in the rest ofthe world.In the afternoon session Ministers had met without advisers, asthe Ministerial Committee on Europe. They had addressedthemselves primarily though not exclusively to the paper by theForeign Secretary and the First Secretary of State (E (66) 11) whichhad been circulated to all Cabinet Ministers together with all theother studies which had been considered at Chequers. In this paper the two Ministers had pointed out that the exploratory discussions which they and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster had beenconducting with European countries during 1966 had been taken asfar as their current authority allowed. In their view it was notpossible to rest upon these discussions for two reasons. First, to doso would indicate a loss of interest in Europe on our part, whetherpermanent or temporary, which would discourage our partners inthe European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and our friends inthe e.c.. Second, it had not been possible in the discussions toascertain with the necessary authority and precision, what kind ofterms we might hope to get in a negotiation for membership in theareas of broad difficulty for us, because we ourselves had not beenin a position to say that in return we could accept the Treaty of rome if means were found within it of meeting our particular difficulties nor to indicate in specific terms what means of doing sowe wished to secure. The two Ministers had, therefore, recommendedthat exploratory discussions should be continued, but upon the basisof a public declaration of our willingness to accept the Treaty of rome provided that means could be found of meeting our difficulties,so that in return we might reasonably insist on being told what conditions of membership we might expect to be able to negotiate.This theme had served as a focal point of Ministerial discussion,both in regard to the balance of advantage or disadvantage we might expect from membership of the Community, and in regard to thenext steps we should take; and upon these points discussion had revealed a variety of views to which he himself had contributed inthe course of summarising the discussion, and which he now wishedto recapitulate for the information of the Cabinet.First, as regards the balance of advantage of membership of theCommunity, in his view the arguments based on the advantages of scale to be derived from membership of a much larger market, were of greater weight than those related to the &quot; cold douche&quot; of competition to be expected in those circumstances. It was unfortunate that the arguments of scale had not been considered fiveyears ago in relation to possible economic arrangements on a north atlantic basis, though there must be considerable doubt whether theUnited States would be willing to forsake her protectionist policysufficiently to make such arrangements possible. Nevertheless it was
necessary to face the fact that the arguments of scale had not been so considered and that there had been a very large development of support for the European alternative. There could be no doubt that united Kingdom industry was overwhelmingly convinced of theadvantages to them of membership of the Common Market, and thatmoves in that direction would probably be the greatest incentive tothe renewal and expansion of investment which we so much required at the present time.Against that background the afternoon&apos;s discussion had confirmed that of the morning in suggesting that our major anxietiesin seeking membership of the Community would be in respect of freedom of capital movements and of the common agricultural policy, including the internal effects in the United Kingdom and theinterests of our Commonwealth suppliers. As regards the latter,some emphasis had been placed on the argument that the next fewyears would see a rising trend in world food prices, one effect ofwhich would be increasingly to narrow the gap between the pricesof the e.c. and those of the United Kingdom. As regards theformer it had been suggested that it might be possible in connectionwith discussions aimed at United Kingdom membership of theCommunity for us to negotiate, whether in the Group of Ten or elsewhere, arrangements for neutralising the sterling balances. If, aspart of the arrangements for joining the Community, we could allay the anxieties arising from the sterling balances, much of our concern about entry would be assuaged. Experience suggested that our international financial obligations placed greater constraint on our economic and political independence than would the Treaty of Rome.His personal conclusion from the discussion had, therefore, been thatwe should accept the recommendation of the Foreign Secretary andthe First Secretary of State to go forward and explore further what conditions of membership of the Community we might be able tonegotiate on areas of special difficulty.He had not, however, been attracted by the proposal that these new explorations should be based upon a declaration of intent toaccept the Treaty of Rome provided that our difficulties could resonably be met under it. Such a declaration without conditionswas too dangerous; but on the other hand if it were accompanied bysufficient conditions, there would be no change from the declaredposition of the Government. He had therefore proposed that he andthe Foreign Secretary should over the next two or three months visit the Heads of Government of the Six to ascertain what the conditions and timing of United Kingdom entry to the Community might be;and that if asked about our acceptance of the Treaty of Rome weshould say that given satisfaction on the major points of capital movements and the common agricultural policy we should beprepared to sign the Treaty. As a corollary of this proposition, hehad suggested first, what indeed had been widely accepted in themeeting, that it was essential that our entry should be made from aposition of economic strength and that our next steps must be timedaccordingly; and second, that pending negotiations for entry, weshould study and explore the possibilities of creating an alternative
CC 53 (66)position should our negotiations fail. Such a position might be either on the lines of Senator Javits&apos; plan for closer economic arrangements between the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and perhaps Japan as well as ourselves, or of a strengthening by some means of our present position as the centre of EFTA and of the sterling area.Some Ministers had expressed doubts whether it would be advisable for the Foreign Secretary and himself to make a series of joint visits to the capitals of the member countries of the e.c.. Suchvisits would, however, reduce to a minimum the possibilities ofmisrepresentation at home and abroad of the Governmenfs position.No conclusions had of course been reached at Chequers on theproposal, which was now for discussion by the Cabinet.The Foreign Secretary said that the process of investigationwhich he and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster had been authorised to undertake had ended in July. The lack of any further move by the United Kingdom Goverment since then was alreadycreating doubt about our intentions among our friends in the e.c. and was also affecting our position in the Group of Fourteen powers in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. If the process of investigation were to be resumed it must be on a more meaningfulbasis. In the past we had not been in a position to answer specificquestions put to us by members of the e.c. and had therefore been unable to take up suggestions made by the Belgian and german governments for detailed discussions about our requirements. Inthe circumstances his own preference would have been for adeclaration of intent on signing the Treaty of Rome but he agreedthat we should now move forward on the lines proposed by the PrimeMinister. In the renewed discussions with the Governments of the eec we should make it clear that the Treaty of Rome created no obstacle for us, provided that satisfactory solutions could be found for the two key issues, capital movements and agriculture. Weshould be able to negotiate transitional periods and need not in his view rule out the possibility of getting agreement for adaptations ofthe arrangements made in the Community under the Rome Treaty.The Five would be anxious to help and he had been assured by theDutch Foreign Minister that the Five would be ready to take a firmline with the French. The French were discouraging the idea offurther discussions and might well be anxious not to find themselvesin opposition to the Five about our entry. France could not afford to withdraw from the e.c. and she might therefore no longer beable to veto our membership. As regards the timetable we should know by about the middle of 1967 what arrangements the membersof the e.c. would be prepared to make and we should therefore bein a position to judge whether our requirements could be met. the formal negotiations and the necessary legislative steps would then take a considerable time and our entry into the Community wouldnot be before 1968 or 1969. There would be advantage in a shorterrather than a longer timetable, but this should be compatible with
the need to strengthen our economy and to protect sterling. It wasnot simply a question of the United Kingdom joining the Six. If we did so Denmark, Ireland and Norway, and possibly Sweden and austria, would join with us. The Community would be transformedand there would be profound effects on the voting position. we might hope that on many key issues, such as agricultural prices, weshould have the support not only of the members of EFTA whowould join the Community with us, but also of some of the Five.The sooner we could achieve this position the sooner we should beable to prevent the adoption by the e.c. of further arrangements under the Treaty of Rome which would be contrary to our interests.In discussion there was general agreement on the need for theGovernment to demonstrate the sincerity of our desire to join the eec if our requirements could be met. To defer action, in order togive time for the strengthening of our economy, would be widelyassumed to mean that we had lost interest in joining: our friends in the e.c. would be profoundly discouraged and the cohesion of efta would be at risk. The effect on our own economy,particularly on business confidence in the United Kingdom andtherefore on the critically important level of investment, could alsobe serious. One form which a move forward might take would, ashad been proposed, be an immediate declaration of intent to sign the Treaty of Rome. It was, however, generally felt that this wouldunduly weaken our bargaining position in relation to the e.c. andour ability to&apos; secure the conditions which we should require. Itmight also create the impression that our entry was imminent andwould take place while we were still in a position of economicweakness. This would be likely to bring sterling under heavy pressure in anticipation of our entry. A forward move must not therefore appear to commit us to joining the e.c. before we hadtaken the necessary steps to strengthen our economy.Considerable doubt was, however, expressed about the advisability of early visits by the Prime Minister and the foreign secretary to the capitals of the Six for discussions with Heads ofGovernment as a means of demonstrating our readiness to join the eec if suitable conditions could be negotiated. Even the order andtimetable for visits would present serious difficulty. The currentpolitical weakness of the present Federal German Government indeed, even the uncertainty about its prospect of survival wouldmake it inopportune for the first visit to be paid to Bonn. nor could the first visit well be made to Rome, since the ItalianGovernment had made clear their dislike of separate bilateral discussions on these issues. It would clearly be unsuitable, on theother hand, for the first visit to be made to one of the smallermembers of the e.c.. Yet in view of the discouraging attitude ofthe French Government-as well as the considerable possibility thatin the upshot General de Gaulle might once again veto our entry it would clearly be wrong for the first visit to be made to Paris. Inany event, some Ministers felt that such visits, even if they wereultimately necessary, would be disadvantageous for some time. Thetask in the immediate future was to regain our economic strength,
whether as a precursor to joining the e.c. or to enable us to maintain an independent position. In either event we needed both to reduce our foreign commitments and hence our expenditure on defence andto carry through successfully the Governments policy on prices and incomes. Moreover, it might be damaging to the prospect of successof the Kennedy Round of tariff negotiations if we were to make anyfurther significant move on discussions with the members of the EECuntil after the tariff negotiations had been completed. Since for allthese reasons we could not afford to make an early move to join the eec, we must avoid any action which might create the impression that such a move was in prospect. Furthermore, it seemed probablethat in the last resort President de Gaulle would maintain the Frenchveto on our entry into the Communities and we could not afford totake action which would lay us open to such a rebuff. It wastherefore argued that on the basis of these considerations theGovernment should go no further than to maintain their present policy of indicating willingness to join the e.c. if suitable conditionscould be negotiated. It was urged that this course could be expressedin terms which should be adequate to avoid any suggestion that theyhad in practice resiled from their policy.Other Ministers however considered that we could not hope tomaintain this position and that it was essential to give an earlyindication that the Government were prepared to take more active measures to ascertain the conditions on which we might hope to join the e.c.. It was argued that while we might not be sufficiently strong economically to enable us to join for another two years, the inevitable process of negotiation would in any event last beyond that time, quite apart from the lengthy transitional provisions whichwe should expect to negotiate to mitigate the immediate impact onour economy. Furthermore, our economic strength relative both toa number of other European countries and indeed to the UnitedStates might be substantially greater in a further 12 months. these considerations argued in favour of the considerably earlier initiation of discussions as a prelude to later negotiations and it was urged that discussions between officials of the Governments concerned couldnot be expected to be fruitful at the next stage unless they werepreceded by a broad indication of political support which could onlybe obtained from Heads of Government. On this view a visit by thePrime Minister and Foreign Secretary at a relatively early stagemight prove-to be the best means of the Government being able totake effective steps to ascertain what transitional provisions and whatadaptation of the arrangements made under the Treaty of Rome we might hope to obtain in formal negotiations.In further discussion the view was expressed that in any event it would be desirable to have prior discussions with our partners inEFTA before making any renewed approach to the members ofthe e.c.. It was arguable whether EFTA might break up if we didnot give an early indication of our intention to hold detailed discussions  on the prospect of joining the e.c.,  and  some
apprehension had recently been shown by our EFTA partners thatwe might ignore their interests in these discussions. There was,nevertheless, a mounting impatience among them at the lack of anymore definitive action on our part. A collective negotiation betweenEFTA on the one hand and the e.c. on the other would not be practicable, but there was considerable evidence that at least amajority of our partners in EFTA would welcome a lead by theUnited Kingdom Government in negotiations with the members ofthe e.c.. In considering our future position it was important tobear in mind the extent to which the entry not only of ourselves butalso of some of our EFTA partners would substantially alter thenature of the Community and lead to changes in its policies in thoserespects which might appear to cause particular difficulty for our interests at the present time. It was suggested that in thesecircumstances, the best course might be to seek to hold a meeting ofthe Heads of Governments of the EFTA countries before the end ofthe year specifically in order to discuss an approach by the UnitedKingdom Government to the members of the e.c.. Such a meeting was both desirable for its own sake and a means of indicating theGovernment^ intention of taking more active measures to pursue its willingness to join the e.c. on appropriate conditions, without incurring the risks which might be entailed by very early visits to european capitals by the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary. Inthe light of such an EFTA meeting, further consideration could begiven both to the desirability of such visits in the early part of 1967and to possible alternative means of achieving the same objective.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussions at the next meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,1st November, 1966.
