1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster (C (66) 28) reporting a difference of view in the Ministerial Committee on the Farm Price Review.The Chancellor of the Duchy said that the line to be taken bythe Government in the Farm Price Review had to be consideredagainst the background of the decision to seek a selective expansionof agricultural production as part of the National Economic Plan, aswell as of the policy on prices and incomes. The differences ofopinion in the Farm Price Review Committee centred on two issues.The first was how much the guarantees should be increased for beef and milk.  The second was over the total increase in the guarantees.The main emphasis in the National Economic Plan had been on an expansion of beef production. However, the greater part ofany expansion in beef supplies must come from an expansion in the dairy herd to produce additional beef calves. This could only be assured by an increase in the price of milk. The agricultural ministers were alone in arguing for an increase of Hd. a gallon inthe price of milk: other Ministers were not prepared to go beyondId. a gallon. As regards beef, there was a broad measure ofagreement on the desirable increases in the guarantees, although theAgricultural Ministers favoured a slightly higher guaranteed price for fat cattle than did other Ministers.There was a wider margin of disagreement on the total increasein the guarantees. The Chief Secretary, Treasury, had argued thatthe total increase should not be more than  13-^- million, theAgricultural Ministers that an increase of  30 million would not be- unreasonable. His own view was that an increase of  20 million would be about right. This would lead to an increase of about per cent in farm incomes but, although this would be above thenorm of the prices and incomes policy, it had to be rememberedthat there had been a substantial fall in farm incomes in 1965.Moreover, farm incomes had to cover the return on capital investment in agriculture which was increasing year by year, as well asremuneration for the farmers&apos; work. An increase in the guarantees of  20 million could not be expected to satisfy the National Farmers&apos;Unions, particularly since the President of the English national farmers&apos; Union was likely this year to be unyielding in negotiation.Indeed, an imposed settlement at this&apos; figure could well create anexplosive situation since farmers were now expecting a substantial increase in the guarantees in the light of the policy of expansion setout in the Plan.  If the Cabinet agreed to a limit of  2Q million for- an increase in the guarantees, the opening proposals by theAgricultural Ministers should be at a lower figure perhaps 15 million. The details of the proposals could be settled by the farm Price Review Committee.The Minister of Agriculture said that the Government were committed to a selective expansion in home agriculture in order toenable British farmers to secure an increased share of the growinghome market, and so achieve a saving of up to  200 million by 1970
in foodstuffs which would otherwise have to be imported. farmers were naturally expecting the Review to be framed in the light of this commitment. It was necessary to secure their co-operation if thepolicy of expansion were to succeed. Farm incomes had fallensubstantially in 1965: moreover, the cost of Exchequer support wasdeclining. In these circumstances it would be reasonable to make an opening offer of  15 million and to seek an agreed settlement atthis year&apos;s Review if this could be achieved with an increase in the guarantees of between  20 million and  30 million. If, however, an agreed settlement were not considered important, an imposedsettlement of around  20 million could be defended. But theadvantages of securing an agreed settlement would be substantial and it would be desirable therefore to leave room to manoeuvre inthe negotiations. The small increase in the cost to the exchequer would be more than counterbalanced by the saving in imports.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that British agriculture wasin fact prosperous and the reduction in farm incomes in 1965 hadbeen due entirely to unfavourable weather conditions. Had theyear been normal, there would have been an increase in farmincomes in 1965 had been due entirely to unfavourable weather conditions. Had the year been normal, there would have been anincrease in farm incomes of 3-\ per cent and output had increasedby 10 per cent in the past two years. An increase in the guarantees of  13^ million would be defensible: within this figure it was possibleto make increases in the guarantees for beef and milk which all themembers of the Farm Price Review Committee except theAgricultural Ministers considered reasonable. Such a settlement would be about as favourable to farmers as the average of the lastseven Reviews; it would be likely to lead to an increase in farmincomes of slightly more than 3% per cent and would thus be consistent with the incomes norm; and it would be substantially more generous to the farmers than the 1965 Review. An increaseabove  15 million, at which level farmers would benefit from halftheir increase in productivity, would represent a more favourablereview than would ensue from the policy of the previous administration and would not be defensible.In discussion it was recognised that the expectations of the farmers had been raised by the publication of the National EconomicPlan and that some increase on a figure that would otherwise accord with the intentions of the Agriculture Act, 1947, might therefore benecessary to achieve their co-operation in the policy of selectiveagricultural expansion and to secure the necessary level of investment.In these circumstances there was general agreement that an increasein the guarantees of  20 million would be reasonable. It was howeveralso necessary to have regard to the interests of our main overseas suppliers and in particular of Australia and New Zealand and any increase above a settlement of  20 million would be embarrassingin that regard.As regards the price of milk, it was recognised that an increase which led to an expansion in production would result in an additional production of butter which would create serious difficulties with our
- 5 59CC 6 (66)main suppliers, particularly New Zealand and Denmark. Thedifference between an increase of Id. a gallon and an increase ofl^d. a gallon would however simply be an increase in the retail priceof id. a pint for four months or for six months; and this difference was not sufficiently great to justify a breakdown on that account inthe discussions with the Farmers&apos; Unions. It was also suggested thatseasonal variations in the retail price of milk were undesirable andthat it would be preferable to maintain a steady price throughout theyear. On the other hand, it was argued that a reduction in the retail price during the summer helped to stimulate consumption at thetime of maximum production. It was also pointed out that, althoughthe increase in the price paid to farmers was passed on to consumers,a significant additional cost fell on the Exchequer because of the resultant increase in the subsidy for school and welfare milk.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thegeneral view of the Cabinet was that a settlement not exceeding 20 million would be acceptable, but that there should be no increaseabove that figure in order to obtain the agreement of the Farmers&apos;Unions. The opening proposals to be put to the Farmers&apos; unions and the final proposals within this limit should be settled by the farm Price Review Committee. The Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster and the Minister of Agriculture would of course be free to report back to Cabinet if the reactions of the Farmers&apos; unions were such as in their view to make a reconsideration of this decisiondesirable but the Cabinet were not disposed to envisage any increasein the limit they had determined. The Farm Price review committee should also consider in the light of the cabinets discussion the question of milk prices, including the advantages and disadvantages of seasonal variations in retail prices and the effect onthe cost-of-living index and on the Exchequer of the possible changes.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a maximum increase of  20 million in the guarantees should be accorded in the Farm Price Review.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to arrangefor the Ministerial Committee on the Farm Price Review:(i) to consider the opening proposals to be put to the farmers&apos; Unions and the details of the finalproposals accordingly;(ii) to consider further the question of milk prices in thelight of the Prime Ministers summing up of their&apos; discussion.suing of the 2.   The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister ofprototype fast Technology (C (66) 24) and by the Secretary of State for Scotlandreactor (C (g6) 26) Qn ^ sitiflg Qf ^ prototype fast reactor (PFR).The Minister of Technology said that it had been agreed that aPFR should be constructed at a capital cost of about  29 million. The
choice of the site lay between Dounreay in Caithness and Winfrithin Dorset, since the Atomic Energy Authority (sea) could not contemplate the development of a third reactor research anddevelopment establishment in addition to those at the two sites inquestion.A substantial part had now been achieved of the sea&apos;s majortask in the civil field of developing nuclear power and henceforththere would be a gradual decline in the scale of effort and expenditureon the development of power reactor systems. The future programmed could most efficiently and economically be organised at one majorreactor development establishment, rather than at two. Dounreaywas concerned almost entirely with fast reactor development and had only one research reactor in addition to the experimental fastreactor. Winfrith, on the other hand, was involved in thedevelopment of all four of the sea&apos;s reactor systems and in additionhad five other small experimental research reactors.The present number of employees at Dounreay was 2,300 andif the PFR were to be built there the establishment^ work would still begin to decline after 1971, when this came into operation. the major work on fast reactor development would be completed withinabout five years thereafter and the programme of work that couldbe foreseen after, say, 1976 would not amount to more than about half the present level, when employment would be confined to theoperation of the PFR as an electricity generating station, togetherwith certain connected development activities. If the PFR were notbuilt at Dounreay, the establishment would close about 1974.The capital cost of construction at Dounreay, together with thenecessary high-voltage transmission lines, would be about  30 million or about  3 million more than at Winfrith, but after taking accountof the need to construct the latter lines in future years the netadditional capital cost would be about  0-7 million at 1970 values.Operating costs would not differ significantly: there would, however,be a 2 per cent greater transmission loss over the long lines fromDounreay and the 1970 value of this loss would be about  0-6 million.The staffing of professional grades at Dounreay had always been difficult and would inevitably remain so and account must be taken of the annual cost of maintaining two reactor development establishments instead of one. This could be assessed in money terms at about  1^- million a year during the period while research and development was being carried out at both establishments. Thenet estimated saving by siting the PFR at Winfrith rather thanDounfeay was therefore of the order of  8 million at 1970 values.There were the additional considerations that the siting of the PFRat Dounreay might discourage oversea visitors and might leadpotential oversea customers to conclude that fast reactors could notsafely be brought near to populated areas. On the other hand, itmust be accepted that many benefits had flowed to Caithness fromthe setting up of Dounreay and, unless suitable arrangements weremade, its running down and eventual closure would create a serious problem for the area. Nevertheless, it must not be supposed thatthe establishment of the PFR at Dounreay would solve the area&apos;s
problems, since the existing establishment had not so far proved tobe a point of economic growth and there was no reason to expect that the PFR would do so. The balance of these factors indicated that Winfrith should be chosen as the site.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that a decision in existing circumstances to site the PFR at Winfrith would have themost damaging consequences for the existing community. Thepopulation of Thurso in recent years had increased from some 4,000to over 9,000 of whom only 2,000 were directly employed at Dounreay.In order to maintain employment in the area at its present level,some 1,100 additional jobs would in any event have to be providedby 1976 but if the PFR were not sited here, this number would bemore than doubled. The theoretical cost of providing them wouldbe very high, of the order of  2 million, but in practice it was most improbable that the task would be achieved. Capital expenditureof  7 million had been incurred in developing at Dounreay housing and education facilities of a high order and these would be wastedif a decision were taken by the Government which would involveits early closing down. Such a decision would be contrary to the government&apos;s policy of regional development and would have serioussocial and economic consequences in the area itself.In discussion it was suggested that it would not accord with the government&apos;s economic policy to seek to develop an artificial centre at Dounreay which in any event would be bound to reduce to halfits present size in a few years&apos; time. The majority of those employed at Dounreay would as employees of sea find no difficulty inobtaining employment with the Authority elsewhere in the UnitedKingdom. In these circumstances, the additional capital and operating costs involved in siting the PFR at Dounreay should be a decisive argument in favour of Winfrith. The general view was,however, that these considerations were outweighed by the importanceof maintaining as far as possible the community which had alreadybeen built up at Dounreay. It was also relevant that, whereas thelevel of unemployment at Thurso was high, Winfrith on the otherhand was in an area of extreme shortage of labour. The additional cost of establishing the PFR at Dounreay was comparable with thatof the differential investment grants to private industry in thedevelopment regions. Such investment grants were not availablefor the nationalised industries, partly because their siting could be controlled by the Government as a matter of policy. On these considerations it would therefore be contrary to the government&apos;s policy for the regional development of industry and would cause serious damage to confidence in the Governmenfs determination to pursue this policy in relation to Scotland if the PFR were sited atWinfrith.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were on balance agreed that the PFR should be sited atDounreay. This decision should be announced by the Minister of technology at the earliest possible date.
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the prototype fast reactor should be sited atDounreay.(2) Invited the Minister of Technology to make an early announcement of this decision.broadcasting and Television(previous reference:CC (65) 25thConclusions,Minute 3)University ofthe Air3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (C (66) 27) on the functions, organisationand finance of a University of the Air and a fourth television networkand a note by the Lord President of the Council (C (66) 25) to whichwas attached a draft White Paper on the University of the Air bythe Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department ofEducation and Science.The Lord President said that the Ministerial Committee on broadcasting had based their consideration of a University of the air on reports by an Advisory Committee convened by the joint parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Science,and by an Official Committee. The Advisory Committee, which had reported on the educational functions of the University, had concluded that it would be essential for University programmes to be broadcast during peak evening hours: it was this consideration thatnecessitated the establishment of a fourth television network, sincepeak hour viewing for the University programmes could not beprovided by the existing television services on the scale required.A fourth television network would have to transmit on UltraHigh Frequency (UHF) and on 625 lines. This would provide alimited initial coverage which would, however, grow over some10 years. Reliable estimates of the possible size of the viewingaudience and the number of students were not available since nothingcomparable to the University of the Air had yet been attempted, butthe Broadcasting Authorities estimated that the programmesenvisaged might attract total viewing audiences of up to 100,000, andthat there might be 10,000 students who would take diplomas and perhaps a further 1,000 who would proceed to degrees. these authorities had some doubts about the size of audiences duringpeak hours because of the competition offered by programmes ofentertainment, since most households had only one set. this difficulty might however be overcome by providing communityviewing centres.Provisional estimates of the cost of the fourth network and theUniversity, based on figures provided by the British broadcasting corporation (BBC) and the Independent Television Authority (ITA),indicated that the capital cost might be some  42 million spread over10 years, of which the amount attributable to the University wouldbe some  14^ million. The annual operating cost of the networkand the University might be about  33 million, of which the annual cost of the University would be  6 million to  7 million. The majorityof the Ministerial Committee had concluded that it would undermine
the status of the University if it were made dependent on advertisingrevenue. Except to the extent that finance could be provided byendowments and such sources as registration fees and sale of books,the cost of the University would thus have to be borne by theExchequer. The size of the sums involved raised a difficult problemof finance, since there was no provision for the University withinthe existing public expenditure allocations. There was the further difficulty that the ITA had expressed doubts about the commercialviability of a fourth network even without the University of the air and the consequential loss of peak-hour transmissions, and had drawn attention to the risk of financial failure which might throw the whole cost of the network and the University on to the Exchequer.The Ministerial Committee had also concluded that, despite somepractical advantages in giving ITA control of the new network, itwould be preferable to set up a new corporation which would itselfsell advertising time and purchase programmes from the programme companies. The main issue for decision was, however, whether the implications of the University and the fourth network for public expenditure should be accepted and priority given to the Universityproject over other competing demands for additional resources, orwhether, because of the implications for public expenditure and theother uncertainties in the project, a pilot scheme should first beintroduced, using spare hours on existing services.The Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Departmentof Education and Science (Miss Lee) said that the AdvisoryCommittee had been drawn from a wide range of educational interestsand had been unanimous in their conclusions, in particular on the potential educational value of the University of the Air and the stimulus which it would give to adult education and the developmentof television for educational purposes. Peak-hour transmission was,however, essential and the University would not be academicallyviable without the establishment of a fourth network to provide this service: it should be possible within four years to provide a service which covered about 35 million people in all the main industrial centres, with 20 main stations. As regards the capital cost, only about  17 million represented an extra demand on resources. TheUniversity could expect a substantial income of its own from thesale of courses overseas, from the sale of books and from endowments.But no part of its cost should be met by reducing existing educationalservices, nor could its demand for broadcasting facilities be met by reducing the number of lower level educational broadcasts on existing services, the need for which would be intensified by the University.Apart from its degree courses, the University would greatlyencourage and assist the development of adult education generally,and technological education in particular, and would make animportant contribution to exports and oversea development. any financial difficulties would be eased by the fact that it would take some years to cover the country as a whole, although a start mightbe made in two years, perhaps preferably outside London.
In discussion there was general agreement on the potentialeducational value of the University, both in providing for the substantial numbers seeking a University education in future years,who could not be accommodated in existing universities under thecurrent programme of expansion, and in stimulating adult educationgenerally. There was also general agreement that any new televisionnetwork should be used mainly for educational purposes. Concernwas, however, expressed at the demand which the fourth televisionnetwork and the University of the Air would make upon resources and at the cost which might be involved. The latter could only beborne by the Exchequer if as a result of a re-examination of educational priorities other educational services were reduced, unlessthe total of public expenditure were to exceed the limits that had been determined by the Cabinet. On this view it was suggested that itmight be preferable to give further consideration to a pilot experimentwhich would use spare hours on existing television services, or to achieve economies either by accepting a coverage of less than thetotal population or by a reduction of the demand on peak hours.It was, however, argued that the advice given by the commercialtelevision interests was not necessarily impartial and that once adecision had been announced to establish a fourth network they mightbe more favourably inclined to participation, particularly if the useof colour were confined to the 625-line standard.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement on the great potential value for education ofa University of the Air. The cost of the present proposals was,however, a matter for concern, since it was necessary to avoid theimposition of an additional burden on the Exchequer. Nor shouldthe University itself be dependent on finance from advertising. Therewas, however, reason to question the validity of the views offered by commercial television interests on this issue. Furthermore, the project would be a pioneer one of wide international interest and itmight be possible to secure financial support from internationalfoundations. He would arrange for the cost of the University andthe commercial viability of a fourth network to be further examined in the light of these considerations. Meanwhile, further consideration should be given in the light of the discussion to the need for peak-hourtransmission and to the possibility of using spare hours on BBC 2which might be acceptable to those sections of the populationprimarily concerned, thus avoiding the cost of a fourth network. Thepossibility of a regional experiment should also be considered. Itwould be desirable to publish a White Paper at an early date, but thisshould, in the circumstances, be confined to the educational aspectsof the University and should omit references to finance and to thefourth network pending the further consideration to be given to thoseaspects. The White Paper on Broadcasting Policy to be issued bythe Postmaster-General should not be delayed in consequence of these further enquiries: it should state that a decision on the fourth networkhad been deferred, but should not ascribe this delay to theconsideration being given to the University.
The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the educational functions and content of a University of the Air proposed in the Annex toC (66) 25.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange forfurther consideration to be given to the financing of a university of the Air and to the commercial viability of a fourth television network.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Education and Science:(i) to submit to the Prime Minister the revised draft of a white Paper on the lines indicated in discussion;(ii) to give further consideration to the need for peak-hour transmission, to the possibility of using sparehours on BBC 2 and to the desirability of a regional experiment in the use of the university of the Air, on the lines indicated by the PrimeMinister in his summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th February, 1966.
