SubjectDefence Review:Statement on the Defence Estimates, 1966: Part future Forces StructureF-111A Option
Defence ReviewStatement onthe defence estimates, 1966:Parti(previous reference:CC(66) 8thConclusions)*The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the Statement on theDefence Estimates 1966: Part I (C (66) 33). They also had beforethem memoranda by the Secretary of State for Defence on theFuture Forces Structure (C (66) 34) and on the F-111A Option(C (66) 35).Carrier force the Secretary of State for Defence said that the question of thelength of time for which the carrier force should be maintained didnot affect the decision on the F-111A since the Admiralty Board andthe Chief of the Naval Staff agreed that in any event this aircraft was essential.Carriers could not be regarded as a cost-effective part of our forces. They were only relevant in the Far East; in the Atlanticthey were too vulnerable and in the Mediterranean and the middle east air cover could be provided from land bases. The Royal Navycould not in any event man more than four carriers and we couldnot afford more than three. Over a 10-year period the cost of theforce could be  1,400 million, including the carriers themselves andtheir aircraft, but excluding the escorting vessels which were requiredfor other purposes as well as the protection of the carriers. With a force of three carriers one would be permanently East of Suez andanother normally available at up to 15 days&apos; notice. One of thethree carriers would, however, be the Hermes which was equipped with only 12 fighter and 7 strike aircraft and one year in three thiswould be the carrier stationed East of Suez. The resultant capability of the carrier force did not justify the expenditure involved. Theonly operations for which carriers would be essential were the landing or withdrawal of troops in the face of sophisticatedopposition outside the range of land-based aircraft. Our proposals on commitments did not however call for the retention of thiscapability in the 1970s. For air strikes against land targetscarrier-borne aircraft were much less effective than land-based aircraft and in terms of cost were two-and-a-half times as expensive.An important part of the carrier role was the protection of ships at sea. It was accepted that up to a range of 300 miles this task couldbe adequately fulfilled by land-based aircraft. The Royal Air Forceclaimed that it could be done up to a range of 700 miles and to resolve the difference between these two figures would require further study. The real question however was whether we should need toprotect shipping against heavy, enemy attack at a range of 300 milesor more from land bases. He and the Chiefs of Staff, other than theChief of the Naval Staff, considered that this was unlikely in the1970s, though the task could arise so long as confrontation lasted.He had therefore concluded that the new carrier, the CVAO-1, shouldnot be built but that we should seek to maintain the existing carrierforce until 1975, although difficulties of recruiting for the Fleet air arm might mean that carriers would have to phase out by about1972.* Previously recorded as a Confidential Annex.SECRET
The Admiralty Board had recently put forward new proposalsdesigned to provide for the construction of the CVAO-1 whilekeeping total costs of the Royal Navy at about the level of his ownproposal. There had been a difference of view about the figures butit was now accepted that the extra cost of the Admiralty Board&apos;proposal would be much higher than they had originally estimated.Capital expenditure on the CVAO-1 over the next three years wouldbe  30 million and in 1969-70 the extra cost of the new plan seemed likely to be  20 million rather than  9 million. From 1973 to 1975the additional expenditure would be about  100 million, so that overthe 10-year period the new plan put forward by the Admiralty board was likely to cost  150 million more than his own proposal. Therewould also be no additional capability until 1973 when the CVAO-would come into service; there would be additional capability after1973 but this would be the period when we should hope to have reduced our commitments in the Far East. The Admiralty Board&apos;proposal would be logical if it were intended to build further newcarriers, the CVAO-2 and 0-3, but this would involve very heavy additional expenditure which we could not contemplate. The planenvisaged carriers phasing out in 1980, but at this date the CVAO-would only have been in service for six to seven years and its cost would not be justified for so short a period of service. Under hisplan the Royal Navy would still have a major role to play and would obtain a number of new ships and new weapons to replace part ofthe carrier capability. An additional 36 Phantoms for the Royal AirForce for the maritime role would also be required. The total costof reproviding the capability of the carrier force would be about 600 million over 10 years as compared with the cost of  1,400million of the carrier force.In discussion it was suggested that carriers gave a degree ofmobility which was not afforded by land bases and that they were less vulnerable than fixed bases, not only in military terms, but also because they were not subject to the political limitations whichtended to affect our use of land bases. It was however pointed outthat, while carriers and land bases were equally vulnerable to nuclearattack, land bases could withstand a much heavier attack withconventional weapons than a carrier. Moreover, it was likely thatcarriers would become more vulnerable as new weapons weredeveloped, particularly if a potential enemy acquired nuclear-powered submarines. Although carriers were not subject to thepolitical limitations of land bases, this did not in fact increase the range of options open to us since any military operations wouldrequire the use of land bases and could not be conducted solely by carriers. Moreover, we intended in the 1970s, with longer rangeaircraft, to concentrate on land bases in Australia or on uninhabitedislands in the Indian Ocean, which would be less subject to politicallimitations.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the decision about the carrier force did not involve a choice between carrier-borne aircraft and the F-111A since all the defence ministers and the Chiefs of Staff agreed that the F-111A would be
required, even if the carrier force were maintained. Although therewas some difference of opinion about the figures it was clear thatthe plan proposed by the Admiralty Board would make it impossibleto attain the figure for defence expenditure of  2,000 million at 1964prices in 1969-70. Carriers would give a valuable bonus to our defence capability, but the maintenance of the carrier force, includingthe construction of the CVAO-1, could not be justified unless wewere prepared to increase defence expenditure substantially abovethe level of  2,000 million. There was general agreement that this could not be accepted and that the CVAO-1 should not be constructed. The Cabinet approved the proposal by the Secretary ofState for Defence for maintaining the existing carrier force, if possibleuntil 1975.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals of the Secretary of State for defence in respect of the carrier force.Future ForcesStructureF-111A Option(previous reference:CC(65) 20thConclusions,Minute 4)The Secretary of State for Defence said that the importance ofair reconnaissance in peace-time had been demonstrated in Cubaand Cyprus and it was even more essential in war. For strategicreconnaissance, long range, a high ceiling and supersonic speed were essential and there was no alternative to the F-111A in this role.Requirements for air strike1 depended on the type of opposition likelyto be encountered, but against the weapons to be faced in the 1970sa strike aircraft must be able to operate at low level, with terrain-following equipment and a highly developed navigational and attacksystem. There was also a great advantage if the aircraft could operate from bases outside the range of enemy attack. As regardstiming, the Canberras must be phased out by 1970. In the second half of the 1970s we hoped that the Anglo-French Variable Geometry(VG) aircraft would come into service. The Royal Air Force wouldrely on this for the strike, reconnaissance and other roles and the project was intended to be the cornerstone of our policy for collaboration in aircraft production in Europe on which the futureof our aircraft industry would depend. The question was how tobridge the gap between 1970 and 1975. The solution he proposed was to purchase 50 F-111As (as compared with 110 envisaged inthe previous year and the 150 TSR-2s planned by the previous administration); these would be supplemented by the transfer of theV-bombers to the tactical role until they were replaced by the VGaircraft. Of the possible alternatives to the F-111A the Spey / Miragewould be at least two years late. Even on the basis of the price nowquoted by the British Aircraft Corporation it would cost more thanthe F-111A and a large part of the cost would be in foreign exchange.It was doubtful whether it could be suitably adapted from its presentrole of a high-level bomber in a temperate climate to a low-levelbomber in the tropics and in any event it would have a shorter rangethan the F-111A and could only operate from long concrete runways.
A developed Buccaneer was a more serious contender and the cost would be only slightly higher than that of the F-l 11 A. It could not however be ready in time and there was no guarantee about the dateof delivery. It would also be wasteful to develop the Buccaneerunless we were to buy the full number of aircraft we required forthe strike role and this would conflict both industrially and financiallywith the Anglo-French VG project.As a result of his negotiations with the United StatesGovernment an agreement had been initialled, ad referendum, onthe terms for a purchase of 50 F-l 11 As. The United StatesGovernment would provide credit to cover the cost of all our aircraftpurchases from the United States at an interest rate of 4f per cent,which he understood was acceptable to the Chancellor of theExchequer. The unit price for the first 10 aircraft would be 2 -1 million; for the subsequent 40 there would be an average price which contained a contingency allowance of  340,000 per aircraft.He expected within the next day or two to obtain a fixed price for the aircraft in the United States configuration and a fixed price for the additions of United Kingdom equipment to meet our requirements. This would give a ceiling price for the whole purchaseof 50 aircraft and a figure per aircraft of about  2-5 million, whichhe would hope to be able to publish. By comparison the cost of50 TSR-2s would have been  9 million each. We should also getguaranteed delivery dates of 12 aircraft by the end of 1968 and ofall 50 by January 1970. The F-111A had encountered certainproblems in the course of development but the difficulties experiencedwith the engine were now being overcome. There was a new problemof drag, but this was no more serious than the one encountered andrectified in the B-58 bomber. Even if a drag of 6 per cent remained,the aircraft would fully meet our requirements. As regardsperformance we should be covered by the contract which the UnitedStates Air Force had concluded with the manufacturers, by whichthe latter were obliged to make good at their own expense anydefects occurring during the first 12 months after delivery.He had also been concerned to offset the dollar cost of theproposed F-111A purchase, which would amount over the full12-year period, including support and spares, to $725 million. TheUnited States Government had agreed to target figures for directpurchases of military stores and equipment from the UnitedKingdom and for co-operative arms sales to third countries,including the recent sale to Saudi Arabia (worth $200 million inforeign exchange to the United Kingdom), which together equalledthe total dollar cost of $725 million. The United States Governmenthad also accepted that the agreement should be subject to annual review and that the two Governments would consult if the targetfigures were not being met. The United States Government had agreed that their reciprocal purchases from the United kingdom should include general defence stores as well as military equipment and, more important, they would waive in favour of the UnitedKingdom the preferences imposed by the &quot; Buy American &quot; Act andthe special preference of 50 per cent imposed because of United
7CC*9(66)States foreign exchange difficulties. United Kingdom industry would thus be able, for the first time, to compete on equal terms with united States industry for United States defence contracts; thisoffered a real opportunity for longer term sales which would be ofconsiderable importance to our economy. As soon as the option forthe F-111A was taken up the United States Government would invitetenders for the construction of naval auxiliaries in the UnitedKingdom to a value of $50 million. We could count on obtainingforeign exchange receipts from the United States reciprocal purchasesand co-operative sales to third countries in advance of our dollarpayments for the F-111A.If we did not buy the F-111A we should have to purchase someother aircraft and whether this was the Spey/Mirage or a developedBuccaneer the total cost would certainly be higher. There wouldalso be substantial extra expense in 1969-70 and this would conflict with the even spread of expenditure over the period, which was important for the defence programme.Finally, it had been suggested that the French Governmentwould react badly to a purchase of F-111As. He had howeverreceived a letter from the French Minister of Defence which referredto certain &quot; preoccupations &quot; about the United Kingdom purchaseof F-111As but went on to suggest Anglo-French discussions inMarch or April about co-operative aircraft projects. We should be giving the French Government a full explanation of our decisionsbefore publication of the White Paper and it did not now seem likely that any serious difficulty would arise over continued Anglo-french -operation.In discussion the Cabinet first considered the relation of adecision to purchase the F-111A to the maintenance by the UnitedKingdom of a military role East of Suez. The decision which theCabinet had taken that morning to maintain such a role necessitated the provision of the appropriate equipment for the Armed forces and it was generally recognised that, for the reasons which had been developed by the Secretary of State for Defence, the F-111A was essential to that role. It was however suggested that, since weenvisaged the ending of confrontation, and a subsequent andconsequential withdrawal from Singapore leading to the diminutionor disappearance of our role in the Indo-Pacific thereafter, by 1970and since the F-111A would not come fully into service until thatdate, it was unnecessary to acquire these aircraft: but the general view was that even after a withdrawal from Singapore it would stillbe desirable for the United Kingdom to maintain a military presence in the Far East, because of our Commonwealth interests and ourconcern for world-wide stability and because the maintenance ofsuch a presence might prove to be a necessary counterpart to thecontinuance of a United States military role in Europe. Moreover,even if events should so develop that it was neither necessary norpossible to maintain such a role, the bringing into service of 36front-line F-111As would not of itself determine our policy or
necessitate our continuance in this area. Nor was the F-111Anecessary solely for our military requirements in the Indo-Pacific.Quite apart from its possible role in Europe, regard must be had to military commitments which might arise elsewhere, whether inrelation to a possible conflict between India and China, or in Africaor as part of our contribution to United Nations peace-keepingforces. It was vital to our interests that we should not be whollydependent on our allies for reconnaissance in such events; and theuse of satellites for reconnaissance in the 1970s would not be suffiently developed to cover the whole range of vital reconnaissancerequirements and would in any event be dependent on the provisionof facilities by the United States.The reduction of our commitments which was envisaged as partof the Defence Review was a further step in the process of UnitedKingdom withdrawal from extensive world-wide commitments afterthe Second World War. This process would continue further but, if our withdrawal were carried out too rapidly, grave damage might result to world stability and to our interests and there would be aserious risk that we should be in no position to play a role appropriate to our standing and interests. It was pointed out that the maintenanceof the military forces necessary for this purpose would pre-emptresources which might otherwise be used for the provision of aid to developing countries and that the Governmenfs plans in this fieldwould therefore inevitably be severely restricted; but it was thegeneral view that this consequence must, if necessary, be accepted.In further discussion it was pointed out that the Buccaneer IIwas a highly effective subsonic low-level strike aircraft but that its performance and range, even in a further developed version, wouldbe inadequate as a substitute for the F-111A, particularly in there connaissance role. Moreover, it would not be advantageous to theUnited Kingdom aircraft industry to concentrate on the further development of an aircraft which was now at the end of its potentialdevelopment, rather than on the next generation of aircraft such asthe P-1127 and the Anglo-French VG aircraft. It was to these that united Kingdom industry should look for its work on military aircraft in the 1970s.The Cabinet then resumed their consideration of the statement on the Defence Estimates, 1966: Part I and considered Section 3,including a revised version of paragraphs 39-40 circulated by theSecretary of State for Defence, dealing with the equipment of theforces, in the light of their previous discussion of the carriers andthe F-111A. A number of drafting amendments were agreed andthe following points were made (a) It was essential that the offset agreement in respect of UnitedStates purchases of United Kingdom military equipment and inrespect of co-operative sales to third countries should- be fullyimplemented, since otherwise we should be unable to meet therequirements for dollar expenditure on United States equipment inthe 1970s which would result from the decisions which had beentaken during the preceding 12 months. While it would not be practicable for the United States Government to give any further
commitments in this regard, we should make it clear to them that,if the offset operations were not successful in providing virtually thewhole of the foreign exchange involved in buying the F-l 11 A, weshould be forced, from our paramount need to conserve foreign exchange, to make corresponding reductions in our oversea defence expenditure, with all that this involved in terms of our commitments.While it would not be appropriate to declare this view publicly,whether in the Defence White Paper or otherwise, having regard tothe damage which it would cause to our relations with other countries and to the maintenance of our commitments and obligations, theUnited States Government should be left in no doubt about therestrictions which would inevitably be imposed upon us by our balance of payments situation. In considering our future course ofaction we should however recognise that our commitments depended on our own interests and our relations with other States. We shouldneither make ourselves dependent on the decisions of the UnitedStates Government in carrying out those commitments nor shouldour statement to them be so framed as to suggest by implication that,provided our requirements in foreign exchange were met, we should necessarily then maintain commitments in the future at the levelnow envisaged, unless this were consonant with our interests.(b) The maintenance of the P-1127 was important for UnitedKingdom industrial reasons and at this stage we should plan on theassumption that it would be developed. The Cabinet must howeverreserve the right to take a different decision should either technicaldevelopments or the escalation of costs make it desirable to do so and for this reason the draft of paragraph 45 of the statement should be amended by omitting the sentence &quot; This decision is nowconfirmed &quot; and by amending the previous sentence to read &quot; as announced at the time, we plan to use instead a combination ofUnited States Phantoms and the United Kingdom VTOL P-1127 &quot;.Since production orders would in the ordinary course shortly haveto be placed, the Ministers primarily concerned should meet in thevery near future to consider further action.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposals of the Secretary of State for defence for the Future Forces Structure. They were however concerned atthe risk that this decision might endanger the attainment of the target for defence expenditure of  2,000 million at 1964 prices in1969-70 and their approval was contingent on the maintenance of continous pressure to achieve that target, including the annualscrutiny of commitments and expenditure on which they had agreed at their previous meeting earlier that day.The Cabinet (2) Approved the proposal to make an agreement with theUnited States Government for the purchase of 50F-l 11 As on the terms proposed by the Secretary of Statefor Defence, provided that it was made clear to theUnited States Government that if the offset operations
were not successful in meeting virtually the whole ofthe cost, in foreign exchange, the United KingdomGovernment would be forced through their paramountneed to conserve foreign exchange to make correspondingreductions in oversea defence expenditure, with all thatthis involved in terms of oversea commitments.(3) Approved the remaining proposals of the Secretary of Statefor Defence in respect of the Future Forces Structure.(4) Approved the Statement on the Defence Estimates, 1966:Part I, subject to the amendments agreed in discussion.(5) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to circulate revisedcopies of the draft Statement to the Prime Minister, first secretary of State, Chancellor of the Exchequer, foreign secretary, Commonwealth Secretary, Colonial secretary and Minister of Aviation.(6) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the commonwealth secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State for defence, to arrange, respectively, for the foreign and commonwealth Governments concerned to be informed,as appropriate, of the decisions which affected them, inadvance of the publication of the Defence White Paper.(7) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange to discuss further with the Ministers primarily concerned the continuing programme for the P-1127.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th February, 1966.
