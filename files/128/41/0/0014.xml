ParliamentDissolution ofParliament1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he had asked Her Majesty The Queen to proclaim the Dissolution ofParliament and that Her Majesty had been graciously pleased to accede to this request. The Dissolution would take place onThursday, 10th March; a General Election would be held onThursday, 31st March; the new Parliament would be summoned onMonday, 18th April (when the first business would be the election of the Speaker and the swearing-in of Members) and would be opened on Thursday, 21st April. A statement to this effect wouldbe made at 5.30 p.m. that evening.In reaching his decision to seek a Dissolution he had been influenced primarily by the fact that, having held office for nearly18 months and taken initiatives, whether by legislation or otherwise,in fulfilment of practically all the pledges contained in the LabourParty Manifesto at the General Election of 1964, the Governmenthad now reached the point at which, if they were to continue to govern effectively at home and to speak with authority abroad, theyneeded a broader Parliamentary base than was provided by theirpresent small majority. Moreover, public opinion was nowexpecting a General Election in the near future; and, if it weredeferred until later in the year, the period of electioneering wouldbe prolonged and it would become increasingly difficult in thesecircumstances to maintain international confidence in our policies,particularly in relation to sterling. It was for these reasons that hehad concluded that this would be an appropriate moment for theGovernment to seek a renewal of their mandate from the electorate.Ministers would shortly be advised of certain arrangements tobe made in connection with the conduct of public business duringthe campaign. They would remain fully responsible for the workof their Departments during this period; but, while they shouldcontinue to discharge their normal duties, they should observereasonable discretion in relation to the initiation of any action of a continuing or long-term nature, e.g., the making of newappointments to statutory bodies for which they were answerable.The same principle should apply as regards any further publishedstatements of Government policy, whether in the form of white papers or otherwise. It would be necessary, however, to publish the White Paper on the Farm Price Review in the normal course.In discharging public engagements during the period of theElection Ministers should seek to avoid creating any impression that they were using these occasions for Party political purposes;and they should also consider, before undertaking to fulfil any international commitments, whether the nature of the subject matterinvolved would enable them to speak with the authority proper to arepresentative of Her Majesty&apos;s Government.Certain issues of policy should now be resolved as rapidly aspossible in order that the Governmenfs intentions might be madepublicly known. This applied particularly to the proposals for there organisation of the docks and the aircraft industry, for the
co-ordination of internal transport and for the more detailedelaboration, so far as necessary, of the Industrial reorganisation corporation. The Ministers concerned should give urgent consideration to these questions; and any other issues of policyrequiring decision should be submitted to the Cabinet as rapidly aspossible.The Cabinet were then informed of the revised business forthe rest of the Session, which would be announced in the Houseof Commons by the Lord President at 10 p.m. that evening. no new Bills would now be introduced; and Parliament would not beexpected to proceed further with the Committee stages of thoseBills which had no prospect of being enacted. The standing committees concerned would therefore be discharged; but select committees would be free to continue their work until the dissolution, if they so wished the Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement on the Dissolution of Parliament.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State, as Chairman of the ministerial Committee on Economic Development, toarrange urgently for further consideration to be given, as necessary, to the Governmenfs proposals in connectionwith the reorganisation of the docks and the aircraft industry, the co-ordination of internal transport and theIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation.(3) Invited the First Secretary of State to submit, as rapidly aspossible, any outstanding issues on prices policy.2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that,in the light of the Dissolution of Parliament, it would be necessaryfor him to make a statement on the economic situation on thefollowing day. An opportunity for this would be afforded by the debate on the economic situation arranged for that day.In accordance with precedent, details are not recorded in theCabinet Conclusions.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th February, 1966.
