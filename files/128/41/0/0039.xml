The EconomicSituation(previous reference:CC(66) 38thConclusions)secret. The Cabinet considered the arrangements to be made forthe future conduct of economic policy in the light of the measureswhich had been announced in the Prime Ministers statement in theHouse of Commons on the previous day. These measures would inevitably attract criticism, particularly as regards the proposedintensification of the Governments policy in relation to prices and incomes. It was therefore important that developments in theeconomic situation should be kept under regular review and that ministers should be enabled to consider collectively, as appropriate,the consequential action which might be necessary.Work should be pressed forward to give effect to the reductions in Government expenditure at home and abroad as rapidly aspossible. It would be important that Ministers&apos; own actions shouldbe seen to be in conformity with the spirit of the measures announced in the Prime Ministers statement; and this implied, among other things, that they should both reconsider any proposed oversea visits to which they were already committed and adopt a more stringentattitude to future journeys of this kind. Henceforward, Ministerialvisits abroad should be curtailed; and only in exceptional cases should Ministers expect to be accompanied by their wives.Oversea AffairsGibraltar(previous reference:CC(66) 25thConclusions,Minute 2)Soviet Union(Previous \Reference:CC(66) 34thConclusions,Minute 2)7160-1SECRET3. The Foreign Secretary said that further discussions hadtaken place the previous week between United Kingdom and spanish officials regarding the dispute over Gibraltar. Our proposalsfor a basis on which a settlement might be reached would now be reported by the Spanish officials to their Government, but they had indicated that the reply would certainly be unfavourable. It had also been hinted that the Spanish Government might withdrawpermission for overflights by United Kingdom military aircraft. Thenext stage would be for us to propose the submission of the dispute to the International Court of Justice.The Secretary of State for Defence said that the withdrawal of permission for military training overflights, which were at presentthose primarily in question, would not have serious consequences for our interests, nor would the withdrawal of permission for theoverflight of all military aircraft unless the French Governmentsimilarly withdrew permission.The Prime Minister said that his discussions over the previousweekend with the Soviet Prime Minister, Mr. Kosygin, had beenvery frank. It was apparent that the Soviet Government wished touse the United Kingdom as an intermediary in any discussions witha 2SECRETParliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
the United States Government, in view of the political difficulty inpresent circumstances of conducting such discussions direct. Asregards Vietnam they would clearly welcome any means, includingthe calling of a conference, by which the conflict might be broughtto an end, but they were not in a position to take any overt actiongoing beyond what would be acceptable to the North VietnameseGovernment, in view of their own difficulties in relation to thePeople&apos;s Republic of China. Nor had they proved willing to accept any joint Anglo-Soviet move in respect of Cambodia. He had made it clear that, if the North Vietnamese were to execute the UnitedStates pilots who had been shot down after the recent bombing raids, this would gravely inflame opinion in the United States,alienate any sympathy in the Western world for North Vietnam andrisk further escalation of the conflict.He had discussed with Mr. Kosygin a possible approach to ajoint East-West declaration which might help to ease internationaltensions and it appeared that the Soviet Government might beprepared to consider such a proposal favourably. Mr. Kosyginagreed, however, that the most useful practical results were most likely to flow from bilateral discussions between the nations primarily concerned. It was also possible that the Soviet Government mightbe willing to consider discussions with a view to agreed reductions inforce levels on either side of the East-West frontier in western europe.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.AircraftIndustryThe ConcordProject(previous reference:CC(66) 33rdConclusions,Minute 5)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of aviation (C (66) 116) on the future of the Concord.The Minister of Aviation recalled that the Cabinet had invited him to circulate a further report on the commercial prospects of the concord, with particular regard to the effect of the sonic bang. the attorney-GeneraFs advice, a copy of which was attached to his memorandum, was that the problems relating to the sonic bang didnot constitute a technical drawback which would legally justify our withdrawal from the project.So far about  45 million had been irrevocably committed anda continuation of the existing contracts, covering the construction oftwo prototypes, would entail a commitment of about  60 million bythe end of the year. The continuation of the programme, however,also implied new contractual commitments which would bring thetotal up to some  65-70 million by that time. The commercial prospects for the aircraft had been more fully considered in the lightof the Cabinefs discussion and a note, based on extensive work by united Kingdom and French officials, was attached to his memorandum. It appeared unlikely that the Government would obtain a return on their development expenditure, but the sales of
the Concord might be about 150, with a sale of spare parts to a value equivalent to this number of aircraft. The United kingdom share of these sales could improve our balance of payments by some 1,000 million over the decade 1970-80, but this gain in foreign exchange would be at the cost of substantially higher UnitedKingdom expenditure, perhaps of the order of 25 per cent. Theprofitability of the aircraft to airlines could hardly be doubted in its initial phase, when it was likely to operate with a high averagecomplement of passengers. Even in later years, with passengerloadings at a more normal level, profitable operation could still beexpected.The consequences for our aircraft industry of cancellationwould be extremely serious, the more especially since this would undoubtedly entail the cancellation by the French Government of all our current Anglo-French collaborative aircraft projects. To thecost of cancellation if we were taken to the International Court ofJustice by the French (which might entail a penalty of up to 200 million) would therefore have to be added the extra cost of acquiring from elsewhere the military aircraft involved in theremainder of our collaborative programme.In these circumstances, however mistaken the original decisionto start the aircraft might have been, there appeared to be no reasonable alternative now to completing its development.The Prime Minister said that in accordance with previous cabinet discussion he had raised the future of the Concord in his recent talks with the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.It was, however, clear that they were not prepared to concede any possibility of cancellation, though they had agreed that there shouldbe a joint study of the commercial prospects of the project. Thissuggestion might well be pursued before we gave any furtherindication to the French Government of our intention to go ahead with the next phase of development.In discussion there was general recognition that it would be impracticable for us to withdraw unilaterally from the project. Itwas suggested that the deliberations of the joint committee might bedeliberately prolonged and that work on the aircraft might inconsequence be delayed indefinitely, so mitigating the cost involved. Itwas, however, pointed out that if we were to proceed with the aircraft at all it was important to do so as quickly as possible, since otherwisewe should forfeit the major advantage which we at present held inrelation to the United States development of a supersonic civiltransport aircraft, in that the Concord would be available some years earlier. Delay would involve a heavy loss of prospective sales inthe face of the attractiveness of the higher speed and capacity of theUnited States aircraft. In these circumstances it was clear that theonly alternative to agreement to cancel the aircraft was to press ahead with its development.In further discussion it was suggested that in the light of theproposed joint commercial survey we might seek the agreement of
the French Government to setting a maximum cost of development and an understanding that, if the prospective cost appeared at a later stage to be approaching this figure, either side should be entitled to reconsider its decision to participate. There was general agreementwith this proposal.The point was also made that it might be desirable to seek to reconsider the relative priority of our other collaborative aircraft projects with the French Government. The Cabinet were, however,informed that these priorities were kept under constant review bythe Ministers primarily concerned, in consultation with the FrenchGovernment. Some of the projects were very promising, but thepresent estimated cost of the Anglo-French variable geometryaircraft gave cause for concern. All these projects, however, hadappropriate break clauses so that we could withdraw from participation if at any time this were in accord with our interest.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that we could not withdraw unilaterally from our participation in the development of the Concord. It was, however,desirable that we should seek any means open to us to do so inagreement with the French Government. To that end we should now pursue the suggestion which had been accepted by the french prime Minister for the appointment of an Anglo-French committeeto consider the commercial prospects of the Concord. Thiscommittee should be enjoined to report in not more than two months.Meanwhile, work on the development of the Concord should proceed as planned on the understanding that this involvedexpenditure in that period of the order of  2 million to  3 million.There should, however, be no new announcement about theGovernments intention to proceed and no final commitment to new contracts involving heavy expenditure, though discussions on such contracts could be started. Other processes, including, if necessary,the publication of the revised estimates, should continue in thenormal way.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Aviation to be guided by PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion in authorising the further development of the Concord.(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation, in consultation with theForeign Secretary and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, toconsider the arrangements required for the appointmentof an Anglo-French committee to consider and reportwithin two months on the commercial prospects of the concord.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary, subject to Conclusion (2), to seek the agreement of the French Government to theappointment of such a committee.
CONFIDENTIAL241Space PolicyBlack Arrow(previous reference:CC (65) 71stConclusions,Minute 4)CC 39 (66)confidential. The Cabinet considered a note by the Minister of Aviation(C (66) 118), to which was attached a report from the Chairman ofthe Official Committee on Technology on the Black arrow programme for the development of a small launcher.The minister of Aviation recalled that in December 1965 whenthe Cabinet had decided that we should work towards terminatingour commitment to the European Launcher development organisation (ELDO), Ministers had been disposed to approve the black Arrow programme. Now that, in consequence of the revisionof both the technical and financial aspects of the ELDO programme,the Cabinet had decided that we should continue to participate, itwas for consideration whether the development of Black Arrowshould be completed. To equip ourselves to play a partin international space activity we must clearly maintain somenational capability. Our present work, apart from Black Arrow, was limited to a modest programme, largely financed by the science research Council, of firing sounding rockets. This did not providethe launcher necessary to test satellite components in space during their development and unless we proceeded with Black Arrow weshould have to buy launchers from the United States. This wouldbe unsatisfactory technologically. The development of the black arrow launcher itself was estimated to cost  9^ million, of which fi million had already been spent, and a commitment of 600,000 authorised up to 30th September. The balance of theprogramme proposed was for satellite development, a field whichwas rapidly expanding and likely to grow in commercial and technological importance.In our present grave economic position it was neverthelessdifficult to contemplate expenditure of the order proposed over thenext two years but, in order to maintain our technological capacity in this field, officials should be instructed to explore urgently thepossibility of devising a more modest means of keeping in being the design teams concerned. The Black Arrow programme should beconsidered together with the proposals which had been made forthe co-operative development of an experimental communicationssatellite on a European basis. If approved, the latter would involveUnited Kingdom expenditure of the order of  1 -5 million a year forthe next four years: the issue would come before Ministers shortly.In discussion it was urged that, since the Government was nowcommitted to continue its participation in ELDO, and in view bothof the increase since the previous-December of the cost of the black arrow programme from  25 million to  32 million and of theabsence of any present economic justification for it, the right coursewould be to cancel it forthwith. The programme was of no scientificinterest and no evidence was available to justify continuedexpenditure on it.On the other hand it was urged that space technology was arapidly expanding field, the potentiality of which was necessarilyunknown at this stage. Its nature was such that certainty could never
8CONFIDENTIALbe achieved on the economic prospects of programmes comparable with the precise calculations which could be made in some industrialfields. It would be undesirable for the United Kingdom to abandonall possibility of future participation in work of this nature and weshould retain the option of doing so should new developments showthis to be justified. In particular, it would be contrary to our interests to take a step which might contribute to the further replacement bythe United States of the hitherto prominent part played by the UnitedKingdom in providing international communications.In further discussion there was general agreement that thedesirability of a modified programme for launchers and satellitedevelopment on the lines proposed by the Minister of Aviationshould be considered in relation to the priorities which should attach to United Kingdom expenditure and use of skilled manpower inother fields of technology. In the first instance, this should be reviewed by a committee of officials and then considered by ministers on the basis of their report.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C (66) 118(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for officials to prepare for the consideration of Ministers areport on the priority to be attached to United KingdomGovernment expenditure on the development of space technology, in relation to expenditure on othertechnological developments.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd July, 1966.
