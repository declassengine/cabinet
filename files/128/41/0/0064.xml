Rhodesia(previous reference :CC (66) 63rdConclusions)secret. The Prime Minister said that, as members of the cabinet would already be aware, the illegal regime in Rhodesia had rejected the document which had been worked out at the meetings with Mr. Smith on HMS Tiger and which the Cabinet had for their part approved at their previous meeting. Mr. Smith&apos;s reply statedthat the illegal regime agreed to accept the principal changes whichwere proposed in the 1961 Constitution as a basis for a constitution for independence in accordance with the six principles. The reply had however rejected the proposals relating to the return to legalityin the following terms:&quot; While the constitutional outline is acceptable to usit would be irresponsible of us to abandon the 1965Constitution, under which we are presently working, before we have assurances, without any shadow of doubt, that yourconstitutional proposals will be secured to us, instead of somepossible constitution of an unknown nature or a situation inwhich a constitution might eventuate. In our view, her majesty&apos;s Government must carry out their responsibility for putting their constitutional proposals to the test of opinion ofthe people of Rhodesia as a whole before we could accept an agreed procedure to move from the 1965 Constitution to thenew one. We are unable to accept the procedures which you suggest for the return to legality.&quot;The Government must now take the action to which they were committed in such circumstances as a result of the Meeting inSeptember of Commonwealth Prime Ministers: he had made astatement accordingly the previous evening in the House ofCommons. In considering the detail of such action it would alsobe important as a matter of urgency publicly to correct themisrepresentations by the illegal regime about the substance of theworking document which had been signed on board HMS Tiger.These misrepresentations related particularly to the question of direct rule, the control of the Rhodesian forces and the proposeddissolution of the Legislature. A Press statement might be issuedby the Commonwealth Secretary giving the facts. Mr. Smith himself had welcomed the proposal for dissolution and new elections andhad said that this might result in the elimination of about 30 ofthe more extreme members of his own party. He had also spoken of reducing the number of Ministers in the interim government from 13 to 12; with the addition of five moderates this would havemeant dropping six members of the present regime. All this hadbeen said in the presence of the Governor and Chief Justice and could be used publicly, although it might be preferable not to mention the names of the five moderates who had been considered for inclusion in the interim government since this might prejudicetheir position in Rhodesia. It would also be important to make clearthat mandatory sanctions would not have a disastrous effect on our economy. We should not get the relief for the balance of payments which would have followed a settlement, but the continuation of
sanctions would have little additional effect on the internal economy of the United Kingdom.In discussion it was suggested that our publicity should take account of the possibility, however unlikely this might be, of a splitwithin the regime and a move to establish a more moderategovernment in Rhodesia before we were finally committed by ourvote at the Security Council to a refusal to accept independence in rhodesia before majority rule. In any event, we should at the leastseek to widen the clear division of opinion which currently existed in Rhodesia, to discredit the extremists and to encourage themoderates. The long discussion by Mr. Smith and his colleagues in Salisbury about the working document showed that some membersof the regime must have favoured its acceptance. We should seek to present the rejection as being the result of pressure byextremists concerned with the preservation of their personal political position, who had for this reason refused to accept proposals whichwere greatly in the interest of European Rhodesians as a whole.The true advantages of the proposals should be explained and developed. There was also evidence from several sources of asubstantial body of moderate opinion in Rhodesia, as for examplewas witnessed by the 3,000 signatures in the Governor^ Book on11th November. No reliance could however now be placed on mr. Smith himself; our hope had been that he would take the leadin forming a moderate government but at every critical stage hehad given way to the extremists in the regime. Nevertheless, he still had a great personal following and if his place were taken byone of his even more extreme colleagues, such as Mr. LardnerBurke, the position of the regime would be much less strong, sincethe latter had no comparable political appeal in Rhodesia. Weshould do nothing to prevent this happening and should accordingly be free to refer to Mr. Smith&apos;s own statements about his willingness to be rid of the extremists in the regime and inthe Legislative Assembly. This might best be done by theCommonwealth Secretary in a public statement. If the extremistsexpelled Mr. Smith it was just possible that he would ask theGovernor to be allowed to form a new government prepared toaccept the working document and that with the support of the rhodesian forces and of moderate opinion this move might succeed.On this hypothesis it would not be in our interest to denigrateMr. Smith and he could best be represented as a weak man whohad given in to extremist views. AIt seemed unlikely however that such a decided split would develop. The liberal element in Rhodesia had proved whollyineffective and we could not count on any of the moderate membersof the regime taking a stand against the extremists. Moreover,our own means of encouraging such developments were limited.A direct appeal by the United Kingdom Government was unlikely to be effective, particularly at the moment when we should beappealing for mandatory sanctions to the United Nations, a body which was regarded in Rhodesia as being under African control.The Governor was reported to be staunch and determined to
remain in office; but a public appeal by him for acceptance of theworking document and a return to constitutional rule would not be effective and would only result in further weakening his position.Our publicity must therefore be confined to the dissemination ofthe facts, on the lines developed in discussion, in &quot;an attempt todiscredit the extremists and widen the existing division of opinion.It must also be accepted that in any event the time duringwhich a movement might develop in Rhodesia for the formation ofa moderate regime prepared to accept the working document wasvery limited. According to the terms of the Commonwealth PrimeMinisters&apos; communique we were committed to the declaration that independence would not be granted before majority rule, providedthat the Commonwealth supported the action which was nowproposed at the United Nations, and particularly the limitations onsuch action. It was possible that a Commonwealth country suchas Zambia might press for the resolution imposing sanctions on rhodesia to include provisions for enforcement action against SouthAfrica. In that event we should be relieved of our obligation to declare that we would not grant independence before majority rulebut on the assumption that we received Commonwealth support,and we should have to reaffirm our obligation in order to obtainsuch support, we could not evade this commitment and we mighthave to give effect to it at, or very shortly after, the meeting of theSecurity Council which had been called for 8th December.Once such a declaration had been made we could no longeraccept any settlement on the basis of the working document. Weshould then have to insist on a return to the 1961 Constitutionwithout independence. Although we might consider that this wouldnot amount to unconditional surrender and our declaration on noindependence before majority rule did not imply that majority rule would follow at once or even in the near future, it must nevertheless be recognised that there would then no longer be any prospect of reaching a settlement with any European regime in Rhodesia. Weshould however be free to consider other possibilities than a returnto the 1961 Constitution during the period before independence,including the suggestion for an Act of Union between the UnitedKingdom and Rhodesia. Mr. Smith himself had not belittled theeffect of sanctions or the strength of the United Kingdom economy.As sanctions became more effective more people in Rhodesia mightbe ready for a return to the 1961 Constitution without independence.Nevertheless, it must be accepted that once our declaration hadbeen made we should have to rely on economic pressure alone,and that propaganda would be ineffective. The Government should therefore review their long-term strategy on the assumption thatthere would be no immediate split leading to the formation of a moderate government in Rhodesia, that we should declare that wewould not accept independence before majority rule and that the limited mandatory sanctions which we now envisaged would not result in any early end to the rebellion or a return to the 1961Constitution.
In further discussion, the Cabinet considered and agreed theterms of a motion on Rhodesia to be put forward in both houses of Parliament.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCommonwealth Secretary and the Lord President should consider in the light of the discussion the immediate line to be taken in ourpublicity. A paper should also be prepared on our longer-termstrategy, taking account of the probable effect of mandatorysanctions on Rhodesia and the way in which the situation was likely to develop there, including the possibility that the regimewould shortly declare Rhodesia a republic. At the meeting ofthe Commonwealth Sanctions Committee later that day theCommonwealth Secretary might be guided on the question of enforcement action against South Africa by the terms of his ownstatement in Parliament the previous evening. The line which shouldbe taken on this issue in the discussions in the Security council should also be based on that statement and should be agreed indetail by the Ministers primarily concerned. The debate in theHouse of Commons on Rhodesia on 7th and 8th December mightbe on the basis of a Government Motion endorsing theGovernments decision to accept the working document, deploringits rejection by the illegal regime and supporting the government&apos;s decision to act in accordance with the agreement at theCommonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting. The same motion mightbe tabled for the debate in the House of Lords on 8th December.The United Kingdom representative at the United Nations had called for a meeting of the Security Council on 8th December; thiswould take place after the Parliamentary debates and theGovernment would therefore have fulfilled its undertaking toprovide for Parliamentary discussion before irrevocable action wastaken.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Lord President of the Council, to consider in thelight of the discussion the arrangements for theGovernments publicity in Rhodesia and in the UnitedKingdom.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to circulate forconsideration the following week a paper on the longer-term strategy on the lines indicated by the PrimeMinister in his summing up of their discussion.Europe(previous reference :CC (66) 56thConclusions,Minute 3)Meeting ofFIN/EFTAHeads ofGovernmentsCONFIDENTIAL2. The Foreign Secretary said that the meeting of Heads of member Governments of the European Free Trade Association(EFTA) and of Finland which had taken place the previous day atLancaster House, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister,had gone well. The decision to call the meeting before the PrimeMinister and he embarked upon visits to the Heads of member
Governments of the European Economic Community (e.c.) had clearly been welcomed, and the atmosphere at the meeting hadbeen friendly. The Prime Minister in his opening statement and he himself in a subsequent speech had explained the reasons for the timing of the United Kingdom initiative for a high level approach to the member Governments of the e.c.. The initiative met withthe unanimous support of the EFTA countries. The Minister of economy of Portgual had drawn attention to some of the difficultieswhich closer association with the e.c. would involve for his own country, and the President of the Swiss Federation had stressed the dangers of undue haste in the approach to the e.c.. TheAustrian Chancellor and the Finnish Prime Minister were concerned with the particular problems for their countries ofcombining a wider economic relationship with their politicalobligations. The Swedish Prime Minister had pressed strongly forfurther consultations as the high-level approach progressed, ifnecessary at short notice and at Prime Ministerial level. Alldelegations had emphasised the importance of maintaining thestrength and cohesion of EFTA during the period of the approach and in subsequent negotiations, and had stressed the benefit of theEFTA market to the e.c. and the consequent strength of theEFTA bargaining position in any negotiations with the e.c.. Alldelegations had also emphasised that the new approach to the EECshould not be allowed to stand in the way of a successful outcome of the Kennedy Round. There had been no detailed discussion ofthe problems for the United Kingdom of entry into the e.c.. Themeeting had concluded with agreement upon a communiqueexpressing support for the United Kingdom initiative and theintention of keeping in the closest consultation within EFTA, withreviews of the position as it developed at any level which thesituation might require. It was understood that this could meanconsultation at Prime Ministerial level, at Ministerial level in thecourse of regular EFTA meetings, or at official level. He had indicated that the March meeting of the EFTA Ministerial council might provide an appropriate occasion for a progress report on thehigh-level approach, but it might well be that it would be desirableto hold another meeting at Prime Ministerial level if the UnitedKingdom decided to seek entry into the e.c..He had informed the conference in confidence that the PrimeMinister and he were proposing to visit Rome early in January a proposal which had been warmly welcomed by the ItalianGovernment and to visit Paris later in the month, immediatelyafter the meeting of the Council of Europe at Strasbourg. Themeeting with the President of France would thus happen before theFrench elections in February, and it might be desirable to have asecond meeting after the elections were over.The Commonwealth Secretary said that it would be desirableto send a brief report of the conference to commonwealth governments.
In discussion it was suggested that further consideration would need to be given to possible methods of consultation with theCommonwealth Governments most closely concerned with the mainsubjects of our exploration with the countries of the e.c..The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the statement by the foreign secretary on the meeting of EFTA Heads of governments.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to send a brief reportof the conference to Commonwealth Governments.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,6th December, 1966.
