CC 31(66)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Minister without Portfolio (Mr. Houghton) said that DameIrene Ward&apos;s National Insurance (Further Provisions) Bill would receive a Second Reading on the Friday of that week. This was almost identical with the Bill introduced in the previous parliament by Mr. Airey Neave which provided for the payment of retirement pensions to those who did not at present receive a pension becausethey were over the minimum pension age in 1948 and not thenalready insured. The Government were now in a stronger position than they had been when Mr. Airey Neave&apos;s Bill was introduced to demonstrate that they had made substantial improvements in theprovision for old people and the Bill was unacceptable on groundsboth of principle and cost. The Legislation Committee had concluded that the Second Reading of the Bill should be opposed and defeatedon a vote.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the minister without Portfolio.secret. The Prime Minister said that he and the Minister of labour had had a lengthy discussion the previous evening with the finance and General Purposes Committee of the Trades Union Congress(TUC). He had told them that Lord Pearson, the Chairman of theCourt of Inquiry, had now offered his good offices in helping to bringthe two parties of the dispute together. The TUC had eventuallyagreed that their General Secretary should seek to persuade theExecutive of the National Union of Seamen (McManus) to accept this offer, as the owners would be prepared to do. It appeared that therewas increased willingness on the part of a number of members of theExecutive of the McManus to end the strike if a face saving formulacould be found; but it was unlikely that there would be a return towork solely on the basis of Lord Pearson undertaking the role ofconciliator, acceptable though he was to both parties. After the meetings the previous Friday there had been no point in his seeing the McManus again, but had told the TUC that he was prepared to seethem if they wished.The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial Committee on emergencies had considered the previous evening the further actionwhich should be taken by the Government. They had agreed that the&quot; Orcadia &quot;, a ship owned by the Secretary of State for Scotland,which was operating within the Orkney Islands with the acquiescenceof the McManus, should now operate between the Orkneys and the mainland. It was hoped that the crew, who were local men, would
be prepared to continue to operate the ship, but the McManus mightwithdraw their acquiescence and it might prove necessary to use a royal Navy crew. Consideration would also be given to thepossibility of requisitioning two further ships to move goods betweenthe Orkneys, the Shetlands and the mainland. Further measuresmight have to be taken shortly to improve the movement of goodsbetween the mainland and the Scottish Islands generally and to enablechildren to return from school on the mainland at the end of the term.The Committee had also discussed plans to use Royal Air Force(RAF) aircraft for transporting exports. In view of the risk that this might lead to a refusal by members of the Transport and general works Union to move goods to the airfields for this purpose, theyhad concluded that the decision whether or not to go ahead with thescheme at the present juncture was one which should be reservedfor the Cabinet.In discussion it was the general view that, since so far the capacityof the civil airlines to handle export freight had not been a limiting factor and it was therefore not necessary to use RAF aircraft at thepresent time for the movement of exports, it would be untimely tomake a statement on the initiation of a scheme at present. Such a move might moreover well result in a strike by the employees ofBritish European Airways which would more than offset direct gainsfrom the scheme. Furthermore, the discussions between the tuc and the McManus and Lord Pearson&apos;s offer of good offices providedopportunities for ending the strike that should not be prejudiced.It would, moreover, be desirable to postpone any statement until after the meeting the following Sunday of the Executive of theInternational Transport Workers Federation (ITF) in view of theimportance of not prejudicing the prospect that the ITF would decline to assist the McManus in the strike.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the ministerial Committee on Emergencies should consider what further action might be necessary to maintain the movement of goods toand from the Scottish Islands. As regards the announcement of plans for using RAF aircraft for transporting exports it was the general view that the initiation of the scheme in the course of the next fewdays might be prejudicial to the prospect of ending the strike.Further consideration should, if necessary, therefore be given to theproposal early in the following week. Meanwhile, it would besufficient to state, if necessary, that the details of the plan had notyet been fully worked out.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister and theHome Secretary.(2) Agreed that no statement should be made at present ofthe Governmenfs plans to use RAF aircraft fortransporting exports and that the matter should befurther considered in the course of the following week.
Prices andIncomesPolicy(previous reference :CC (66) 30thConclusions,Minute 3)CC 31 (66)secret. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of memoranda bythe First Secretary of State on prices and incomes policy (C (66) 81),on the draft Prices and Incomes Bill (C (66) 80) and on pay reviewmachinery (C (66) 82), and of a memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (C (66) 83) on arbitration and courts of inquiry.The First Secretary of State said that in accordance with the cabinets conclusion at their previous meeting he had informed theParliamentary Labour Party on 22nd June that the government intended to proceed with the introduction of a Prices and incomes bill broadly on the lines that had already been made known. Hehad made the point that the Bill would include power to requirecompulsory notification of dividend increases and power to referdividends to the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) andhe had explained the Governments proposals about penalties for offences under the Bill, and for dealing with the problem of non-payment of fines. At the meeting the Governments proposals forproductivity, prices and incomes had met with a wide measure of support, and those in favour of the policy and of the introduction ofthe Bill had considerably outnumbered those against. The view didnot appear to be generally taken that the proposals in the Billconstituted an unacceptable encroachment upon the independence and the rights of the trades unions.In discussion it was suggested that this general support for thepolicy had been qualified by criticism on various aspects, and notablyon the absence of special provisions in respect of lower paid workers.The application of a percentage norm at all levels of income inevitablyimplied a widening gap in absolute terms between incomes at different levels; one suggestion was that the norm should be formulated in money terms rather than in percentage terms. It was suggested thatGovernment supporters would look for an element of incomeredistribution in the working of the prices and incomes policy. Itmight be desirable that, when the Bill was introduced, other measures should be taken at the same time to create a favourable climate ofopinion. For instance:(i) The Government might take action to establish adequateminimum wages.(ii) The Government should be able to show that there weresanctions that could be applied when recommendations by the NBPIwere not accepted (as, for instance, in the case of the Road HaulageAssociation).(iii) It should be made clear that the prices and incomes policyapplied no less to dividends than to wages; if the Government wererelying upon fiscal measures to restrain dividend increases, their ability and readiness to use such measures should be made manifest.Further action on these lines might be combined with theintroduction of a norm of nil, with exceptions strictly related toimprovements in productivity, together with some public gesture of voluntary restraint or abatement of incomes by the more highly paid
on the lines that had been suggested by the Chancellor of theExchequer at the previous meeting.It was pointed out, however, that much of what had beensuggested would need considerable work before any decisions couldbe taken by the Government, still less before action could be put intoeffect. Some of what was proposed would be highly controversial and might have an adverse effect on the climate of opinion on prices and incomes policy.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed in principle that the prices and incomes policy should continue to be developed on the lines that had been followedhitherto, and that the Prices and Incomes Bill should be introduced inJuly. He would discuss the exact timing of the introduction of theBill with the First Secretary of State, the Lord President of theCouncil and other Ministers closely concerned. The introduction ofthe Bill should not wait for action on the suggestions that had beenput forward in discussion, which should receive the further thought and examination they required before decisions could be taken.Moreover the Minister of Technology had made some new suggestions for action which could increase the effectiveness of prices and incomes policy, and would not be incompatible with the introduction of theBill, although they might affect the extent to which it would benecessary to implement its provisions. It would be useful if these suggestions could be examined by the First Secretary of State andother Ministers concerned, with a view to their being further considered by the Cabinet at a meeting to be arranged in the nearfuture, when he hoped that it would be possible to have the wide-ranging review of economic prospects and policies which had beensuggested at the previous meeting.The First Secretary of State said that in this field his generalpolicy would be to strengthen the authority of the National board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI); to avoid setting up new independentreview bodies and to try to bring the existing bodies closer to theprices and incomes policy and to the NBPI; to establish as a general rule that courts and committees of inquiry should be required to take account of national economic considerations; and to seek theagreement of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and the confederation of British Industries (CBI) to a joint tripartite declaration that arbitrators should have regard to the national interestand specifically to the prices and incomes policy. He had set out inC (66) 82 detailed proposals for making progress on these lines.The Minister of Labour said that he accepted the First Secretary&apos;general objectives in respect of pay review machinery. He questioned,however, the wisdom of a tripartite declaration requiring arbitratorsto have regard to prices and incomes policy. In his view the function of arbitration, at any rate in the private sector and perhaps also in thepublic sector, was to be an extension of the machinery of collective bargaining. Arbitration tribunals were not able to take a completelydetached view de novo of a matter that was referred to them, as could the NBPI; their function was to settle disputes, and they inevitablyoperated within the limits of the particular cases with which they
were concerned. For instance, even if in a dispute an employer had offered more than could be justified in terms of the prices and incomes policy, an arbitration tribunal could hardly in practice make an awardwhich offered less. For these reasons arbitration could not in his view be used as an overt instrument of incomes policy and anyattempt so to use it was likely to diminish the confidence of the two sides of industry in arbitration and thus to diminish its value in dealingwith industrial disputes. For these reasons he was unable to supportthe First Secretary&apos;s proposal for a tripartite declaration. He would prefer to rely on selection and careful briefing of arbitrators, and onthe power to refer arbitration awards to the NBPI.He agreed in principle with the First Secretary&apos;s proposals on courts and committees of inquiry, although in view of thecircumstances in which such bodies were set up it was desirable toretain some flexibility in dealing with particular cases. On unilateralarbitration he would be holding further meetings with the TUCshortly. Though the TUC were anxious that a system of unilateralarbitration should be restored, it would not be easy to overcome the reluctance of the CBI.In discussion there was considerable support for the misgivingsexpressed by the Minister of Labour about a tripartite declaration on arbitration. It was pointed out that, although the NBPI had recommended that the Franks Committee on Higher Civil service pay should be invited to have regard to considerations of prices and incomes policy, the Civil Service National Staff Side had been unwilling to co-operate in such an invitation, partly because they feared that, if they did so, they would be under pressure to agreethat a similar invitation should be issued to the Civil ServiceArbitration Tribunal. They had agreed, however, that the franks committee should be entitled to take into account anything which theCommittee themselves thought relevant. There would be furtherapproaches to the National Staff Side to pursue this matter. but their reaction suggested that a tripartite declaration on arbitrationwould be difficult to achieve; and, if the Government tried and failedto obtain agreement to a tripartite declaration, they would be ablethemselves to issue a declaration on their own responsibility only atthe cost of great resentment. It might be better to rely upon thepower to refer particular arbitration awards to the NBPI, and so to face resentment on a particular case rather than on the general principle. Another possibility might be to give the NBPI a generaloversight of arbitration awards, which would entitle them to reviewany award they thought right without specific reference by theGovernment. This would be less invidious than relying on particularreferences; it would, however, breach the principle hitherto followed,that the Board considered matters only on specific reference by theGovernment (though they were free to suggest to the Governmentmatters which they would like to have referred to them).In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) The Secretary of State for Education and Science said thatthe proposal that the pay of university teachers should be determined
by a panel of the NBPI rather than by an independent review body would not be popular with university teachers; none the less he agreed with the First Secretary&apos;s general objectives and was content to acceptthe particular suggestion of an NBPI panel, provided that it wasmade clear from the outset that the panel would be dealing withother questions of public service pay besides the pay of unversity teachers. It was suggested that the pay of the Higher Civil Serviceand the remuneration of doctors and dentists should also be brought within the scope of the NBPI panel from the outset; but it was pointedout that this was likely to be completely unacceptable to the staffinterests concerned and that more progress was likely to be achieved if the Government moved towards this long-term objective by stages,beginning on the lines suggested by the First Secretary of State in his memorandum.(b) The Secretary of State for Defence said that he was preparedto accept that the NBPI panel should deal with Forces pay, again if itwere recognised from the start that the panel was going to deal witha range of public service pay questions. On the other hand theMinistry of Defence were developing proposals for dealing withForces pay in a way which would avoid difficulties created by theGrigg formula. They would be discussing these proposals with theDepartment of Economic Affairs, the Treasury and the Ministry ofLabour. In his view no irreversible decisions on the machinery fordealing with Forces pay should be taken until these proposals hadbeen examined.(c) The Minister of Health said that with some misgivings hewas prepared to accept the First Secretary&apos;s proposals (in paragraph 3of C (66) 82), in so far as they related to the Review Body on Doctors&apos;and Dentists&apos; Remuneration. He expected that the representativesof doctors and dentists could be brought to agree that the KindersleyReview Body should be invited to take account of the national interestand in particular of the general principles of prices and incomes policy; he foresaw some objection on the part of the professions tothe proposal that a representative of the NBPI should be added tothe secretariat of the Review Body; and he thought it likely that the professions would resist strongly proposals for common membershipbetween the NBPI and the Review Body. In his view it would be important not to try to make progress in relation to the KindersleyReview Body ahead of progress in relation to the Franks Committee.(d) It was suggested in discussion that, if arrangement were madefor bringing the Franks Committee and the Kindersley Review Bodyinto closer relation with the prices and incomes policy, on the lines suggested by the First Secretary of State, it would in practice be verydifficult subsequently to refer their recommendations to the NBPI.This might in turn be reflected in arrangements for the rest of theCivil Service, which might be reluctant to accept that the NBPIshould have general surveillance over awards of the Civil ServiceArbitration Tribunal if recommendations by the Franks Committeeand the Kindersley Review Body were in practice not referable tothe NBPI.The First Secretary of State, summing up this part of thediscussion in the absence of the Prime Minister, said that he would
like to consider further what his colleagues had said about thedifficulties of bringing arbitration machinery into a closer relationship with the prices and incomes policy. He recognised the force of theobjections to a tripartite declaration, particularly in the private sector;on the other hand, if there were to be no such declaration, theGovernments willingness and ability to intervene in disputes that had been the subject of arbitration, and so to refer them to the NBPI,would be critical to the success of the policy. To give the NBPI a standing right to review arbitration awards would be to breach theprinciple that it was for the Government to initiate references; it wasnot clear that this was desirable. It had also to be recognised thatit would in practice be difficult, if not impossible, to secure that the implementation of arbitration awards was. delayed while they were considered by the NBPI; reference of arbitration awards to the board was likely to be acceptable only on the basis that they were referred for examination and comment after the event.He recognised the theoretical difficulty of appearing to adopta different way of dealing with review bodies from that adopted fordealing with arbitration awards, particularly in the public sector.Nevertheless, these theoretical difficulties might not arise in practice,if it were possible to associate the existing review bodies more closely with the prices and incomes policy, by means of changes that wouldbroadly achieve the same effects as, even if they did not take the exact form of, the proposals in paragraph 3 of C (66) 82. There was general agreement that in the long term the general objective shouldbe to transfer the work of the existing review bodies to the NBPI (or its proposed panel); but the Cabinet accepted that it would benecessary to proceed to this objective by degrees, as circumstancespermitted, and endorsed the general lines of his proposals.The next stage would be for the Ministerial Committee on prices and Incomes to agree detailed proposals for making progress in thefield of pay review machinery, in the light of the Cabinets discussion.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the prices and incomes policy should be developed on the lines which had emerged from their discussion.(2) Approved the draft Prices and Incomes Bill attached toC (66) 80, for introduction in July 1966.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would discuss with theFirst Secretary of State, the Lord President of the Counciland other Ministers concerned the timing of theintroduction of the Prices and Incomes Bill.(4) Took note that the First Secretary of State would arrangefor the Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes toconsider detailed proposals for developing the prices and incomes policy and for modifying pay review machineryon the general lines suggested in C (66) 81 and 82, in the
light of, and subject to alterations and commentssuggested in the course of, the Cabinefs discussion.(5) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to arrange for officials of his Department to discuss with officials of theTreasury, the Department of Economic Affairs and theMinistry of Labour proposals for changes in thearrangements for dealing with pay of the Armed Forces,and to report to the Ministerial Committee on Prices and incomes.(6) Invited the Minister of Labour to consider further the implications and consequences of introducing legislation for a national minimum wage and to report to the ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes.(7) Took note that the First Secretary of State would examine further the question of sanctions for non-compliance with recommendations of the National Board for Prices and incomes, and in particular, in consultation with theMinister of Transport, would consider what further action the Government should take about the recent decision by the Road Haulage Association, despite the recommendations of the National Board for prices and Incomes and remonstrations by the Minister ofTransport, to recommend &quot; blanket&quot; increases of road haulage charges.(8) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for the suggestions by the Minister of Technology for action toincrease the effectiveness of productivity, prices and incomes policy to be further considered during the cabinet&apos;s forthcoming discussion of economic prospectsand policies.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23rd June, 1966.
