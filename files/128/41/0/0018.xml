The Cabinet(previous reference:CC (66) 17thConclusions,Minute 4)1. The Prime Minister welcomed the new members of theCabinet. He invited the attention of all Ministers to the fact thathe had arranged to circulate memoranda on &quot; Questions ofProcedure for Ministers &quot; (C (P) (66) 5) and on the &quot; Conduct ofGovernment Business &quot; (C (P) (66) 6), which revised and brought up to date the standard procedures which successive Administrationshad followed in these matters. Ministers might wish to refreshtheir memory of these procedures; and it would be helpful if theywould invite the attention of such of their junior colleagues as werenewly appointed to the importance of their being strictly observed.Particular regard should be paid to the continuing need to preserve the confidentiality of Government business and to avoid the serious embarrassment which could arise from the premature disclosure of the Governments discussions and decisions.oversea affairs vietnam (previous reference:CC (66) 3 3thConclusions,Minute 2)Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (66) 13thConclusions,Minute 2)Irish Republic2. The Foreign Secretary said that the current disorder incertain parts of South Vietnam arose from the long-standing dislikeof the Buddhist sections of the population for the present government of the country. The Buddhists were divided into two main groups, of which the one with the more extreme opinionswas in close touch with the regional separatists in the north.Although the Government had handled the situation better than might have been expected, the disorder would still do serious damage to the social and economic progress of the country and tothe conduct of the war with the Viet Cong. It was remarkablethat the latter had not taken greater advantage of the situation;and this might be due to the heavy military losses which they had suffered in previous months. It was problematical what form ofGovernment might emerge from the present situation.The Prime Minister said that the current situation in relationto Rhodesia and the action which the Government might need totake had been closely considered at a series of meetings of theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee; the United KingdomSpecial Representative in Central and East Africa (Mr. Malcolm Macdonald) and the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (LordCaradon) Resident at the United Nations had returned to theUnited Kingdom to participate in those discussions. The situation had developed to the point where it was becoming clear that theUnited Kingdom could not handle it alone and that international action would be required; but no firm decisions had yet been taken on the form of action which we should seek to promote.The Prime Minister said that this year was the 50th anniversary of the Easter rising in Dublin in 1916 and there was reason tobelieve that members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) might seek to create disturbances in Northern Ireland and in GreatBritain either during Easter, or during the following week-end.Precautions against violence had been taken by the Home Secretary,
in consultation with those concerned, and in co-operation with theGovernment of the Republic of Ireland. It was possible that members of the IRA might seek to interrupt public services,e.g., power stations or railways; and the Ministries concerned should therefore arrange for the necessary Departmental staffs to beavailable at short notice in order to deal with any emergencieswhich might arise. The Ministers themselves or, if they were abroad,their junior Ministers should arrange to be informed immediatelyof any incidents of this nature.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister and theForeign Secretary.(2) Invited the Minister of Power and other Ministers whoseresponsibilities might be affected by disturbances created by the Irish Republican Army during Easter and thefollowing week-end to arrange for the necessaryminimum of Departmental staffs to be available at short notice during these periods.Parliament 3.  The Cabinet were informed of the programme of business in the first fortnight of the new Parliament. The Budget would beintroduced on 3rd May and an announcement to this effect wouldbe made early in the following week.legislative programme,1966-67(previous reference:CC (66) 17thConclusions,Minute 3)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (C (66) 56), to which was annexed a draftlegislative programme for 1966-67.The Lord President said that, in drawing up the programme,the Future Legislation Committee had had in mind the desirabilityof avoiding the pressure of business to which Parliament had been subjected in the previous Sessions. Their proposals would fill thetime available, and more Bills could be added to the programmeonly if some of those at present included were postponed. Sincethe Government could look forward to a Parliament of the normallength, hov/ever, it was not necessary to attempt to pass in the first session all the important Bills to which they were pledged. Therewould be advantage in phasing their plans over several Sessions,and the Future Legislation Committee would put forward after easter proposals for the second and third Sessions with a view to securing an orderly and coherent development of the Governmenfslegislative programme for the Parliament as a whole.In discussion the following principal points were made:(a) In view of the pledge to introduce legislation on leasehold reform given in The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of the1965-66 Session of Parliament, and of the importance which thetopic had assumed during the General Election, not only in Walesbut in some English constituencies, the Leasehold Reform Bill
ought to be included in the first Session&apos;s programme. The bill would have an element of retrospection, since it would apply toleases which had expired since 8th December, 1964, and it was important to remove as soon as possible the uncertainty which affected transactions in leasehold property. A considerable amountof work remained to be done, but it should be possible to produce a Bill later in the Session and, provided that priority were given tothe Land Commission and Local Government Finance Bills, to handle it in the House of Commons, perhaps with the assistanceof the Secretary of State for Wales. If time could be madeavailable by the postponement of another Bill, Leasehold Reformshould be added to the programme, but it was important thatthe Government should not again promise legislation and fail tosecure it.(b) The Protection of Consumers (Trade Descriptions) Bill,which had been put into the programme for 1966-67 in preference to the Companies Bill, might be deferred to make way for leasehold reform. On the other hand, it was an attractive Bill of interest toall sections of the community, and had made good progress in theHouse of Lords in the previous Session. It was arguable that boththis Bill and the Companies Bill, which had also made progress andwould not require much time, should be included in the first session&apos;s programme. It was suggested, however, that theCompanies Bill was no longer urgent, that it had been criticised for implementing only the more conservative proposals of a generallyconservative Report, and that it would be preferable to introduce a more radical and comprehensive measure in a later Session.(c) From some points of view there would be advantage indeferring the Iron and Steel Bill to the second Session in order toallow time for the continued growth in the strength of sterling andto avoid vesting day falling at a time when the gilt-edged marketmight be expected to be weak and the issue of the stock requiredby the provisions for compensation would be difficult. On theother hand, it might be easier to secure the passage of a majorcontroversial Bill in the first Session of the Parliament, andpostponement would involve a risk that if it became necessary topass the Bill under the Parliament Act procedure it would not bepossible to implement it fully during the lifetime of the Parliament.In present circumstances it did not appear necessary or desirable, to engage in further discussion on the form of the proposals with industry, which had not put forward any useful suggestions as aresult of the Governmenfs expressed willingness to listen to whatthey might wish to say. Further consideration should, however, begiven by the Ministerial Committee on Iron and steel nationalisation to the question whether with an assured majorityit would be worth taking the risk of hybridity involved in extending the provisions of the Bill to the British Iron and Steel Federation,and to the timing of the introduction of the Bill within the 1966-67Session. The provisions for compensation should be reviewed bythe Minister&apos;s principally concerned.
(d) The Minister of Health had represented that the miscellaneous Health Services Bill which would enable variousimprovements to be made in the health and welfare services, shouldbe restored to the main programme from the reserve. In view of pressure on the programme this did not appear to be possible.(e) If the Overseas Aid Bill, which had also been relegated tothe reserve, were included in the main programme, it couldincorporate the Asian Development Bank and the Indus BasinDevelopment Bills. It was doubtful, however, whether the amalgamation of the three Bills would in fact save time andwhether it would be possible for the Overseas Aid Bill to be passedearly enough to avoid separate legislation on the AsianDevelopment Bank. If it could be ready in time, it would bedesirable to introduce it.(/) It was not clear that time could be saved by passing the overseas Territories Bill in the first Session. Unless some savingcould be demonstrated, the Bill should be placed in the reserve list.(g) Some time might be saved by deferring the Criminal justice bill, but deferment would aggravate public anxiety about theincrease in crime and it was desirable to pass the Bill in the first session so that measures to deal with young offenders could beintroduced in the second Session.(h) Further consideration should be given to the possibility of deferring the Bill to establish a Parliamentary Commissioner for administration. The Bill should for the present be placed in thereserve list.(i) It might be found necessary in the course of the Session tointroduce Bills on Decimal Currency, Hovercraft, and the LocalGovernment Commission. Consideration should be given to thepossibility of combining with the latter a short measure to relieve the Government of the obligation to review the establishment of the inner London Education Authority. It was desirable that the Billto enable the Government to implement Conventions on ConsularPrivileges, which could contain provisions enabling futureConventions to be implemented by Order in Council, should havea high place in the reserve list.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the main programme for the 1966-67 sessions should include Bills on Leasehold Reform and Road Safety, subjectto the exclusion from the latter of controversial provisions. Tomake room for these Bills, the Parliamentary Commissioner and protection of Consumer Bills should be placed in the reserve list.Overseas Aid should be added to the main programme if it wouldbe possible to pass it in time to avoid separate legislation onAsian Development Bank and Indus Basin Development. overseas territories should be retained in the main programme only if theColonial Secretary were able to satisfy the Lord President that itwould effect a real saving of time in the current Session. It wasnoted that other Bills might become necessary: if the LocalGovernment Commission Bill were among them, consideration should be given to the possibility of amalgamating with it the
The Queen&apos;sSpeech onthe Openingof parliament. The Cabinet considered a note by the Lord President ofthe Council (C (66) 57), to which was appended the draft of the queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.The Lord President said that the draft had been considered byThe Queen&apos;s Speech Committee. Certain changes would now berequired in consequence of the decisions reached by the Cabinet onthe previous item of their agenda.In discussion a number of amendments were agreed and thefollowing points were made:(a) It was suggested that a statement should be included in the speech of the Governmenfs policy in respect of the continuation of aid towards the economic and social development of countires overseas. It was, however, the general view that this could best be covered in the course of the Debate on the Address.(b) Greater stress should be laid on the Governmenfs intentionto take action to promote increased productivity in industry.Education [Inner London) Bill. Subject to these points, and to theconsideration of the programme from time to time by the future legislation Committee in the light of the progress made, theCabinet approved the draft legislative programme attached toC(66) 56.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Leasehold Reform Bill and an amendedRoad Safety Bill should be added to the main programme for 1966-67, and that the parliamentary commissioner and Protection of Consumer Bills shouldbe placed in the reserve list.(2) Invited the Lord President (i) to consider, in consultation with the Minister of overseas Development, whether the Overseas AidBill could be passed in time to avoid separate legislation on the Asian Development Bank andIndus Basin Development, and, if so, to add theBill to the main programme;(ii) to  consider,  in  consultation  with  the  colonial secretary, whether the Overseas Territories bill would effect any saving of time in the 1966-67Session, and, if not, to place the Bill in the reservelist;(iii) to arrange for the Future Legislation Committee tokeep the programme under review.(3) Subject to Conclusions (1) and (2), approved the draftlegislative programme attached to C (66) 56.
(c) Paragraph 16 dealing with the formulation of theGovernments policies for the aircraft and shipbuilding industries should be omitted and these issues dealt with in the course of the debate on the Address.The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to the amendments agreed in discussion,the draft text of The Queen&apos;s Speech appended toC (66) 57.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would submit the text,as amended, to The Queen for Her approval.(3) Invited the Ministers concerned, in preparing for the debate on the Address, to be guided by the points madein their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,7th April, 1966.
