SubjectBroadcasting and television broadcasting: Draft White Paper
CC 10 (66)Broadcasting The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Postmaster-and Television  General (C (66) 32)5 to which was attached a draft White Paper on(Previous       Broadcasting.Reference:CC(66) 6th The Postmaster-General said that the White Paper was theConclusions,    outcome of a policy review undertaken by the Ministerial CommitteeMinute 3) -      ,      .       \ .     , , ,     ,    ^.....Whit&quot; Paper on on broadcasting&quot;caSLing- As previously agreed by the Cabinet, it left openBroadcasting    tne question of the fourth network and the University of the Air.The most difficult issue related to the financing of the british broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and in particular the proposal thatadvertising should be included in the Light Programme. When theGovernment had come into office they had found that the BBC were faced with a very serious financial problem as the result of their various commitments, under decisions of the previous Administration,to undertake a major expansion of their services. At that time the bbc were faced with a cumulative deficit of  125 million by 1969and had asked for an increase in the licence fee to  6. Pending the outcome of the policy review which they instituted forthwith theGovernment had agreed to an increase to  5 from August 1965; but,if no further action were taken, the BBC would exhaust theirborrowing powers by the end of 1967-68. In these circumstances the Corporation were now asking for an increase in the licence feeto  6 10s., to take effect in August.The Ministerial Committee had considered that there were only three sources from which additional revenue for the BBC could bedrawn the Exchequer, the licence fee and advertising. They haddismissed the possibility of Exchequer finance; and they had rejectedany early increase in the licence fee. They had therefore concluded that the Corporation should be offered the opportunity to selladvertising time on the Light Programme (since the Licence and agreement gave the Government no power to compel the BBC toaccept advertising). This might produce  7 million a year after twoor three years and would not, therefore, solve the BBCs problems.But, together with the other measures proposed, it should defer theneed for an increase in the licence fee to 1967-68 or later. The LightProgramme was in any event addressed primarily to the popularaudience; and the proposal to introduce advertising into it shouldnot therefore have the adverse effects on programme standards oron the independence of the BBC which the Corporation professed toapprehend. It was an additional advantage of including advertisingin the Light Programme that it would help to deprive the &quot; pirate &quot;radio stations of their main source of revenue.In discussion it was suggested that the essential problem whichfaced the Government was the problem of financing a service, whosecosts were increasing steadily as a result both of increasing prices and of the expansion to which it was committed, from a flat-ratelicence fee which was regressive in its nature and had lost its originalbuoyancy now that the ownership of television sets was widelyspread. If no other source of finance were provided for the BBC,the licence fee would have to be increased by an average of about
10s. a year in the future. Moreover, although a reduction of BBCexpenditure might be enforced by insistence on greater administrativeeconomy and improvements in efficiency, it was unlikely that this reduction would materially affect the financial problem. Indeed, therecent investigations of the Official Committee on Broadcasting had only confirmed the findings of previous independent inquiries thatthe Corporation operated efficiently and economically by comparisonwith e.g., the Independent Television Authority (ITA) and Germanbroadcasting authorities. Any attempt to impose a limit on expenditure would therefore merely compel the Corporation eitherto curtail their programmes generally or to abandon the BBC-2service. But these economies would be harmful to the developmentof public service broadcasting, would lead to a further and undesirable extension of commercial broadcasting and would evokean unfavourable public reaction.In further discussion it was suggested that the licence fee was still relatively low in relation to the cost of the services providedby the BBC; that there was still scope and justification for increases in the fee at suitable intervals; and that, since the licence system offinance guaranteed the standard and independence of public servicebroadcasting, it should remain the principal source of BBC finance.On the other hand, increases in the licence fee were generallyunpopular with the public, particularly in the light of the apparentlyfree services provided by the ITA; and they bore hardly onpensioners and low wage earners. It was therefore necessary to seek a supplementary and more buoyant source of finance in order toavoid too frequent increases in the licence fee and to enable theproper development of public service broadcasting to proceed.In the light of these conflicting considerations the proposal toinclude advertising in the Corporation^ Light Programme could be argued to entail the risk that, even if confined to that programmeinitially, it would constitute a precedent and would open the doorto the extension of advertising to the Corporation^ other serviceswhen the time next came to consider an increase in the licence fee.Moreover, the amount of revenue obtainable from advertising was uncertain and was in any case insufficient to solve the BBCsfinancial problem, even if the proposal were acceptable to theCorporation in principle, as seemed unlikely. On the other hand,no other source of additional finance for the BBC was available; andin the light of the responsible attitude which the independent television companies had displayed despite their dependence on revenue from advertising, there were grounds for believing that public opinion would not react unfavourably to the inclusion of advertising in the BBCs Light Programme. In the long term itwould make possible an acceptable pattern of increases in the licence fee at intervals which might perhaps comprise several years at a time;and it would thus help to ensure that the licence system would remain the basic source of finance for the BBC. Moreover, theCorporation^ objections of principle might be reduced if they were reminded that this was only one of the measures for reinforcing theirfinances which the Government proposed and that it would be
supplemented by the additional licence fee for colour television andby the proposed measures to reduce evasion of payment of thelicence fee and to increase the Corporation^ revenue by the sale of technical services and programmes to the proposed local communitystations.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that an Exchequer subvention should be dismissed as a supplementary source of finance for the BBC andthat an early increase in the licence fee was open to considerableobjection. It was also agreed in principle that the licence fee oughtto remain as the principal source of the Corporation^ finance butthat, in order to avoid too frequent increases in the fee, some furthersource of revenue was necessary and there seemed, for this purpose,to be no alternative to the inclusion of advertising in the LightProgramme. But in view of a letter which he had recently receivedfrom the Vice-Chairman of the BBC, expressing very forcibly theopposition of the Governors to the inclusion of advertising in theCorporation^ programmes, it would be appropriate that, togetherwith the Lord President of the Council and the Postmaster-General,he should arrange to meet the Vice-Chairman and the Director-General of the Corporation in order to discuss the whole problem with them and to ensure that the BBC were fully aware of the considerations which the Government had to take into account. Inthe light of the outcome of this discussion it would be necessary forthe Cabinet to give further consideration to the issues raised inC (66) 32.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Prime Minister, together with the lord president of the Council and the Postmaster-General,would discuss with representatives of the british broadcasting Corporation the financial problems of theCorporation and the proposal to introduce advertising onthe Light Programme.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of C (66) 32 at a subsequent meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th February, 1966.
