CC 24 (66)confidential parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Oversea AffairsNorth AtlanticTreatyOrganisation(NATO)(previous reference:CC(66) 23rdConclusions,Minute 2)ChineseNuclearTest(previous reference:CC(64) 2ndConclusions,Minute 1)Indonesia(previous reference:CC(66) 13thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that he and the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster had had a number of consultations withrepresentatives of NATO Governments in preparation for a meetingof the NATO Council in Brussels on 6th June to consider themeasures to be taken in the light of the French declaration of their intention to withdraw from the Organisation. Our first aim mustbe to carry out the most effective and economical re-organisationof the Alliance, leaving it open to France to participate on mutuallyacceptable terms, but being prepared to carry on without Franceif this proved necessary. The discussions had been complicated byan excessive desire on the part of some members of the Allianceto placate the French and by a tendency on the part of others to seek to discuss at too early a stage complicated issues which couldwell be left for later settlement. One major problem would be whether or not the Council should move from Paris and we must seek to avoid the Council, the Military Committee and SupremeHeadquarters Allied Powers in Europe being located in threedifferent places.The Prime Minister said that it appeared from his recentdiscussion with the United States Ambassador that it was unlikelythat the United States Government would be concerned to pursue the problem of nuclear sharing until agreement had been reached on the major problems of the reorganisation of the Alliance.The Foreign Secretary said that the Government of the People&apos;republic of China claimed that the third nuclear test which theyhad just carried out had been a thermo-nuclear explosion.Evidence would shortly be available on which this claim could be assessed. The reaction of the Indian Government to the test hadbeen sharp, but the Indian Prime Minister, Mrs. Ghandi, appearedat present to be determined that the Indians should not develop their own nuclear bomb. Nevertheless, the Indian attitude infuture would be affected by the extent to which guarantees of security against nuclear attack could be given to non-nuclearPowers by the nuclear Powers as part of an agreement that theformer would not develop their own nuclear weapons. Otherwise,the Chinese test did not greatly affect the course of discussions ona comprehensive test ban or on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. We must bear in mind that the French Governmentwould shortly be carrying out a series of nuclear tests and theterms of our public statement on these and on the Chinese testshould be in broadly similar terms.The Foreign Secretary said that some indications had beenreceived from the Indonesian Government of the goods which they wished to obtain with the  1 million grant which we had recently made to them: it appeared that for the most part these goodscould be supplied by United Kingdom industry.  The Indonesian
Rhodesia(previous reference:CC(66) 23rdConclusions,Minute 2)Government still adhered in public to their policy of confrontationbut there had been a number of private exchanges of view between their representatives and those of other countries in an endeavourto seek a face-saving formula which would enable confrontation tobe brought to an end; unfortunately, so far no formula had beenfound which would be acceptable both to the Malaysian and to the indonesian Governments.The Foreign Secretary said that the Security Council mightmeet the following day, or more probably early in the following week. The African States had prepared a draft resolution fortabling at the meeting; it was at present in terms which included the mandatory use of force and was quite unacceptable to us, butit was doubtful if it could obtain the nine votes which were necessary to make it effective under the provisions of the Charter.Our aim in the discussions should be to avoid the taking of a vote on the resolution and to seek a consensus merely that the item of rhodesia should remain on the agenda.In discussion it was urged that we should not use our powerof veto in any circumstances to defeat a resolution on Rhodesia,but it was generally recognised that we could not accept aresolution which made it mandatory for us to use force to bringthe rebellion to an end. Furthermore, we must have full regard tothe effect on the position of Zambia and also on United Kingdomcopper supplies even of a mandatory resolution confined to continue sanctions. There was general agreement that we mustlose no opportunity of continuing to make clear our policy on rhodesia, that our agreement to informal talks implied nocondonation of the illegal declaration of independence and that wewould maintain the six principles which we had laid down as abasis for a settlement. One difficulty in dealing with the views of african Governments was that, whereas the Heads of State were forthe most part responsible in their attitude to the problem and understanding of the difficulties which affected both Zambia and ourselves, their representatives, whether at the United Nations or inLondon, were sometimes much more extreme. If there were to bea meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers in the course of theyear it would be important to us that it should be attended by thePrime Ministers or Heads of State themselves.The Prime Minister said that the informal talks had begunbetween United Kingdom and Rhodesian officials. While the latterclearly had been given little discretion by the leaders of the illegal regime, there were nevertheless indications that, no doubt inconsequence of the effect of our economic sanctions, they were now prepared to be less intransigent and to envisage the prospect of majority rule. For our part, we should continue to emphasise thatour concern in these talks was to find a way to restore constitutionalrule and to ascertain whether or not a basis of negotiation existedand with whom such negotiations could take place.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Foreign secretary and the Prime Minister.
industrial disputes(previous reference:CC(66) 7thConclusions,Minute 3)ThreatenedSeamen&apos;sStrikeCC 24 (66)secret.   The Minister of Labour said that the seamen&apos;s disputearose out of the 1965 agreement with the owners which had improved   remuneration  for  week-end  work  at  sea,   on   theunderstanding that the pattern of work would not be altered.Unfortunately this understanding had not been recorded in theagreement and many ships&apos; masters had increased week-end work in effect introducing a seven-day week contrary to previouspractice.   This had caused much resentment and in response torepresentations from the National Union of Seamen (McManus) theShipping Federation had written to owners to draw their attentionto the spirit of the 1965 agreement.   However, this had onlyproduced a limited reduction of the new week-end working.   TheUnion had, therefore, put in a claim for a 40-hour week with allwork above that to be paid at overtime rates.   The owners inreply had offered an agreement reducing the working week to40 hours in three annual stages, but seeking some countervailingadvantage in a reduction of leave.   Whilst the leaders of theUnion had recommended this offer to the Union&apos;s full ExecutiveCommittee, the latter had rejected it and were insisting on the40-hour week being reached quickly with no reduction of leave.He had met the Union&apos;s leaders but it was clear that they could not carry the Executive, still less the Conference, with them.   He had,therefore, called the full Executive to the Ministry the previous day and spelt out the economic position to them very fully.  Hehad offered them a full Court of Inquiry, but, whilst the Executivewelcomed this and the meeting in general had been friendly, they remained insistent on a better offer from the owners as well.  Hehad therefore called in the Trades Union Congress (TUC) who,however, took a pessimistic view of the position.   He was seeing the TUC again in the afternoon and the TUC would also be seeing the National Union of Seamen.  It had to be recognised, however,that the position was at present grave and a strike seemed probable.This placed the Government in great difficulty; on the one hand the economic consequences of a strike would be very serious; onthe other hand acceptance of the men&apos;s demands would be a gravebreach in the prices and incomes policy; nevertheless, it had to berecognised that the seamen were still poorly paid as compared withother workers.In discussion, there was general recognition of the seriousness of the situation for the economy. If the seamen&apos;s demands were met in full, it would on certain calculations amount to a 16 per cent increase in remuneration on top of a 13 per cent increase in 1965and the breach in prices and incomes policy would be verydamaging. Either this or a strike might weaken confidence in sterling at a time when the trade figures for the previous monthwere in any event unfavourable. A strike could cause widespreadphysical dislocation about half our exports and nearly half our imports were carried in United Kingdom ships. The cost ofswitching to foreign ships would be about  13 million a month(if there were no sympathetic action on foreign ships).   The
problem of moving essential supplies might cause the strike to spread to the docks, e.g., if the Royal Navy had to be used to clear strike-bound ships from berths to moorings. Nevertheless, ifa strike were declared, the Government would be bound to resist it.On the other hand, concern was expressed that theGovernment might find themselves in a false position in opposing the Union&apos;s demands. There might be considerable sympathy forthe seamen in respect of their conditions of work. The calculationthat the increase in remuneration demanded by the men would amount to a 16 per cent increase was unrealistic, as it assumedwrongly that all the men would work at week-ends. A prices and incomes policy which did not allow poorly paid workers toimprove their conditions in order to bring them into line withthose of other trades would be indefensibly rigid. Resistance tothe seamen&apos;s case would not appear consistent with the treatmentgiven to the doctors.In further discussion of the prospects of avoiding the strikeit was suggested that where, as in this case, the consequences of strike action would be very grave to the nation as a whole, the dangers of establishing a practice of appeal to the Prime minister might be thought to be outweighed by the need to do everything possible to avoid the serious situation which would result from astrike. But any such intervention, if it were made, should takeplace before the strike had been declared and not after. It waspossible, however, that the strike might be averted by the ownersgiving way. They were already under some pressure to do so fromthe Confederation of British Industries (CBI); but it was important that the Government should not be involved in any arrangement ofthis kind. In any event the prospect of a strike, and the possibilityof its spreading were such that contingency planning to maintain essential supplies and services had become necessary.The Home Secretary reported that the Ministerial and OfficialCommittees on Emergencies had authorised some preliminaryprecautions. In these cases there was always a nice balance between the need for preparedness and the risk of provocationthrough taking the preparatory measures. The ministerial committee had not considered that emergency powers would berequired before the strike started, but the necessary regulationswere ready. It had been felt necessary to authorise four steps ofa confidential, consultative, character:(i) The Ministry of Agriculture to consult the meat trade aboutthe possibility of a shortage in Southern England.  ,(ii) The Ministry of Defence to arrange for essential supplies to the Scottish and other islands.(iii) The Ministry of Defence to consult port authorities aboutpreparations for the navy to clear berths.(iv) The Ministry of Defence to enquire of Commands aboutthe availability of Service personnel in the event of the strikespreading to the docks.
CC 24 (66)The Secretary of State for Defence reported that thearrangements for supplying Scottish and other islands were nowcomplete, that the discussions on clearance of berths would be continuing over the week-end, and that 34,000 men would be needed from the Services if there were a dock strike. If it became necessary to man coastal ships the naval authorities would need tocontact their owners in advance.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwould be necessary to keep the position under continuous review.It would be for further consideration in the light of developmentswhether there would be advantage in his personally intervening inthe negotiations before the strike began.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the statements of the Ministerof Labour, the Home Secretary and the Secretary ofState for Defence.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would give furtherconsideration, in the light of further developments in thesituation, to the possibility of intervening personally inthe negotiations.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,12th May, 1966.
