SECRET -31     46CC 4 (66)secret parliament 1.   The Lord President said that on 1st February there wouldbe a debate in the House of Commons on a motion to take note ofthe Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Aircraft Industry(Plowden Report). It appeared that the Opposition would not seek to divide the House on a motion in such terms, since it implied thatthe Governments attitude towards the Report was at this stagepurely exploratory. If, however, the Government were to commit themselves to the acceptance of the Report by a motion whichwelcomed it, an amending motion might then be tabled.The Minister of Aviation recalled that earlier in the week theCabinet had agreed (CC (66) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 5), that theGovernment should accept the Reports basic analysis of the futureof the aircraft industry, but that the precise nature and terms of theGovernments participation in the industry should be left for negotiation. They had also agreed that he should endorse theproposals for international co-operation: but these did not seem likely to prove contentious. In these circumstances the best course might be for the Governments motion to take note of the report and for his speech to welcome it in principle without any commitment on its details, although the proposals for international co--operation should be specifically welcomed.Discussion showed general agreement with this view.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a motion should be tabled in the House ofCommons which would take note of the Report of theCommittee of Inquiry into the Aircraft Industry.(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation in his speech on the motionto welcome only the broad principles of the Report andthe proposals for international co-operation, on the lines indicated in the discussion.Prices and incomes PolicyPay of the armed forces and. the higher civil Service(previous reference:CC(66) 3rdConclusions,Minute 2)SECRET*2. The First Secretary of State said that discussions since the cabinets decision to accept the reports of the National Board for prices and Incomes (NBPI) on the pay of the Armed Forces and theHigher Civil Service had suggested that an early announcement ofthe decision might be embarrassing to the Government both inrelation to their efforts to promote a settlement of the dispute onrailwaymen&apos;s pay and in the wider context of the proposed legislation on prices and incomes. On the other hand it was necessary to give full weight to the impact on both the Armed Forces and the CivilService as a whole of a decision to reject the reports or to accept them only in a modified form. The increases for the Armed forces could be presented as being the equivalent of an annual rate of increase of just over 6 per cent; and the reasons for giving an increase* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
above the norm could be convincingly explained by reference to theperiod of time to which it was related. Similarly, the increases forthe Higher Civil Service could be shown as being well within thenorm as a whole; and the exceptional increases for Under-Secretariescould be justified by reference to special factors. None the less the absolute figures of some of the increases could be embarrassing. Hehad therefore considered further, in consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Defence, whether to invite the Cabinet to reconsider their decision on the acceptance ofthe report on Higher Civil Service pay. This might have beendesirable if it had been reasonably certain that a decision to modify the NBPFs recommendations would be likely to facilitate an acceptable settlement of the railwaymen&apos;s dispute and substantially to diminish opposition to the prices and incomes legislation. Butthere was no assurance that such would be the result. His own view,therefore, was that, on balance, the Cabinefs decision should standand that it should be announced later in the day. But in view of the potential embarrassment the Cabinet might wish to give the matter further consideration before action was finally put in hand.The Prime Minister said that, since the Cabinet were not being asked to reconsider the substance of the decision which they had recently taken, the issue now before them related simply to the timing and presentation of that decision.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had receivedearlier that morning a formal request from the Secretary-General ofthe Staff Side of the Civil Service National Whitley Council that theStaff Side should be provided with a copy of the report of the NBPIon Higher Civil Service pay in advance of publication. It would bedesirable, therefore, that he should invite representatives of theNational Staff Side to a meeting later in the day, at which he could give them copies of the report and inform them of the government&apos;s decision before it was publicly announced. On this basis anannouncement should be deferred until 28th January.In discussion it was suggested that, if an announcement weredeferred for a further day, the Government might be exposed to criticism that this arrangement had been made deliberately in orderto protect them against embarrassing criticism in that afternoon&apos;economic debate in the House of Commons or for other reasons. Itwas the general view, however, that consultation with the Staff Side,which would be in conformity with the procedure adopted in relationto other reports by the NBPI, would constitute sufficient justification for a further slight postponement of publication.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange a meetinglater in the day with representatives of the Staff Side ofthe Civil Service National Whitley Council in order togive them advance notice of the Governmenfs decisionon the report by the National Board for Prices and incomes on Higher Civil Service pay.
secret. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary ofthe Cabinet (C (66) 17), to which was attached a report by the official committee on Local Government Finance on capital grants forhighways improvement and the proposal for a separate grant for education, and a memorandum by the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment (C (66) 20) on the points outstanding for decision fromthe Cabinefs previous discussion of local government finance.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that hehad reached agreement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Secretary of State for Education that there were no administrativeor technical advantages in having a separate education grant, andthe Local Authority Associations did not appear to favour a separategrant on any basis which would be viable. The Cabinet might therefore agree that the proposal for a separate grant for education services should not be pursued.It had originally been proposed to introduce capital grants ata level of 50 per cent for various services, and to reduce from 75 to50 per cent the maximum level of grants for improvements and construction of highways. It now appeared that, in view of the high cost and very uneven incidence of major road schemes, it was not practicable to reduce the level of highways grants. To keep these at75 per cent and hold the other capital grants at 50 per cent wouldinvolve an increase in Exchequer assistance of  27 million. Such anincrease could be avoided by reducing capital grants on other services to 40 per cent, but none of the Ministers concerned consideredsuch a reduction feasible. It might be that the local authorities would not welcome capital grants for other services on the groundthat they would be likely to increase Governmental control, in which event he would not pursue the proposal but it would be undesirable for the Government to take the initiative in withdrawing it.However, if the additional money could not be found, then the only alternative to maintaining the grants at the level of 50 per cent wasto drop them altogether.It had been agreed that the Government should give additional assistance amounting to  30 million to local authorities in 1967-68,and that this assistance should be concentrated on the relief of the(2) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the reports by the National Board for Prices and Incomes on armed forces pay and Higher Civil Service pay to be published on Friday, 28th January, and for the government&apos;s decision on these reports to be announced in the Houseof Commons on the same day.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for ministers to be supplied with appropriate material for thepublic justification of the Government^ decision.
domestic ratepayer. This would increase the rate burden of industry;as industry could charge rates as an expense before deduction of tax,every additional  5 million on the rate burden of industry cost theExchequer about  1 million in loss of revenue. For these reasons it was proposed that the grant to local authorities for relief of the domestic ratepayer should be  25 million. This would be acceptableif an additional  5 million could be provided in respect of themaintenance of highways in county boroughs and inner London.There would, however, be grave objection to the additional highwaysmaintenance grant being found within the  25 million, since thatwould in effect reduce the amount of grant for relief to the domesticratepayer to  20 million. Such a reduction of what was already asmall sum would be very difficult to justify to the local authorities.In discussion the following points were made:(a) Though the decision not to proceed with a separate grant on education would be represented as a failure to honour a pledge whichhad been made by the Government before they took office, it wouldmake no difference to the amount of money spent on education.(b) If the level of grants for highways remained at 75 per cent,and capital grants for other services were fixed at 50 per cent, theGovernment would be subject to constant pressures to raise the levelof grants on other services. The difference between the rate of grant for other services and the rate of grant for highways would causebad feeling among local authorities. Though the additional expenditure would merely be a transfer from local authority toGovernment spending, it was of the first importance at the presenttime to keep to a minimum the rise in Government expenditure.Nor was the maintenance of such grants essential, in the view of most Ministers concerned, in order to maintain adequate control bythe central government. Not to proceed with the proposals for capital grants for other services would make the negotiations with local authorities more difficult; but the proposals which had nowemerged would have considerable attraction, and there was reasonto think that many local authorities were not enthusiastic about theproposal for capital grants for other services.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, if the cabinet decided not to proceed with the proposals for capital grants for other services, he would be content that the extra  5 million for highwaymaintenance should be treated as additional to, not as part of, theassistance of  25 million net for the relief of domestic ratepayers.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of view in the Cabinet was in favour of abandoning the ideaof a separate grant for education, of retaining the 75 per cent grant for improvements and construction of highways and abandoning theproposals for capital grants at 50 per cent for other services. TheCabinet also agreed that there should be a grant of  25 million forthe relief of domestic ratepayers and of a further  5 million forhighways maintenance by the county borough councils and theGreater London Council. It should be made clear that theGovernment had endeavoured to find ways of improving the system
ReorganisationSECRETLocal 4.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the MinisterGovernment 0f Housing and Local Government (C (66) 6) and by the Secretary ofState for Wales (C (66) 15) on the need for a review of theorganisation and functions of local government.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that thetime had come for a radical enquiry into the functions and organisation of local government in England. The present standingstructure was inadequate, in that there was no proper relationship between the size of local authorities and their modern functions, thatthe historic division between town and country was no longerappropriate and that the system all too often resulted inthe subordination of local government services to a conflict over the boundaries between the local authorities. No simple answer was tobe found merely by setting up much larger local authorities but a thorough reorganisation, which would lead to the establishment of much larger areas for some of the modern functions of localof local authority finance within the existing framework, but that ithad become apparent that there were serious disadvantages in anyinterim measure which went beyond the agreed provision for grants for the relief of domestic ratepayers amounting to  30 million in1967-68, rising by a further  30 million in each of the two following years. The limited success of the Governmenfs efforts to improve theexisting system emphasised the need for a long-term and radicalreview of the whole system of local authority finance, including the rating system as well as Government grants. The reform of theorganisation of local government envisaged in the memorandum tobe discussed under the next item of the Cabinefs agenda would bevery relevant in this context.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the proposal for a separate grant for education services should not be pursued.(2) Agreed that grants for improvements and construction ofhighways should remain at levels up to 75 per cent.(3) Agreed that the proposal for separate capital grants forother local authority services should not be pursued.(4) Agreed that additional assistance should be given to localauthorities in 1967-68 as to  25 million for the relief of domestic ratepayers and as to a further  5 million forhighways maintenance by county borough councils andthe Greater London Council.(5) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government toproceed in accordance with these decisions in his further negotiations with the representatives of the localauthorities.
government, might make it possible then to find a new source orsources of local finance and so either to dispense with or to supplement the rating system and change the present extremelyunsatisfactory method of financing local authority services. Thesuggestion he had made for such a radical review at the annual conference of the Association of Municipal Corporations the previousSeptember had been received with surprising acclaim.The present procedure for reorganisation, which had been initiated by the Local Government Act, 1958, and involved protractedexamination by the Local Government Commission, was insufficientlyradical and far too&quot; slow. The importance of the issues involved andthe need for reorganisation to be worked out by a body of thehighest standing made it desirable to appoint a Royal Commission.Such a Commission should be asked to produce a fully worked outscheme. This would admittedly add considerably to the time required for the Commission since the completion of such a task would take two years at least, but procedure in this manner would save much time in the longer run, since the Commission would not then merely produce a statement of principles which would thenlaboriously, area by area, have to be applied in the face of strugglesby the existing local authorities to retain their identities. Scotlandand Wales raised separate problems and it would not be appropriate for them to be covered by the Commission.If this proposal were agreed in principle, the timing would raise a number of difficulties in relation to existing proposals for there organisation of certain local authority areas. The main issue was whether the reorganisation of the Manchester and Merseysideconurbations should be completed before the Commission were appointed: this would mean postponing the latter for at least twoyears. Having regard also to the division of opinion in Lancashireon the form of reorganisation, the right course would be to windup the Local Government Commission and start the new reviewforthwith. The Government should, however, carry through to completion those of the Local Government Commission^ proposalswhich had already been approved or on which decisions could be announced during the next few months.The Secretary of State for Wales said that, while he agreed thatthe time had come for a radical reorganisation of local government,it was doubtful whether it was appropriate for this to be done by a royal Commission. In particular this course would be inappropriate for Wales in that proposals for the reorganisation of the localgovernment structure there were already far advanced and shouldnot be further delayed. Even if, however, the Royal Commission^terms of reference were limited to England, there would be pressure by the Local Authority Associations, which covered Wales as wellas England, for the current proposals to be postponed until theCommission had reported. Apart from this consideration, andbearing in mind the extent of the detailed studies which had beencarried out on local government reorganisation in recent years, itmight be preferable for the Government themselves to present a
White Paper containing proposals for reorganisation which, after discussion with the local authorities and others concerned, could be incorporated in a Parliamentary Bill.The Secretary of Stale for Scotland agreed with the need forreorganisation. Given the difference in the structure of localgovernment and the division of functions between authorities inEngland and in Scotland, the issue required separate consideration in Scotland, though it would be appropriate for this also to be doneby an enquiry at a high level.Discussion showed full agreement on the need for a radicalreorganisation of the local government system. There was some support for the view that, having regard to the extent of previousstudies and enquiries and to the danger that the appointment of a royal Commission might result in unnecessary delay, it would be preferable for the Government to publish at an early date their owndetailed proposals, for subsequent consultation and discussion. Itwas, however, the general view that in England it was necessary toappoint a Royal Commission because of the extent of disturbance ofexisting authorities which would necessarily be involved and the consequent desirability of prior consultation with them beforedetailed proposals were published. It was also generally agreed that much importance must be attached to the working out of a fullydetailed scheme by the Royal Commission and to the presentation of their report at the earliest possible date; and that Wales and scotland could best be dealt with on the lines envisaged by therespective Secretaries of State, though it would be necessary for there organisation in the three countries to be based on the same principles and for there to be co-ordination of the separate enquiries.As regards England, the terms of reference of the Royal commission should be widely drawn and should include the regional aspects ofthe problem, particularly in the light of the establishment of regional economic planning councils. They should also include the possibilityof some further transfer of functions to the central government.There was also general agreement that the appointment of the RoyalCommission should not lead to the cessation of work on the rationalisation of services, including specifically any reorganisation of police forces that might prove desirable.In further discussion the following points were also made:(a) A radical reorganisation of local government boundariesmight call in consequence for a review of the work of theParliamentary Boundaries Commission at a later date.(b) The task which would be imposed on the Royal commission would make heavy demands upon its members, despite the extensiveassistance which would be afforded by the appropriate section of theMinistry of Housing and Local Government. It might therefore benecessary to consider whether some remuneration other than thepayment of expenses should, contrary to normal practice, be paidto the members.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,27th January, 1966.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement with the proposals put forward by theMinister of Housing and Local Government. The next step shouldbe to consider the form of a public statement and the terms ofreference of the Royal Commission, both of which would involve further consultation with the Ministers concerned. In addition tothe Ministers who were more immediately concerned with localauthorities, the First Secretary of State should also be consulted inview of the relevance of the enquiry to regional developments. Itwould also be necessary for there to be co-ordination between thework to be done in England, Scotland and Wales.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that there was need for a radical reorganisation ofthe system of local government in Great Britain.(2) Agreed that the reorganisation currently being considered in wales should continue without interruption.(3) Agreed that there was need for separate enquiries into there organisation in England and in Scotland.(4) Took note that the Secretary of State for Scotland would consider the appointment of a body of enquiry in respectof Scotland.(5) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government,after consultation with other Ministers concerned, to send to the Prime Minister, for submission to The Queen,proposals for the composition and terms of reference of a royal Commission on the reorganisation of localgovernment in England.(6) Subject to Conclusion (5), invited the Minister of housing and Local Government, in consultation with the secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales, to considerthe terms of a public statement on the government&apos;s proposals.
