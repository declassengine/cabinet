&quot;J    265CC 43 (66)secret parliament 1.   The Lord President said that Parliament would adjourn onFriday, 12th August, subject to essential Parliamentary businesshaving been completed by then, and would resume on 18th October.This time-table would necessitate deferring the Second Reading ofthe Industrial Reorganisation Corporation Bill until after the summer recess, but an assurance could be given that this would not delay the time-table which had previously been accepted for the committee stage of the Bill.In discussion it was suggested that the Lord Presidentsstatement that afternoon on the programme of parliamentary business might make it clear that this deferment of the SecondReading of the Bill implied no diminution of the importance whichthe Government attached to the Corporation and that the preliminary work of the Board of the Corporation would in no way be delayedin consequence.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Lord President of theCouncil and invited him to make clear in his statement that afternoon the importance which the Government attachedto the work of the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation,on the lines indicated in discussion.OverseaAffairsGibraltar(previous reference:CC (66) 39thConclusions,Minute 3)Persian GulfStatesSECRET2. The Foreign Secretary said that a record of the openingstatements by the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs and by himself on the opening of the discussions about Gibraltar had been placedin the Library of the House of Commons. We had put a series of proposals to the Spanish Government in subsequent discussions between officials and, though we had not yet had their formal reply,it seemed clear that this would prove to be unfavourable. our intention was then to propose a reference of the dispute to theInternational Court of Justice. If the Spanish Government refused,our proposal would nevertheless still put us in a good tacticalposition in relation to any subsequent discussion on this issue at theUnited Nations. If, however, the Spanish Government accepted theproposal in principle it would then be necessary to agree detailedterms on which the dispute should be referred to the Court. It was unlikely that such discussion would be concluded before the endof the Summer R.recess and in any event there could be no final agreement while Parliament was not sitting, since the agreement would require Parliamentary ratification. It could, if necessary, bemade clear in the House of Commons that there would be no final agreement on the terms of reference in question until Parliament had considered them.The Foreign Secretary said that Sheikh Shakhbut, the Rulerof Abu Dhabi, had been deposed. It had been clear for some considerable time that his retention of power was contrary to the7162
Indonesia(previous reference:CC (66) 42ndConclusions,Minute 2)interests both of the people of Abu Dhabi and of the United Kingdom,but it had not been possible for us to take action except in response to the express wish of the ruling family. The latter had now formallyrequested the deposition of Sheikh Shakhbut and action had beentaken in consequence.The Foreign Secretary said that it was now confidently expectedthat the Bangkok Agreement would be signed in the course of theweek in Djakarta. The Agreement provided for the reaffirmationof popular opinion in the Borneo territories on their continuedparticipation in Malaysia, for an exchange of diplomatic representatives and for an immediate end to hostilities betweenIndonesia and Malaysia. The public agreement would be accompanied by a secret exchange of letters which would provide that mutual recognition of Indonesia and Malaysia would follow the holding of elections in the Borneo territories which would reaffirmtheir position in Malaysia, but that regular contacts would meanwhilebe maintained between the two countries.In discussion it was agreed that it would on balance be undesirable that any statement should be made in Parliament, orissued by the Prime Minister, welcoming the signature of theAgreement. It was however suggested that the Foreign and commonwealth Secretaries might suitably send messages to the signatory Powers of the Agreement and that the Secretary of Statefor Defence might send a message to United Kingdom troops inMalaysia, expressing appreciation of the difficult and dangeroustask which they had so successfully carried out in dealing withconfrontation.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaries toconsider whether it would be appropriate for them tosend messages on the signature of the Bangkok agreement to the appropriate Ministers in Indonesia and malaysia and Singapore respectively.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to considerwhether it would be appropriate for him to send a message to United Kingdom troops in Malaysia, onthe lines indicated in discussion.EconomicSituation(previous reference:CC (66) 42ndConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that a ministerial steering Committee on Economic Policy had been established tokeep under review the broad development of the Governmenfseconomic strategy and to report, as appropriate, to the Cabinet.The Committee would be meeting the following day; it would review the current situation and commission further work on forward planning by officials, on the basis of which a report could be madeto the Cabinet in due course.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that preliminaryindications showed that the balance of payments for the second quarter of 1966 had been in heavy deficit. It was difficult at thisstage to assess with confidence in quantitative terms the eventualeffects of the measures already announced. Much would depend upon their impact upon business expectations of future levels of demand; uncertainty about the extent and time scale of recovery,superimposed upon the tight liquidity position in which companies were finding themselves as a result of the credit restrictions and the selective Employment Tax, could lead to substantial adjustments to industrial investment plans. On the best forecasts that could bemade at present, it was expected that the level of private investment would not change significantly over the next 18 months, and might even fall away. Between the second half of 1966 and the second halfof 1967 public consumption was expected to rise by 3 per cent andfixed investment in the public sector by 7 - 5 per cent. The expectationwas that the level of unemployment would increase at a rate ofabout 10,000 a month (seasonally adjusted), to reach a level ofabout 1-8 or 1-9 per cent (seasonally adjusted) by the end of1967. Forecasts of the balance of payments for 1967 following therecent measures suggested that there would be a deficit in the first half of the year followed by a sizeable surplus in the second half,so that the balance of payments should be in surplus over theyear as a whole. This depended however upon fulfilment of thedecisions on reductions of Government expenditure overseas. Inan independent analysis the International Monetary Fund had alsoconcluded that the United Kingdom balance of payments would bein surplus in 1967. The knowledge that international bodies werereaching this conclusion would be likely to spread, with beneficialeffects upon confidence in sterling.The additional public expenditure proposed for 1967-68 over1966-67 amounted (at constant prices) to  1,350 million (10-9 percent) including both basic and additional programmes; and to  880million (7 -1 per cent) for basic programmes alone. The ministerial committee on Public Expenditure had concluded that an increaseof 10-9 per cent in public expenditure in 1967-68 was out of thequestion, and had decided to recommend to the Cabinet that thereshould be a detailed review of programmes, without commitment,to see what detailed measures would be necessary if the cabinet were to decide to keep the rate of growth of public expenditurenext year within the planned rate of A\ per cent; this would allow an increase of about  500 million at constant prices. Until the effects of the measures announced on 20th July became clearer, it wouldnot be possible for Ministers to decide whether public expenditure programmes should be allowed to increase in 1967-68 by 4  percent or by some greater or smaller amount; but decisions wouldhave to be taken after the Recess, and, in order that decisions couldbe properly taken, it would be important for officials to assemblethe data upon which decisions would have to be based. the ministerial Committee on Public Expenditure therefore recommended7162a 3
that officials should be instructed to draw up a wide-ranging set ofalternatives, no branch of expenditure being excepted, on the basisof which Ministers could reach decisions in the autumn on whatrate of growth in public expenditure in 1967-68 over 1966-67 wouldbe acceptable and what detailed measures should be taken to achieve this objective. If the Cabinet agreed, the Treasury would set this in hand at once, in consultation with officials of other departments.Looking further ahead, Ministers would also have to review the rate of growth of public expenditure over the years beyond1967-68 in the light of revised forecasts of the rate of economic growth. This exercise should be related to the more immediateexercise on the programme for 1967-68, since decisions about thelevel of expenditure in later years might to some extent affect theposition for 1967-68. In the longer-range exercise, and so far aspossible in the shorter-range exercise as well, Ministers should beput in a position where they could, if they wished, revise prioritiesas between one departmental programme and another: hence theneed for a wide-ranging set of alternatives among which to choose.Substantial economies had already been secured in the defence programme; but it would not be right to exclude the defence programme from the scope of these further exercises. He wouldbe writing to the Secretary of State for Defence to suggest that officials should examine without delay the possibility of achieving further savings of up to  150 million at constant prices in defence expenditure.Among the possibilities which he would suggest for review wouldbe the size of the armed forces, the level of civilian support for the armed forces, the batmen system, the number of naval dockyards,and the timing of the aircraft carrier programme.In discussion the following points were made:(a) One of the tasks of the new Ministerial Steering Committeeon Economic Policy would be to form a view upon the degree ofdeflation which the measures already taken were producing. Inview particularly of the risk that loss of business confidence might lead to a greater degree of deflation than was at present forecast,the Committee would put in hand contingency planning for reflation.It would clearly be important that, where measures were taken toincrease expenditure as part of an exercise in reflation, first priority should be given to expenditure which would directly benefit growth,productivity, exports and import saving. In committing additional public expenditure this should be the first priority. As a secondpriority it would be desirable to have ready programmes in the field of public sector investment (for example, road programmes) whichwould be desirable for their economic benefits, e.g., as providing theinfrastructure for growth, as well as being reflationary in effect. Asa third priority, in case additional measures of reflation were needed,consideration could be given to proposals for increased social investment. The distinction between expenditure which directlypromoted growth or benefited the balance of payments and consumption expenditure was more important, certainly in thecurrent situation, than the distinction between public and privateexpenditure. Though the Governments social objectives should notbe lost sight of, it might well be that in these circumstances
improvements in benefits and assistance to persons would have totake a lower priority, difficult though such decisions would be.Consideration would have to be given, for example, to the possibilityof deferring the increase in non-contributory benefits from June to october or November, 1967, and of relating the increase to the risein prices rather than to the rise in earnings since the last increase in benefits.(b) The problem of time lag would have to be borne in mindin considering the role of public sector investment in a reflationexercise. If business confidence dropped and industrial investment plans were curtailed on a large scale, and during the course of nextyear some measure of reflation proved to be urgently needed, itmight not be easy to bring about a quick revival of growth of private investment. In this event the Government might be faced with the choice between injecting additional public sector investment, whichwould not necessarily be of the first economic priority, or stimulatingconsumers&apos; expenditure.(c) In reaching decisions on the rate of growth of public expenditure in 1967-68 the Government would need to leavethemselves some freedom of manoeuvre in other sectors where itmight be necessary to sustain or stimulate output and investment in the interests of growth or of the balance of payments.(d) Special attention should be given by the departmentsconcerned to the promotion of import savings. For example, theMinistry of Technology should review imports of machine tools and consider what could be done to encourage domestic manufacture ofsome of the tools that were now imported. The Board of trade should review investment programmes in the chemical industry,with a view to encouraging those projects which would lead to substantial import savings. Other projects for substantial importsavings were under separate discussion. It would be desirable forsponsoring departments to take such steps as were open to them toencourage large industrial companies not to cut back their investment programmes.(e) There should be a further review of agricultural policies and programmes, with a view to seeing whether further import savings could be achieved without serious damage to our internationaltrading relationships, commitments and policies.(/) The Housing Ministers and the Minister of Public building and Works should review the possibility of import savings inconnection with the housing programme, particularly in imports of timber.(g) The Governments regional policies had had considerable success in reducing the gap between the level of unemployment in theMidlands and the South-East and that in Scotland, Wales and theNorth-East. While from the point of view of overall economic activity a national level of unemployment of \\ to 2 per cent mightbe desirable in the interests of flexibility and redeployment, there wasa danger that the deflationary effect of the recent measures would notbe evenly spread over the country as a whole, but would bearCC 43 (66)      267
disproportionately severely upon Scotland, Wales and otherdevelopment areas. It would be important to maintain policies for promoting growth in those areas, where the potential for growthwas greater than elsewhere in view of the reserves of labour available and in general to do what was possible to prevent the impact ofdeflation from bearing more severely on those areas than on otherparts of the country.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had had a useful review of the economic situation, whichwould serve as a basis for further strategic planning by the newMinisterial Steering Committee to which he had already referred.The Cabinet agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ proposal that, in the field of public expenditure, officials should be instructedto draw up, without commitment, a wide-ranging set of alternative means by which the growth of public expenditure in 1967-68 couldbe contained within the planned rate of 4  per cent in real terms,no branch of expenditure being excepted, as a basis for ministerial decisions later in the year on the rate of growth in public expenditure which would be appropriate in 1967-68 and the detailed measureswhich could be taken to achieve that rate. At the same time theexercise should look forward to later years, with a view to enablingMinisters to take broad decisions about the rate of growth of public expenditure in the years beyond 1967-68 in the light of revisedforecasts of the growth of the economy to 1971-72.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the points made in discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for officials to draw up, without commitment, a wide-rangingset of alternative means whereby the rate of growth in public expenditure in 1967-68 over 1966-67 could be contained within the planned rate of 4J per cent in real terms.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Public Expenditure in due course:(i) to consider the rate of growth in public expenditurein 1967-68 and the alternative courses available,in the light of the points made in the cabinets discussion and of the report to be prepared by officials, and to make recommendations to theCabinet;(ii) to review the public expenditure programme for later years in the light of revised forecasts of the rate ofeconomic growth, and to make recommendations to the Cabinet.(4) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, the HousingMinisters (the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Ministerof Housing and Local Government and the Secretary ofState for Wales), the Minister of Technology and the
Minister of Public Building and Works to pursuepossibilities of greater import savings in the fields forwhich they were responsible, on the lines suggestedin discussion.(5) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for a group of Ministers under the chairmanship of the minister without Portfolio to consider whether greater savings ofimports of agricultural commodities could be achieved without serious damage to our international tradingrelationships, commitments and policies.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,10th August, 1966.
