CC 26 (66)confidential parliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the week beginning 13th June, after the whitsun Recess.Oversea affairs rhodesia(previous reference:CC(66) 25thConclusions,Minute 2)confidential. The Foreign Secretary said that in the recent debate in theSecurity Council of the United Nations the extreme resolution which would have required members of the Organisation to imposemandatory sanctions against nations not co-operating in theeconomic measures against Rhodesia had failed to secure thenecessary number of votes. For the time being at least this was asatisfactory outcome.IndustrialDisputesSeamen&apos;s Strike(previous reference:CC (66) 25thConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Minister of Labour said that he had had a further discussion with the National Union of Seamen (McManus) and theShipping Federation on the previous Monday. The Union&apos;position appeared to have hardened after the week-end; and he hadbeen told in confidence that the Union leaders saw little hope of anychange in the attitude of their members for at least a fortnight. Inthese circumstances he proposed that the Government should announce that they intended to establish forthwith a Court of Inquiry,even though the strike was still in process; there were sufficientprecedents for action of this kind. The Courts terms of reference might be:&quot;To inquire into (i) the immediate causes and circumstances of the present dispute between the shipowners and members of theNational Union of Seamen;(ii) terms and conditions of service of seamen, taking intoaccount the national interest, technological change andthe need for an efficient and competitive shipping industry;(iii) relations between shipowners, officers and seamen;(iv) the law, including the Merchant Shipping Act,  1894,relevant to paragraphs (ii) and (iii) above;and to report.&quot;These terms of reference would allow the Court to make an earlyinterim report on the issues involved in the immediate dispute before they proceeded to consider the longer-term reforms which might berequired.The Home Secretary reported that congestion in the docks hadbeen developing more gradually than had been expected. unless there were some unforeseen change in the situation, there should beno serious congestion at any port until the following Tuesday and perhaps not even then.  So far it had not been necessary for naval
SECEE1tugs to move strike-bound ships from their berths; and this issuealso was not expected to arise before the following Tuesday. NoDepartment had needed to implement the Emergency Regulations,with the exception of the Ministry of Transport who proposed toestablish Port Emergency Committees on the following day. It hadbeen necessary for the Royal Navy to introduce emergency services to the Western Isles; and fuel supplies for the Western Hebridesmight have to be arranged by the same means. Otherwise, naval vessels had not had to be used; and supplies to the Orkneys andShetlands were being maintained. The Northern Ireland Governmenthad now decided to proclaim a state of emergency in Ulster; butthey would not take any action under the Proclamation without prior consulation with ourselves.In discussion some concern was expressed about the probablecourse and duration of the strike. The Government faced a dilemmabetween on the one hand making or promoting concessions to theNUS, which might bring the strike to an end but would prejudice theprices and incomes policy, and on the other hand facing a prolonged and perhaps widespread dispute. It could be argued that, ratherthan allowing the strike to continue indefinitely, with increasinglyserious consequences to the economy, the Government should take some further action to promote a compromise settlement. On theother hand it was open to question whether any settlement was yetfeasible; and it might well be preferable to press forward with theproposed Court of Inquiry, which would show that the Governmentwere determined to redress the long-standing grievances of the NUSstemming from the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 and so to tackle the problem at its roots. Although a major statutory reform wouldbe a very lengthy process, the crucial Part II of the Act, dealing withdisciplinary provisions, had already been examined by the Board ofTrade in consultation with the McManus and the owners; and this surveywould be a valuable starting point for the Court of Inquiry.In further discussion some doubt was expressed whether theCourt of Inquiry might prejudice the Governmenfs policy on prices and incomes. Was it intended that the findings of the Court in theirinterim report on pay and hours of work should be accepted by theGovernment even if they were in conflict with the prices and incomes policy? But it might be no less embarrassing if they had to be rejected on that ground, especially in the light of other recent caseswhere substantial awards by independent review bodies had beenaccepted.On the other hand it had never been the Governmenfs policy that the norm established for the purposes of the prices and incomes policy should not be exceeded in any circumstances; and in thepresent case an award by the Court of Inquiry which was inaccordance with the criterion of the national interest need not makeany greater breach in the policy than the previous cases. Therewould be no advantage in seeking to enforce a reference of thepresent dispute to the Prices and Incomes Board, but the fact that theCourt would include at least one individual who was also a memberof the Board should be helpful in this connection.
Visit oiFederalGermanChancellorCONFIDENTIAL4. The Foreign Secretary said that in the discussions which,together with the Prime Minister, he had had with Dr. Erhard, theFederal German Chancellor, and Dr. Schroeder, the Federal ForeignMinister, during their recent visit to London close agreement hadbeen reached on the tactics to be pursued in the North Atlantic treaty organisation (NATO) in face of the French withdrawal. There wasa good prospect that the policy on which we were agreed would alsobe accepted by the 14 NATO Powers before the meeting of the ministerial Council of the Organisation in Brussels in June. He had had a brief discussion with Dr. Schroeder about the problem of nuclear sharing in the North Atlantic Alliance; but it had beenagreed that this issue should be deferred until after the Brusselsmeeting. Dr. Schroeder still appeared to favour a solution whichwould give the German Government some degree of physical controlover nuclear weapons; but he might not press this view. TheGerman Government, however, attached less importance than ourselves to the possibility of concluding a non-proliferation treaty,which we regarded as an integral element in any solution of the nuclear problems of the Alliance. As regards accession by theUnited Kingdom to the European Economic Community (e.c.) wehad suggested to Dr. Erhard that a statement by the Six supporting the principle of United Kingdom entry into the Community would assist the more detailed discussions and investigations which would now have to be undertaken. The question of the cost of UnitedKingdom forces in Germany had been the most difficult subject.Dr. Erhard had been surprised by our request for an additional contribution this year and had represented the difficulty ofcommitting himself on this issue before discussion with his ownCabinet.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thestrike was of a unique character, and could not have been avertedby any steps which the Government could realistically have taken.But an interim report by the proposed Court of Inquiry might wellprovide a means whereby the moderate elements in the Union couldcontribute to a reasonable settlement; and arrangements forconstituting the Court should therefore proceed as rapidly as possible.At present it seemed unnecessary for the Cabinet to meet duringthe following week and the day-to-day developments in the situation should be dealt with by the Ministers directly concerned. the ministerial Committee on Emergencies, however, should meet on thefollowing Tuesday and Thursday.The Cabinet Approved the proposal to constitute a Court of inquiry into the dispute between the National Union of seamen and the Shipping Federation and invited the Minister of&apos;Labour to announce this decision in the House of commons that afternoon.
The Prime Minister said that Dr. Erhard faced a dispute within his own party about NATO and policy towards France in the lightof the French Governments decision to withdraw from theOrganisation; and he was also confronted by a difficult budgetaryproblem. It was not unnatural, therefore, that he should wish todeal with these problems one at a time and to concentrate on solving the NATO problem before addressing himself to other subjects suchas the question of nuclear sharing, the financing of United kingdom troops in Federal territory and United Kingdom entry into the e.c..But it was perhaps significant that he had been inclined to discountthe indications that the French Government might now be more favourably disposed to our entry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Dr. Erhard had clearly expected that we would raise the question of the cost ofUnited Kingdom forces in Germany in regard to 1967 and subsequent years but had perhaps not appreciated that we should feel bound topress this issue in relation to the current year as well. We had put to Dr. Erhard the need for a German financial contribution of 50 million by such means as German payment for the civilian labour employed by our forces or the reimbursement of the taxes which wepaid to the Federal Government in respect of our troops. In replyDr. Erhard had emphasised the budgetary difficulties of the federal government and the unwelcome need to increase taxation withwhich they were confronted; but we had pointed out the much largertax increases which had been made in our own Budget. Dr. Erhardhad wished to defer further discussion of the problem; but it hadfinally been agreed that the German Finance Minister should cometo London in June for this purpose and that this might be followedby the visit of a United Kingdom Minister to Germany in July.These discussions would undoubtedly involve some hard bargaining;but we must adhere to our determination to reach a settlement by mid-September.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Space Policy :EuropeanLauncherDevelopmentOrganisationPreviousReferences:CC(65) 71stConclusions,Minute 4 and cc(66) 2ndConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of aviation (C (66) 73) about United Kingdom participation in theEuropean Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO).The Minister of Aviation reminded the Cabinet that, inDecember 1965, they had decided that we should terminate our commitment to ELDO. Subsequently, however, our partners in theOrganisation had put forward a new proposal for the developmentof an extended version of the ELDO-A launcher (ELDO-PAS) andhad also indicated that they would be prepared to consider some reduction in the United Kingdom contribution to the Organisation.It had therefore been decided that these new developments justifieda postponement of our withdrawal for a period of up to 3 months inwhich the new proposals could be studied in more detail.   This
proposal had been accepted by the Ministerial ELDO Conferencein April and it had been agreed that the Conference should adjournuntil 9th June. It was now necessary to decide our attitude whenthe Conference reassembled.The Official Committee on Technology had completed a study of the scientific and technological implications of the new proposals.Their report, which was appended to C (66) 73, indicated that theseimplications had not changed significantly since the cabinets decision that we should end our commitment to ELDO apart fromthe facts that the ELDO-PAS system should provide an appreciabletechnical improvement on the original ELDO-A programme andthat there was now a growing interest in the use of satellites for television purposes. It remained true, therefore, that, while theamount of technological &quot; fall-out&quot; from space research anddevelopment was arguable, our attempts to strengthen and moderniseour technology would be jeopardised if we withdrew entirely fromthis field while our European allies remained active within it. TheOfficial Committee also indicated that from the financial point ofview there was now a prospect that, if our ^contribution could bereduced from its present level of 38-8 per cent to 25 per cent from 1st January, 1967, our total expenditure in relation to the revised programme would amount to only some  42 million as comparedwith the estimate of  48-58 million which had been before theCabinet when they took their original decision to withdraw from theOrganisation. Moreover, if we withdrew from ELDO while our partners continued, we should have to pay some  14-5 million asthe balance of our commitment. For these reasons the additional cost of remaining in the Organisation could now be put at no morethan some  27 million over the next six years; and most of theforeign exchange costs would be met by contracts placed in thiscountry.But the strongest arguments in favour of our remaining in theOrganisation were political. It was now clear that our withdrawal would have a serious effect on our standing in Europe and would prejudice our attempts to promote closer European association. Ifwe withdrew, our European partners would certainly go aheadwithout us; and we should then be effectively excluded from anycollaboration in European space technology, while our efforts to seekcloser co-operation with Europe in new scientific and technologicalfields would also be prejudiced. Finally, it had recently become evident that the United States Government were anxious that weshould remain in ELDO; and our withdrawal might therefore forfeitUnited States goodwill, on which we were greatly dependent in many other fields.For these reasons, the balance of advantage lay in our continuing to participate in the ELDO-A programme on the basis of itsmodification to include ELDO-PAS, provided that our financial contribution was reduced. Informal enquiry of the Secretary-Generalof ELDO suggested that it should be possible to secure a reduction
in our total contribution to a level of 29-75 per cent over the period1967-71.In discussion there was a significant degree of support for thisproposal. The Cabinefs original decision to withdraw from ELDOhad been based largely on an assumption that our partners in theOrganisation would welcome our action as an excuse to bring the enterprise to an end and so to relieve themselves of a financial burden which they were privately finding as onerous as ourselves. this assumption, however, had been shown to be wrong. The other european Governments were now genuinely anxious that ELDOshould continue; and they were increasingly reluctant to be left in aposition in which, if the Organisation were discontinued, europe would be in effect dependent on the United States for the provisionof launchers. The decisive considerations, however, were political.Our international reputation and our prospects of promoting closerEuropean integration in wider fields would alike be gravely damagedif, at this juncture, we withdrew from an advanced technologicalenterprise to which other European Governments attached so much importance and were seen to be prepared to become virtuallydependent on the United States for launching facilities. Moreover,we could expect a withdrawal to provoke a particularly sharpreaction from the French Government whereas, if we met the Frenchdesire that we should remain in the Organisation, we might be betterplaced to adopt a firm attitude towards the French Government inrelation to a reassessment of the Concord project, the cost of whichwas rising at an alarming rate. For these reasons it would be to our advantage to remain in ELDO provided that we could secure a significant reduction in our financial contribution.As against these considerations it could be argued that there hadbeen no real change in the economic considerations involved sincethe Cabinet had taken their original decision and that, if we remained in the Organisation, we should be tacitly accepting a commitment which would prove to be of indefinite duration and to entail muchgreater expenditure than any of the estimates which were at present under consideration. The other European Governments were anxious that we should continue in partnership with them since thisimplied, in effect, that we should continue to finance a great part oftheir research and development whereas the proper course for usto adopt in our own interests would be to reverse this process and,by withdrawing from the Organisation, to compel them, if they wished to continue, to finance our development by purchasing ourlauncher. The ELDO project held no prospect of military advantagefor us, since any military use of the launcher was debarred by theOrganisation^ Charter; and such civil use as was contemplated for it would be wholly uneconomic by comparison with an arrangement whereby we could purchase telecommunications channels by our participation in the International Telecommunications SatelliteOrganisation. It was unrealistic to suppose that, by acquiescing inthe wishes of other Governments at our own expense, we should bein any better position either to secure their goodwill in relation towider aspects of European collaboration or to persuade the French
secret y    166cc 26 (66)Government in particular to adopt a more realistic attitude towardsthe Concord project. These considerations were irrelevant to an issue which we should now decide on its merits and in the light of our own interests.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thearguments were very nicely balanced but that it appeared to be thepreponderant view of the Cabinet that such change in circumstances as had occurred since the Cabinet took their original decision didnot justify any change in that decision.The Cabinet Endorsed the decision that we should now terminate our commitment to ELDO as soon as was practicable.South ArabiaMilitary Aid(previous reference:CC(65) 12thConclusions,Minute 2)secret . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (OPD (66) 62) about military aid to South Arabia, whichhad been discussed by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committeeon the previous day and had been referred to the Cabinet at therequest of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Foreign Secretary said that it had been agreed in theDefence Review that we should leave Aden and conclude no defence agreement with an independent South Arabia. He had seen theSouth Arabian Federal Ministers, now in London, on the previous day and had confirmed our decision not to conclude a defence agreement.We were however under an obligation to assist the federal government in building up local forces so that they could take overthe defence of the country when we left. This was agreed; what was at issue was the amount we should pay and the length of our commitment. What was now proposed was substantially less thanwhat the Federal Government had asked for and represented, in theview of the Chiefs of Staff, the minimum required to maintaininternal security and offer some protection against external attackwhen South Arabia became independent. We were under a treatyobligation to defend the Federation and assist in maintaining internal security until independence and he proposed that our commitmentafter independence should be for a strictly limited period of threeyears until 1971. If we did not assure the Federal Government thatthey would be provided with adequate defence there was a risk thatthey would give up the effort they were now making to achieveconstitutional progress leading to independence and that theFederation would at once disintegrate and South Arabia wouldrelapse into chaos. This would gravely damage United kingdom interests since a breakdown in internal security might mean that weshould have to make a fighting withdrawal, with consequent loss ofmen and material. We should also be accused of betraying our friends in South Arabia: the humiliation of a disorderly withdrawal would weaken confidence in us in the Persian Gulf: and our failure to bring South Arabia to independence in an orderly manner would damage our prestige throughout the world.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that our civil and military aid to the Federation was now running at  16 million a year andamounted to nearly three-quarters of total Federal expenditure. TheForeign Secretary&apos;s proposals would involve capital expenditure ofsome  6 million and additional recurrent expenditure of  5-6 million a year. The Foreign Secretary suggested that our commitment would end in 1971 but in view of the degree of the Federation^ dependence on us it was unrealistic to suppose that we should be able to extricateourselves then. It was agreed that some additional aid would haveto be given in order to secure our own withdrawal, but the levelsuggested was unacceptably high. A figure of  1 million a year, tocover both capital and recurrent expenditure and aid to the EasternAden Protectorate as well as the Federation, should be sufficient tomeet the minimum necessary increase in the Federal forces.The Secretary of State for Defence said that what was at issue was the price we must pay in order to secure our political andmilitary withdrawal from South Arabia in good order. It was essential that internal security should be maintained until our forces had left and we should be dependent for this on the Federal RegularArmy, whose loyalty could only be relied upon so long as they were assured of their pay and of their future. We could not withdrawpolitically with honour unless we could secure orderly constitutional progress to independence and for this we were dependent on theco-operation of the Federal Government. It need not be assumed that we should be unable to terminate our commitment in 1971since by that date the whole position in South Arabia might well have changed. Saudi Arabia might have taken over the protection ofSouth Arabia, which she could well afford to do, or the country might have been absorbed by the United Arab Republic. All his advisers, including the Chiefs of Staff, agreed that we must beprepared to pay a price of the order suggested by the foreign secretary if we were to withdraw from South Arabia in good order.The precise level to which the Federal forces should be built up should, however, be subject to a more detailed examination of the costings.In discussion it was argued that the level of expenditure suggestedby the Foreign Secretary was unduly high both in relation to the savings which should accrue from the Defence Review and inrelation to other claims for civil and military aid. The forcesproposed for South Arabia, both in size and in the degree ofsophistication, would be far beyond the ability of the country to sustain. There was therefore a serious risk that whatever conditions we might now put on our commitment we should in practice be unable to terminate it by 1971. On the other hand, it was pointedout that the size of the country and the difficulty of maintaininginternal security called for disproportionately large forces, including some air forces. Any course open to us involved risks, butagreement with the Federal Government was urgent and if were fused to give them adequate help we might at once createconditions which would make it either impossible or at least moredifficult and even more expensive to bring South Arabia to independence and to secure our orderly withdrawal.
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,26th May, 1966.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that in theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee on the previous day thegeneral sense had been that the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposals should in principle be accepted as the price we must pay to secure our political and military withdrawal from South Arabia. There was however a difference of view in Cabinet and some members felt thatit should be possible to meet our minimum requirements at a lower level of expenditure. A decision was urgent in view of thenegotiations with the Federal Ministers now in London and he would therefore propose to have a further discussion later that day withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Foreign Secretary and theSecretary of State for Defence in an attempt to resolve the issue.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Foreign Secretary and theSecretary of State for Defence, would give furtherconsideration to the level of military aid to be offered tothe Federal Government of South Arabia.-
