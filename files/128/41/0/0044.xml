The Commonwealth Secretary recalled that the previousNovember, after the illegal declaration of independence in Rhodesia,the Government had decided to take all possible action to applyeconomic sanctions and had secured a very wide measure of support from other countries for them. In April of this year the leader of the illegal regime, Mr. Ian Smith, had taken the initiative in seekingdiscussions with the United Kingdom Government about a settlement and we had agreed that there should be informal talks between officials to ascertain whether there was a basis for negotiations and,if so, with whom such negotiations should be held. In these informaltalks, United Kingdom officials had explained our views on the way in which the six principles which we had laid down as the basis of an acceptable solution could be given constitutional effect and had emphasised that negotiations on such a constitution could only takeplace after a return to constitutional rule in Rhodesia.The previous week these talks had been adjourned because the illegal regime had announced their intention of introducing legislation to provide for an amendment to the Constitution whereby they would obtain permanent powers of preventive detention. It seemedimprobable that this action was a deliberate affront to the UnitedKingdom Government but we had emphasised to the illegal regimethe grave view which we took of it in relation to the continuance ofthe informal talks. Agreement to have such talks at all had causedwidespread suspicion among African countries and would undoubtedly give rise to particular difficulty at the forthcomingSECRET1. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that our proposals for reducing our foreign exchange expenditure on our forces in Germany had been put forward in the Western european union (WEU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)in accordance with the prescribed procedures. An Anglo-GermanCommission had also been established to consider ways in which german offset payments might be increased. The position had recently been complicated, however, by a message from the UnitedStates President to the Prime Minister proposing tripartite discussions on these issues between the United States, Germany and ourselves.The Ministers concerned would meet in the following week to consider how best to deal with this approach.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this move by theUnited States Government had undoubtedly been made to dissuadeus from withdrawing forces from Germany and would considerablycomplicate our task of reducing our foreign exchange expenditure.
Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers. In particular PresidentKaunda had threatened that Zambia might withdraw from theCommonwealth.Ministers had considered ways in which increased pressure mightbe brought to bear on the illegal regime. The possible courses ofaction were:(i) The use of force. There were however overwhelmingobjections to this course, which had been ruled out by theGovernment.(ii) The handing over of responsibility for dealing with thesituation to the United Nations. This also had been rejected. Itmight involve an escalation of the action to be taken in a manner which would gravely damage our own interests and it would in any event not mitigate the present difficulties of our situation.(iii) A mandatory resolution under Chapter VII of the united nations Charter, either in respect of economic sanctions generally orin respect of supplies of oil alone. The advice of officials was thatany such action would inevitably lead to sanctions against SouthAfrica. These would be likely to fail, with grave consequences forthe United Nations, and would in any event be disastrous for theUnited Kingdom economy. We would suffer severe economicdamage if we broke off relations either with South Africa or withthe African members of the Commonwealth and other African Statesbut, on the balance of our economic interests alone, it appeared thatwe should suffer more seriously from the former than from the latter.Ministers had also considered whether we should declare that wewould not accept independence in Rhodesia before the institution of majority rule. Such a statement would undoubtedly greatly ease ourposition at the Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers, but since it would irretrievably damage any prospect of achieving a settlement in Rhodesia, this course was not acceptable.In these circumstances, the best course which we could take atthe Meeting was on the following lines. We should admit thats anctions had not proved to be as effective as we had hoped at theMeeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers held at Lagos in Januaryof this year. It would, however, be wrong to assume that they were having no effect: on the contrary they were imposing substantialdifficulties for the Rhodesian economy. For example, only one-quarter of the last tobacco crop had so far been sold and that at pricessubstantially below normal. There was, moreover, little prospect that the illegal regime would be able to sell any considerable part ofthe crop due for sale in March 1967. We should also state that noother countries had suffered economic damage comparable to ourown in an attempt to end illegal independence in Rhodesia. Thecost to us was at the rate of some  80 million a year, including our aid to Zambia.There were three main breaches in sanctions: continuing trade between Zambia and Rhodesia, continuing supplies of oil throughPortuguese East Africa and South Africa and continuing Rhodesianexports of certain raw materials, primarily chrome and pig iron and
chiefly to Germany and the United States. As regards the first,Zambia had so far cut off only some 35-40 per cent of her trade withRhodesia and this proportion could be considerably increased,perhaps up to some 80 per cent, without unacceptable consequences for the Zambian economy. The Cabinet would recall that before the summer Recess we had agreed to provide additional aid of some 7 million, making nearly  14 million in all, in order to assist Zambiain her difficulties in making a phased reduction of this order. TheMinister of State for Commonwealth Affairs had subsequentlyalmost succeeded in reaching agreement with the ZambianGovernment on this basis when President Kaunda had made his statement about the possibility of Zambia withdrawing from theCommonwealth. It would be important at the forthcoming Meetingof Commonwealth Prime Ministers to seek help for Zambia from theother African members of the Commonwealth, who had so far donelittle or nothing to assist. As regards oil, it was difficult to see howsupplies could be further reduced. It would be physically possibleto stop oil going through Portuguese East Africa and this might have some psychological effect in Rhodesia. That would, however, onlybe temporary, since alternative supplies could go through SouthAfrica, and we could not face the consequences of oil sanctions against the latter. As regards the continuing export of raw materials,we were continually pressing the Governments concerned to reduce their imports from Rhodesia, but they maintained that they could not take further action without passing legislation and that this was notpolitically practicable.There had been a further development overnight in that telegramshad been received from our representative in Rhodesia, with a message from the Governor. This stated that Mr. Smith and his ministers had been taken aback by the adverse criticism arousedthrough the introduction at this stage of their ConstitutionalAmendment Bill. Mr. Smith was anxious for the talks to succeedand if they could be resumed as soon as possible was prepared to give an undertaking that during their progress he would not introduceany legislation dealing with preventive detention or allied subjects,or any other constitutional amendments. If agreement were reached on the basis of the six principles and a return to constitutional rulehe would withdraw completely the recent constitutional amendment.The Prime Minister said that while sanctions had not had thepolitical effect which had originally been hoped of supplanting the illegal regime by a moderate government, they had led Mr. Smith to propose that talks should be held and the leaders of the regime were well aware of the effect which sanctions were having. In the talks theUnited Kingdom officials had explained that the carrying out of oursix principles involved the firm entrenchment of those provisions ofthe Constitution which would lead gradually to majority rule. Theneed for this had been emphasised by the action of the illegal regimeduring the previous week in introducing their ConstitutionalAmendment Bill. Our officials had also explained that negotiationsmust be based on a return to constitutional rule and the formation
by the Governor of a properly constituted government which wouldbe widely representative. This would probably include Mr. Smith,though not some of his colleagues, together with representatives ofmore moderate European opinion and of some Africans, though itwould probably not be possible at this stage for the leaders of thetwo main African Nationalist parties, Mr. Nkomo and the rev. Sithole, to be included. It would, however, be important thatthey should be released from detention, provided that they gave an assurance that they would pursue their political ends constitutionally.The control of the armed forces and the police would in this periodhave to be in the hands of the Governor and the acceptability of theproposed new constitution to the people of Rhodesia as a whole would probably be ascertained by a Royal Commission, whose members might be drawn mainly, or perhaps entirely, from thiscountry. It might also prove desirable to insist on the neutralisationof the area around the Kariba Dam, perhaps by a force containingtroops from other members of the Commonwealth. One of thedifficulties facing the illegal regime was that if the Royal Commissionreported that the proposed constitution was unacceptable, theposition would then revert to that obtaining before the illegaldeclaration of independence. There was however no escape fromthis dilemma. In considering the line which we should take at theMeeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers, Ministers had in discussion the preceding day taken the view that we should not seek to initiate any form of mandatory sanctions in relation to oil supplies for Rhodesia, even if they were confined to Portuguese East Africa.There were, however, arguments for the contrary view that use mightbe made of the threat of such sanctions by informing Mr. Smith thatif he would not accept a settlement on the lines which we had putforward by a given date, say 1st December of this year, then theUnited Kingdom Government would propose a mandatory resolution on such sanctions at the United Nations. Discussion at theforthcoming Meeting was likely to prove extremely difficult and inview of the danger that Zambia, and perhaps one or two othercountries, might withdraw from the Commonwealth, it might benecessary to have an urgent Cabinet meeting to review the line whichthe Government should take in the light of developments during theMeeting.After the Meeting there might be advantage in not resuming the talks at their present level, but in the Commonwealth Secretaryhimself going out to Rhodesia to see the Governor. He would ofcourse not then have any official relations with the illegal regime,but if Mr. Smith came to Government House the commonwealth secretary could see him, though without recognising his position, and could put to him a series of propositions. These might include theconstitutional proposals which he had mentioned and other possibilities such as the appointment of a constitutional committeerepresentative of other Commonwealth Governments to work out analternative acceptable constitution. Although some of these possibilities might be unacceptable to Mr. Smith, he might be themore inclined to accept the form of constitution and basis of returnto legality which we had in mind.
In discussion the view was expressed that whatever constitutionalprovision was made to entrench the vital clauses of the constitution which would lead in the course of time to majority rule, this would be ineffective in preventing a racialist government from ignoring orforcibly changing it in order to preserve government by Europeans.The only safeguard for majority rule was to insist that this should come into effect before independence was granted. We should therefore publicly declare our intention not to grant independencebefore majority rule, should continue present sanctions and shouldnot resist any move in the United Nations to make them mandatory.As part of this policy it would be reasonable that we shouldcompensate Europeans who in these circumstances did not wish toremain in Rhodesia: the cost might be high, but would in the longrun be less than the continuance of present policies.It was, however, the general view that though such a course ofaction could be logically justified it offered no prospect of success.The scope for our policies was strictly limited by what was practical.To grant independence before majority rule would undoubtedly upsetAfrican opinion, but to declare that our policy was not to grant suchindependence meant destroying any hope of a settlement of the rhodesian problem, would inevitably drive that country into the arms of South Africa and would therefore in practice be responsiblefor the indefinite postponement of the very majority rule which thepolicy sought to secure. It would however certainly be necessary toconsider with the utmost care the means by which the major clauses of the Constitution could be entrenched, including perhaps provisionfor appeal to some outside agency such as the Privy Council.There was general agreement that while different interpretationscould well be made of the effect of sanctions, these should bemaintained at their present level and wherever possible strengthened,and there was reason to hope that the period for the sale of the nexttobacco crop in March to April 1967 would result in substantially increased pressure on the regime to accept a settlement on our terms,since the sanctions which had already been applied to tobacco meant that there would then be no prospect of selling any substantial part ofthe 1967 crop unless sanctions were lifted. While it might not bepossible to maintain indefinitely international agreement to thecontinuance of sanctions there was every prospect that this could bedone at least until April 1967. We were seeking to strengthensanctions wherever possible, but we must recognise that beyond acertain point we might have to pay a heavy price to Germany andthe United States in respect of our major political interests for anyfurther support which they might give to the policy.It was also the general view that we should resist any proposalto make sanctions mandatory by a resolution under Chapter VII ofthe United Nations Charter. The application of mandatory sanctionsin respect of oil supplies for Rhodesia passing through PortugueseEast Africa might not of itself involve serious consequences for us,but it would not be effective, since increased supplies of oil would
then pass through South Africa. Any subsequent widening of mandatory sanctions in order to stop this would have the gravestconsequences for the United Kingdom economy and indeed for theposition of the United Nations and for the world-wide level ofeconomic activity.It was recognised that sanctions at their present or likelyprospective level would not be sufficient to lead to the overthrow ofthe illegal regime, but experience suggested that they might inclineMr. Smith to accept a settlement which would accord with ourprinciples. In the short run, sanctions had undoubtedly had the effectof stiffening European support for Mr. Smith in Rhodesia, but this effect might be dissipated by the knowledge that we were prepared tocontinue sanctions over a long period if necessary, and by a widerdissemination of the facts in Rhodesia, including particularly theextent to which there was already relatively substantial emigrationfrom Rhodesia to South Africa.In discussing these issues at the forthcoming Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers we should make clear the uniqueextent to which the United Kingdom had suffered economic damage from the policy of sanctions. Indeed, Zambia had in many respectsactually benefited from them and we should make it clear that thecontinuance of trade between Zambia and Rhodesia at its present level was one of the major weaknesses in the policy. Inacknowledging that an increased severance of trade between rhodesia and Zambia held dangers for the latter, we should also make clear the extent to which we had already undertaken to assist Zambia andforcibly express the view that such aid was not solely a matter forthe United Kingdom, but for the Commonwealth as a whole, andparticularly for African Commonwealth countries.In further discussion doubt was expressed on the desirability ofconveying to Mr. Smith, on any resumption of the informal talks, an ultimatum to the effect that if he did not accept our terms for asettlement by a given date we should declare that independence would not be granted before majority rule. If such an ultimatumwere ineffective and there could be no certainty that it would be we should then irrevocably have tied our hands in seeking to make use of any later opportunities which might reasonably have been expected to occur, particularly in the following spring, for obtaining a settlement on terms consistent with our principles.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thegeneral view of the Cabinet was that broadly we should maintain our present policy. At the forthcoming Meeting of commonwealth prime Ministers we should make it clear that we were pursuing thehonourable aim of a settlement based on our six principles and wouldnot be prepared to derogate from them. We would make clear our intention of continuing sanctions, if necessary for a long period, butthe general view of the Cabinet was that we should resist any attemptto introduce mandatory sanctions, even if these were limited to the transit of oil to Rhodesia through Portuguese East Africa. Weshould, however, seek to expose the weakness of voluntary sanctionsarising from the continuing level of Zambian trade with Rhodesia
and seek the agreement of the former to reduce it substantially andof other Commonwealth countries in Africa to assist her in any difficulties that ensued. The course which we should adopt in relationto the resumption of informal talks in Rhodesia would be a matter for further consideration in the light of the Meeting. The cabinet were inclined to the view that there should be no undue haste inresuming the talks, though it would be necessary to send a reassuringmessage to the Governor, whose position it was important to preserve.It was of the utmost importance that Ministers should limit their discussions on these issues with Commonwealth representatives at theMeeting and should not disclose any details of the course of the informal talks or of the constitutional proposals which we had inmind. It might well be that the course of events at this Meeting would call for a review of some aspects of the policy which had been agreed and it might be necessary to call an emergency meeting of the cabinet for that purpose.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Prices andIncomesPolicyStandstill on prices and incomes(previous reference:CC(66) 41stConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The First Secretary of State said that so far there had beenwidespread compliance with the standstill on prices and incomes, asfar as could be judged over a holiday season. Although individualrepresentations had been made by trade unions on the application ofthe standstill to increases of wages under existing commitments, therehad been no general disposition to challenge the standstill itself. the government&apos;s general economic measures made it easier for employers to resist pressure for increases in wages and salaries andthe attitude of employers had in general been favourable, although there had been some complaints about the enticement of workers from their current firms by offers of higher pay. There had beenvery few increases of dividends. Prices had been relatively stable,increases attributed to the economic regulators and the selective employment Tax (SET) tending to be offset by reductions resultingfrom seasonal changes, but there was likely to be difficulty in dealingwith some increases attributed to the SET which went beyond what could be justified on that account. Departments had received somecomplaints about price increases but none which proved, oninvestigation, to have substance. The Confederation of BritishIndustries (CBI) had urged their members strongly not to increase prices, but they had refused to recommend that price increases shouldbe notified to the Government because of the importance they attached to the voluntary operation of the standstill and the avoidance of requests for exemptions. This argument was unacceptable; itwould, however, be necessary to make administrative arrangementsCC 44 (66)      274
to deal adequately with any substantial increase in applications for exemption, and possibly the CBI itself might agree to vet them in thefirst instance.While the position was not discouraging and there was a widespread desire that the standstill should work, its continuedvoluntary operation might be threatened if unions took legal action toenforce existing commitments. If such action were taken, it would benecessary to quickly invoke the compulsory powers given by Part iv of the Prices and Incomes Act. It would, however, be necessaryto decide before long what criteria should be applied to increases of pay during the period of severe restraint that was to follow the initialsix months standstill. So far it had been suggested that increasesmight for example have to be clearly related to increases in productivity, or be limited to the lowest-paid workers, but the latter would create serious difficulty in relation to differentials. Nor wouldsuch criteria meet the needs of the public services. The criteria wouldalso have an important bearing on the Government^ long-termincomes policy following the period of severe restraint, and proposals would shortly be brought before the Ministerial Committee on prices and Incomes. It might subsequently be desirable to institute tripartitediscussion of these with the CBI and Trades Union Congress (TUC).In discussion there was general agreement that public opinionhad welcomed the standstill policy, and that unions and employershad, in general, been co-operative. The following principal points were also made:(a) More than 500 companies had declared dividends since the standstill was announced, and of these only 36 had increased theirdividends. The Treasury were seeking an explanation from these.The Treasury had also been consulted by a number of companiesover contemplated increases in dividends; in only three special caseshad the Treasury advised that increases might be made, and in every other case the Treasury advice against increases had been taken. Itwas likely that the current pressure on profits would assist therestriction on dividends.(b) While it might be possible to make arrangements with theUnited States to ease the pressure in the United Kingdom resultingfrom the world-wide trend towards higher interest rates, there was little hope of any early reduction in domestic rates.(c) Food prices had remained stable since the standstill, a fall in mid-July having been followed by an increase of three-quarters of apoint in the retail prices index in mid-August, attributable to seasonalcauses; the figures for mid-September were likely to show a fall ofone point. The brewery industry had agreed to hold beer prices andto absorb part of the cost of the SET and the bakers had been askedto hold bread prices, although there was a possibility of an increasein the price of flour. Consideration was being given with the foodindustries to the improvement of the early-warning system fornotifying increases of prices. More generally, the Board of trade had been consulted about a number of proposed increases of prices,and had agreed to increases in only two cases; they had investigateda number of complaints of increases but had not found any substance
in them, although the recent increases made by the laundry industry were being investigated. It was, however, likely that the incidence ofthe SET and the economic regulators would lead to some increases of prices in the near future.(d) While, in the Health Service, general practitioners had accepted the advice of their representatives to accept the defermentof their improvements in pay, subject to some minor easements that had been possible within the terms of the White Paper on Prices and incomes, difficulties were developing in the hospital service due tothe action of junior doctors who had reacted strongly to the standstill.The widespread threats of emigration could do great damage to the health Service if they were carried out, and the situation would be carefully watched. While the Royal Commission on medical education had been asked to consider as a long-term possibilitywhether doctors should, following training in this country, be requiredto serve here for a number of years, or in default to repay the cost oftheir training, there was no possibility of applying this in the presentsituation, although doctors would be reminded of their obligations.(e) Following the previous Cabinet discussion of the proposedprovisions of the Criminal Justice Bill in the enforcement of fines, itwas now proposed to restrict the Courts&apos; power of immediatecommittal, where an offender had the means to pay forthwith, to cases where the offence itself was punishable by imprisonment. Thisproposal would ensure that people could not be imprisoned for offences under the Prices and Incomes Act if they refused to pay thefines. However, it was unlikely that the Act would become law untilwell into 1967, and, in the intervening period, it could not be excludedthat a defaulter under the Act might be committed to prison if he hadthe means to pay but refused to do so. Nor would the new provisionapply to Scotland.(/) In general, local authorities had been co-operative in deferringrent increases.In further discussion it was pointed out that the absence ofexceptions to the standstill on incomes had contributed very largely to its acceptance by the unions. It was, therefore, important that nosuch exceptions should be allowed in the field of wage negotiationsover which the Government had control or influence. It wassuggested, however, that the uniformity of application of the standstillmight be threatened if the Association of Supervisory Staffs,Executives and Technicians (ASSET) took its threatened legal actionagainst Thorn Electrical Industries to enforce compliance with theircontract, or if the newspaper proprietors conceded certain cost-of-living increases now due under contracts of employment. The CBIwere unwilling to advise their members to break legal contracts, andit was likely that if there were any breach of the standstill it wouldnot be possible to continue it generally on a voluntary basis, so thatthe powers under Part IV of the Prices and Incomes Act would haveto be invoked to give employers protection against legal action. the cbi were seeking assurances to that effect and it would be necessary
also to consider what should be said by the Prime Minister to the tuc about the possibility of invoking these powers of compulsion.No assurance should be given at this stage to the CBI but the TUCmight be told that while the Government hoped that it would not benecessary to invoke Part IV of the Act, they had to decide on their action in the light of circumstances and that, if the voluntaryapplication of the standstill broke down and inequities and injusticesarose from breakaway action, or if intolerable legal difficulties arose,they would have reluctantly to make use of the compulsory powers given by the Act. It was suggested that, in view of the legal actioncontemplated by ASSET, no specific reference should be made tolegal difficulties. On the other hand, it was pointed out that ASSETmight be deterred from legal proceedings if there were a likelihood that the application of the compulsory powers under the Act wouldbe held directly attributable to their own action. A more obscurereference to this effect in the Prime Ministers speech, while it would still be generally understood, would be preferable. It was also suggested that the invocation of the compulsory powers might be most readily justified on the grounds of legal necessity.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the standstill on prices and incomes had, in general, operated satisfactorilywith the voluntary co-operation of unions and employers. Itscontinued acceptability depended largely on the absence of exceptions,and it would be necessary for the standstill to be applied rigidly inthe field of wage negotiations controlled or influenced by theGovernment. The Cabinet would wish to keep under review thecontinued operation of the standstill and the need to invoke Part iv of the Prices and Incomes Act. It would also be necessary to giveearly consideration to the criteria that should be applied in the periodof severe restraint following the standstill period. In view of thepossibility that compulsory powers might have to be invoked before long, the Cabinet were also agreed that, in addressing the TUC, heshould give a warning of this on the lines suggested in their discussion.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,1st September, 1966.
