ParliamentPrices and incomes PolicyPay of the armed forces and the higher civil Service(previous reference:CC(66) 2ndConclusions,Minute 3)SECRET*2. The First Secretary of Stale said that the discussions whichwere currently taking place in relation to the threatened railway strike had shown that an early announcement of the Governmenfsacceptance of the reports of the National Board for Prices and incomes (NBPI) on the pay of the Armed Forces and the higher civil Service might well embarrass the Government in their efforts to achieve a settlement. He had not reached any firm view at thepresent stage whether or not this made it desirable either for theCabinet to review their decision or for its announcement to be delayed, but it might be necessary for the question to be further considered at their meeting later in the week.In discussion it was suggested that the Governmenfs decision was already widely expected and that a delay in its announcement would not have any effect on the railway dispute. While there mightbe a case for reviewing the Cabinefs decision on the implementation of the NBPI report on the pay of the Higher Civil Service, anychange would necessitate consequential changes in the pay of senior officers in the Armed Forces. There was general agreement that,subject to this latter aspect, the report of the NBPI on the pay ofthe Armed Forces should in any event be implemented, though theannouncement of the Governmenfs decision might be deferred.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the First Secretary of State might bring beforethem at their next meeting the possible need to reconsider the Cabinefs decision in respect of the pay of the Higher Civil Service, with any consequential effectthat might be entailed in respect of the pay of senior officers in the Armed Forces.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1), invited the First Secretary ofState, in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of State for Defence, todetermine in the light of the discussion the dates of publication of the reports of the National Board for prices and Incomes on the pay of the Armed Forces andof the Higher Civil Service and of the Governmenfsdecisions on them.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.CC 3 (66)secret. The Cabinet discussed the Parliamentary arrangements forreplying to the motion of censure tabled by the Opposition for debate in the House of Commons on the following Thursday.
secret. The Prime Minister said that a statement on terms forending the rebellion and on the constitutional future of Rhodesiahad been drafted in the light of the recent discussions with Sir HughBeadle, the Chief Justice of Rhodesia. The effect of sanctions wasnot yet being felt by the man in the street in Rhodesia and Sir HughBeadle did not consider that the statement would at this stage be decisive in turning opinion against the illegal regime. It was difficultto judge the moment when the statement would have the greatestimpact in Rhodesia but there were advantages in making it now sothat it would be on the record when the effect of sanctions began to be felt.In discussion of the draft statement (the text of which, asamended, follows this minute) a number of amendments were agreed and the following main points were made:(a) Paragraph 1. In answer to questions about economic measures it could be said that further measures were underconsideration.(b) Paragraph 2. The reference to constitutional rule might betaken to mean Parliamentary rule; it was, however, pointed out thatthe phrase &quot; constitutional rule&quot; was now well established as implying the end of illegal independence.(c) Paragraph 3. It might be unwise for the United KingdomGovernment to hold discussions with the illegal regime, even on the limited subject of bringing the rebellion to an end: there would alsobe a risk in giving the Governor too wide a discretion to undertakesuch discussions. The statement should therefore be limited to &quot; TheGovernor is authorised to receive from the regime any proposals about the means by which the rebellion is to be brought to an end &quot;.(d) Paragraph 7. Reference to &quot; the widest possible spectrumof public opinion of all races in the country &quot; might be interpretedby the European minority to mean that there would be predominantAfrican representation in the interim government. It was, however,pointed out that this phrase had been accepted by Sir Hugh Beadleas being likely to commend itself to reasonable European opinion in Rhodesia, and any change might be liable to misinterpretationby him.The point was also made that the Government would be askedwhether Mr. Smith himself or other members of the illegal regimewould be acceptable as members of the interim government. It wasthe general view that this should not be absolutely excluded, althoughit seemed likely that after the overthrow of the present regimeMr. Smith would withdraw from public life in Rhodesia or evenemigrate to South Africa. In answer to questions, reference couldbe made to our intention that the interim government shouldcomprise the widest possible spectrum of public opinion of all racesin the country; it must, however, be a condition that members ofthe interim government should be committed to accept constitutionalrule and the five principles which the United Kingdom Governmenthad laid down.Rhodesia(previous reference:CC(66) 1stConclusions,Minute 1)
(e) Paragraph II. This paragraph was intended to convey a warning that elections might be deferred for a considerable time.Matters relating to the franchise would have to be determined andthis might be done by a variety of means, such as a RoyalCommission, a constitutional conference, or a referendum. It wouldbe unwise to go into detail at this stage.(/) For reasons of brevity the Governmenfs original five principles had not been repeated in the statement but they shouldbe attached as an annex when the statement was published.Financial and economic measures the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a public statement was ready for issue to the effect that, when constitutional government was restored in Rhodesia, the lawful government wouldnot be bound to accept responsibility for any obligations (includingexchange control authorisation) which the illegal regime might havepurported to incur. A further measure was also being considered bywhich the United Kingdom banks would assume the responsibilityof their branches in Rhodesia for all oversea transactions. It was,however, doubtful whether this could be made effective and it mightonly damage our banking reputation and divert business to our competitors.The First Secretary of State said that a number of furthereconomic measures should be taken. A total ban on exports to rhodesia should be imposed; but it remained to be decided whetherthis should exclude goods already paid for and ready for shipment,as the Confederation of British Industries (CBI) had requested. Theban on imports from Rhodesia should also be raised from 95 percent to 100 per cent. Subject to further discussion with the CBI,United Kingdom firms might be asked to reduce the activities oftheir Rhodesian subsidiaries. Chrome exports from Rhodesia hadalready been made illegal by Order in Council in order to assist theUnited States Government in stopping imports of chrome from rhodesia into the United States. Similar action could be taken inrespect of tobacco and the merchanting of tobacco in Rhodesia witha view to export could also be made illegal.In discussion it was suggested that to exclude goods already paid for and ready for shipment from the ban on exports to rhodesia would appear to leave open a loophole and might discourage otherGovernments from banning exports to Rhodesia. It was, however,pointed out that the amount of such goods was likely to be negligibleand that to refuse the CBFs request would unnecessarily antagoniseindustry. On balance, therefore, it was the general view that thisexclusion should be allowed.The Prime Minister&apos;, summing up the discussion, said that theimposition of further financial and economic measures might best be announced at the end of the week. These should include therepudiation of the obligations incurred by the illegal regime, the banon exports to Rhodesia and the increase in the ban on imports from
95 per cent to 100 per cent. The ban on exports should excludegoods already paid for and ready for shipment. Subject to furtherconsideration by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, action to freezethe external assets of Rhodesian branches of United Kingdomowned commercial banks might be included in the further series of measures to be imposed when trade between Zambia and Rhodesiawas cut off. Action to make illegal the export and merchanting of tobacco might best be deferred until shortly before the tobaccoauctions were due to start. Bechuanaland should continue to be exempted from these financial and economic measures.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would make thestatement on terms for ending the rebellion and on theconstitutional future of Rhodesia that afternoon.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the commonwealth secretary, to announce the imposition of further financialand economic measures at the end of the week, on thelines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing upof their discussion.Draft statement the FUTURE OF rhodesia the first aim of the British Government is to bring the rhodesian rebellion to an end as quickly as possible, without lastingdamage to the country. To this end, they will maintain and, ifnecessary, intensify economic measures with a view to a speedysettlement. But it is equally the purpose of the British Governmentto help the people of Rhodesia, without rancour or recrimination,in making a fresh start towards establishing (in the words of theLagos communique) &quot; a just society based on equality of opportunityto which all sections of the community could contribute their fullpotential and from which all could enjoy the benefits due to them without discrimination or unjust impediment&quot;.2. This fresh start must begin with an unqualified return to constitutional rule. It must also engage from the outset thecapacities of all Rhodesians of good will in the work of overcoming the fears and antagonisms of the past and of setting Rhodesia onthe road to independence in a spirit of inter-racial trust and collaboration.3. The illegal declaration of independence and the subsequentactions of the rebel regime have created a new situation. Rhodesia&apos;future course cannot be negotiated with the regime which illegallyclaims to govern the country. There is no confidence inside or outside Rhodesia that they could be relied on to lead the countryforward to an independence in which racial harmony would be
ensured. The Governor is authorised to receive from the regime any proposals about the means by which the rebellion is to be broughtto an end. But discussion of Rhodesia&apos;s constitutional future mustbe with responsible persons representing all the people.4. Rhodesia obviously cannot proceed at one step fromrebellion to independence. For all the reasons given by her majesty&apos;s Government repeatedly, inside and outside Rhodesia, andas I said at the United Nations on 16th December, 1965, &quot; a returnto constitutional rule would not and could not mean an immediateadvance to majority rule &quot;. That process must be renewed withoutdelay or impediment: but it can come only with time and timemeasured by African advancement and achievement.5. Once there has been a return to the rule of law and theconstitution, the British Government will immediately act to reverse the economic measures taken during the rebellion, in order to permit the resumption of Rhodesia&apos;s external trade, the reopening of markets for her exports, the inward flow of essential supplies such as oil andpetrol, and the renewal of investment and the planned developmentof the country. The necessary statutory instruments are ready and could be made effective immediately.6. This will be the first step in a period of economic andpolitical rehabilitation during which passions may cool, the economicand social strength of the country may be restored and the energiesof all Rhodesians may be enlisted in the tasks of reconstruction.7. Assuming that there is a speedy and peaceful return to constitutional rule, the best provision for the first stage after thisreturn would appear to be for the Governor to form an interim government of Rhodesians, responsible to him, comprising the widest possible spectrum of public opinion of all races in the countryand constituting a representative Government for reconstruction.During this period, the police and military forces will come underthe direct responsibility of the Governor.8. The first responsibility of this interim Government, as of any government, will be the maintenance of law and order. This willrequire not only the normal precautions against domestic disturbanceand illegality but also, in the special circumstances of Rhodesia,guarantees to prevent a repetition of the rebellion and to protecthuman rights. The British Parliament will need to be assured aboutthe adequacy and effectiveness of these guarantees.9. Urgent action will be needed to restore the Rhodesianeconomy. The British Government will be ready to contribute tothe economic needs of the country and in particular to assist, inco-operation with other Commonwealth Governments, with schemesfor the advancement, education and training of Africans so that theymay as soon as possible play their full part in the development ofthe country&apos;s economic and political institutions.10. Problems of political rehabilitation will also have to be tackled. Persons restricted or detained for purely political reasonswill have to be released provided that they give guarantees that their
political activities will be conducted constitutionally. The aim is tocreate conditions in which, while law and order is maintained,political activities may be conducted in security and freedom fromintimidation from any quarter.11. How long this period of interim government may lastcannot immediately be foreseen; neither can the date at whichParliamentary institutions can be restored. Clearly the period of interim government will last until conditions can be stabilised andthe social and political wounds inflicted on the country can be healed.The views of the people of Rhodesia will have to be sought on the amendments and changes necessary in the 1961 Constitution tosecure a resumption of full constitutional government on the basis ofthe five principles which have been proclaimed by successive british governments. To these must now be added a sixth principle,namely, the need to ensure that, regardless of race, there is nooppression of majority by minority or of minority by majority.12. The course of constitutional development in Rhodesiaafter this towards independence must be based on the implementation of these principles and it will be necessary in due course to considerthe means of ensuring this, for example by a Royal Commission in preparation for a Constitutional Conference, which will in any caseneed to be held before independence can be achieved.13. The British Government have maintained throughout that,while Rhodesia is a matter of world concern, it remains a british responsibility and they continue to accept their full responsibility.They intend to discharge their task in the interests of all the peopleof Rhodesia. The British Government are convinced that therecannot be lasting peace, freedom or prosperity in Rhodesia untilconstitutional rule is resumed and the country is fairly set on pathsleading to a just and democratic society in which full equality of opportunity is assured, racial discrimination is removed and the rightsof Europeans and Africans alike are safeguarded.14. Every week that passes while the rebellion continuesincreases the economic and political strains within Rhodesia andmakes the eventual task of reconstruction more difficult. It nowrests with all responsible Rhodesians who have the true welfare oftheir country at heart to bring the rebellion to an end before it is too late and to support the representative of The Queen in upholdingconstitutional law in Rhodesia.TransportPolicyUrban traffic and Transport(previous reference:CC (65) 68thConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (C (66) 10) on the handling of issues relating to problemsof urban traffic and transport, particularly in London.The Minister of Transport said that at their meeting on 7th December, at which they had discussed the proposed increases inLondon Transport fares, the Cabinet had commissioned a report by mid-January on specific measures to restrain private traffic in Londonand to raise a financial contribution from non-Exchequer sources to
secret the Aircraft 5.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the FirstIndustry Secretary of State and Secretary of State for Economic AffairsThe Committee (C (66) 14) reporting the conclusions of a Committee of Ministers onth1 A^rcraf1t^&apos; ^ immecuate actiQn to De taken by the Government on theIndustry recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry into the Aircraft(Plowden Industry (Plowden Report) on the aircraft industry.Report)SECRET7155-2 bLondon transport. It was clear that schemes for restraining privatetraffic or raising additional revenue by means of supplementarylicensing would require legislation and would take a considerable time to work out. It would be unwise to proceed with restrictivemeasures of this kind in advance of co-ordinated proposals for urbantransport, including the improvement of public transport. It would therefore be best that the Governmenfs views on traffic restraint and supplementary licensing should be presented in the context of urbantransport policy as a whole in the White Paper on transport policywhich it had been announced would be presented during the spring.In the meantime discussions with the Greater London Council were continuing on the scope for expanding and intensifying parkingcontrols in London; the Council were due to report to her next month.In discussion there was general support for the proposals bythe Minister of Transport and a particular welcome for her desire toinclude simultaneously with further restraints on private trafficpositive measures for the improvement of public transport. It had originally been envisaged that a statement would be made at the timewhen the London Transport fare increases came into operation; that had not proved possible, and it would therefore be right to includeproposals on the restraint of traffic in the presentation of aco-ordinated policy.It was also pointed out that, if further restraints were introduced on public parking in central London, they would not be designedmerely to avoid local congestion but would go further than wouldbe necessary on this score alone in order to diminish the volume oftraffic coming into London. They would undoubtedly be unpopular;and they would require an increase in the force of traffic wardens,which might have implications for their salaries.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed generally with the proposal of the Minister ofTransport to deal with measures of traffic restraint and supplementarylicensing in the context of a policy for urban transport as a whole.The Cabinet-CD Took note of C (66) 10.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to circulate a draft white paper on transport policy for consideration in due course.
The First Secretary of State said that the Committee ofMinisters under his chairmanship had agreed that the Governmentshould accept the basic analysis of the future of the aircraft industryin the Plowden Report, and that they should promote a merger ofthe airframe interests of the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) andHawker-Siddeley Limited (HS), with a Government shareholding inthe new company. The precise nature and terms of theGovernments participation should be left for settlement in negotiations with the existing companies. An announcement onthese lines, which should avoid committing the Government ondetails, and particularly on the question of the Governments holding in the proposed new airframe company, could be made by theMinister of Aviation in a debate on the aviation industry early inFebruary.The Minister of Aviation said that it would also be necessary toaccept in general terms the Plowden Committee&apos;s forecast of acontraction in the size of the aircraft industry from 250,000 to 200,000employees or less by 1970. The question whether the guided weapons interests of the two firms should be merged would need tobe further considered. Negotiations with the companies, andparticularly with BAC, would not be easy; there were some in theaircraft industry who would prefer to sell all their interests ratherthan participate in a joint company with a Government holding.In discussion the following points were made:(a) If the Cabinet accepted the Committee&apos;s recommendation to seek a negotiated agreement, the decision on the size of theGovernments shareholding would turn mainly on what could beagreed with the companies. It would none the less be desirable tohave a preliminary indication of the Cabinets view of what the aim should be. It was suggested that no decision should be taken on this issue until the size, shape, location and management of the reorganised industry had been settled. Whatever arrangements weremade, it was important that the Government should be able todetermine the major decisions on these factors. This might be thought to require at least a majority shareholding. On the other hand there might be a danger that 100 per cent public ownership would weaken the competitiveness of the new company in international markets,and would create difficult pressures upon the Government in viewof the need for the industry to contract. A 70 or 80 per centshareholding would enable existing private interests to withdrawmost of their money from the industry, and leave them with too smalla stake in the new concern. These considerations might indicate thedesirability of a 51 per cent holding, but this might be the most difficult of all to negotiate. It might well be possible to meet theGovernments objectives in terms of influence on the policy of thecompany with a minority holding of, say, 30 to 40 per cent, providedthat the majority shareholding was not concentrated in a few handsbut was widely spread.(b) In the tactical handling of the negotiations the majorconsideration would be to ensure that the management of the new company was in the right hands.  Past experience suggested that it
b 2would be important that the HS management rather than the BACmanagement should be in charge of the new company; this would indicate the need to ensure that the terms of the merger and ofGovernment participation were acceptable to HS. It might be easier to handle BAC if negotiations were not pressed forward with too great urgency, in view of their financial position and prospects; onthe other hand undue delay, after the period of uncertainty that hadalready elapsed, could lead to a further deterioration of morale inthe industry and damage its prospects of ultimate viability on thebasis of the Plowden Committee&apos;s recommendations. In any event,there should be no delay in the further discussions which would be needed to establish Ministerial agreement on the detailed points thatremained to be settled.(c) It would be helpful if, in his speech on the plowden committee&apos;s recommendations, the Minister of Aviation couldwelcome and endorse the proposals for international co-operation, inthe first place between the United Kingdom and Europe andsubsequently between the combined European interests and UnitedStates industry, and the proposal for a conference of Europeanaviation Ministers. On the other hand it might be advisable at thisstage not to endorse the recommendation that the most sophisticatedtypes of aircraft should be acquired from the United States; this might appear prematurely to rule out the possibility that aircraft ofthis type could be designed and built by a combined Anglo-Europeaneffort.(d) Further consideration would need to be given to theimmediate problem of the future of Shorts, and in particular to what could be said about the prospects for the Belfast aircraft.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet in general endorsed the line proposed in the memorandumby the First Secretary of State on immediate Government action inthe light of the Plowden Committee&apos;s recommendations on theaircraft industry. There should be further discussions between theMinisters concerned on the points that would arise in subsequentnegotiation with BAC and HS. The Cabinet agreed that theMinister of Aviation should make a statement on the lines proposed,including the specific references to international co-operationsuggested in discussion. There should be further discussion betweenthe First Secretary of State, the Secretary of State for Defence andthe Minister of Aviation on handling the immediate problems inconnection with Shorts.The Cabinet  \ \(1) Approved the proposals for Governmental action on the plowden Report set out in the memorandum by the first secretary of State (C (66) 14).(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation to announce in a debate on the aviation industry in the House of Commons early
in February the Governments attitude to the recom-mendations of the Plowden Report on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister, including the specific references to international co-operation.(3) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for theCommittee of Ministers which had considered therecommendations of the Plowden Report to give furtherconsideration to the issues which would arise in negotiations on the implementation of these decisions.(4) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Defence and the Minister of aviation, to give further consideration to problems arising in connection with Shorts.secret the Aircraft 6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C (66) 9) by theIndustry        Minister of Aviation on a hardship claim by the British aircraft corporation (BAC) following the cancellation of the TSR 2.British Aircraft       The Minister of Aviation said that the Governments decisionHardshfi0n: the Previous year to cancel the TSR2 had robbed BAC of thePayments basic work and profit on which its future plans had been based. Ithad always been recognised that a heavy hardship claim would bemade by the contractors and at the time of cancellation this had beenput at the notional figure of  20 million. The effect of cancellationon the work of the Corporation as a whole was such as to affectadversely the sales prospect of the BAC 1-11 and in consequence theCorporation had submitted a claim for financial assistance on a large scale. This included a claim for  8 - 5 million under the &quot; hardship &quot;provision of the Break Clause of the TSR 2 contracts, a request fora payment of  19 - 25 million in respect of the cost of the developmentof BAC 1-11, any payment under this head to be reduced by theamount paid in respect of the TSR 2 Break Clause, and finally a claim for  9-452 million for overheads unrecoverable as a result ofthe cancellation of the TSR 2. The last claim could be negotiated inaccordance with normal contractual practice and it seemed probablethat only a much smaller sum would prove to be admissible. Thefirst claim for a &quot; hardship &quot; payment must not be confused with normal cancellation charges: nor could it be considered in isolationfrom the claim in respect of the cost of development of the BAC 1-11.The Ministry of Aviation&apos;s Director of Accounting Services hadinvestigated the finances of the Corporation: his report revealed thatthese were precarious and assessed the sum required to enable BACto carry on successfully at a minimum of  12 million. While theGovernment could not contemplate a payment designed primarily to compensate the Corporation for the frustration of their expectation of profit, their survival was nevertheless important, since they were responsible for the United Kingdom share of the Concord airframedevelopment and of the two Anglo-French military aircraft projects.In the light of these considerations it would be reasonable tomake a substantial payment to the Corporation assessed in relationto the development of the BAC 1-11.    When the Corporation
developed the first version of the BAC 1-11 they had applied for, and received, the 50 per cent aid which the Governmenfs present policyallowed them to contribute towards promising civil aircraft. Whenthe Corporation, in 1963, decided to proceed with the second version of the aircraft it was open to them to apply for similar assistance and,had they done so, it would probably have been granted. TheCorporation had preferred, however, to finance this versionthemselves, partly in expectation that their profits on the TSR2would provide a financial margin against any setbacks. It would therefore be reasonable for the Government now to pay theCorporation a further sum to bring the Governmenfs contributionup to 50 per cent of the agreed costs of the BAC 1-11 project to date and of the estimated forward cost. If these were confirmed as 36 million, the Governmenfs additional payment would be a further 8-25 million.A total rejection of the Corporation^ claim in respect of theTSR2 would make voluntary negotiations between them and theGovernment on the basis of the recommendations of the Committeeof Inquiry into the Aircraft Industry (the Plowden Committee)impossible and might even result in the production of the BAC 1-11coming to an end. In any event, action which would seriously prejudice the financial viability of the Corporation would doirreparable damage to the three current Anglo-French co-operativeaircraft projects, to our export standing in respect of aircraftgenerally and to the prospect of co-operation with the corporation in pursuance of the Plowden Committee&apos;s recommendations. Inthese circumstances, it would be desirable to offer the Corporationa payment of  8-25 million on account of further assistance to the bac 1-11, on condition that this was regarded as meeting also any&quot; hardship &quot; claim related to the TSR 2, whether under the BreakClause or in respect of overheads not otherwise recoverable. Sucha payment would not invalidate the calculations which were before ministers at the time the TSR 2 was cancelled, nor erode the savings which were then forecast.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the provision whichhad been made for  20 million for &quot; hardship &quot; payments at the timeof the cancellation of the TSR 2 had no basis apart from being themaximum estimate of what might be claimed. BAC had been paidall that was due to them under their contract and no claim in respectof frustrated profits was admissible. Nor had BAC any moral rights in respect of the governmental contribution of 50 per cent towardsthe cost of developing the second version of the BAC 1-11 whichthey had failed to claim at the time, since they then expected to makea profit on this version: no claim for assistance had been made since this would have involved an equivalent Government share in theprofits. However, in view of the effect of the financial position ofBAC on co-operation with the French in the production of aircraft and on our exports of aircraft it would be reasonable to offer BACa loan of sufficient working capital to meet their requirements, with interest at Bank Rate and repayable from 1967 onwards as BAC
effected their delivery of the BAC 1-11 to meet the current UnitedStates order.Discussion showed general agreement with the proposal putforward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the claims submitted by the British aircraft corporation for financial assistance should be rejected,save to the extent that any part of these claims proved tobe admissible in accordance with normal contractualpractice.(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to negotiate an agreementwith the Corporation for the provision by the Govern-ment of working capital on the basis proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer.PublicExpenditure1966-67OverseasInformationServices(previous reference:CC(66) 2ndConclusions,Minute 4)SECRET7. The Cabinet had before them a note (C (66) 18) by the chief secretary, Treasury, to which was annexed a report by officialsshowing what cuts would be needed to reduce the overseas information estimates for 1966-67 from  3T6 million to 30-6 million.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the report by officials had inevitably been prepared in great haste and he would not wishto be committed to it in detail. Broadly, it showed the means bywhich the draft estimates had already been reduced by a sum of 1 million and the alternative means by which a further similarreduction could be made. This could be either by the suspension ofall work on the Middle East Relay Stations in 1966-67, coupled withthe deferment of certain operations and new services by the british broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and a reduction of  180,000 inprovision for the British Information Services (BIS) or, if no further reduction were made in the estimate for the BBC External Services,a reduction of a further  650,000 in the provision for the british council and the BIS.The Foreign Secretary said that the increase in the draftestimates had been due to the need to rebuild the Middle East RelayStation, and to make provision for the Montreal Exhibition, thedecision on which could not now be reversed, and to rising salarycosts outside departmental control. These three aspects involvedincreased expenditure of  3^ million. In previous discussion it hadbeen agreed to reduce the draft estimates of  32-6 million to 31-6 million. A further cut of  1 million would do serious damage to our work on overseas information, which was closely linked with trade promotion. Indeed, the work of the British Council, whichwas our chief instrument for promoting a knowledge of Englishabroad, had to that extent also a direct relation with trade promotion.Furthermore, the British Council was an invaluable instrument for
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,25th January, 1966.the propagation of Government information in those countries where our Embassies were prevented from disseminating it. It wastherefore important to our work overseas as a whole that provision should be made for expenditure of  31-6 million.In discussion there was general agreement that no reductions which might prejudice our trade promotion should be made in theprovision for overseas information work. It was suggested that itmight be practicable to make a smaller reduction than  1 million which would not affect services specifically related to tradepromotion. It was, however, the general view that further partialreductions might damage the efficiency of our overseas information work as a whole and that provision in the estimates should thereforebe made at the higher total.The Cabinet Agreed that provision should be made in the 1966-67estimates for expenditure of  31-6 million on overseas information services.
