Secretariat:Sir Burke trend . P. rogers mr. W. A. nield mr. D. S. laskey mr. R. T. ArmstrongSubjectThe Economic Situation
The EconomicSituation(previous reference:CC (66) 37thConclusions)CC 38 (66)secret the Cabinet resumed their discussion of Notes by the Secretaryof the Cabinet (C (66) 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114and 115) on the economic situation.The Prime Minister suggested that the Cabinet should now proceed to take decisions on the detailed measures to be included inthe statement which he would be making later in the day.Prices and incomes standstill (C (66) 114)In discussion the following points were made:(a) It was suggested that the statement should propose acomplete standstill on increases of prices and incomes for six months,followed by a further six months of severe restraint. The standstillwould rely largely on the voluntary co-operation of those concerned,although there would be some lengthening of the periods of standstillprescribed in the Prices and Incomes Bill.(b) It was for consideration whether the statement should indicate that pay increases justified by improvements of productivity,or pay increases for workers whose earnings were substantially belowthe national average, were not ruled out. It was argued, however,that exceptions of this kind would weaken the effectiveness andcredibility of the standstill and would tend to have the effect that the standstill penalised the public services (where it could be rigidlyenforced) more stringently than the private sector. This would be contrary to the pledges which the Government had given.Exceptions for proved improvements of productivity might alsowork inequitably in the private sector, since improvements in the productivity of those directly engaged on a manufacturing processand paid by results (who would benefit) could also create additional work for those not directly engaged on the process and paid on timerates (who would not necessarily benefit). It would be preferable,therefore, that agreements for wage increases based on improvements in productivity should not come into operation until the end of the standstill period.(c) It was proposed that the statement should indicate thatthere should be a standstill on wage increases, including existing commitments, for six months from the date upon which they were due to come into effect. This, however, might bear hardly upongroups for which increases had already been agreed to come intoeffect at some future date, since they would have to wait for sixmonths from that date, not for six months from the beginning of the standstill. On the other hand other groups due to receive increasesretrospectively would be aggrieved if they were now asked to wait until the end of the standstill period before receiving their increases.It was suggested that there would be a series of difficult cases of thiskind and that the statement should therefore leave some room fordealing with individual cases in negotiation and should not purportto pronounce a final and indiscriminate decision. The way in whichthe policy was executed would have to depend partly upon the degree
of co-operation on the part of management and unions. It wasagreed that the statement should merely indicate that the standstillwould be for a period of six months and should not specify whetherthe six months ran for all concerned from the date on which the standstill was introduced or for each group from the date upon which individual increases were due: this would be for negotiation betweenthe Ministers concerned and the leaders of both sides of industry.(d) There would be other difficult problems on which negotiations would have to take place. For instance, the standstillshould, strictly speaking, apply to increases under sliding scalecost-of-living agreements; but, if it were enforced in relation to increases of this kind, there would be a danger of losing theco-operation of unions who had hitherto accepted the prices and incomes policy.(e) It was proposed that the statement should include anexhortation to companies to stabilise their dividends. It was agreedthat the invitation should be to hold down, rather than merely to stabilise, dividends and that it was for consideration whether itshould be couched in the terms of a requirement, even though it wasnot proposed to seek a statutory sanction for the limitation.Dividends were in any case expected on average to be lower than last year.(/) It might be desirable that the statement should include an indication that employers would be expected not to increase the remuneration of directors or fees of various kinds. It would benecessary to be ready to use the powers of the Prices and incomes bill to reinforce an indication of this kind. The proposed newCompanies Bill would require more extensive disclosure of directors&apos;remuneration; and companies should be asked to behave inaccordance with the provisions of the Bill pending its entry into force.(g) It was likely that the National Board for Prices and Incomeswould need to be strengthened; it might be necessary to rely moreextensively on part-time appointments to the Board to deal with alarge volume of cases.(h) In discussion of the Parliamentary timetable for the prices and Incomes Bill it was suggested that it might be desirable that all stages of the Bill should be completed, at least in the House ofCommons, before Parliament adjourned for the summer Recess. Onthe other hand the effectiveness of the standstill and of the Bill didnot depend upon the Bill&apos;s receiving the Royal Assent earlier ratherthan later. It was agreed that the Committee Stage of the Bill shouldbe taken upstairs, not on the floor of the House and that every effort should be made to achieve as much progress as possible before the recess. Final decisions on the timetable, however, would have to betaken in the light of the reaction to the Prime Ministers statement that afternoon.(/) The Trades Union Congress and the Confederation of BritishIndustries should be informed about the proposal for a standstill, ifpossible shortly before the statement was made in the House ofCommons.
Government expenditure overseas (C (66) 107)The Foreign Secretary said that the memorandum by officials(C (66) 107) listed the main categories of Government expenditure overseas. Some of these, such as pensions, could not be reduced.It should be possible, however, by accelerating the redeploymentdecided in the Defence Review, to achieve gross savings of  46 million a year in the foreign exchange expenditure on our forces outside europe. If we secured an increased contribution from Hong Kongthe total might amount to  50 million. Against this, however, mustbe set some additional payments and terminal charges arising from an acceleration of the programme; and it would therefore be imprudentto count on a net saving of more than  40 million in 1967-68 ascompared with 1966-67. As regards expenditure on our forces inGermany the Chancellor of the Exchequer would be discussing the issues involved with the Federal Government later in the week in Bonn.It was essential that any proposal to withdraw our forces should be inthe context of the procedures prescribed by the North Atlantic treaty organisation (NATO) and Western European Union (WEU), which required us to secure the agreement of a majority of our allies inWEU. If we withdrew forces unilaterally, it must be expected thatthe Federal German Government would exercise the right to reduce their offset payments, the agreement governing these being due to expire next year. As a result we might achieve no net saving inforeign exchange unless we withdrew from NATO altogether. Theconsequences of any major withdrawal of forces from Germany(/&apos;) It was suggested that the appeal for a standstill on prices and incomes would be reinforced if Ministers voluntarily undertook to forgo part of their salaries. There was a considerable measure of support for such a gesture, provided that it was not made the basis for an appeal for reductions in wages and salaries elsewhere in thepublic services or in the private sector. On the other hand a voluntarygesture of this kind would not necessarily carry conviction; and theproposed increase in surtax would be a more effective demonstration of the Governments determination to ensure that sacrifices shouldbe made by those who could bear them. The proposal for a voluntaryreduction of Ministerial salaries need not, therefore, be pursued.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat there was general agreement that his statement should includeproposals for a prices and incomes standstill on the lines which had now emerged. In preparing his statement he would take into account the points made in discussion.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Government should call for a standstill for six months on increases of prices and incomes of everydescription and for a further period of six months of severe restraint thereafter, on the lines and subject to thepoints agreed in discussion.
would be serious not only for Anglo/German relations but also forour relations with our other NATO allies, on whom we dependedfor support both in our European policy and for the maintenance of sterling. It should be possible, however, by a combination of somewithdrawal of forces and some increase in German payments, tomeet an additional  20 million of our foreign exchange costs inGermany.The memorandum proposed annual savings of  5 million in military aid and of  1 million in the cost of our diplomatic representation and information services overseas. It also set out the implications of securing annual savings of either  10 million or 20 million in our programmes of economic aid. Such savings would be difficult to achieve; but, even at the higher level, they would represent only about one-tenth of the aid programme, compared tothe defence economies proposed, which represented about one-sixthof oversea defence expenditure. On this basis the total savings would still fall short of the target figure of  100 million; but, even so,they would cause considerable political difficulties. The defence programme would then include no allowance for contingencies; and larger reductions could not be made without a radical and irrevocablechange in our foreign and defence policies in the Middle East and far East.The Secretary of State for Defence said that the figure of 46 million should be reduced by  3 million, since we should have tomaintain the stockpile in Cyprus in order to fulfil our commitment to Libya until longer-range transport aircraft came into service in1968. The accelerated redeployment of our forces, in addition to thepolitical difficulties mentioned by the Foreign Secretary, could have serious effects on Service morale and recruitment. The total savingsenvisaged should however be capable of achievement, although thefigures suggested for individual theatres might be subject to somevariation in practice. The proposals assumed that Indonesianconfrontation against Malaysia would be ended by 1st January, 1967,at latest. This might not be an unreasonable assumption; but theBangkok Agreement had not yet been ratified and the outcome ofthe struggle for power between President Sukarno and the more moderate faction within the Indonesian Government was not yetcertain. It was therefore important that we should not annouce our intention to withdraw forces from the Far East regardless of an effective termination of confrontation, since this would strengthenPresident Sukarno&apos;s hand in opposing ratification of the BangkokAgreement. The redeployment of our forces would presentformidable physical problems, involving the movement of thousands of men and of large quantities of stores. It could not therefore in anycase be complete by 1st April, 1967; and it would be some time after that date before the full rate of saving could be achieved.His recent visit to Hong Kong had convinced him that we could resonably ask for a larger contribution than had been envisaged inthe Defence Review. The national income of Hong Kong was 550 million a year and was increasing at an annual rate of 6 or 7 per
cent. The total expenditure of the Colony^ Government was 110 million a year; and it should not be impossible for them tomake a defence contribution of  10 million. This would involve anincrease of  8^ million over their existing contribution of  l-  million.It would also be reasonable to look to Libya and Brunei to pay thecost of any British forces stationed there, since both States enjoyedlarge and increasing oil revenues. This might produce a furthersaving of about  5 million. On this basis the total of defence savings,if additional payments and terminal charges were excluded, would amount to about  55 million. It would be reasonable  hat a proportion of the total savings required should be obtained from the aid programmes, since defence changes were irreversible whereasreductions in aid could more easily be restored when resourcespermitted.defence in discussion it was suggested that it would be unreasonable to expect a contribution from Hong Kong which would be twice as large as that envisaged in the Defence Review; this would meanincreasing local taxation by 11 per cent. It was nevertheless thegeneral view that, given the economic situation, we should bejustified in pressing for a total contribution of  10 million if we wereto keep our forces, all of which should in fact be counted as internal security forces, at their present level in Hong Kong.Economic and the  Minister of Overseas Development said that a reduction of 10 million in our programmes of economic aid could with difficultybe secured. But it would leave no provision for contingencies; andthe aid programmes did not allow for rising prices. For both these reasons the reduction would involve a significant curtailment ofexisting and planned aid programmes. The gap between the developed and developing countries was increasing; and we were under greater pressure to increase our aid contribution. It had been expected that in the immediate future and, in particular, during thenext financial year there would be a substantial increase in the aidprogrammes, although subsequently they might level off. account should also be taken of the effect on industry in the United Kingdom,since a large proportion of our aid was tied to United kingdom exports. The memorandum set out the difficulties involved inany reduction; and a reduction of  20 million would havedisproportionately more serious consequences. The fact that it might subsequently be possible to restore the reductions in the aid programme would not necessarily mitigate the damage that would bedone meanwhile.In discussion it was pointed out that there was inevitably adiscrepancy between the total aid programme each year and theamount actually spent. If, as was suggested, actual disbursements in1966-67 were likely to be $180 million, the estimated disbursements
of  215 million in 1967-68, even allowing for a cut in the programmeof  10 million, would still show an increase in expenditure. It should therefore be possible to achieve a further saving of  10 million byslowing down the programme to some extent and thus increasing the&quot; estimating adjustment&quot;.GermanyIt was agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should inform the Federal German Government, during his visit to Bonnon the following day, that, if they could not make an additional contribution to cover the whole of the foreign exchange costs of our forces in Germany in 1967-68, we should have to propose, throughthe prescribed NATO and WEU procedure, that substantial numbersof troops should be withdrawn. This should also be made clear inthe Prime Minister^ Parliamentary statement that afternoon. Itwas for consideration, however, whether the statement should include any figure for the additional contribution which we hoped to obtain from the Federal Government. If a figure were given, it couldobviously not be less than the amount of  50 million for which theChancellor of the Exchequer would be asking. On the other hand the Federal Government might not agree to contribute the full amount; and, if we had committed ourselves publicly, we should then have to implement the threat to withdraw forces. In that event the Federal Government might then refuse to renew the currentOffset Agreement under which we obtained some  40 million a year;and we should then be left with no alternative, if we wished to eliminate the foreign exchange costs involved, but to withdrawvirtually the whole of our forces from Germany. There was also a danger that, if we exerted too much pressure under the NATO andWEU procedures, we might precipitate an overall review of militarycosts in Europe, in which we should be required to count  40 millionIspent by the United States and Canadian forces in the UnitedKingdom against the cost of our forces in Germany. In spite of these risk, however, public opinion would not accept that we shouldcontinue to make a large contribution across the exchanges to theFederal German Government in respect of our troops in Germany;but tactically it would be wiser not to commit ourselves in public atthis stage by mentioning in the Prime Ministers parliamentary statement the figure of  50 million as the Federal contribution whichwas our ideal objective.In discussion the view was expressed that the implications of withdrawing forces from Germany to the United Kingdom would need further study before final decisions could be reached. If theforces were not to be disbanded, the provision of additional accommodation would throw a heavy additional burden on theconstruction industry; and the budgetary cost of maintaining themin the United Kingdom might well be higher than the saving inforeign exchange obtained by withdrawing them from Germany.In further discussion it was generally agreed that the PrimeMinisters statement should contain only a total figure for the savings
CC 38 (66)to be obtained from Government overseas expenditure. This figurecould not be less than  100 million if sufficient impact were to bemade on the balance of payments deficit and on confidence, and ifthe internal measures of economy to be announced in the statement were to be accepted by public opinion as tolerable. The savingsalready agreed in discussion, provided that they were secured, would contribute about  80 million towards the objective of  100 millioh;and an additional contribution of  20 million from the federal german Republic would suffice to meet the balance. On the otherhand, it would be unwise to mention a figure above  100 million inthe Prime Ministers statement, since this might be interpreted as implying that we intended to enforce defence reductions going beyond those envisaged in the Defence Review and this would be liable to undermine confidence in the territories concerned and amongst our allies.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the figure of  55 million for defence reductions was agreed onthe basis indicated in the discussion. The precise way in which thissaving should be secured would require to be worked out in detail,on the understanding that there would have to be some flexibility asbetween the economies attributed to individual theatres in the officialmemorandum. The Defence and Oversea Policy Committee would discuss the problem of Hong Kong; but it was agreed in principle thatwe should seek an increased contribution from the Hong KongGovernment above that proposed in the Defence Review. savings of  5 million in military aid and  1 million in the cost of ourdiplomatic representation and overseas information services were also agreed. As regards economic aid it was agreed that there shouldbe a reduction of  10 million on the lines proposed in the officialmemorandum; but a further  10 million should also be obtained byslowing down the programmes and thus decreasing actualdisbursements during 1967-68. On this basis he would indicate inhis Parliamentary statement that the Government had &quot; decided onfirm programmes which will reduce Government expenditure overseas, military and civil, by at least  100 million &quot;. The statement would also make it clear that a substantial withdrawal of forces fromthe Far East would take place once it was clear that confrontationwas ended. But it would not include any itemisation of the total figure which would indicate the proportion as between military and civil savings or the economies to be obtained in individual areas,whether Germany or elsewhere.The Cabinet -(2) Agreed that Government expenditure overseas should bereduced by at least  100 million, on the lines agreed in discussion.Exchange control measures (C (66) 113)The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had considered whether a travel allowance could be introduced for travel within the
sterling area. Such a measure could not be made effective unless ageneral exchange control was introduced upon current transactionswithin the sterling area; and this was neither practicable nordesirable. It would be possible to exclude certain countries fromthe scheduled territories for the purposes of the Exchange Control Act,in order to make it possible to impose a travel allowance for travel to those countries; but there would be considerable political andadministrative difficulties about that. In his view, for the purposesof the present measures the travel allowance could be introducedonly for travel outside the sterling area.In discussion it was argued that the allowance should be fixed at  60; but it was pointed out that average expenditure on tourismwas about  45 a head (excluding fares). The Cabinet agreed,therefore, that the allowance should be fixed at  50 for 12 months from 1st November, 1966, for travel outside the sterling area and approved the transitional arrangements and consequential changesset out in C (66) 113. They also endorsed the changes proposed inrespect of emigrants&apos; remittances.The regulator (C (66) 108)In discussion it was suggested that the imposition of the regulatoron the tobacco duty would help to reduce expenditure on imports.On the other hand there was some danger that tobacco had reachedthe limit of taxable capacity; and an increase of 10 per cent in thetobacco duty would increase the retail index price by nearly a wholepoint.The Cabinet agreed that the regulator should be introduced at10 per cent on spirits, beer and wine duties, on hydro-carbon oilduties and on purchase tax, but not on tobacco and betting and on other minor duties.The Cabinet also agreed that there should be a rebate of theincrease in the hydro-carbon oil duty for public passenger transportoperators.Building control (C (66) 106)The Cabinet agreed that the limit for the purpose of the buildinglicensing control should be reduced from  100,000 to  50,000. It was desirable that the Prime Ministers statement should emphasise thatbuilding control did not apply in development areas. An orderreducing the limit should be introduced immediately the building control Bill received the Royal Assent.Office control (C (66) 110)The Cabinet agreed that the control of office building should beextended to the East and West Midlands Regions and to the rest ofthe South-East Region of England.Hire-purchase (C (66) 111)It was argued that, since the regulator would increase thepurchase tax on motor cars, an increase in the minimum down-payment on cars to 50 per cent would be likely seriously to prejudiceoutput and employment in the motor industry.
The Cabinet agreed that hire-purchase restrictions should beintroduced at the levels proposed in the second paragraph of thememorandum before them.Public sector investment (C (66) 109)In discussion the following points were made:(a) The Minister of Power said that reductions in the investment programmes of the electricity and gas supply industries would be liable to increase the risk of industrial dislocation in the winter of1967-68. It would be little short of disastrous to defer a start on theHinckley B nuclear power station. But it should be possible toreduce the investment programme of the Electricity Council in1967-68 by  20 million and the programmes of the National coal board and Gas Council by  10 million in each case in 1967-68.(b) The Postmaster-General said that reductions in hisprogramme would have to fall upon telecommunications investment.A reduction of  20 million in 1967-68 would be intolerably severe.A reduction of  13 million should be practicable, although this was likely to increase waiting lists for telephones to 250,000. It would help to reduce the effect on waiting lists if demand were restrained by requiring a year&apos;s rental to be paid in advance of installation of a telephone.(c) The Secretary of State for Scotland said that it should bepossible to reduce the investment programmes of the ScottishElectricity Boards in 1967-68 by  4 million.(d) The Minister of A aviation said that the investment programmeof the British Airports Authority, British European Airways (BEA)and British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) could be reducedby  5 million in 1967-68. The investment programme for BEA for1967-68 included  20 million for re-equipment, on the assumptionthat they re-equipped with United Kingdom aircraft. If theyre-equipped with United States aircraft, no expenditure in 1967-68would arise. If Ministers were to decide that BEA should re-equipwith United Kingdom aircraft and no provision were made in the1967-68 programme, re-equipment would be deferred and BEAearnings of foreign currency would be likely to suffer. It would bepossible, however, to save  5 million if re-equipment for internalroutes only were deferred, though at some loss of efficiency.(e) The Minister of Transport said that the investment programme of the British Railways Board might be reduced by 10 million in 1967-68 provided that this economy was not necessarilyachieved at the expense of the specific projects referred to in thememorandum before the Cabinet. The London Transport Board&apos;sinvestment programme might be reduced by  2 million in 1967-68.The investment programme of the Transport Holding Company(THC) could be reduced by  2 million in 1967-68, by deferring fleetreplacements and other measures; but it was not realistic to stipulate that the THC should be allowed to make no new acquisitions.
Investment expenditure on docks (including non-nationalised docksas well as the British Transport Docks Board) might be reduced by 10 million in 1967-68; but, if so, this would include a decision notto proceed with the Portbury project, which it was proposed to announce in the forthcoming Transport Policy White Paper.(/) The Minister of Technology indicated that some reduction could be made in the civil research and development programme ofthe Atomic Energy Authority, although it was not possible at thisstage to indicate a precise figure. It was suggested that a sum of 2 million might be achieved in this field.(g) The Minister of Housing and Local Government said thatthe proposals in the note before the Cabinet for reducing investment by local authorities on swimming baths, offices and town centreredevelopment should be capable of being realised. The reductionof expenditure on offices could be related to the desirability of avoiding new development while the structure of local governmentwas under consideration by the Royal Commission. Water and sewerage programmes, however, were related to housebuilding andit would be difficult to achieve a reduction of as much as the 11 million proposed. On the first three items, together with water and sewerage programmes, a reduction of  28 million might besecured in 1967-68.(h) The Minister of Transport said that it should be possible tosecure a reduction of  12 million in expenditure on the roads programme in 1967-68, although this would mean the postponement of some  60 million worth of work. The Secretaries of State forScotland and Wales agreed that the Scottish and Welsh roadprogrammes should be reduced by a total of  2 million together in1967-68.(/) The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that itshould be possible to save  5 million in 1967-68 by postponing the move of Covent Garden Market. It would be preferable not to defermaking schemes on farm structure under the Agriculture Bill; butin the light of the slowing down of the programme a reduction of 1 million in 1967-68 could be accepted without damage to thescheme.if) The Minister of Public Building and Works said that, sincethe note before the Cabinet had been prepared, it had emerged thatan additional  750,000 would be needed in 1967-68 for starting new government training centres. Nevertheless, it should be possible tosecure a reduction of  1^ million in his Departmental programme for 1967-68.ik) The Minister of Health accepted a reduction of  3 million in investment on local health and welfare in 1967-68, notwithstanding the fact that the largest share of this would be secured at the expenseof old peoples&apos; homes.(/) The Home Secretary said that it should be possible to secure areduction of  1^ million in Home Office investment programmes for

It might be thought preferable to makereductions in current expenditure within the education service,perhaps by increasing the charges for school meals and milk. It waspointed out, however, that the current public expenditure programme would be further considered by the Public Expenditure Committee;and an increase at this time in the charges for school meals and milkwould be difficult to reconcile with the proposed standstill on prices and incomes. The Cabinet agreed that there should be no reductionin the investment programme for higher and further education in1967-68.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet had now approved reductions in programmes for1967-68 totalling  150 million as follows:
In his statement he would indicate that nationalised industriesinvestment programmes were to be reduced by  95 million in 1967-68and Central and Local Government investment programmes by 55 million in 1967-68, and that these reductions would begin to have some effect in the present financial year.Postal charges the Cabinet agreed that the Prime Minister should include inhis statement an announcement of the proposed increases in postal charges which the Cabinet had already approved, and that thePostmaster-General should make an announcement at a rather later date about the proposed changes in the status and organisation ofthe Post Office, which had also been approved by the Cabinet.SurtaxThe Cabinet agreed that a surcharge of 10 per cent should be imposed upon surtax payments for the tax year 1965-66. legislation for this proposal would be included in next year&apos;s Finance Bill.Public expenditure the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at their meeting on18th July, the Public Expenditure Committee and the departmental ministers who had been invited to attend the meeting had accepted that the increase in the public expenditure programme in 1967-68as compared with 1966-67 would have to be kept within a considerably lower figure than the 10-9 per cent which would result from the basic and additional programmes as they stood. If theincrease were limited to 5 per cent, programmes for 1967-68 wouldhave to be reduced by  726 million; if the increase were limited to4  per cent, the reduction would be  819 million. It was forconsideration whether the Prime Minister should indicate in his1statement that the current estimates of public expenditure programmes for 1967-68 would be reduced by  726 million or 819 million.In discussion it was suggested that an alternative might be forthe Prime Minister to say that the increase in public expenditure from 1966-67 to 1967-68 would be limited to 4  per cent. on balance, however, the Cabinet agreed that there should be no reference to the public expenditure programmes for 1967-68 in thestatement. But the Chancellor of the Exchequer might let it be known that the estimates for 1967-68 would be sharply scrutinisedand reduced, without giving any figures in absolute or percentage terms.Liner trainsThe Cabinet agreed that any reference in the statement to linertrains would have to be carefully worded if it were not to have an adverse effect upon negotiations on the opening of liner trainterminals to private road hauliers. The Prime Minister might say,however, that the Government had indicated their determination
that the liner train programme should proceed on the basis of openterminals and, if questioned further, that negotiations to this endwere in hand.*Import controls (C (66) 115)The Prime Minister said that it was for consideration whetherthe statement on the economic situation, which he proposed to makein the House of Commons that afternoon, should include an indication that we should wish to discuss with our partners in theEuropean Free Trade Association (EFTA) the imposition of selectiveimport controls on certain classes of imports, notably machinery,timber and paper. It appeared, however, that it would be impossibleto make such controls retrospective to the date of announcement(and so to prevent forestalling), and that there would also be grave risk of retaliation. In these circumstances it might be preferable thatno reference to import controls should be included in his statementbut that the Cabinet should take a decision in principle to introducequantitative restrictions at an early date, when the temporary importsurcharge expired. The Cabinet might also wish to consider bringing forward the date of expiry of the surcharge and its replacement byquantitative restrictions.A number of Ministers favoured the introduction of quantitativeimport restrictions as soon as possible. It was argued that, to theextent to which imports were directly restricted, it would be possibleto rely less heavily on restrictions on domestic demand to ease thebalance of payments; and it was suggested that the inclusion in thePrime Ministers statement of an indication that we intended tointroduce direct import controls would greatly increase the impact of the statement on overseas opinion.On the other hand Ministers had stated in public more than once in recent weeks, both at home and overseas, that the Governmenthad no intention of replacing the temporary import surcharge, whenit expired, by quantitative restrictions on imports. To introducequantitative restrictions immediately upon expiry of the surcharge,and particularly to bring forward the date upon which the surchargeexpired and immediately thereupon to introduce quantitative restrictions, would therefore be a considerable shock to overseasopinion and would be likely to antagonise Governments who might otherwise welcome the proposed statement. If there were signs that imports were rising significantly after the end of the surcharge itmight be necessary to introduce quantitative restrictions; and this could be done, without a breach of our international obligations, ifwe could show that we were in serious balance of payments difficulties. But it would be necessary to allow some period to elapseafter the expiry of the surcharge in order that the rising trend in imports could be demonstrated. In the meantime any indication thatthe Government were contemplating the introduction of quantitative restrictions could lead to heavy forestalling. In answer to questions,
therefore, the Government would have no alternative but to maintain that there was no intention of replacing the surcharge, when itexpired, by quantitative restrictions.There was general agreement on the need to pursue, urgently andby all possible means, opportunities for economising in the use of imported goods and materials and for substituting domestic production for imports.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that there was general agreement that there should be no reference to import controls in his forthcoming parliamentary statement and that in answer to questions it would be necessary, inorder to avoid forestalling, to continue to state that the Governmenthad no intention of replacing the surcharge by quantitative restrictions. It was clear, however, that, if it appeared after the endof the surcharge that the level of imports was rising (apart from theimmediate but temporary increase which could reasonably beexpected to follow the withdrawal of the surcharge), the cabinet would need to be in a position to introduce quantitative restrictions,if necessary, without delay. Preparations should be put in handaccordingly. In addition the Ministers concerned should put in handa detailed study of the types of machinery being imported and should consider urgently how to ensure that a larger proportion of the requirement might be met from domestic production.Export incentives (C (66) 112)In further discussion it was suggested that it would be desirableto include in the Prime Ministers statement some indication ofpositive and constructive action in relation to export incentives. Itmight, for instance, be possible to revive a proposal that firms whoobserved an agreed code of practice in relation to prices and incomes,productivity, export promotion and import substitution might receive favourable tax treatment. On the other hand a great dealof Governmental action had already been taken in order to encourageexports; and proposals for a new form of indirect taxation (the value-added tax) and the institution of a central export corporation seemedto offer better prospect of progress than suggestions for discriminatorytax treatment, which would be clearly contrary to our international obligations. In the meantime it would be preferable to include no reference to export incentives in the Prime Ministers statement than to mention aspirations which would not match well with the firm decisions already taken on the other measures to be included in thestatement.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that no reference should be included in theParliamentary statement to be made by the PrimeMinister later that day to the possibility that theGovernment might introduce either quantitative restrictions on imports or special incentives to exports.(4) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with thePresident of the Board of Trade and other Ministers
concerned, to ensure that preparations were made for theintroduction of import controls if it became necessary to implement the Cabinet&apos;s decision in principle to this effectshortly after the removal of the import surcharge in theautumn.(5) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theMinister of Technology and other Ministers concerned,to give further consideration to possible means of ensuringeconomy in the use of imported goods and substitutingdomestic production for imports, particularly in relationto machinery.Summing up and conclusions the Prime Minister, summing up the main discussion, said thatthe Cabinet had now approved a series of measures relating to demand in the private and public sectors which should reduce the pressure on domestic resources by over  500 million. The reductionof domestic demand would itself help to relieve the balance ofpayments by curtailing the demand for imports and releasing capacity for production for export. In addition, direct action on government expenditure overseas, on travel allowances and on emigrants&apos;remittances should improve the balance of payments by at least 150 million. In the situation which faced the Government, wherethe restoration of confidence was one of the prime objectives, the presentation of the measures to be introduced was no less significantthan their real impact upon domestic demand and the balance ofpayments. The measures constituted a determined attack on the excess of domestic demand and on the deficit in the balance ofpayments; and in his Parliamentary statement, which would take account of the points made in the Cabinets discussion, he would seek to present the proposals as not only of substantial significancein their economic impact but also as convincing indications of theGovernments resolution to deal with the economic problems whichconfronted the country.The Cabinet (6) Agreed that a travel allowance of  50 on travel outside the sterling area should be introduced for 12 months from 1st November, 1966.(7) Approved the transitional provisions and consequentialchanges set out in paragraphs 7 and 10 of the Noteattached to C (66) 113.(8) Approved the change in the arrangements for emigrants&apos;remittances set out in paragraphs 12 to 19 of the Noteattached to C (66) 113.(9) Agreed that the regulator should be applied at 10 per centwith effect from midnight on 20th/21st July, 1966, onCustoms and Excise duties on spirits, beer and wine andhydrocarbon oil and on purchase tax.
(10) Agreed that legislation should be introduced at an appropriate opportunity to refund the surcharge onhydrocarbon oil . duties to public passenger transportoperators.(11) Agreed that the limit for exemption from building control should be reduced from  100,000 to  50,000 by an Orderto be introduced as soon as the Building Control Billreceived the Royal Assent.(12) Agreed that the control of office building should be extendedto the East and West Midlands Regions and to the restof the South-East Region of England.(13) Agreed that minimum down-payments on hire-purchaseshould be increased on cars to 40 per cent, on domesticappliances to 33^- per cent and on furniture to 20 per cent and that the maximum period of repayment should befixed at 24 months for each of these groups of articles all with effect from midnight on 20th/21st July, 1966.(14) Approved reductions totalling some  95 million in 1967-68in nationalised industries&apos; investment programmes andsome  55 million in 1967-68 in Central and LocalGovernment investment programmes, as agreed in discussion. i(15) Agreed that a year&apos;s rental should henceforward be requiredin advance of installation of a telephone.(16) Agreed that a surcharge of 10 per cent should be imposed in relation to surtax for the year 1965-66.(17) Took note that the Prime Minister would announce themeasures to be taken in a statement to be made later that day in the House of Commons.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st July, 1966.
