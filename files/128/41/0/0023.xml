CC 23 (66)confidential parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Oversea AffairsNorth AtlanticTreatyOrganisation(NATO)(previous reference:CC(66) 17thConclusions,Minute 5)Rhodesia(previous reference:CC(66) 21stConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mrs. White) saidthat there were some indications of concern in France at there actions of the other NATO Powers to the French Governmentsannouncement of their intention to withdraw from NATO.The Prime Minister said that there had been no developments since the last meeting of the Cabinet: we were still awaiting the arrival of the Rhodesian officials to participate in the talks.Meanwhile, it had been ascertained that President Kenyatta of kenya, Dr. Obote of Uganda, President Nyerere of Tanzania and dr. Banda, the Prime Minister of Malawi, accepted the expediency of our agreement to have these talks. President Kaunda of Zambiawas, however, still perturbed about them and it might be desirable for the Commonwealth Secretary to visit Zambia for discussions with him. There had been general concern among African countries that no Africans would be associated with the talks and it mightbe appropriate to consider this aspect further after the discussions with President Kaunda. In the meantime, it was also clear that,since the announcement that the talks would be held, further pressure had been brought to bear on Mr. Smith, the leader of the illegal regime, by the most extreme members of the RhodesiaFront. For our part the less that was said publicly about the talksat this stage the better.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mrs. White) saidthat we were seeking to avoid a meeting of the Security council at the present juncture to discuss Rhodesia, but the prospect ofsuccess was uncertain.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Prime Minister andthe Minister of State for Foreign Affairs.Social ServicesMinistry of social SecurityBill:administrative arrangements(previous reference:CC(66) 21stConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofPensions and National Insurance (CC (66) 67) on the administrative arrangements necessary to implement the Ministry of Social SecurityBill.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance recalled thatthe Cabinet had asked her on 28th April to consider the possibilityof undertaking, between the Third Reading of the Ministry of social security Bill in the House of Commons in July and Royal Assent
in November, the administrative arrangements necessary to bring thenew non-contributory benefits into operation by the last week inNovember. She had found that operationally such a programme was possible, though not without some risk of breakdown, providedthat the appointed day for the payment of the new benefits weredeferred until 12th December; but she was dismayed by the effect which inability to secure Royal Assent before the Summer Recesswould have on the presentation of the new scheme. The Bill was designed to make the new supplementary benefits more acceptablethan national assistance, particularly to the 700,000 old people whohad been shown by the Survey, which had been made of thecircumstances of retirement pensioners and which was shortly to bepublished, to be eligible for assistance, but to be unwilling to apply for it. The new arrangements would also provide an answer to the growing demand for pensions for those old people who were noteligible for pensions under the existing national insurance scheme.If the proposals were to achieve their effect it was essential that thenew Ministry should be introduced by a vigorous publicity campaign,and that the assessment of the new benefits should be undertaken by the Supplementary Benefits Commission. If Royal Assent werenot obtained before the Summer Recess, however, the publicitywould be much circumscribed and the assessments would have tobe made by National Assistance Board Officers acting as such. Itmight also be necessary to postpone the introduction of a systemof written claims and the pilot scheme for combined order books,both of which were valuable features of the new proposals.The Lord President said that it would now be necessary to passbefore the Summer Recess the Bill to be introduced by the Ministerof Labour for the repayment to manufacturing industry of the sumscollected through the selective employment tax. The Ministry of social Security Bill could be passed in addition to this only if theGovernment were prepared to defer until the autumn the SecondReading of four important Bills Iron and Steel, Prices and Incomes,Housing Subsidies and Industrial Reorganisation Corporation. if parliament sat until 5th August it might be possible to take theSecond Reading of some of these Bills, but it would not in any event be possible for them to begin their Committee Stage until the autumnbecause the Standing Committees were fully occupied on other urgentmeasures.In discussion it was pointed out that, in these circumstances,to give the Bills a Second Reading before the Recess would not result in their receiving Royal Assent any earlier. There would therefore be no purpose in requiring Parliament to sit during thefirst week in August, and there was considerable disadvantage in doing so in view of the number of young Members who would wishto be with their families during the school holidays. Moreover, theGovernment had hoped that, with a substantial majority, it wouldbe possible to avoid subjecting the present Parliament to the pressureunder which its predecessor had worked; but the programme now contemplated would preclude any relief before the Summer Recess.There was general agreement, however, that it would be desirable
to secure the passage of the Ministry of Social Security Bill beforethe Recess even if this necessitated sitting until 5th August.In discussion of the timetable for. particular Bills the followingprincipal points were made:(a) The Ministerial Committee on Iron and Steel Nationalisationhad considered it important to obtain the Second Reading of theIron and Steel Bill as soon as possible in order to remove uncertaintywithin the industry and to demonstrate that the Government were determined to proceed with nationalisation. It would not benecessary for this purpose to have the Bill considered in committee before the Summer Recess. On the other hand, the matters remitted to the Ministerial Committee on Iron and Steel Nationalisation on 7th April (CC (66) 18th Conclusions, Minute 4) had still to be brought back to the Cabinet. While, therefore, the Parliamentary programme would permit Second Reading before Whitsun, it might be desirableto introduce the Bill shortly after Whitsun and to take SecondReading before the Summer Recess.(b) If it were found possible to include the new mortgage schemefor house purchasers in the Housing Subsidies Bill, it would bedesirable that that Bill should receive a Second Reading before the summer Recess so that persons wishing to buy houses would know what help they might expect. It might, however, be necessary todeal with mortgages in a separate Bill.(c) It was desirable that the Industrial reorganisation corporation should start work during the Summer Recess but thiswould not necessitate the passage of the Bill since, once it hadreceived a Second Reading, the members of the Corporation could being informal negotiations with industry. No question of spendingmoney would arise for some months thereafter.id) If the Iron and Steel, the Industrial reorganisation corporation and the Ministry of Social Security Bills were to beintroduced before the long Recess, it would be important to make some progress with the Prices and Incomes Bill also, in order toreduce the risk of a weakening of confidence in sterling during the summer. On the other hand, to introduce the Bill some time before it could be passed might give an impression of indecision, and itwas arguable that its introduction should be deferred until theautumn, when public opinion might possibly be more willing toaccept the Bill. Some time must be allowed, however, for thefurther consultation to which the Government was pledged and forthe consideration of the form of the Bill by the Cabinet, and adecision on timing could best be taken at that stage.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that arrangements should be made for theMinistry of Social Security Bill to be passed through all its stagesbefore the Summer Recess. They recognised that, in view of theneed to make progress with other Bills, this would mean askingParliament to sit until 5th August and accepting a timetable whichwould leave little room for the debates, for which there might be ademand, on foreign policy or Rhodesia. Urgent consideration should
be given by the Ministers concerned to the compensation provisionsof the Iron and Steel Bill, and it would be necessary for the Cabinetto consider the points remitted to the Ministerial Committee on 7thApril. A convenient course might be to introduce the Bill shortly after Whitsun. He would consider with the First Secretary of State,in the light of their discussion, the timing of the Prices and incomes bill with a view to a Second Reading before the Summer Recess.The Bill might also need to be brought back to the Cabinet. TheIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation Bill should be given a SecondReading before the Summer Recess in order that members of theCorporation might begin work informally.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord President of the Council to make thenecessary arrangements to secure that Parliament should sit until 5th August, and to give further consideration tothe Parliamentary timetable with a view to ensuring thatthe Iron and Steel Bill, the Prices and Incomes Bill, andthe Industrial Reorganisation Corporation Bill receiveda Second Reading, and the Ministry of Social SecurityBill be passed through all it stages, before the summer recess.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would consult the first secretary of State on the timing of the Prices and incomes bill.(3) Agreed to consider outstanding questions of policy and timing on the Iron and Steel and Prices and Incomes Billsat later meetings.LocalGovernmentReorganisationTerms of .Reference ofRoyalCommissions(previous reference:CC (66) 4thConclusions,Minute 4)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Scotland and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment (C (66) 68) on the terms of reference and organisationof the proposed Royal Commissions on local government organisation.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that theSecretary of State for Scotland and he proposed the following termsof reference for each Commission:&quot; To consider the structure of Local Government (outsideGreater London) (England only) in relation to its existingfunctions: and to make recommendations for authorities andboundaries and for functions, having regard to the size and character of areas in which these can be most effectivelyexercised and the need to sustain a viable system of localdemocracy.&quot;It would be wrong to charge the Commissions with a full study of the distribution of functions between central and local government,since this would be a lengthy task which would divert them fromtheir main one of revising the structure, but the terms of referenceproposed would not debar them from considering some changes.The possibility should not be excluded that the Commissions might
CONFIDENTIAL7suitably consider whether the structure of local government could conveniently accommodate some function not at present discharged by local government or alternatively whether some function mightnot be transferred from local to central government. It was, however,desirable that they should only embark on the examination of such questions after consultation with the Government and this could best be secured by an exchange of letters between the chairmen and the Ministers concerned, setting out an understanding that theextent to which the Commissions should concern themselves withexamining the distribution of functions between central and localgovernment would be a matter for consultation. It had been ascertained that the proposed terms of reference would be acceptable to the Chairmen designate.To enable the English Commission to make rapid progress itwould need to be able to commission studies on a wide variety of subjects and for this purpose it was proposed to make available toit a research organisation supported by specialist staff from theMinistry of Housing and Local Government.Concern had been expressed to him by the First Secretary ofState at the exclusion of Greater London from the terms of reference of the English Commission, on the ground that there should be no suggestion that the pattern adopted in Greater London wasinviolable and that the Commission should not be prevented fromproposing an enlargement of the area if they thought it right to doso. The First Secretary of State had also expressed the view thatthe Commissions should be enjoined to report in not more than18 months, since otherwise it might be impracticable to legislate onthis contentious issue save in the last full session of the present parliament. If this course were adopted, it might be necessary topay the Chairmen and members to enable them to devote themselvesfull time to these questions.His own view was, however, that it would be preferablespecifically to exclude Greater London from the purview of theEnglish Commission, in view of the need to avoid any suggestionthat it might be the subject of a further review so soon after the major reorganisation which had recently been carried out. It would,however, be made clear to the Chairman of the Commission that itwas open to the Commission to consider changes in the boundaries of Greater London if they thought fit and also that the structuralpattern adopted there should not necessarily be regarded as oneappropriate for the rest of England. This would meet the first point raised by the First Secretary of State. There would, however, begrave difficulty in enjoining the Commissions to report in a periodof 18 months. The task before them was most formidable and,even if the Commissions were to work full time, it seemed doubtfulwhether it could be completed in less than two years. The length,complexity and political sensitivity of the issues involved might thenmake it desirable to consider postponing legislation until the first session of the succeeding Parliament, but this could only bedetermined in the light of the Commissions&apos; reports.
CONFIDENTIALIn discussion there was general agreement that Greater london should be excluded from the terms of reference of the EnglishCommission, subject to the understanding proposed by the Ministerof Housing and also that the Commissions should not be enjoinedto report within a period of 18 months. There was also generalagreement that the concern of the Commissions with the division of functions between central and local government should be restrictedas proposed. It would, however, be necessary for the commissions to be completely free to propose a redistribution of functions asbetween local authorities themselves and this might be made clearerby amending the relevant part of the terms of reference to read:&quot; To make recommendations for authorities and boundaries and forfunctions and their division.&quot;The following points were also made:(a) The term &quot; a viable system of local democracy&quot; was intended, and would be so interpreted by the Chairmen designate,as enabling the Commissions to have regard to possible changes inthe system of local government finance in relation to its structure.(/;) There would be advantage in the specialist staff available toassist the English Commission being drawn partly from the Ministryof Transport.In further discussion there was general agreement that thereshould be no change in the principle that members of royal commissions should not receive payment. There was, however,frequently need for such Commissions to be assisted by independentstaff who might need to be paid full time for their services andto this end there might be advantage in reviving the practiceof appointing paid Assistant Commissioners. If, on furtherconsideration, this practice were approved, it might be applied inrespect of the Royal Commissions in question.The Cabinet (1) Agreed with the terms of reference proposed in C(66)68,subject to the amendment agreed in discussion.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would in the light oftheir discussion submit to The Queen proposals forthe composition and terms of reference of royal commissions on the Reorganisation of Local Governmentin England and in Scotland.(3) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government, inconsultation with the Minister of Transport, to considerthe appointment of specialist staff from the Ministry ofTransport to assist the English Royal Commission.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider in thelight of the discussion the desirability of reviving thepractice of appointing paid Assistant Commissioners to royal Commissions.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,5th May, 1966.
