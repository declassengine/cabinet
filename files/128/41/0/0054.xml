OverseaAffairsZambia(previous reference:CC(66) 41stConclusions,Minute 5)confidential. The Commonwealth Secretary said that the situation on theCopper Belt in Zambia was still tense and there were fears that therecent riots might be renewed. There could be little doubt that thesituation had been considerably exacerbated by the references toracialism in a recent speech of President Kaunda, followed by theaction of the Zambian Government in ordering the deportation of25 Europeans. The representations we had made to the ZambianGovernment about the deportation of those of the 25 who wereUnited Kingdom citizens had necessarily been in general terms,since we had not available (and the Zambian Government had refused to provide) particulars of the citizenship of the persons concerned. One hopeful development was that the fire at the petroldump at Kitwe which had been the original occasion of the rioting,and which had been thought to be the result of sabotage, had nowbeen publicly declared to be purely accidental. President Kaundawas due to make a further public speech before he left for the meetingthe following week in Addis Ababa of the Organisation of AfricanUnity and it was hoped that on this occasion he might help to calmthe situation.Germany(previous reference:CC(66) 50thConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that,notwithstanding the current uncertainty about the position of thepresent Federal German Government, he intended to fulfil hisengagement to visit Bonn in the latter part of the week in order thatwe should not appear to be losing any opportunity to improveinternational relations at the present juncture.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretaries.HomeInformationServices(previous reference:CC(66) 47thConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Prime Minister recalled that the Cabinet had at their meeting on 22nd September invited the Lord President of the Councilto consider how the Governments information services could best be co-ordinated. The Lord President had now completed his enquiries. These had shown that there was a clear need for betterco-ordination. It would however be undesirable to create anything in the nature of a Minister or a Ministry of Information. Whatwas required was mechanism to ensure that all Ministers wereadequately informed about decisions on policy which their colleaguesintended to announce; that the order and timing of the announcementCC 54 (66)confidential parliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.7547
should be properly co-ordinated; and that Ministers should receiveappropriate guidance on what they should say in public if they madespeeches or answered questions about the policies of the government as a whole. The latter was particularly important for Ministers ofState and Parliamentary Secretaries. This co-ordination had to becarried out both at the Ministerial and at the official level. TheLord President would be responsible for Ministerial co-ordination,though he would not himself have direct contact with the Press,other than through his regular meetings with the Lobby. It would,however, be necessary to ensure that he was adequately informed of all forthcoming announcements of policy, to enable him to comment on their timing and presentation and that he was in aposition to provide members of the Government at short notice withauthoritative briefs on the main announcements of policy on whichthey might have to offer public comment. It was also necessary toenable him to make arrangements to keep in touch with what wasbeing said on political issues on television, so that criticisms could,if necessary, be immediately countered by Ministers. An additionalappointment would be made to his staff to enable him to carry &quot;out these functions. At the official level a similar exchange ofinformation should be carried out between the Press Office at10, Downing Street and departmental information offices and anadditional appointment would be made to the staff at No. 10 for thispurpose.These arrangements could be carried out more effectively ifcertain adjustments were made in the Governments conduct ofbusiness in other respects. In particular it should be a standinginstruction to all relevant Committees to consider, at the end ofeach meeting, what arrangements were necessary to provide publicity for any of their decisions which it was intended to announce publicly.When they had agreed on the appropriate presentation, this shouldbe indicated to the Lord President, so that he might then consider how far it need be more widely disseminated. Individual Ministerstaking departmental decisions that would also involve publicity should follow the same procedure. It would also be necessary toimprove the arrangements for interdepartmental consultation on the presentation of departmental advertisements. There should also bea central point of reference for the consideration of invitations issued to individual Ministers to appear at short notice on television, toensure a consistent line of response.These arrangements would not interfere with the existing practice whereby some Departments exercised a degree ofinterdepartmental co-ordination of publicity, such as that exercised by the Department of Economic Affairs in relation to publicity for1decisions of economic policy, nor would they affect existing arrangements for the projection of our foreign policies. If theCabinet welcomed these proposals in principle, he would circulate a paper.In discussion there was a general welcome for these proposals,which left the individual responsibility of Ministers unimpaired but
SECRETEurope(previous reference:CC(66) 53rdConclusions,Minute 2)4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion on Europe. They had before them a memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (C (66) 146)on the action which might be taken in the light of their precedingdiscussion.The Foreign Secretary recalled that at their previous discussion the Cabinet had accepted that there was a need for the Governmentto demonstrate the sincerity of our desire to join the european economic Community (e.c.) if our requirements could be met.We could not merely defer action, since this would undoubtedly be widely understood to mean that we were not serious in our intentions and hence would lead to a number of developments which might be gravely harmful to our interests. The problem at issue was how toobtain from the Governments of the e.c. an indication of the way in which our special difficulties could be met if we decided to apply for membership of the Community. Until we had such indications,we could not decide whether or not to apply: but we could notembark on the necessary investigation of them unless theGovernments of the e.c. could be made to realise that we were inearnest. To this end three main proposals had been discussed.These were: /,,(i) A meeting of the Heads of Government of our partners in the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).(ii) Early visits to the capitals of the Six by the Prime Ministerand himself.(iii) A declaration that the Government were prepared toaccept the Treaty of Rome, subject to receivingsatisfaction on the points on which we saw difficulty.If any of these courses were adopted it would be followed byand be inseparable from:(iv) The investigations which we needed to undertake in greaterdepth and which would respond to invitations which wehad had (but not taken up) from some of the Five.7547a 3would improve the co-ordination of the public presentation of theGovernments policies. It was also suggested that in consideringbriefs for Ministers making public speeches outside London, itwould be important to arrange for them to cover regionaldevelopments on which the Ministers might be asked questions orbe expected to comment.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, that the Prime Minister would circulate a paper setting out the detailed proposals whichwere envisaged for the co-ordination of the Governmentshome information services, on the lines indicated in his statement.
Any of these major steps could only be taken after we hadcarefully considered what action would be appropriate to ensurethat our obligations to our EFTA and Commonwealth partners were met. A meeting of the Heads of Government of EFTA had however serious disadvantages which outweighed the singleadvantage that it would gain us further time to strengthen our economy. One reason why our leadership was implicitly accepted inEFTA, in so far as relations with the e.c. were concerned, was thatwe were in a median position between those who wished to movefaster towards joining the Community and those who were morereticent in this respect than we were. In these circumstances anEFTA meeting of the kind proposed could not be expected to resultin our receiving agreed advice from our partners or in any consensuson the action to be taken. It would, however, be likely to producepressure upon us for additional commitments within the framework of EFTA, or for some kind of joint negotiation between EFTA andthe e.c. which we knew to be unacceptable to the latter. The soleresult of the meeting might therefore be seriously to complicate ourown eventual position in negotiations, while still not appearing toopinion both here and in Europe as the kind of decisive step forward that was now required. It would be sufficient in the light of therecent meeting of EFTA in Lisbon that we should notify theGovernments concerned, rather than consult them, on any movewhich we might now make. The same considerations would applyto other members of the Commonwealth.In these circumstances, his own preference was for Course (ii),i.e., visits by the Prime Minister and himself to the capitals of the six. If, however, the Cabinet took the view that such a tour might appear too dramatic or presented insurmountable difficulties becauseof the political situations in Germany and Holland, then theGovernment should adopt Course (iii) and make a declaration inrespect of the Treaty of Rome, followed by the necessaryinvestigations under (iv).In discussion it was agreed that the two immediate questionsbefore the Cabinet were whether we should make no further move on the issue of joining the e.c. until our economic position wasstronger or, if some forward move were agreed to be necessary, what form it should take and what the timing should be. While therewas general agreement that our attitude could not be negative,differing views were expressed on the second question.Some Ministers felt that either of the courses mentioned in theForeign Secretary&apos;s memorandum, i.e., early visits to the capitals ofthe Six by the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary or a declaration that the United Kingdom Government were prepared to accept theTreaty of Rome subject to receiving satisfaction on points on whichwe saw difficulty, would be premature at this stage. Discussion at chequers had shown the dangers of joining the e.c. while our economic position was weak and, even more, if it appeared that our economic weakness was the reason for our seeking membership.While capital movements and agriculture were the main areas of
difficulty for us, we should need to be satisfied on other points, suchas our ability to manage our own economy, including our regional policy, and the power of the European Commission to make regulations having direct legal effect in the United Kingdom. visits by the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary could lead us intopremature negotiations and if we were negotiating from a positionof economic weakness we should be less likely to obtain our requirements, without which we could not afford to join the e.c..Moreover, we should risk a rebuff by the French which would bevery damaging if the prestige of the Prime Minister and foreign secretary were personally engaged. The first step should thereforebe to consult our EFTA partners. While collective negotiation between the e.c. and EFTA might be impossible, our ownnegotiating position would be stronger if it were clear that we hadthe backing of EFTA. This course would give time for measuresto strengthen our economy to take effect and would enable the kennedy Round of tariff negotiations to be completed; a move bythe United Kingdom towards the e.c. might prejudice the successof these negotiations which were of great importance to us. Ameeting of the EFTA Heads of Government, as had been proposed,would show that we did not wish to stand still on the issue of joining the e.c. and would also demonstrate that it was a question not simplyof the United Kingdom joining, but of forming a new and widerCommunity.Other Ministers however felt that a meeting of EFTA Headsof Government would not by itself be sufficient to maintain thenecessary momentum; it might on the contrary be regarded as onlyanother device to defer a decision. While our economy was at presentvulnerable, it was reasonable to expect that we should have regainedour competitive position by the time we could in any event join the eec. This was a period when the relationships between countries were particularly fluid and unsettled: and it offered the UnitedKingdom a unique opportunity to exercise leadership. If we failedto take it and appeared to retreat, the damage not only to our international position but also to our economy could be at least asserious as if we made a premature move to join the e.c.. It would therefore be wrong to stand still and we should explore the readiness of the Six to meet our requirements on the points of difficulty forus. Our readiness to move forward would be demonstrated either by visits by the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary or by adeclaration about our readiness, subject to conditions, to accept theTreaty of Rome. Some support was expressed for the view that on balance the former offered the greater advantage. It would of course be clear that the Government would be entirely free thereafter to decline to join the e.c. if the visits showed that we could not obtainreasonable conditions for doing so. On the other hand it wassuggested that the former course would risk a French rebuff andwould in any case bring up at once the question of our readiness to sign the Treaty of Rome and the conditions to which this would besubject: it might therefore be preferable to adopt the second course
and to link this with discussions in greater depth with the Governmentsof the e.c.. We need not be in any hurry to proceed to formalnegotiations and it seemed unlikely that negotiations would in fact be possible at least until after the French elections in the spring.This course would not rule out visits by the Prime Minister andForeign Secretary to the capitals of the Six at a later stage. It wouldbe important to let it be known, at the same time as we made our forward move, that it would be our intention to join the e.c. on terms which would not call in question either the strength of the economy or the value of sterling. Provided that this was madesufficiently clear, the effect on confidence in the forthcoming monthscould be helpful rather than the reverse. At the same time we shouldinitiate studies of the alternative policies which we should pursueif we failed to obtain satisfactory conditions from the e.c. and were therefore unable to join the Community.In further discussion the Prime Minister said that after the cabinet&apos;s wide-ranging discussion of our relationship with Europe,further consideration might conveniently be concentrated on thefollowing proposals, which sought to take account of the differingpoints of view. There was substantial agreement that we could not maintain our present position; and that we needed to ascertain theconditions of membership we could hope to secure before we coulddecide whether to seek entry or not. This information could onlybe obtained at a higher level and on a different basis from previousdiscussions. Entry from weakness would be disastrous but to take no further action while we regained our strength might damage ourrecovery. An indication that we expected to join at a time ofeconomic strength and under conditions which, apart from anysafeguards we might secure, would make investment in the UnitedKingdom attractive to European and American investors, might wellbring us a net inflow of capital even before entry, during our periodof recovery.As regards the argument that further moves towards europe should await the outcome of the negotiations in the Kennedy Round,the proposed visits would afford a valuable opportunity to impress on the Six the importance of the success of those negotiations. Therisk of a rebuff could not be decisive since this might at any stage be presented as inhibiting any further action. The purpose of theproposed visits would not be to seek entry, but to ascertain the likelyconditions of entry. If these turned out to be unacceptable or ifwe were rebuffed this would constitute the strongest defence of oursubsequent position. A declaration of intent in regard to the Treatyof Rome ran the risk of saying too much or too little. any declaration which would be regarded by the Europeans as a worthwhile advance on our present position might unduly commitus; yet anything less might prove not significantly to alter the government&apos;s present position. The arguments relating to aconference of EFTA Prime Ministers were conflicting.With so many uncertainties it was imperative that the government&apos;s freedom of choice must be preserved, both as towhether we were to join the Community, and when we were to do
so, until the necessary information was available. To obtain that information the following action might be taken:(a) After consultations with the Governments of EFTA, aconference of their Prime Ministers in London shouldbe called for early December, to consider the steps to befollowed in further approaches to the e.c..(b) There should be an announcement, probably at the sametime as the announcement of the EFTA conference,re-affirming our willingness to enter the Community onappropriate terms, and stating that he and the foreign secretary would accordingly make a series of visits to the heads of Government of the Six to make our requirements clear and to ascertain theirs.(c) The January meeting of the Consultative Assembly atStrasbourg should be the occasion for him to make afull statement of the Governments attitude to Europe;the terms of the statement would need to be consideredby the Cabinet.(d) Thereafter he and the Foreign Secretary should carry out their visits both to explore conditions of membership and to press for a forthcoming attitude in the kennedy round. For the former purpose it would be necessaryto have an agreed formula on our attitude to the Treatyof Rome, which would no doubt be on the basis ofof qualified acceptance.(e) Urgent studies should be made by officials of both the&quot; Javits &quot; plan and also of the prospects of our continuingwithout any new form of association, both to strengthen our position in any subsequent negotiations, and toconsider what it should be if they failed.(/) We should decide the nature and timing of consultations with the Governments of the Commonwealth and of theUnited States in regard to our further moves towardsEurope. Those consultations might in turn reveal furtherpossible courses of action.In the ensuing discussion it was urged that unless the proposedvisits were announced at the same time as the conference of EFTAPrime Ministers, the announcement of the latter might be interpreted as an indication of our reluctance to seek further progress with the six and might also constrict our own freedom of action subsequently.The advisability of the proposed visits in these circumstances might turn primarily on the terms of the statements we should have tomake of the Governmenfs policy and of the conditions on which weshould be prepared to join the Community. The statements wouldhave to indicate how far the Government would accept the Treatyof Rome, and what transitional provisions and adaptations of thearrangements made thereunder we should need, if we were to secure from the Governments of the Six authoritative indications of how
far they would meet our conditions. It would be possible for the statements to be considered further after the EFTA conference and again after the meeting of the Consultative Assembly at Strasbourg.It would be important to bear in mind that thereafter the statement on the details of the policy to be pursued during the discussions with the Governments of the Six, however informal these might be,would set the pattern for any subsequent formal negotiations.The Prime Minister, summing up the latter part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet were on balance in agreement with the broadlines of the programme of action he had put forward but thestatement of our policy which we should have to make required further detailed consideration. The Cabinet should therefore resume their discussion the following week upon the basis of a further paperby the Foreign Secretary, which should set out in detail theprogramme of action he himself had outlined and a draft statementof policy on the lines indicated in the discussion.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to circulate a paper on thelines indicated in the Prime Minister^ summing up oftheir discussion.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion in the following week onthe basis of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,3rd November, 1966.
