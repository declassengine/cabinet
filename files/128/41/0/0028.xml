(PreviouReference:CC(66) 27 th conclusions,Minute 3)CC 28 (66)SECRETIndustrial 1.   The Minister of Labour said that the previous evening heDisputes jia(j discusse(i with the Finance and General Purposes CommitteeSeamen&apos;s Strike 0f Trades Union Congress (TUC) the interim Report of theCourt of Inquiry under the chairmanship of Lord Pearson. Itappeared that they had now somewhat changed their view: they now suggested that agreement might be reached with the NationalUnion of Seamen (McManus) if the recommendations were improved by abandoning the proposal that the number of days&apos; leave shouldbe reduced in consequence of the immediate move to a 48-hour week. The Committee had been unanimous that this was the onlybasis on which agreement might be reached. Such an arrangement would, however, amount to an immediate increase of payequivalent to 1\ per cent, as compared with the 5 per centrepresented by the recommendations of the Court of Inquiry andwould destroy any prospect of maintaining the government&apos;s policy on prices and incomes. It was unfortunate that the view ofthe TUC had already become public knowledge. The shipownersfor their part were not prepared to make concessions going beyondthe Courts recommendations. As regards the seamen, it appeared that a substantial number were now ready to return to work on theterms recommended by the Court, but strong efforts, includingintimidation in some instances, were being made by certain sectionsof the Union to maintain the strike.In discussion it was suggested that the responsibility whichhad been laid upon the Minister of Labour for the maintenanceof the Governments policy on prices and incomes had made itimpossible for him to carry out his task of industrial conciliation.A solution could not be found to the present dispute unless theGovernment were prepared to move from its rigid position, themaintenance of which might alienate public support. Nor would the industrial issues be settled even if the seamen&apos;s strike were tocollapse: it was also of major importance to maintain theGovernments relationship with the TUC, which had to take on the role of conciliation hitherto held by the Minister of Labour.It was, however, the general view of the Cabinet that theGovernment could not seek the termination of the strike on theterms proposed by the Finance and General Purposes Committeeof the TUC, even if these should prove acceptable to the owners,and that the adoption of such a course would destroy any prospectof success of the Governments policy on prices and incomes. Itwould, therefore, inevitably lead to the abandonment of theGovernments policy of maintaining full employment and theconsequences would, in the longer run, be far more damaging tothe people of the country as a whole than the prolongation of thestrike. There was general recognition that the maintenance of theGovernments policy might involve an early widening of the areaof industrial dispute and that the continuation of the strike would shortly necessitate the greater use of the Governments emergency powers, particularly in respect of the maintenance of port working.7141-2a 2f1
There might even be a threat to the maintenance of law and orderin certain areas, in view of the extent of intimidation. Theseconsequences had, however, been envisaged when the Cabinet had first decided on its course of action in relation to the current disputeand must, if necessary, be accepted as preferable to a change in policy which would involve substantial unemployment. There wasalso general agreement that it was important to seek to maintainthe fullest co-operation with the TUC and to persuade the general council of the TUC of the importance of not departing in any material respect from the recommendations of the Court of Inquiry,of which the Chairman of the TUC was a member. It could alsoprofitably be emphasised that these recommendations constitutedsolely an interim report and that other long-standing and seriousgrievances of the seamen were being considered by the Court.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that the Government could not contemplate any material departure from the recommendations of the interimReport of the Court of Enquiry. They recognised that this policy might lead to a deterioration of the immediate industrial situationand every effort should be made in further discussion with the tuc to avoid this. He would accordingly now, together with theMinister of Labour, discuss the situation with the TUC and seek to persuade them of the importance of standing by therecommendations of the interim Report of the Court of Inquiry.He would also consider in the light of the reactions of the TUCwhether he and the Minister of Labour might profitably then seethe Executive of the McManus or their negotiating committee. If fromthese discussions the possibility emerged of any compromiseproposals which would be compatible with the Governmenfs policy on prices and incomes, the Cabinet would be further consulted.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.. Iron and steel nationalisation(previous reference:CC(66) 25thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Prime Minister said that, when the Cabinet last considered steel nationalisation, the views of the steel companies had been reported. These had fallen a long way short of whatthe Government considered necessary both in terms of effectivereorganisation of the industry and of public ownership. TheMinister of Power had since indicated the views of the Governmentto the industry, and on Monday, 13th June, Mr. Judge andMr. Peach of the British Iron and Steel Federation (BISF) had come to give him and the Minister of Power the industry&apos;s viewson nationalisation. Mr. Judge had also told him that theFederation would be issuing a statement of their views that night(Tuesday). Their proposals were quite inadequate to meet the government&apos;s requirements and he had replied that although he
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th June, 1966.\liwould report the industry&apos;s views to his colleagues, they were not acceptable.The Minister of Power said that, despite the pending Pressrelease, he would be meeting Mr. Judge later that day to consider with him how the nationalisation measures could be put into effect.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister andthe Minister of Power.
