CC1 (66)1. The Prime Minister said that the Meeting of CommonwealthHeads of Government at Lagos had proved to be more favourable toour interests than had been expected. In particular, we had maintained our view that military force should not be used to end the rebellion and we had not been held to a specific timetable for bringing it to an end, though it had been agreed that there shouldbe a further meeting in July if by then economic sanctions had not succeeded in doing so. Since the Lagos meeting it had become apparent that sanctions were having a considerable impact on the economy of Rhodesia and the oil embargo had been extremelyeffective. The Rhodesia refinery had closed down and there wouldbe the utmost difficulty in any oil tanker discharging its oil into the pipeline at Beira, since the use of the storage tanks there, through which the oil would normally have to pass, would be denied by thetwo companies concerned. Despite the statements of the PrimeMinister of the illegal regime, Mr. Smith, it was estimated that only some six weeks&apos; stocks were now available in Rhodesia. Nor weresupplies entering the country by other means, save for a smallquantity of lubricants, at the normal level, from South Africa. Thelatter had not taken any action which might frustrate sanctions. Theairlift to Zambia had been remarkably successful and in the currentweek imports of oil by this means had exceeded the previous normalweekly consumption. It was hoped that, as soon as stocks had been built up, Zambia would be able to end oil rationing. In discussions with President Kaunda it had been agreed that the Zambia frontierwould be closed to imports from Rhodesia, except for imports ofcoal, at such time as the impact of other economic sanctions made it apparent that a collapse of the rebellion could be quickly achieved by this means.The visit of the three Labour Members of Parliament to rhodesia had been most useful, in particular in discussions with theGovernor and with the Chief Justice, Sir Hugh Beadle. Furtherconsideration was being given to the most effective use of the radiotransmitter at Francistown. The proposed visit of the Common-wealth Secretary to Salisbury for discussions with the Governor hadbeen cancelled because the illegal regime had sought to imposeconditions which might imply that we recognised it.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the PrimeMinister.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs andthe Minister of Labour (C (66) 3) on prices and incomes policy.The First Secretary of State said that the memorandum was circulated as background for the Cabinefs later consideration of theproposed Prices and Incomes Bill and of the problems that would
arise in this field in the near future. The Government had embarkedupon the development of a long-term policy for prices and incomesnot as an end in itself but as a condition of the achievement of steadyeconomic growth and the fulfilment of their social policies. Thoughrecent economic indicators, such as the trade figures, might suggestthat there was now less need for restraint, and the policy had in factalready been more successful than Press reports implied, the need to maintain and intensify it was as strong as ever. This entailedbeing prepared to stand up to threats of industrial action aimed atundermining it and, if necessary, to take issue with conventionalattitudes to industrial negotiations.The National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) had achieved a considerable degree of success with its first reports, andwas establishing its authority. None the less its reports might fromtime to time create presentational difficulties for the Government.He was considering in the light of experience so far whether somebroadening of the membership of the Board was desirable. It wouldbe important to avoid overloading the Board, or allowing it to beused except as a means of establishing principles of prices and incomes policy in a series of case law decisions. From this pointof view the possibility of re-establishing compulsory arbitration, witha body on the lines of the former Industrial Disputes Tribunal butrequired to have regard to the national interest, might be considered.In the meantime consideration was being given to the effect ofpursuing the prices and incomes policy upon the discharge by theMinistry of Labour of their function of conciliation; and to means whereby arbitration tribunals could be brought to take account ofthe national interest. One possibility might be to proceed by meansof a formal requirement or request to arbitrators to take account ofthe policy; another might be to make an exemplary reference of an arbitration award to the NBPI.The Minister of Labour said that a number of serious difficulties would shortly arise in pursuing the policy: for example, in respect ofthe Governmenfs commitment in principle to introduce equal pay and in dealing with the pay claims of dockers, railwaymen, miners and bakers. The maintenance of the policy would require the full support of all Ministers. The reintroduction of compulsory arbitration would be useful: some unions mostly those which represented lower-paid workers would welcome it, but the more powerful might resist it, and it could not in any event be reintroducedin time to assist with the immediate problems.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the prices and incomes policy was essential for the achievement of the government&apos;s economic and social objectives. From the outset ithad been recognised that this was a long-term policy, which couldnot be expected to have dramatic results in a short space of time,particularly since it had had to be introduced at a period ofexceptionally heavy pressure on labour and other resources. It was too early as yet to say whether it might be necessary to take othershorter-term measures through the Budget to operate on theadditional pressure of demand generated by the rise of incomes the
previous year, but it would be important to see that any short-term measures conflicted as little as possible with the long-term policy.In the coming year prices were expected to rise less rapidly than in1965; unemployment might well rise, but it was at present at a recordlow level and the Government had done much to mitigate the regional consequences of the former maldistribution of employment.On prices it would be important to counteract the myth that wasbeing created that large price increases were being temporarily heldback. Every possible step was being taken to see that the principlesof the prices and incomes policy were maintained in the publicservice, at the inevitable cost of some injustices.In discussion the following points were made:(a) Much of the recent rise in food prices had been seasonal.The rise in the 12 months to December 1965 had been of the order of3 per cent, compared with 5-1 per cent in the previous 12 months,and was in part due to factors beyond the Governments control.Insufficient attention had been drawn to prices which had fallen (suchas those of pork, butter and sugar).(b) The role of arbitration, particularly in the public sector,would need further consideration. A statutory requirement uponarbitrators to take account of the national interest would be difficultto enforce, while to refer an arbitration award to the NBPI could put an undue strain on the system of arbitration. One possible course might be for the NBPI to present a case at arbitration hearings.(c) The value and relevance of fair comparisons, particularly inthe public service, needed to be further considered. Faircomparisons of the established kind did not always take account of differences of productivity and efficiency between those who werebeing compared. A new study of the operation of the principle offair comparisons in the Civil Service had been put in hand.(d) It was suggested that the Government might be able toexpress what the nation could afford by way of incomes increases interms of a global figure rather than of a percentage. This might encourage reactions within the unions to excessive wage demands which would pre-empt an undue share of this amount, though therewas a danger that the unions representing the economically strongergroups would get the larger share.(e) It was also suggested that, in order to emphasise therelevance of the policy to the Governments social objectives, thenorm should be set at a lower rate say l-  per cent for individualswith incomes over a certain figure. Such a course could, however,present difficulties in relation to salary structures which spanned a wide range of incomes, because of the anomalies created by unduecompression.(/) All the income references to the NBPI had so far been inrespect of wages or salaries, not because there were objections ofprinciple to referring other sorts of incomes to the Board but becauseno suitable case had presented itself.   It was for consideration
whether some increases of dividends, possibly the current increases in bank dividends, or increases in the cost of some financial service,should be referred.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were fully agreed that it was necessary to maintain andintensify the prices and incomes policy on the lines indicated by theFirst Secretary of State and the Minister of Labour. presentation of the policy in Ministerial speeches could with advantage take aless defensive form, stressing the successes of the policy and the limited nature of recent price increases. It would be helpful if theMinister of Agriculture would circulate to other Ministers notes on recent movements of food prices, which could be very helpful in thisconnection. It was also particularly important to stress in relationto the policy the need for, and advantages of, improvements in productivity and technological efficiency. Ministers should lose no opportunity of pressing forward improvements in productivity and agreements to bring restrictive practices to an end in industries forwhich they were responsible. Detailed aspects of the policy could best be further considered in the Ministerial Committee on economic development.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of C (66) 3.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to circulate notes on recent movements of food prices.(3) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Economic Development toconsider further the ways in which the prices and incomes policy could best be further developed and strengthened.Prices and incomes Bill(previous reference:CC(65) 46thConclusions,Minute 1 and cc(65) 57thConclusions,Minute 5)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs(C (66) 5) to which was attached the draft of a Prices and incomes bill.The First Secretary of State said that, since the proposed prices and incomes legislation had last been discussed by the Cabinet, theLaw Officers had advised on ways of refraining the Bill in order to minimise its penal effects on the unions. As now drafted, the bill would enable the Government to operate a standstill on priceswithout also operating a standstill on incomes, and, in practice, toapply the procedure for prior notification to employers only. There-was considerable support for the Bill from the Trades UnionCongress (TUC), and while the Confederation of British Industries(CBI) were unwilling to commit themselves outright to public support, its leaders had said in private that the early warning andstandstill systems could be effective only if they were or could, ifnecessary, be made statutory. If the Cabinet approved the Bill inprinciple, the details would be considered later in the week by the ministerial Committee on Economic Development and subsequently,
after further discussion with the TUC and CBI, by the legislation committee, in order that the Bill might be ready for introduction at about the beginning of February.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It was questionable whether the power given by the Bill to delay increases in prices and incomes and require them to besubmitted for examination justified the political or Parliamentarydifficulty which its introduction would create for the Government.It had, however, to be borne in mind that to refer a price or wage increase to the National Board for Prices and Incomes after it hadbeen announced was of limited value; the powers in the Bill wouldenable the Government to refer proposals or claims before decisions were reached, when there was a better prospect that considerationsarising from the prices and incomes policy could be brought to bearon the result. The only other course would be to institute a statutoryholding of wages and prices and this was not acceptable to theGovernment.(b) The provisions for enforcement, which created new criminal offences, might be strongly opposed in Parliament and might giverise to difficulty for the Government when they had passed into law.It was for consideration whether it would be preferable to rely onthe common law for sanctions rather than to create new criminal offences. On the other hand, if reliance were placed only on thecommon law, it would not be possible to provide immunity fromcriminal liability for conspiracy or to avoid the risk that a tradeunion might be sued for damages. Even as drafted, the Bill did notavoid the danger that a strike leader who refused to pay a fineimposed on him under the enforcement provisions would be liableto imprisonment.(c) It would be necessary to add a further clause to the Bill toensure that it was not an offence for persons and companies to actin concert to keep prices down.(d) As drafted, the Bill was in conflict with the remuneration of Teachers Act, and further provision would be required to dealwith this point.(e) It was for consideration whether a White Paper explaining the provisions of the Bill should be published at the same time asthe Bill.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposed Prices and Incomes Bill in&apos; principle,and agreed that it should now go forward for detailed discussion bythe Ministerial Committees concerned.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the draft Bill attached to C (66) 5.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the Billto be considered in detail in due course by the ministerial Committee on Economic Development and
subsequently by the Legislation Committee, taking account of points made in the discussion.(3) Invited the First Secretary of State to consider thepossibility of publishing an explanatory White Paper atthe same time as the Bill.CommercialPolicySuper VC-lOsMiddle EastAirlines(previous reference:CC(65) 71stConclusions,Minute 5)for . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the President ofthe Board of Trade (C (66) 7) about the sale of Super VC-lOs to middle East Airlines.The President of the Board of Trade said that for the past year the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) had been trying to concludean agreement with Middle East Airlines (MEA) for the sale of anumber of Super VC-lOs. In March 1965 the Government had agreed to arrangements which would have probably involved aGovernment subsidy of about million but an agreement had notbeen concluded on the basis then contemplated. The Chairman ofMEA had now indicated the terms on which he would be preparedto buy three VC-lOs. BAC could only meet these if they received aGovernment subsidy which would amount to some    million,through an interest free loan of about  \\ million and the provisionof working capital by the Government of  1\ million. They alsoinvolved agreement to the sale of Lebanese apples in the UnitedKingdom to the value of at least 20 per cent of that of the aircraft.The Ministerial Sub-Committee on External Economic policy had not been able to agree whether the Government should beprepared to offer such assistance. His own opinion was that, havinggone so far already, it was desirable to enable BAC to meet the terms.Although payment for the aircraft would be spread over 10 years,there was no reason to suppose that MEA would not meet their obligations and a considerable sum in foreign exchange would beearned over the period. Undoubtedly a subsidy to the export of theaircraft would be involved; but this was a feature of many sales of aircraft on the international market and we would not encounterinternational difficulties on that account. If we failed to secure anorder from MEA, it would be a major setback to any hope of sellingthe VC-lOs to any other airline. BAC would arrange for the sale ofLebanese apples in the United Kingdom and the Government wouldnot directly be involved. It would be desirable for this to be donewithin the present quotas, although it would lead to complaints from such traditional suppliers of apples as Italy and Canada. We should inot, however, exclude the possibility that a small increase in the totalquota for United Kingdom imports of apples might be necessary.The Minister of Aviation said that it had been made clear toBAC that any governmental assistance could apply only to the three aircraft now under discussion and could not apply to any other aircraft for which options were given to MEA. The terms suggested should not be regarded as a precedent for any sales of VC-lOs orother aircraft to other airlines.   There were, however, substantial
reasons for accepting them in the present instance. The UnitedStates companies were making a determined effort to secure this contract in the belief that thereafter MEA would be committed to united States aircraft. The Douglas company had offered a verymuch larger interest free loan than was now proposed. If we nowwithdrew support there would be strong criticism of the Governmentand damaging publicity for the VC-10.In discussion it was urged that international competition for aircraft sales could only be conducted on the kind of terms suggested and that these were necessary to enable the United Kingdom aircraft industry to compete against the effort of the United States companies to secure a monopoly. If the sale to MEA were concluded, there remained the hope that BAC might sell a further 10 or 15 VC-lOs toother airlines at the same kind of price. The company themselveswere not anxious to secure such orders and might well prefer to closedown the VC-10 production line as soon as possible. This would,however, result in a United States monopoly for long-range civil aircraft and would lose an opportunity of significant foreign exchangeearnings from the sale of VC-lOs over the next few years. It mightwell be possible to make use of the probable cancellation charges onthe existing BO AC orders for the VC-lOs to reduce the price of theaircraft to overseas airlines. It was also argued that the results of withdrawing Government support would be damaging to ourrelations with the Lebanon in view of the importance which they attached to the sale of their apple crop.On the other hand it was argued that the prospects of sales ofVC-lOs in world markets were not adequate to justify sounsatisfactory and so costly an agreement. The cost of the VC-10was too high to attract airline operators in competition withequivalent United States aircraft. The proposal involved selling theaircraft abroad as a substantial loss and any further sales could hardly be on better terms. The number of aircraft sold would be small and their production would involve the use of scarceengineering resources which could be better employed in producingother goods for export which could be sold at a profit. The Reportof the Committee of Inquiry into the Aircraft Industry (PlowdenReport) had indicated clearly that it was not possible for the UnitedKingdom aircraft industry on its own to compete in the market for large civil aircraft. Moreover, the future of BAC was in considerable doubt and it would be imprudent to advance further large sums tothe company in order to finance the production of aircraft to be soldat a loss. Although the Government would not be directly concerned with the purchase of the Lebanese apples it would be presented as an integral part of an agreement which we supported.If the import quota for apples were not increased there would be serious complaints from such traditional suppliers as Canada andItaly. If, on the other hand, the quotas were increased to meet theircomplaints there would be serious repercussions on the UnitedKingdom horticultural industry.
In further discussion the Chief Secretary put forward analternative proposal. It now seemed possible that credit might beprovided for the MEA purchase under the German Offset Agreement.This would not be repayable until the end of 10 years and it would carry interest at perhaps half the normal commercial rate. Such adeal might be as advantageous to MEA as the terms so far discussed and might therefore make it possible to sell the aircraft on an ordinary commercial basis without special governmental assistance.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet were opposed to Government support of theorder and kind envisaged to enable BAC to meet the terms set byMEA for the purchase of Super VC-lOs. The Chief Secretary&apos;proposal should, however, be further examined. If it appeared thatit was possible to conclude the deal on reasonable normal commercial terms by the use of credit under the German offset agreement the matter should be brought before the Cabinet again.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Government should not give special assistance to BAC as set out in C (66) 7 to enable themto meet the terms set by MEA for the purchase ofSuper VC-lOs.(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, to examine the possibility of the sale beingconcluded on a normal commercial basis withoutgovernmental assistance by the use of credit under theGerman Offset Agreement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,18th January, 1966.
