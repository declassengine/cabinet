CONFIDENTIAL 3CC 41 (66)confidential parliament 1.   The Lord President reported that the Opposition had decided to substitute for the Supply Debate arranged for Wednesday,8th August, a Motion to transfer consideration of the Prices and incomes Bill from Standing Committee B to a Committee of thewhole House. This change was devised to permit a Second reading debate on the new clauses of the Bill providing powers to enforce the standstill on wages and prices; and the Debate should be conducted on that basis. It would not necessarily be to theGovernments disadvantage.Economic !SituationPrices and incomes Bill(previous reference:CC (66) 40thConclusions,Minute 2)confidential. The Minister of Housing and Local Government said thatit would be important, both in the debate on the Bill andsubsequently, to try to ensure that the standstill on wages and prices should become effective by means of voluntary co-operation. It was open to question how far the standstill could in fact be enforcedby the statutory means provided in the Bill; and contingency plans should be prepared for the action to be taken if the voluntarystandstill proved abortive, in order that the Cabinet might be ableto consider the implications in advance.In discussion there was some support for this view. the government&apos;s intention had been to try to ensure the success of the standstill by voluntary methods and not to resort to compulsion until these had been seen to fail. Moreover, if, as seemed likely, theTrades Union Congress decided on the following day to supportthe standstill, this would be an additional reason for preferring thecourse of voluntary co-operation.On the other hand it would be wrong to exaggerate the prospect that a standstill could be achieved by voluntary means. TheGovernment, as employer, would be able to enforce a standstill inthe very large public sector; but this would be liable to provokeconsiderable resentment if the standstill were seen to be only partiallyeffective in the private sector. It would be unfortunate, therefore,to give employees in the public sector any reason to suppose that inthe private sector voluntary methods would be attempted in the initial period and that only if these failed would compulsion be invoked. From this point of view it might be preferable to be readyto implement the compulsory powers in Part IV of the Bill at anearly stage in order to demonstrate the Governmenfs determination to hold the balance evenly as between the public and the private sectors and to deter any attempts by the latter to frustrate the standstill. Indeed, some private employers might need the protectionof Part IV of the Bill to indemnify them in relation to contractsmade before 20th July.The Prime Minister recalled that at their previous discussion on the standstill of wages and prices the Cabinet had agreed thatthe procedure envisaged by Part IV of the Bill, whereby its provisions
would become operative only on the introduction of an AffirmativeOrder lapsing unless confirmed by both Houses within 28 calendardays, would demonstrate the Government^ preference for proceeding by voluntary means but also their determination toenforce the standstill by statutory powers if voluntary means broke down. The Cabinet would need to adhere closely to this collectivedecision; and it might be advisable for a form of words, based upon it, to be agreed for use in the debate. Thereafter, however, it wouldbe necessary to see how the situation developed before further decisions were taken. If, as now appeared possible, there was ageneral and voluntary acceptance of the standstill, pressures by oneor two recalcitrant groups could be dealt with ad hoc, if necessary,by use of the reversion powers over wages and prices in Part IV ofthe Bill. But, if the standstill were infringed more widely, other action would be required; and it might be advisable for the Cabinetto give some thought, in advance, to its implications. In any event the Affirmative Order giving effect to the powers in Part IV of theBill would not be introduced without prior discussion and decision by the Cabinet.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theCabinet to consider the implications of the action whichmight be required if it became necessary to enforce a statutory standstill of prices and wages.OverseaAffairsSouth Arabia(previous reference:CC (66) 33rdConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that a village in Beihan hadbeen raided the previous day by two aircraft from the Yemenwhich were almost certainly Egyptian. 75 houses had been hit andthree children wounded. The raid had been widely interpreted asaction designed both to discredit our ability to defend South arabia and to destroy the cohesion of the Federal Government. The latter had asked that we should both make a formal protest to theGovernment of the United Arab Republic (UAR) and also retaliateon Egyptian targets in the Yemen. The Canadian and UnitedStates Governments, which were the protecting powers in the UARand the Yemen respectively during the period in which we did not maintain diplomatic relations with either country, had been asked tomake strong protests to the two Governments: we were in additionseeking to call a meeting of the Security Council. While suchdiplomatic action was being taken we could not simultaneouslyretaliate, but if that action failed to produce any result we mighthave to consider retaliation. Alternatively, it might be possible toobtain agreement to a United Nations investigation of the incidenton the spot.In discussion it was pointed out that, since the Yemeni side ofthe border in question was occupied by the royalists, the raid could

The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the outcome ofhis recent discussions with the President of the United States,President Johnson, in Washington.The Cabinefs discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately in the bound volume of Most Confidential Recordsheld by the Secretary of the Cabinet.Zambia(previous reference:CC (65) 9thConclusions,Minute 4)intensification of SanctionsAgainstRhodesia byZambiaSECRET5. The Cabinet considered a note by the commonwealth secretary (C (66) 120) covering a memorandum by the Minister ofState for Commonwealth Affairs about the intensification of sanctions against Rhodesia by Zambia; and a note by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C (66) 121) on the effects on the UnitedKingdom of an interruption in Zambian copper supplies.The Minister of State for Commonwealth Affairs said that our policy required the intensification of sanctions against Rhodesia ifwe were to secure a negotiated settlement on our terms within areasonable period. We also needed to keep up the momentum ifinternational support for sanctions were to be sustained. Apartfrom the oil supplies reaching Rhodesia from South Africa andMozambique, which we were unable to prevent, Zambian trade withRhodesia now constituted the major gap in sanctions. Zambianimports from Rhodesia had already been reduced by about 30 percent compared with the level before the illegal declaration of independence (i.d.i.); if in co-operation with us the ZambianGovernment were now to impose a phased cut-off, reducing theirCC 41 (66)not plausibly have been made in retaliation for raids from Beihanon areas under the control of the Yemeni Government. We were taking such military precautions as were possible to deal with further raids of this nature.The Commonwealth Secretary said that there had been a furthermutiny in Nigeria and that Major-General Ironsi, the Head of State,had been kidnapped and possibly killed. A Lieutenant-ColonelYakubu Gowon, who was a Hausa from the Northern Region, had assumed charge of the Government, with the support of theSupreme Council. He had been strongly advised by both our ownHigh Commissioner and the United States Ambassador againstpromoting the secession of the North from the Federation. So farthere had been no anti-European feeling, although two Europeanshad by accident been killed in cross fire between two bodies oftroops.
imports by a total of 80 per cent from the level before i.d.L, thiswould have a major effect on Rhodesian earnings of foreign exchange and on employment in Rhodesia. An agreement on these lines would also help to restore Zambian confidence in the UnitedKingdom Government and might prevent a decision by Zambia atthe Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting in September to leavethe Commonwealth or sever relations with us, either of whichcourses could lead to a break-up of the Commonwealth. In hernegotiations with the Zambian Government she had been authorisedto offer a total of  6-85 million to be spent in the rest of 1966 on approved projects for developing alternative supply routes and localcoal supplies, together with a review of the situation in December1966 if the emergency had not ended by then. This offer had been rejected by the Zambian Government, partly because of their lackof confidence in the policy of the United Kingdom Government andpartly because they regarded it as an inadequate commitment bythe United Kingdom to carry through the projects which Zambiawished to undertake. We could not give an unlimited commitment,as the Zambians wished, but it might be possible to reach agreementif we brought forward the review promised for the end of the yearand agreed now on the amount of continuing assistance which wecould offer for the first half of 1967. She therefore proposed thatwe should maintain our offer of  6-85 million for expenditure onagreed projects in 1966 and offer a further  7 million for the continuation of agreed projects during the first half of 1967. our assistance would be discontinued if there were a return to constitutional rule in Rhodesia or to normal communications between Rhodesia and Zambia. Our offer would also be subject toreconsideration if Zambia left the Commonwealth or broke offrelations with the United Kingdom.Effects on jne President of the Board of Trade said that any substantialKin^omt)! reduction in copper exports from Zambia from the normal rate ofan Interruption 60,000 tons a month would increase the price of our copper imports in Zambian and add to the burden on our balance of payments. This wasCopper illustrated by the recent movement in copper prices which had fallenSupplies by near]y  loo a ton, to just under  500 a ton, owing to the zambian Government^ decision to permit the resumption of copperexports through Rhodesia provided that the freight charges in rhodesia were paid by the purchasers. If Zambian copper exports were in the range of 20,000 to 38,000 tons a month this would impose an additional burden on our balance of payments, owing to higher copper prices, of  3-4 million to  7-4 million a month. Ifthe level of Zambian exports fell below 38,000 tons a month therewas likely to be a physical shortage of copper which would furtheraffect our manufacturing industry and hence our exports. Therewas therefore a strong case for trying to reach an agreement withZambia which would increase the capacity of alternative routes forthe export of copper from the present level of 20,000 tons a month to a potential level of 38,000 tons a month, and which might alsoreduce the risk of unilateral action by Zambia to restrict copperexports.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the ZambianGovernment were seeking an unlimited commitment of support bythe United Kingdom: it therefore seemed doubtful whether theywould accept an offer of an additional  7 million since this still seta limit to our aid, even if a higher one. It seemed even moredoubtful whether this offer would re-establish Zambian confidence inthe United Kingdom Government to such an extent as to alter their whole attitude and induce them to adopt the policy we advocatedfor Zambian trade with Rhodesia. Copper exports from Zambiawere now moving again through Rhodesia and United Kingdomcompanies were able to purchase supplies through Swiss firmswithout the need for any alteration in our exchange controlregulations against Rhodesia. The Zambian Government would still be in a position to take unilateral action to restrict copperexports and it seemed unilkely that increased aid from the UnitedKingdom would seriously inhibit them from doing so if they sowished. If the additional offer of  7 million could be found withinthe ceiling for our economic aid, he would nevertheless not objectto it; but in our present economic situation there could be no justification for any increase in the total aid expenditure.In discussion it was agreed that three main aspects of theproblem required consideration; the effect in Rhodesia of more stringent sanctions by Zambia; the degree to which an increasedoffer of aid might influence Zambia&apos;s attitude at the forthcomingCommonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting; and the extent to which agreement with Zambia would safeguard our supplies of Zambiancopper.As regards the first point, sanctions were already having aconsiderable economic effect in Rhodesia, and this would be substantially increased if there were a phased reduction of Zambiantrade on the lines we had in mind. This would also help to sustaininternational support for the policy of voluntary sanctions against rhodesia. On the other hand sanctions had so far had little political effect in Rhodesia itself and even if their economic effects became more severe it was arguable that this might only increase the determination of the regime and of the hard core of the european community not to surrender. Moreover there seemed little prospects of any large scale liberal move against the regime. Neverthelesssanctions could still bring about a change of policy on the part ofthe regime, although it might well take a considerable time to achieve this: the effective sanction on sales of tobacco was particularly important in this context. The Government were committed to bringing the rebellion to an end and must in honourmaintain the policy of sanctions even if this policy would still takea considerable time to show its full effect and the ultimate resultcould not be regarded as certain.The Rhodesian situation had had serious political effects inZambia, but, although the Zambian economy had suffered certain limited damage, Zambian foreign exchange reserves had increased
considerably, owing to the higher price of copper, and the revenues of the Zambian Government had gained considerably and were relatively substantial. Zambian distrust of the United KingdomGovernment was due to political rather than economic causes andspecifically to suspicion about the informal talks with the regime in salisbury. It was doubtful whether an increased offer of aid would substantially affect Zambia&apos;s attitude at the Commonwealth PrimeMinisters&apos; Meeting but the consequences of Zambia leaving theCommonwealth, particularly if this led to a more extensive break-upof the Commonwealth, would be so serious, both politically and economically, that it would be worth paying the  7 million if thisavoided such an outcome. If the offer were rejected by Zambia weshould be no worse off and, the offer having been made, our position with other Members at the Comonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; meeting would be stronger. If the offer were accepted it would be reasonable to stipulate, as was proposed, that the position would be subject toreconsideration should Zambia leave the Commonwealth. In fact,however, we might wish even in this eventuality to maintain theoffer if it would help significantly to safeguard our copper supplies.An agreement with Zambia would not of itself necessarilyprevent the Zambian Government from seeking to restrict copperexports. We could however make it clear that our assistance wouldbe terminated if such action were taken and that this must be acondition of our offer. Even if the total amount of our aid to zambia of some  14 million were regarded as an insurance for continued copper supplies, the premium would not be unduly highsince a heavy reduction of supplies could cost us as much as anadditional  100 million a year on the balance of payments.In further discussion it was pointed out that it had been agreedthat the  6-85 million which we had already offered should be additional to the total agreed expenditure on aid. It was argued that neither this amount nor the additional  7 million could properly be regarded as aid or found within the aid budget. Duringthe current financial year our aid was fully committed up to the agreed ceiling. In the year 1967-68 there would be a cut of 20 million as a result of the announcement made on 20th July andthere would in practice have to be a further cut of  10 million toprovide for contingencies.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion was in favour of making a further offer to zambia on the lines proposed by the Minister of State for commonwealth Affairs. In addition to the conditions suggested inthe memorandum it should be made clear that the offer was conditional on the Zambian Government imposing no restrictions oncopper exports. We should in any case be under great pressure atthe Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting and subsequently atthe United Nations for the imposition of mandatory sanctions against Rhodesia. It was doubtful whether these could be confined to oil sanctions and they could well lead to an economic embargoagainst the whole of Southern Africa, which would have disastrous consequences for the United Kingdom economy.   There would
The AircraftIndustryRe-equipment of BritishEuropeanAirways(previous reference:CC (66) 40thConclusions,Minute 4)confidential. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of a memorandumby the First Secretary of State and Secretary of State for economic affairs (C (66) 119) on the aircraft industry.The Minister of State, Department of Economic Affairs,recalled that at their previous meeting the Cabinet had invited theMinister of Aviation to inform British European Airways (BEA)of the Governmenfs decision that their fleet should be re-equipped with United Kingdom aircraft, and had invited the First Secretaryof State, in consultation with the Minister of Aviation, to arrangefor a further study to be made of the means by which assistance should be given to BEA to deal with the problems with which thisdecision would present them, of the size, constitution and timing ofBEA orders and of the implications of postponing re-equipment foralso be strong pressure for military action against Rhodesia either by the United Kingdom alone or by a United Nations force. Itmight be suggested that, since we could not be certain that sanctions would be effective, the question of using military force should bere considered. This had however been studied in detail and thedifficulties of a military operation and the objections to the use of force, not only in regard to Rhodesia itself but for the whole of central Africa and indeed for the economic and strategic positionof the United Kingdom, had been shown to be decisive. It was arguable that the cost of. our aid to Zambia could be regarded aspart of a war operation rather than as part of our normal aid programme but further consideration should be given to the mannerin which the cost should be borne. In view of the difficulty ofmaking provision for it within any existing departmental budget and since it would be to some extent an insurance for maintaining thesupply of Zambian copper to the United Kingdom this consideration should include the possibility of providing the money by means of alevy on imports of copper.The Cabinet (1) Approved C (66) 120, subject to the points made by thePrime Minister in his summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofState, Department of Economic Affairs, to consider thepossibility of recovering the cost of our aid to Zambia bya means of a levy on imports of copper.(3) Subject to Conclusion (2), invited the Chancellor of theExchequer, in consultation with the Secretary of Statefor Defence, the Commonwealth Secretary and theMinister of Overseas Development, to consider further in the light of the discussion how the cost of aid to zambia should be met.
10CONFIDENTIALProposedMerger of rolls-Royce,Limited, andBristolSiddeleyEngines,Limiteddomestic routes. The First Secretary of State took the view thatthe study of these matters should be remitted to the Sub-Committeewhich it was proposed should consider the reorganisation of the airframe industry.The Cabinet were now invited to endorse the further conclusions reached by the Ministerial Committee on Economic Development,that Rolls-Royce, Limited, and Bristol Siddeley Engines, Limited,should be told that the Government saw no objection in principle to the proposed merger of their aero-engine interests, and that no decision should be taken for the time being on the reorganisation of the airframe industry, while the matter was further studied by aSub-Committee of Ministers.The Minister of Aviation said that he had informed BE A ofthe Governments decision that they should re-equip with UnitedKingdom aircraft. BEA had taken this decision badly, and an unfortunate speech by the Chairman of BEA at a lunch at whichthe Press were represented had led to premature reports in thePress. He would be making a statement in the House of Commonslater in the day on the Governments decision. It had beensuggested that he should not indicate in that statement that BEAwould themselves from a commercial point of view have preferred to buy United States aircraft; but BEA had strongly urged that heshould do so and, if he did not, they would certainly make itpublicly known themselves. He questioned whether it was appropriate for further study of the questions arising on BEAre-equipment to be undertaken by the Sub-Committee which wouldbe considering the future of the airframe industry, but he supported the conclusions suggested by the First Secretary of State on theaero-engine merger and on further study of the reorganisation ofthe airframe industry.In discussion the following points were made:(a) A key question for the proposed Sub-Committee on thefuture of the airframe industry would be the future load on theindustry. The re-equipment of BEA was an integral part of this,and questions arising on the size, make-up and timing of BEA orderscould appropriately be considered by the same Sub-Committee. Itmight not be appropriate, however, to invite the Sub-Committeeto consider the wider question of the future of the Air TrafficLicensing Board and its procedures.(b) It was suggested that relationships between BEA and theaircraft industry would be improved if BEA were represented on the boards of directors of companies in the industry. On the otherhand it was pointed out that this relationship could make fordifficulties, and there was no evidence that it would have anysubstantial practical value.(c) While a Government statement on the future of the airframe industry during the Recess need not be ruled out, it wassuggested that it would be better to defer a final decision until someof the uncertainties about demand on the industry were resolved,even though this might mean postponing an announcement untilthe autumn.
CONFIDENTIAL11 255RoyalCommissionon Assizesand QuarterSessionsOutsideLondonCONFIDENTIAL7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C (66) 123) proposing the appointment of a RoyalCommission on Assizes and Quarter Sessions outside London.The Lord Chancellor said that there had long been criticism of the wastefulness and inefficiency of the circuit system which required Assize Judges to sit twice a year for hearing civil and criminal cases in each of 61 Assize towns, many of which providedinadequate business or were visited for too short a time to hear the occasional long case, while large centres of population had noAssize of their own. These arrangements resulted in serious delays in hearing civil cases and in accused persons having to travel longdistances for trial. The system had not been examined since theRoyal Commission on the Dispatch of Business at Common Law(the Peel Commission) of 1936, and there was a strong case for afar-reaching inquiry by an authoritative Royal Commission whichcould consider not only the reorganisation of the Assize system,but the desirability of establishing district High Courts outside london; the case for extending Crown Courts similar to those at liverpool and Manchester; the administration of criminal justiceat Quarter Sessions which were now so overloaded that it was difficult to find suitable persons to serve as Recorder or Chairmanof Quarter Sessions; and the ownership and use of courtaccommodation, the scarcity of which played a disproportionatepart in determining the pattern of the court system. There might now be less local opposition to reform of the system than had beenthe case in the past, because many local authorities were finding thecost of supporting an Assize a heavy financial burden, and an earlyThe Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet in general endorsed Conclusions (4) and (5) in paragraph of (C(66) 119). He would give further thought to the composition and terms of reference of the proposed Sub-Committee.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that Rolls-Royce and Bristol Siddeley should be told that the Government saw no objection in principle tothe proposed merger of their aero-engine interests.(2) Agreed that no decision should be taken for the time being on the reorganisation of the airframe industry, while thematter was further studied by a Sub-Committee ofMinisters.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theconstitution of a Sub-Committee for this purpose, andwould consider how far it was appropriate to remit tothat Sub-Committee questions arising from the decisionto require BEA to re-equip with United Kingdomaircraft.
12CONFIDENTIALinquiry was likely to be welcome. The Home Affairs Committeehad approved in principle the proposal to recommend theappointment of a Royal Commission. It was proposed, afterconsultation with the other Ministers concerned, that the terms ofreference should be: &quot; To enquire into the present arrangementsfor the administration of justice at Assizes and at Quarter Sessionsoutside Greater London, and to report what reforms should bemade for the more convenient,&apos; economic and efficient disposal ofthe civil and criminal business at present dealt with by thosecourts &quot;.In discussion there was general agreement that an inquiry wasnecessary and that it was of sufficient importance to be undertaken by a Royal Commission. The chairman should be a layman withwide administrative experience, and it would be important that thefinancial aspects of the system of Assizes and Quarter Sessions andthe desirability of the State acquiring court premises outside london should be carefully considered.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that it was desirable that an inquiry should beundertaken into the system of Assizes and quarter sessions outside London on the lines proposed inC (66) 123.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would submit to the queen proposals for the appointment of a RoyalCommission on Assizes and Quarter Sessions.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,2nd August, 1966.
