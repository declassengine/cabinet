confidential 116CC 17 (66)CONFIDENTIALLord l.  The Cabinet expressed their condolence with the LordChancellor      Chancellor on the death of his wife and directed that a message oftheir sympathy should be sent to him.EconomicSituation(previous reference:CC(66) 14thConclusions,Minute 2)CONFIDENTIAL*2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was natural that sterling should be subject to some degree of additional strainduring an Election campaign. But the pressure on the poundwhich had been manifested in the last few days had developed very rapidly and on a more significant scale than had been expected.There was now a general expectation in the market that theauthorities would respond by the classical means; and the governor and Court of the Bank of England had accordingly recommendedthat Bank Rate should be raised by 1 per cent that day.If this action were not taken, the situation might deterioratestill further. The speculation which was inseparable from an election would be liable to develop in any event; and after a certainpoint it might extend into the field of commercial trade. Ourfinancing requirement in the current year was already estimated tobe of the order of  350 million; and we could not lightlycontemplate the increase in this figure which might result if thespeculative movement against sterling were allowed to pass out ofcontrol.It would be possible to deal with this situation by using our reserves of gold and foreign exchange to support the sterling rate;and we might hope that, if the present pressures derived mainly from ordinary pre-Election uncertainty and to some extent fromdisquiet about the, disappointing trade returns for January, our losses would be made good once the Election was over and normalconditions were restored. But we could not count on making good the outflow completely; and the net loss could be substantial.Alternatively, we could have recourse to the International monetary fund and to the various technical arrangements which we had madewith the Central Banks of other countries for the support of sterlingwhen it was last under pressure in the previous autumn. If so,however, we should merely increase the amount of our foreignindebtedness, which already imposed a heavy burden on our balanceof payments.For these reasons, prudence pointed to i an increase of 1 percent in Bank Rate, which should be coupled with a public statement by the Bank of England that this represented no more than a normalprecaution against the uncertainties of the pre-Election period andthat sterling remained basically sound.
In discussion considerable doubt was expressed about the wisdom of this course. The following main points were made:(a) If the present situation had arisen in the ordinary course ofevents, an increase in Bank Rate might have represented the correctaction. In fact, however, the strain on sterling had developed in themiddle of an Election campaign; and this fact was very relevant tothe decision which now faced the Government. If, in thesecircumstances, an increase in Bank Rate was misinterpreted by international opinion as indicating that the Governmenfs decisionto appeal to the country had been precipitated by a deterioration in the economic situation which they had hitherto been reluctant to admit, the pressure on the pound might well be aggravated ratherthan reduced.(b) In so far as this pressure should be regarded as deriving fromdoubts about the competence of the Government to safeguardsterling or about the compatibility of certain elements in the LabourParty&apos;s Election Manifesto with the continued stability of the pound,there were some grounds for believing that such doubts might bebeing deliberately fomented by the Governmenfs political opponents the more so since all other current indications of publicopinion suggested that the Government would be returned with anincreased majority. If, in these circumstances, the Governmentallowed themselves to be coerced into adopting ill-advised financial measures, they would be seen to be at the mercy of unscrupulousfinancial pressure and would lose their freedom of political action.It would be disastrous if, as a result, an open clash developedbetween the Government and the City and the integrity of sterlingbecame a party issue in the electoral campaign. Even if, as mustbe assumed, the Governmenfs will prevailed, incalculable damagewould be done to sterling; and it would certainly be preferable to contemplate an increase in our international indebtedness than toput at risk the basic standing of our currency.(c) The Building Societies were known to be contemplating anearly increase in their lending rates, although some were lessconvinced than others of the necessity for such action. But a risein Bank Rate would be liable to precipitate a decision in favour ofan increase in mortgage rates; and since this would be undesirableat the present juncture, the Societies should be informed that any increase in their lending rates would be referred to the national board for Prices and Incomes.(d) There could be no certainty that an increase of 1 per centin Bank Rate would suffice to arrest the pressure on sterling. Butit would be very damaging if, having consented to an increase ofthis order now, the Government were compelled to authorise asecond increase in the following week. It would be preferable, bothon merits and in terms of insulating sterling from party politics, to refrain from action at the present stage but to be prepared, ifnecessary, to raise Bank Rate by more than 1 per cent in the latterstages of the electoral campaign.
confidential     117(e) In the interim, we should have recourse to the international financial facilities which had been mobilised in the autumn of 1965.It would be quixotic not to avail ourselves, in this renewedemergency, of arrangements which at that time we had made considerable efforts to secure, even to the extent of committing ourselves to a policy on prices and incomes which had been a source of potential embarrassment to the Government ever since. Weshould at least extract a compensating advantage by drawing on those facilities now; and, in so far as our ability to do so depended upon the goodwill of other countries, it was not irrelevant that theFrench Government had just indicated their intention to adoptmeasures which might go far towards disrupting the atlantic alliance and our other partners in the Alliance should thereforebe the more willing to help us for broad political reasons. Forthe same reasons we should be able to count on a sympatheticresponse from the United States Administration.As against these considerations it could be argued that anincrease in Bank Rate, made promptly at the outset of the election campaign, might be effective in arresting at an early stage a deterioration in the situation which might otherwise develop furtherthroughout the campaign. If so, it should be to the Governmentselectoral advantage. It could also be presented as a sign of strength rather than weakness, particularly since prime rates weretending to rise throughout the world and an increase in Bank rate would therefore be seen as a natural and proper reaction to this tendency. Moreover, it would be unwise to place too great reliance on the international facilities which had been put at our disposalin the previous autumn. Their availability depended in the last resort on the relationships between the Governments and theCentral Banks in the countries concerned; and we could notassume that Governmental sympathy would necessarily be reflected in willingness by the monetary authorities to support sterling against their better judgment. It was not easy to see how, even in theUnited States, the President could compel the Federal reserve bank to give us more support in the exchange market than they were already providing.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of the argument appeared to incline against an increase inBank Rate that day; and the Bank of England should be so informed. It was essential, however, that no hint of this discussion should be allowed to become publicly known; and all members ofthe Government should take care to avoid any statement during theforthcoming electoral campaign which could be interpreted asmaking sterling an issue in that campaign, unless the tactics of theOpposition Parties made this unavoidable.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that no increase in Bank Rate should be made that day.
secret parliament 3.   The Lord President of the Council said that the future legislation Committee had agreed the previous day that he should write to all Ministers giving a provisional list of Main ProgrammeBills for the next Session and a list of those which the committee at present thought might be held over to form the major part of theMain Programme for 1967-68.The provisional list, on which a formal submission would bemade to the new Cabinet when a draft of the Opening Speech was put before them, was based on the proposal that the first Sessionof the new Parliament should continue until at least the end ofJuly 1967. This meant that there would be no Queen&apos;s Speech,and consequently no Debate on the Address, in the autumn of 1966.Discussion showed general agreement with the Lord Presidentsproposal.The Cabinet Agreed that, if the Government were returned to office atthe forthcoming Election, the Session of Parliament whichwould be opened on 21st April, 1966, should continue atleast until the end of July 1967.SECRETMinister ofTechnologyPersonalStatement4. The Minister of Technology drew the attention of theCabinet to an article in the Daily Mirror that morning. Thisreferred to the opposition of the Transport and General Workers&apos;Union to the Government^ policy on prices and incomes; drew a wholly misleading inference from his meeting with the Executive ofthe Union earlier that week, the purpose of which had been entirelyconfined to seeking the Union&apos;s concurrence in his continuedleave of absence from the post of General Secretary pending the outcome of his candidacy at the forthcoming General Election; andreflected both on his own loyalty to his colleagues in the Governmentand on the Prime Ministers integrity.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to inform theGovernor and Court of the Bank of Englandaccordingly.(3) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government to seek to dissuade the Building Societies from raising theirlending rates at the present time and to warn them thatany increase of this kind would be made the subject ofa reference to the National Board for Prices and Incomes.
secret oversea AffairsFrance(previous reference:CC(65) 6thConclusions,Minute 2)5. The Foreign Secretary said that the President of France,General de Gaulle, had sent messages to the Prime Minister andto the President of the United States regarding the intentions ofthe French Government in relation to the North Atlantic treaty and to participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(NATO). These messages stated that France proposed to terminateher participation in the integrated commands and no longer toplace her forces at the disposal of NATO, though she was preparedto have understandings about mutual facilities and co-operation inthe case of a conflict. This meant that all French forces would be withdrawn from assignments to, or control by, NATO militarycommands in peace; that, although France would continue to berepresented on the North Atlantic Council, French officers wouldbe withdrawn from NATO military headquarters; and that thelatter, including Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe(SHAPE), would have to withdraw from France. French troopsin Germany would also be withdrawn from assignment to NATO,unless the Federal German Government agreed to their remainingunder some new arrangement to be negotiated bilaterally.General de Gaulle proposed to notify the remaining members of nato accordingly the following day or at the beginning of next week. We had suggested to our principal allies that the remaining14 members of NATO should issue a public declaration of faith inthe continuation of the Alliance; that machinery should be set up within it to co-ordinate responses to the French approach and consequent action; and that all should agree not to deal bilaterallywith France, except - after agreeing their line with the remainder.This course of action had been agreed with the United StatesGovernment and endorsed the preceding day by the Defence and oversea Policy Committee.This was not the occasion to consider the longer-term effects of the French Governmenfs decision. These would inevitably begrave and might involve heavy expenditure on the replacement of nato infrastructure, while there would be a disquieting increasein the relative importance and standing of Germany within the alliance. There would, however, be certain partial offsettingadvantages in that the relative importance and standing of theUnited Kingdom would also be increased and that this might afford an opportunity for pressing more effectively our views on the reform of the NATO structure and on burden sharing, while it wasalso possible that some foreign forces might be stationed in theUnited Kingdom, with advantages to our balance of payments.  in C.C 17 (66)In discussion it was suggested that, while it might be desirableto take legal advice on the possibility of seeking an injunction againstthe Daily Mirror to prevent a repetition of these maliciousallegations, the wisest course would be to ignore the article.
general it would be important that the Government should not, inthe upshot, show hostility to France in consequence of general de Gaulle&apos;s decision, but they should clearly demonstrate that theywere determined to maintain the North Atlantic Alliance.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the foreign secretary.SECRETFarm price review(previous reference:CC(66) 16thConclusions,Minute 4)6. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food (C (66) 51 and 53) reporting theprogress of discussions with the Farmers&apos; Unions on the farm price Review.The Minister of Agriculture said that the Farmers&apos; Unions had maintained until very late in the discussions a demand for anincrease in the guarantees exceeding  50 million. However, at thelast moment they had moved from this position and had comedown to some  31 million, as reported in C (66) 53. Late theprevious evening they had come still lower to  27^ million. It was doubtful whether they would be prepared to reduce their bidsignificantly below this figure. This was slightly less than theincrease which the Agricultural Ministers had recommended to theCabinet from the beginning as the basis of a reasonable agreed settlement which would maintain the confidence of farmers and secure their support of the targets for agricultural production in theNational Economic Plan. Nevertheless, in view of the cabinet decision on 3rd March, the Farmers&apos; Unions had been given no indication that a settlement at this figure would be acceptable.The Cabinet should however be aware that, if the Governmentrejected a settlement of  27^ million, strong feelings would bearoused amongst the farming community. The Farmers&apos; unions had asked for a further meeting with the Prime Minister before afinal decision was taken by the Government to impose a settlementof  20 million. The differences between what the Farmers&apos; unions were seeking and the Governments proposals (set out in Annex IIto C (66) 51) were primarily in respect of cereals, pigs and sheep.The Farmers&apos; Unions had also asked for certain long-term assurances, including a guarantee that they would be allowed duringthe period of the National Economic Plan to retain the incomeresulting from some two-thirds of their increased efficiency. Hehad made it clear to the Farmers&apos; Unions that an assurance of thiskind could not be given. It would however be desirable to include in the White Paper on the Review a statement that the Governmentwould be willing to discuss with the industry the provision ofassurances to provide for greater stability in the level of support.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was opposed to increasing guarantees by more than  20 million. This was not inany way a harsh settlement. Over the past seven years the average
SECRETReorganisationof the Docks(previous reference:CC(66) 5thConclusions,Minute 3)7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (C (66) 54) about future policy on the reorganisation ofthe docks.The First Secretary of State recalled that the Queen&apos;s speech on the Opening of the present Session of Parliament had included a statement about legislation on the docks, designed to enable theCC 17 (66)settlement had been  21 million above the minimum set by the 1957Agriculture Act: and an increase in the guarantees of  20 million this year would be  26 million over the minimum: this would belikely to increase farm incomes by about 5 per cent. It was generally accepted that there was no case on merits for increasing the guarantees further nor would any major advantages flow from reaching an agreement with the Farmers&apos; Unions.In discussion there was general agreement that the guaranteesshould not be increased by as much as  27-1- million in order toreach agreement with the Farmers&apos; Unions. There was some support for the view that, particularly in view of the repercussions on our oversea suppliers, there should be no increase above 20 million. On the other hand it was argued that it would be worth while raising the Governmenfs offer slightly if this would achieve a fully agreed settlement, always provided that the further increases in guarantees were restricted to cereals, pigs and sheep.No further increase in the price of milk could be contemplated,particularly in view of the problems this would raise for ouroversea suppliers of dairy products. There was general agreement that no specific long-term assurances could be given to the Farmers&apos;Unions: the precise form of any statement of intent to be includedin the White Paper should be agreed with all the ministers concerned.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet agreed that the Agricultural Ministers shouldbe authorised to increase the guarantees up to a maximum of 23 million, provided that a settlement on this basis was fullyagreed with the Farmers&apos; Unions. Any improvement in the government&apos;s existing offer should be confined to cereals, pigs and sheep. If full agreement within this range were not possible, no increase should be made above the schedule set out in the annex to C (66) 51. The Agricultural Ministers were authorised to include in the White Paper a paragraph on the lines suggested in paragraph 4of C (66) 53, provided that no specific commitment was implied andthe text was agreed with the Ministers concerned.The Cabinet . Invited the Agricultural Ministers to continue discussions with the Farmers&apos; Unions on the basis of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.
Government either to proceed with a limited measure primarilyintended to implement the Report of Inquiry into certain matters concerning the Port Transport Industry (the Devlin Report) or witha more radical reorganisation which would involve some form ofpublic ownership of the docks. It had subsequently become clearthat the Departments concerned could not put forward proposalsfor a radical reorganisation without clearer guidance from ministers on their objectives. It had therefore been decided to arrangethrough the National Executive of the Labour Party for a study group to be appointed on this matter. Its Report had recentlybeen received and recommended the establishment of a strongNational Ports Authority and a series of Regional Port authorities which would be statutory bodies owning the port facilities in theirregion, would carry out the actual port operations and would be the sole employers of port labour. The general policy recommended in this Report had been endorsed in the Labour Party&apos;s election manifesto.During this time the Minister of Labour had been continuing to make progress in his discussions with those concerned on theDevlin Report. The employers and the unions concerned had agreed privately on a system which would involve a voluntaryreduction in the number of port employers of labour, followed by asystem of licensing of employers; this would be accompanied by asystem of permanent employment of labour which would greatlydecrease the amount of casual labour in the docks even though itmight not wholly remove it. The next stage in these discussions would be for the Minister of Labour to publish a new draft dock labour Scheme.The Ministerial Committee on Economic Development had considered the Minister of Labour&apos;s proposal for continuingprogress on the introduction of the new system of port employment and the majority supported it. There were however certainobjections, since this procedure would in practice cause substantialdelay to the more fundamental reorganisation. Such are organisation would entail the new regional port authoritiesbecoming the sole employers of labour: and it would not bepossible to abolish casual labour or make the working of the docksfully efficient without the establishment of such authorities. the licensing of port employers as proposed by the Minister of labour would establish new vested interests in the ports; and two majorreorganisations of the system of port employment could not well becarried out within a period of two to three years. Moreover, therewas now no certainty that either the employers or the unions wouldbe prepared to proceed on the basis of the new Dock Labour scheme proposed in view of the possibilities of radical reorganisation setout in the Labour Party&apos;s Election Manifesto.On the other hand the Minister of Labour had emphasised that a radical reorganisation could certainly not be introduced for at least a further two years and that it would be wholly wrong totake no action meanwhile to deal with the evils of casual labour in the docks or the inefficiencies of their present working. Moreover,
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,10th March, 1966.the Minister considered that the agreement reached after difficult negotiations with the port employers and unions should not bediscarded when it could substantially alleviate the present problems.In discussion it proved the general view that the limited measure of reform based on the Devlin Report should not now be abandoned. To do so would leave the Government open to thecharge that they were abandoning a scheme which offered the chance of early improvement in the operation of the docks throughpractical measures agreed by employers and unions in favour ofa radical change in ownership and control adopted for doctrinairereasons. Nor would the urgency of improving the operation of the ports, particularly in relation to exports, permit the postponement of action until January 1969 which seemed to be the earliest date at which a basic change could be introduced. Moreover, Lord Brown,in his capacity as Chairman of the Modernisation Committee, had expressed doubt whether the radical reorganisation would, in any event, deal with some of the immediate and pressing problems which the short-term scheme was intended to solve. It was recognised that the announcement of the intention of theGovernment to introduce major changes in the ownership andcontrol of the ports would make the Minister of Labour&apos;s task in persuading employers and workers to co-operate in short-term measures more difficult: but every effort should be made to achieve their full support.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet took the view that the Minister of labour should proceed with the publication of the new draft Dock labour scheme and with the necessary negotiations. These would have totake place against the background of the Governmenfs intentionto introduce in due course a radical reorganisation of portownership and control.The Cabinet \\Approved C (66) 54.
