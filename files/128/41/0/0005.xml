2. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that the six countries members of the European Economic Community (e.c.)had recently met in Luxembourg in an attempt to resolve the differences which had developed between the French Governmenton the one hand and the Five Governments on the other hand.The outcome had not been wholly satisfactory to either party; butit might be thought that the Five had, on balance, derived greaterprofit from the encounter. The French Government could claim that they would still retain a virtual veto on the issue of majorityvoting in the Community; but this would not necessarily confer any practical advantage on them, since it had always been implicit inthe working of the Community that the principle of unanimitycould not, in practice, coerce any member Government to accepta decision which they judged to be contrary to their major national interests. It was perhaps more significant that the meeting had shown that the French Government were not prepared, in theevent, to implement their threat to leave the Community if the outcome was not to their satisfaction; and, to this extent, therewere some grounds for hoping that they would be more cautious in adopting tactics of this kind in the future.The results of the meeting did not suggest that there was likelyto be any opportunity in the immediate future for an initiative by ourselves to enter into closer relations with the e.c..The Foreign Secretary said that, during the recent period inwhich the United States Government had suspended bombing operations against North Vietnam, we had maintained continuouscontact with the Government of North Vietnam and with otherCommunist Governments, in the hope of establishing conditions inwhich negotiations to end the hostilities in Vietnam might be started. But there had been no response to our initiatives; and the1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet considered the position which the Governmentshould adopt in relation to two Private Member&apos;s Bills, on SexualOffences and Abortion respectively, which would come forward for debate in the House of Commons in the near future. Theyendorsed the recommendation of the Home Affairs Committeethat the Government as a whole should adopt an attitude of neutrality in both instances, on the understanding that this neednot preclude individual Ministers from expressing, if they sowished, personal sympathy with the objectives of the proposed legislation and that, in the case of the Abortion Bill, it might be appropriate to offer to make available the services of the officialdraftsman to assist in the preparation of any measure which might appear to be acceptable in principle to the House.
latest statement issued by the authorities in North Vietnam, by insisting that negotiations could not begin unless the United StatesGovernment were willing unconditionally to cease all forms of attack on North Vietnam and to recognise the Viet Cong as the sole representative of the Vietnamese people, suggested that theattitude of the Government of North Vietnam had not changed.In these circumstances the United States Government had had no alternative but to resume bombing attacks on Vietnam. In astatement which had been issued by the Foreign Office we had indicated that we understood and supported this action. In thecircumstances, however, we could have adopted no other attitude;and we should have been subject to even greater embarrassment ifwe had attempted either to defer any public indication of our attitude or to evade the issue of the extent to which United states policy had our general endorsement. The United StatesGovernment had now referred the issue to the Security Council;and we should therefore take this further opportunity to renew our efforts to promote a settlement in the context of a reconvenedGeneva Conference.In discussion considerable disquiet was expressed about the impact, particularly on the Governments supporters in theHouse of Commons, of the Foreign Office statement on the resumption of United States bombing of North Vietnam. It was unfortunate that the Cabinet had not been given an opportunityto express a collective view on the wording of this statement,particularly since its apparently uncritical endorsement of UnitedStates policy might involve the Government in subsequentembarrassment if it became clear that, so far from promoting anend of the hostilities, the United States action was merelyaggravating the tension. On the other hand criticism of this kind could be argued to do less than justice to the efforts which boththe United States Government and we ourselves had made topromote negotiations for a peaceful solution of the dispute. It was our own initiative which had originally persuaded the UnitedStates Government to institute a short bombing truce overChristmas and to extend it thereafter for a longer period than theyhad originally envisaged. It had always been implicit in this initiative that if, having responded to our pressure in this respect,they failed to elicit any response from the Government of north vietnam, they would have no alternative but to resume the bombing attacks, particularly in the light of the increasing number of casulties which their forces were sustaining. It was unreasonable to expect them in these circumstances to accept the unilateral terms which the Government of North Vietnam, in their most recentstatement, had stipulated as conditions of negotiation; nor could we ourselves hope to retain our influence in working for therestoration of peace in Vietnam if we sought to press the UnitedStates Government beyond the point of concession which they haddemonstrated, by the recent truce in the bombing, that they wereprepared to contemplate. Both we and they had shown greatpatience in the face of unduly critical attacks on our policies inrelation to Vietnam; it was now for others to show a similar
Legislation on        3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the chancellor the Docks       of the Exchequer (C(66) 21) on proposals for legislation for improving the efficiency of the docks.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Committeeof Ministers which had been considering this issue had agreedupon proposals for a Bill to be presented jointly by the Ministerof Labour and the Minister of Transport. The Bill would havefour main features:(i) It would provide for a system for licensing port employers,so as to enable port authorities to promote a reduction in thenumber of employers. This was an essential preliminary to fulldecasualisation and the provision of regular employment for alldock workers. The licensing authorities would be port authorities(not the National Ports Council as recommended by the DevlinReport); employers would have a right of appeal to the Ministeragainst a decision by a port authority, and the National PortsCouncil would also have the right to make objection to the Ministeragainst a port authority&apos;s proposals.(ii) The Bill would place responsibility for the provision of welfare amenities on employers who owned their own dockfacilities and, in other cases, on port authorities.(iii) Harbour authorities would be given more powers topromote port efficiency, including powers to acquire land and facilities and also to enable them to operate inland depots in orderto reduce congestion at ports.(iv) The Minister of Transport would be given power to direct the National Ports Council to submit particular schemes of reorganisation, and powers to settle the lines of the investment programmes of independent harbour authorities.A study of the implications of even more substantial changesin the ownership and reorganisation of the docks was in hand butthe Committee believed that the action he had outlined wasnecessary whatever further measures might be required at a later date.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the study inquestion was now expected to be completed within the next fewweeks. Some of the provisions in the proposed Bill might prove tobe inappropriate if the  Government were contemplating the degree of restraint while we continued our efforts to promote asettlement of the dispute on reasonable and honourable terms.From this point of view, it was satisfactory that a Motion which had now been tabled in the House of Commons, endorsing theGovernments policy, had already attracted a very considerable measure of support from the Governments supporters in theHouse.
introduction of more far-reaching changes in the docks at an earlydate and since the timetable for the study of such changes hadbeen accelerated, it might be preferable not to take decisions onthe legislation now proposed, despite its urgency, until it could beconsidered in the wider context.The Cabinet Agreed to resume consideration of C (66) 21 at a later meeting.public expenditure(previous reference:CC(66) 3rdConclusions,Minute 7)Rounding-off of DefermentArrangements4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C (66) 22) on proposals for modifying thearrangements for slowing down the rate of expenditure on capital projects and on stores and equipment in the public sector.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the measures announced in July 1965 had included arrangements for the deferment for six months of all capital expenditure projects otherthan those in certain exempted classes (notably housing and school building). This was a continuous &quot; rolling forward &quot; by six monthsuntil further notice of all projects affected. While it was essentialto retain the benefit of these savings, the time that had elapsedmade it no longer possible to continue to operate in terms ofdeferred projects. The continuation of these arrangements would therefore be in terms of new expenditure limits: departments would work out the expenditure which would have arisen in 1966-67on projects deferred in the first six months of the operation of thescheme, and would deduct that sum from the planned capitalexpenditure limit for the year. The resulting sum would be their new limit on capital expenditure for 1966-67, and they would beable to re-programme investment within that limit. This principlehad been applied in preparing the 1966-67 Estimates and the&apos;methods of its application had been agreed with the ministers concerned. He proposed to make a statement in the House ofCommons on this matter, on the lines of the draft attached to his memorandum.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The particular form of the arrangements proposed wouldhave a serious impact upon the Home Office capital expenditure programme, particularly in respect of the police: if there were noadjustment, they would be unable to start any new operationalprojects. Any modification to take account of this point wouldnot prejudice the programme of other Ministers.(b) The Foreign Office and the Ministry of Public Building and works would discuss with the Treasury the programme for capitalexpenditure on buildings for the Diplomatic Service in 1967-68 and subsequent years.
Gas Industry 5.   The Minister of Power said that the Gas Council and theNorth Sea Gas British Petroleum Company (BP) were now ready to conclude anagreement on the supply of gas from the North Sea. The gas council had for some time been concerned about the supply and price of naphtha, on which most of their new processes depended,and had therefore been investigating the possibility of easing their position by the additional use of natural gas from abroad. He had warned them that, when there were possibilities of United KingdomCC 5 (66)(c) It would be convenient if the Chancellor of the exchequer could make his proposed statement not later than 8th February.(d) It would be helpful to add to the second paragraph of thedraft statement an indication that the deferment had contributednot only to the improvement in the balance of payments but alsoto reducing the load on the building industry which had restrictednew housing.(e) The intention to modify the form of control on capitalexpenditure rather than to relax it might not be sufficiently clear from the third paragraph of the draft statement, and particularly from the penultimate sentence.(/) The position of the classes of capital expenditure exempted from the six months&apos; deferment should be made clear.(g) It was suggested that the fourth paragraph of the draft statement should be modified to make it clear that special consideration would be given for local authority projects in development areas. In view of the wide extension of thedevelopment areas, however, this could amount to a substantialrelaxation, and the balance of opinion was that it would be preferable not to amend the statement on these lines. This aspectwould nevertheless require further consideration thereafter.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals by the Chancellor of the exchequer for modifying the arrangements for slowing down therate of expenditure on capital projects and on stores and equipment in the public sector.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to amend the draft statement annexed to his memorandum to take accountof the points made in discussion and to circulate a revised version to the Public Expenditure Committee.(3) Subject to Conclusion (2), agreed that the Chancellor of theExchequer should make an early statement on his proposals in the House of Commons.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the HomeSecretary to consider how these arrangements should beapplied to capital expenditure on Home Office Votes.
supplies, it would be difficult to justify any further imports, whichhad to be undertaken on the basis of long-term commitments oversome 15-20 years. BP had put forward proposals for a very rapidexploitation of their North Sea drillings. This they believed to bein the national interest though it involved certain risks. They had originally sought a price from the Gas Council of 6d. a therm,while the Council for their part had offered 4d. plus an additional contribution of a \d. a therm for a limited period towards the installation of a larger marine pipe than BP regarded ascommercially justifiable at the outset. Agreement had beenreached between them on a price of 5d. a therm, on a temporary basis and without any contribution by the Gas Council to the costof the marine pipe. This price was valid only up to an averagedelivery of 100 million cubic feet a day and for a period of threeyears from the date of commencement of a guaranteed supply orfrom 1st July, 1967, whichever was the earlier. Above the stipulatedquantity in the first three years and for all supplies thereafter, theprice would be for re-negotiation. BP would from the outset andat their own risk provide a marine pipe capable of carrying200 million cubic feet a day and the Gas Council would make atleast equivalent provision on land. The price which had beenagreed was substantially below the price of 6^d. a therm in the contract for the supply of gas from Algeria, was lower than theestimated price of 5T8d. for imported methane gas from Nigeriaand was competitive with the estimated price of Dutch gas havingregard to the lower quality of the latter which contained some15 per cent nitrogen.There was no question of fixing now a price for North Sea gasin general. With the discovery of larger quantities and some experience of costs we could reasonably look for a significant reduction below 5d. a therm. The longer-term issues involved would be the subject of interdepartmental examination; meanwhile,it would be made clear that the price which had been fixed was alimited and temporary arrangement without prejudice to the longer term. Subject to the approval of the Cabinet, he proposed to make an oral statement to this effect in the House of Commons onFriday, 4th February.In discussion anxiety was expressed that the agreement whichhad been reached should in no way prejudice the prospect of a substantially lower price for North Sea Gas in the longer term.In particular it was suggested that, if the cost of production werelater shown to permit a substantially lower price for the total supply from BP, it might be desirable to re-negotiate the price forthe initial quantity of 100 million cubic feet a day in the first three years. It was, however, pointed out that, if quantitiessubstantially beyond 100 million cubic feet a day became available,it would be possible to fix a much lower price for these which wouldgive a reasonable rate when averaged over the whole production.It was moreover reasonable that at the outset an agreement shouldbe made in the terms proposed, having regard to the initial risks andthe desirability of encouraging the earliest possible exploitation of
IndustrialDisputesThreat of aNational RailStrike(previous reference:CC(65) 40thConclusions,Minute 3)6. The Home Secretary said that, although the official committee on Emergencies had considered the measures whichwould be required should the railway strike which was threatenedfor 14th February take place, he had so far postponed any meetingof the Ministerial Committee on Emergencies with a view to action being initiated, since these measures involved consultation withoutside organisations. Such consultations would inevitably become known and might therefore adversely affect the efforts which werebeing made to avoid a strike. The initiation of these precautionscould, however, no longer be postponed if they were to becompleted by the time the strike was due to take place; he therefore proposed to hold a meeting of the Ministerial Committeethat afternoon and to proceed thereafter with the necessary consultations if the Committee so agreed.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be imprudent to delay further the initiation of the necessaryprecautionary measures unless there were developments during thecourse of the day which offered a substantially more hopefulprospect that the strike would be avoided.The Cabinet Took note of the Home Secretary&apos;s statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,3rd February, 1966.the North Sea gas supplies; and it would be made clear that therewas no question of the initial agreement prejudicing the negotiation of the price for later contracts, whether with BP or with other companies which had concessions in the North Sea.The Cabinet Agreed that the Minister of Power should make astatement on the agreement between the Gas Council andthe British Petroleum Company for the supply of gas fromthe North Sea in the terms which he proposed.
