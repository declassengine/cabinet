confidential parliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Lord President said that the arrangements for the debate onforeign affairs would depend on the outcome of the forthcoming meeting between the Prime Minister and his colleagues on the onehand and Mr. Smith, the leader of the illegal regime in Rhodesia, andhis advisers on the other. As regards the Christmas Recess it was atpresent contemplated that Parliament would adjourn on Wednesday,21st December and reassemble on Wednesday, 18th January, but thistimetable might require reconsideration in the light of subsequentdevelopments.Oversea AffairsThe foreign secretary&apos;s visit to Moscow(previous reference:CC (66) 50thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that his recent visit to Moscowhad shown that the Soviet Government no longer maintained a whollynegative attitude on a number of major international issues. they wished to keep discussions in progress and believed that we could help to find a solution for some of them. A considerable part of histime had been devoted to discussions on Vietnam and, while the line taken by the Soviet leaders did not differ in substance from that whichthey had pursued hitherto, the tone of the discussion was less harsh:it appeared that they were anxious to know our views on various possible ways by which negotiations to end the conflict might beachieved and they recognised that, while the United StatesGovernment were anxious to bring hostilities to an end, the recentelections to Congress had increased pressure upon them to adoptsterner military measures.The Soviet Government were clearly concerned to reach agreement on a treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons,though they were proving extremely difficult in negotiation on its text.On this issue, they preferred to deal directly with the United StatesGovernment. It would be necessary to concert in the near futurebetween the United Kingdom Ministers concerned what attitude weshould adopt on the issues of particular importance to our interests.In contrast to the Soviet attitude on this issue, however, there hadbeen a setback to the possibility of securing a treaty to ban nuclear tests underground. It had been hoped that in consequence of therecent visit to Moscow by Sir Solly Zuckerman, the Chief scientific adviser to the Government, there might be a further meeting between united Kingdom, United States and Soviet scientists leading to an agreed scientific view on the level of explosions which could bedetected without the necessity for inspections of the site. It appeared,however, that the Soviet scientists had gone beyond their brief in thediscussions with Sir Solly Zuckerman and that the Soviet military
authorities wished to maintain their freedom to continue undergroundtests.As regards Europe, the Soviet leaders were concerned to secure agreement to the holding of a European Security Conference andwere attracted by our proposals for a joint European declaration of principles. They had come no way to meet us on the discussions regarding the United Kingdom claims for compensation. He had warned them that we could not accept indefinite delay beforedistributing to the claimants the Russian assets which we held. Atthe very end of his visit they had made a very minor concession inrelation to Mr. Gerald Brooke, in that they had agreed that theBritish Consul should be allowed to see him. This was not significantin itself, since under international law there was already the right tosuch visits, but it might indicate the possibility of a more substantialgesture at a later stage.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Foreign Secretary andcongratulated him on the outcome of his visit.Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (66) 61stConclusions,Minute 1)MandatorySanctionsSECRET3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C (66) 173), to which was attached a reportby officials on the resolution to be introduced at the United nations for mandatory sanctions on selected Rhodesian exports and for ageneral oil embargo.The Commonwealth Secretary recalled that at the Meeting theprevious September of Commonwealth Prime Ministers we had saidthat, given an assurance of the full support of commonwealth representatives at the United Nations (UN) for our proposals, weshould be prepared to agree to the passage by the Security Councilof &quot; resolutions under Chapter VII of the UN Charter providing formandatory sanctions on certain selected exports from Rhodesia and,perhaps at a somewhat later stage, on the import of oil into Rhodesiavia Mozambique&quot;. In considering how best to implement this undertaking (action which would be contingent on the outcome ofthe forthcoming meeting with Mr. Smith, the leader of the illegal regime) the Ministers primarily concerned had been guided by thefollowing considerations:(i) The sanctions should cause the maximum economic damage to the illegal regime.(ii) We  needed  to  safeguard  the   economic interests  ofneighbouring friendly countries in Southern Africa, suchas Zambia, Malawi and Botswana.(iii) The sanctions must be sufficiently credible to preserve theexistence of the multiracial Commonwealth.
CC 62 (66)(iv) The United Kingdom must in its own interest avoid being drawn into direct economic confrontation with SouthAfrica.In the light of these considerations Ministers had agreed that theresolution which we would co-sponsor in the Security Council should provide for mandatory sanctions on the export from Rhodesia ofasbestos, iron ore, chrome, pig iron, sugar, tobacco, copper, meat and meat products and hides, skins and leather. Furthermore, in view of thepossibility that British motor vehicle plants in Rhodesia might be usedfor the assembly of foreign cars, the possibility of a sanction shouldbe held in reserve on the export by foreign manufacturing countries of assembly parts for Rhodesia: meanwhile, we should seekassurances from the British motor car manufacturers that they wouldreject any proposal by their Rhodesia subsidiaries to assemble motor vehicles manufactured in a country other than the United Kingdom.Parallel assurances should be sought from the Governments of countries with substantial motor industries. Consideration had alsobeen given for the possibility of mandatory sanctions on new investment in Rhodesia, but this would be ineffective in the absence ofthe operation of a comprehensive system of exchange control by all members of the UN.The proposal for a limited embargo on oil supplies from rhodesia through Mozambique had been discussed early in theprevious November with a number of friendly Governments and itappeared that there would be no hope of obtaining agreement at theSecurity Council for such a limitation. In the light of further discussions directed to securing African co-operation at the security council, it was therefore proposed that we should be prepared toaccept a general oil embargo, although we need not commit ourselvesat this stage to sponsoring it. The drafts of the consequent resolutionsrelating to selected mandatory sanctions and to the oil embargo were attached to his memorandum. A final decision had yet to be takenwhether our vital reservation on oil sanctions that we would on no account become involved in enforcement measures against SouthAfrica should be made openly at the UN, or whether it should bea matter for confidential understanding between members of theCommonwealth. On the one hand, a public statement wouldreassure the South Africans that we were not embarking on a courseof confrontation and would hence avoid the possibility that, in anticipation of such a development, retaliatory action would be takenby the South African Government and South African firms, with consequent grave damage to our commercial and economic interest.Furthermore, if we made no public statement at this stage, it mightbe more difficult to resist subsequent pressure for more stringentmeasures of enforcement. On the other hand, a public statement atthe outset might well be regarded by our African Commonwealthpartners as giving public notice that South Africa could defy theUN resolution with impunity. The precise course which should beadopted in the light of these conflicting considerations would call for further discussion by the Ministers immediately concerned should
the forthcoming meeting between the Prime Minister and Mr. Smithfail to achieve a settlement. Subject to that aspect, the selectedmandatory sanctions which were proposed should have little or no additional adverse effect upon our economy, since they comprisedmeasures which we were already applying to the best of our abilityon a voluntary basis, but they would make it more difficult for othercountries to trade with Rhodesia.In discussion there was general agreement with the proposals ofthe Commonwealth Secretary. It was noted that these had noimplications for military action by the United Kingdom to enforceany of the measures which were contemplated. There was alsogeneral agreement with a suggestion that the proposed measuresrelating to the assembly of motor car parts in Rhodesia should beparalleled by action relating to aircraft parts.discussions with Mr. Smith(previous reference:CC (66) 61stConclusions,Minute 1)The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, in the event of a failure to reach a settlement atthe forthcoming meeting between the Prime Minister andMr. Smith, the leader of the illegal regime in Rhodesia,action in respect of resolutions at the United Nations formandatory sanctions relating to Rhodesia should be inaccordance with the proposals in the report attached toC (66) 173, subject to the point agreed in discussionrelating to aircraft parts.(2) Took note that in the event of such action being necessary,the means by which we should make known ourreservation on oil sanctions that we would on no accountbe involved in enforcement measures against SouthAfrica would be a matter for further discussion betweenthe Ministers primarily concerned.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that Mr. Smith had now agreed to come to a meeting on the conditions which had beenapproved by the Cabinet at their previous discussion. It was clearthat he had welcomed the proposal and was anxious to reach asettlement, but there still remained a wide gap between the terms which he was willing to concede and the minimum which was acceptable to us. It must therefore remain seriously in doubt whether the meeting would lead to a settlement. Undue expectations ofsuccess followed by a breakdown might have damaging consequences for our economy and it was important to make clear the fact thatwe were not entering into the discussions because of our concern a tour economic position and that the mandatory sanctions which weenvisaged would not involve further damaging economic consequences for us. One more hopeful aspect of the situation was that it appeared that the South African Government were bringing considerable pressure upon Mr. Smith to agree to a settlement.The Ministers primarily concerned had discussed further sincethe last meeting of the Cabinet the terms on which we must insist ina settlement and he and his colleagues who would go to the meeting would, in the exercise of the discretion which had been given to them,be guided by the general views of the Cabinet on these issues.
-7   395CC 62 (66)The Foreign Secretary, speaking on behalf of the Cabinet, saidthat they were very conscious of the grave difficulties and extremedelicacy of the issues which would confront the Prime Minister andhis colleagues at the forthcoming meeting and warmly assured him of their support and good wishes.PublicExpenditureLocal AuthorityCurrentExpenditure(England andWales) 1967-68and 1968-69(previous reference:CC (66) 56thConclusions,Minute 6)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C (66) 176) bythe Minister of Housing and Local Government on local authoritycurrent expenditure (England and Wales) 1967-68 and 1968-69.The Minister of Housing and Local Government recalled that on10th November the Cabinet had approved proposals by theChancellor of the Exchequer for further cuts, beyond reductions for over-estimating, of  30 million in 1967-68 and  45 million in 1968-69in the estimates of local authority expenditure for the purpose of fixing the total of rate support grant, but had agreed that if theseproposals met strong and well-founded objections, the matter shouldbe reconsidered.   He had accordingly, with the other ministers concerned, met representatives of the local authorities.  They hadfully accepted that in the light of the present economic situation localauthorities should play their part in reducing the rate of growth ofpublic expenditure, but they had strongly emphasised two points:first, that the Government must make a clear statement of policy onthe need to restrict the growth of public expenditure; and second, thatthe cuts in their expenditure as large as those Ministers had proposedcould not in fact be achieved.   They had asked that the totalreductions  in  their  estimates   (including  those  in  respect  ofoverestimating) should be abated by  80 million and  90 million in thetwo years concerned, and had been told that their views would beconsidered, though without much hope being held out that they would prove acceptable.   Since circulating his memorandum, he had discussed the matter with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and agreedthat in all the circumstances it would be right to abate by  10 million in 1967-68 and  20 million in 1968-69 the further reductionsprovisionally approved by the Cabinet, so that the estimates of localauthority current expenditure at mid-November 1966 prices, for thepurpose of fixing the rate support grant would then be  2,557 million for 1967-68 and  2,726 million for 1968-69.  If this solution were accepted by the Cabinet, officials of the Departments concerned should now meet to consider how the authorised expenditure shouldbe allocated and how the decision should be presented to the localauthorities.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was important thatthe local authorities should be given the backing of a firmGovernment statement on the need to restrict the growth of public expenditure, so as to make clear that the reductions now proposedrepresented a deliberate Government decision designed to encourageeconomy. The Government should also make it clear to them thatit was hoped that the rates would not be increased.
In discussion the following points were made:(a) The discussions between the Departments concerned and theTreasury about the final allocation of expenditure within the totalwhich it was now proposed to authorise would afford Departmentsan opportunity to make any points to which they attached special importance.(b) It would be necessary to make clear in the proposed statement by the Government that the reductions in local authority expenditure were not intended to affect expenditure on the high priorityprogrammes of housing, schools and hospitals, which the Governmenthad undertaken in July to exempt from their measures of economy.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the estimates of local authority current expenditure for the purpose of fixing the total of the rate support grant should be  2,557 million in 1967-68 and 2,726 million in 1968-69.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of housing and Local Government to arrange for theallocation of this expenditure to be considered by theDepartments concerned.(3) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government to concert with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theother Ministers concerned with local authority services astatement setting the Cabinet&apos;s decisions on reductions in local authority expenditure in the context of the present economic situation and of the need to restrain the growth of public expenditure generally.PublicExpenditureHelp towardsHomeOwnership:Draft white paper(previous reference:CC (66) 57thConclusions,Minute 2)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of housing and Local Government (C (66) 175) to which was attached adraft White Paper on the Governments Option Mortgage Scheme.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that subjectto the Cabinets approval of the draft it was proposed to publish theWhite Paper at the same time as the Housing Subsidies Bill on 5th December, 1966.In discussion there was general agreement that a White paper should be published on the lines of the draft; any further drafting amendments should not be allowed to blur the clarity of the account which the present draft gave of what was inevitably a complex scheme.The following points were also made:(a) The arrangements for endowment mortgages, as described inparagraph 9, had been agreed with the institutions concerned.(b) Though the scheme would not be operative until 1st April,1968, existing borrowers would in general have to make their choicenot later than 31st December, 1967, whether to switch to the optionmortgage scheme. The dates mentioned in paragraph 15 were thusconsistent with the Governments decision on the operative date.
$    396CC 62 (66)(c) Paragraph 17 put forward administrative and practicaldifficulties as the reason for not making the scheme operative until 1st April, 1968. It would be difficult to introduce the scheme before then, but not impossible, and the Governments decision to defer thedate of operation until 1st April, 1968, had not been based primarily on grounds of administrative difficulty but rather on broad economic grounds. The validity of the reason given in the draft for delay was likely to be challenged in the House of Commons and elsewhere.Rather than attribute the delay to difficulties of this kind, it would be preferable to indicate in paragraph 17 simply that the Governmenthad decided that the scheme should be fully operative from 1st April,1968. A consequential amendment would need to be made inparagraph 25.The Cabinet (1) Approved the draft White Paper on the GovernmentsOption Mortgage Scheme attached to C (66) 175, subjectto amendments on the lines agreed in discussion andsubject also to any further amendments of a purelydrafting nature.(2) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government, inconsultation with the Lord President of the Council, toarrange for the publication of the White Paper on 5th December, 1966.DecimalCurrencyDraft white paper(previous reference:CC(66) 55thConclusions,Minute 3)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C (66) 174) to which was attached a draft white paper on Decimal Currency in the United Kingdom.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was desirable thatthe White Paper should be published at an early date to announce the Governments decisions on the coinage, to explain the reasons forchoosing the  -cent system of decimalising the currency and enablethe necessary planning and preparations to proceed. He hoped thatit would be possible shortly to set up the Decimal Currency Board;he had invited Sir William Fiske to be Chairman and Lord Erroll tobe the Deputy Chairman of the Board.In discussion it was suggested that the case for adopting the -cent system was argued too defensively in the draft. Chapter IIImight be amended to avoid this impression. It was also suggestedthat the title &quot; new penny &quot; for the minor unit in the new system would be unnecessarily cumbersome. On the other hand it waspointed out that the word &quot; new &quot; would be( retained only during the transitional period. Whatever official title might be given to the newminor unit, it was probable that the public would continue to call it a penny, and it would be better that official nomenclature shouldcorrespond with public use.
confidential the Cabinet (1) Approved the draft White Paper on Decimal Currencyattached to C (66) 174, subject to the revision of chapter III on the lines suggested in discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Lord President of the Council, to arrange for thepublication of the White Paper on 12th December, 1966.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,1st December, 1966.
