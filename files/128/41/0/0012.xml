SubjectLocal Government FinanceDraft White Paper
The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of housing and Local Government (C (66) 37) to which was attached adraft White Paper on Local Government Finance.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that thesubstance of the White Paper followed decisions taken by the Cabinetin September 1965 (CC (65) 48th Conclusions, Minute 1) and inJanuary 1966 (CC (66) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 2 and 4thConclusions, Minute 3). Its main purpose was to set these decisions in perspective: the proposals were presented not as a long-termsolution but as a temporary measure designed to make rates astolerable as possible until such time as a reform of the structure oflocal government enabled major changes to be made in the structure of local government finance. It was important that the White paper should not commit the Government to abandon entirely the systemof rates as a source of local government finance since it might in theevent be necessary to retain it, though in a much improved form.Certain amendments to the text were desirable in order to emphasise that the criticism of rates applied only to their present form. Equally,however, the White Paper should not commit the Government toretaining the system if developments over the years made possibleits replacement by other sources of revenue such as a local income tax.For the next few years all that was possible was to establish a new method of assessing the proportion of local expenditure met byExchequer grants and to meet a steadily rising proportion of this expenditure year by year. In addition he proposed to include provision for the rating of empty property. Although this might inpractice yield only about  5 million a year in additional revenue, itwould remove what was widely regarded as an unfair aspect of the rating system.In discussion it was suggested that it would be preferable not to publish a White Paper at the present stage, but for a statement to bemade on the immediate changes which the Government proposed,since on the one hand the present proposals fell substantially short of the far-reaching changes in the system which had been indicatedin the Labour Party Manifesto and on the other hand it would be imprudent to make such severe criticisms of the rating system withoutany certainty that an alternative method could be found of raising the large sums which were required for local government expenditure.Rates still formed a lesser burden in relation to the gross national product or to personal incomes than in 1938 and there did not appearto be any alternative to maintaining the rating system in some form as the major source of revenue of local authorities. Furthermore,the early publication of the White Paper might be embarrassing inrelation to current discussions with the local; authorities, both inEngland and Wales, and also in Scotland. A White Paper on the rating system in Scotland would also be necessary if one were published in respect of England and Wales.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the rate of increase ofthe cost of services administered by local authorities was now so
great that an annual increase in the rates of the order of 10 per centwas necessary. Given the lack of buoyancy in the rating system,such a rate of increase would soon cease to be tolerable and it wastherefore essential to find means both of making the system lessregressive and of supplementing it as a local source of revenue. TheGovernment had created expectations of a major change in thesystem of local government finance and it was necessary to explainwhy it was not at present practicable to proceed with any major change while at the same time showing that the government recognised the disadvantages of the present system. It was thereforeon balance desirable to issue the White Paper, but the criticism of the rating system in paragraphs 5-7 should be amended to avoid any impression that the Government envisaged the possibility of eventuallyabolishing the rating system altogether.The First Secretary of State, summing up this part of thediscussion, said that the general view of the Cabinet was in favourof publishing the White Paper. The doubts which had been raisedaffected primarily paragraphs 5-7 of the present draft, which shouldbe redrafted in the light of the discussion. The redraft should leaveopen the possibility of a complete recasting of the rating system andof finding additional sources of local government finance to supplement the rates. A White Paper would also be necessary, in parallel with that proposed, to deal with the changes in the rating system in Scotland. Time would not permit the draft of such a paper to be circulated to the Cabinet and the text should thereforebe agreed by the Secretary of State for Scotland with the ministers primarily concerned.In further consideration of the draft White Paper a number of drafting amendments were agreed and the following main points weremade:(a) The reference to the review of local government inparagraph 9 should include a suitable reference to Wales.(b) The reference to the rating of empty property should be ingeneral terms since agreement had not yet been reached on details.(c) In paragraphs 19 and 20 the effect on the individual ratepayerof the Governmenfs proposal should be brought out as clearly aspossible.(d) A paragraph should be included describing the proposed changes in the highways grant, even though this might draw attentionto the absence of changes in connection with other specific grantssuch as education.The First Secretary of State, summing up the discussion, saidthat the White Paper should now be redrafted by the Minister of housing, in consultation with the Ministers concerned, in the lightof the Cabinefs discussion. Any further drafting points which ministers might wish to make should be sent direct to the Ministerof Housing. The White Papers in respect of England and Wales,on the one hand, and in respect of Scotland on the other, should bepublished on Friday, 25th February.
The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Minister of Transport, to amend the White Paper inthe light of their discussion and, in consultation with theLord President of the Council, to publish it on Friday,25th February.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to arrange forthe simultaneous publication of a similar White Paper on local Government Finance in Scotland.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd February, 1966.
