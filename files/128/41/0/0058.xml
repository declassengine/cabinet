ParliamentPrices andIncomesPolicy:Draft white paper onPeriod ofSevereRestraint(previous reference:CC (66) 56thConclusions,Minute 5)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The First Secretary of State recalled that in previous discussionof the draft White Paper on Prices and Incomes Criteria during thePeriod of Severe Restraint the Cabinet had agreed that a simplerexplanatory document should be prepared for release to the Presswhen the White Paper itself was published. On further consideration,he doubted whether this would be appropriate: the Press conferenceswhich he proposed to hold, especially with the industrialcorrespondents, might be more effective without such a document.In discussion it was the general view that the public presentation of the White Paper, the terms of which were unavoidably involved and difficult of interpretation, would be a matter of great importance.To this end, it would be desirable for the First Secretary of state to explain the measures to an appropriate group of Members ofParliament and to see both the Lobby and the industrialcorrespondents. There were conflicting considerations relating to thepreparation of a simpler explanatory statement for any of these purposes and this would be a matter for him to consider in the lightof the discussion.The Cabinet-Invited the First Secretary of State to have regard to thepoints raised in discussion in considering the public presentation of the White Paper on Prices and IncomesCriteria during the Period of Severe Restraint.OverseaAffairsIran(previous reference:CC (65) 5thConclusions,Minute 2)soviet union(previous reference:CC (66) 56thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that a dispute had developedbetween the Government of Iran, on the one hand, and theinternational oil consortium on the other, primarily over the level of oil production in Iran: it might reach a critical stage in the nearfuture, calling for urgent Ministerial consideration. The Shah waspersonally involved. One difficulty which we might face in respectof our own interests was the reluctance of the United States membersof the consortium to accept the need for some concession to the viewsof the Iranian Government and there was a risk that the latter might take unilateral action.Some of the members of the Soviet delegation at present payingwhat was nominally a parliamentary visit to the United kingdom were of particular importance and it would be helpful if, wherever practicable, senior Ministers could meet them.
Nigeria(previous reference:CC (66) 52ndConclusions,Minute 4)Zambia(previous reference:CC (66) 54thConclusions,Minute 2)The Commonwealth Secretary said that there was little outwardchange in the situation in Nigeria, which remained tense. We wereplaying a part in the efforts which were being made to achieve ameeting between Colonel Gowon, the Head of the military government, and Colonel Ojukwu, Military Governor, EasternRegion, to discuss a modus vivendi between the Northern and eastern Regions.There had been no further disturbances on the Copper Belt inZambia. We had been the subject of vicious attacks in recentspeeches by President Kaunda, both in Zambia and at the united nations. It was noteworthy that these coincided with a request fromthe Zambian High Commissioner that we should provide additional assistance to Zambia in supplying railway wagons.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretaries.ParliamentParliamentaryProcedureandSpecialistCommittees(previous reference:CC (66) 19thConclusions,Minute 4)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (C (66) 163) on parliamentary procedure and specialist committees.The Lord President said that there would shortly be a debate inthe House of Commons on the recommendations of the SelectCommittee of Procedure. These had been considered by the ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedure, which had agreed that a number of changes should be proposed.The recommendations on financial procedure of the SelectCommittee were generally acceptable: any necessary legislation could probably be included in a Finance Bill. The Opposition would support the appointment of a Select Committee on Science and technology and had suggested that it might start with a study of theannual reports of the Research Councils and the policy of theUniversity Grants Committee towards science and technology. TheOpposition would also have accepted as an experiment in the current session a committee on the work of a single Department: but the ministerial Committee had considered that, quite apart from thedifficulty of finding a suitable Ministry, there would be difficulty inmanning a second Specialist Committee, bearing in mind the need to establish a new Select Committee to supervise the work of theParliamentary Commissioner. The proposal to establish a SpecialistCommittee to cover the work of a single Department should not therefore be pursued for the present Session.The Select Committee had recommended that, experimentally,there should be two morning sittings a week on the lines proposedto them by his predecessor, save that adjournment debates and certain other business should not be moved to the morning. The ministerial committee considered that this might prejudice the success of the
experiment since there was unlikely to be sufficient non-controversialbusiness to fill the morning sittings. It was therefore proposed thatMinisterial statements of secondary importance, which at presentwere generally made as answers to written questions, should be takenin the mornings and, further, that a new form of debate on topicalquestions should be introduced on one of the mornings as an experiment. The procedure for raising these debates would be thesame as for applications under Standing Order No. 9, except thatapplications would not have to be raised at the first opportunity,and the element of urgency, as at present understood, would notapply. If leave were given, the debate would take place on the nextavailable opportunity in the same week; it might last for one-and-a-half hours; the duration of speeches might be limited and divisions and counts would be barred. These new debates were likely to be popular with back benchers and might relieve the pressure for the relaxation of Standing Order No. 9: the Speaker, who had been consulted, was generally in favour, provided that the necessarySessional Order did not involve too much being left to his discretion in dealing with applications. The Ministerial Committee consideredthat the morning sittings should be held on Monday and Wednesdayfor preference, or alternatively on Tuesday and Wednesday.The Select Committee had also recommended that an extraquarter-of-an-hour should be provided for questions on Mondays toThursdays, and that Friday sittings should be extended by an hour,but it had seemed to the Ministerial Committee that it would be preferable to gain experience of the other changes before reachingany decision on these proposals. He had also discussed with theOpposition the possibility of reducing the number of royal commissions for Bills, and hoped to reach agreement with themthat there should be only one of the present type of Commissions forBills and that this would take place at the end of the Session. Ashort Bill might be required. He proposed, in recommending allthese proposals to the House, to invite the Select Committee on procedure to concentrate on producing within a year a major reporton all other aspects of procedural reform: they might, however, begiven authority to appoint a Sub-Committee to deal with any minorpoints on which early recommendations would be useful. despite the Opposition^ decision to allow a free vote on morning sittings,there should be a Whip for Government supporters in any divisionsfollowing the debate.In discussion, there was general agreement, in view of the PrimeMinisters announcement on 21st April and the readiness of theOpposition to accept the idea of two specialised committees including an experimental committee on the work of a single Department, thatit would be desirable that the Governments proposals should not belimited to the setting up of a single Select Committee on Science and technology. The Select Committee needed to supervise the workof the Parliamentary Commissioner would be no substitute for aCommittee on the work of a Department. There was reason tobelieve that the Opposition would accept a proposal for a second
Specialist Committee in respect of the Ministry of Agriculture.Fisheries and Food. The Chairman of such a committee should bea Government supporter and it would be necessary for the Ministerof Agriculture to maintain a close control of the topics studied bythe committee. Although the object should be to study the work ofthe Ministry of Agriculture, policy in England and Wales could notbe wholly separated from that for Scotland and the Minister ofAgriculture should consult with the Secretaries of State for Scotlandand for Wales in framing detailed proposals for the new committee.In further discussion it was pointed out that the pressure formorning sittings, and much of that for topical debates, had largelydeveloped since the 1964 election among back benchers whose firstexperience of Parliament had been at a time of exceptional pressure.Morning sittings would be resisted by the Opposition and wouldalso make it difficult for Ministers to fulfil their proper role in their departments. Ministerial statements and topical debates would be particularly inconvenient as they would often involve senior Ministers.The object of introducing morning sittings was primarily to enablethe House to rise earlier in the evening: it was not consistent withthis approach to create new types of debate which would add to thetotal of Parliamentary business.On the other hand it was argued that the House had been encouraged to hope for some measure of Parliamentary reform andthat feeling in favour of morning sittings was by no means limitedto recently elected Members. The proposed business for the experimental morning sittings should save some time at the end ofthe Parliamentary day, although the Government would need to reserve the right to arrange late business if necessary. The Whipwould not be used for business taken in the morning, and there wouldbe no possibility of a count; senior Ministers&apos; departmental work should not therefore be much affected. It was important that the experiment should not fail because of a lack of interesting business,and the suggestions for topical debates might also forestall pressure for the relaxation of Standing Order No. 9.In further discussion of the proposed business for morningsittings, it was suggested that adjournment debates, despite the viewsof the Select Committee on Procedure, should be taken in the morning. There should not be much difficulty in filling the remainingtime in morning sittings with uncontroversial business; if furtherdebates were needed it would be better not to link them with theprocedure under Standing Order No. 9. If topical debates were totake place at all, their subjects should be chosen by the Government,not left to the discretion of the Speaker. But it might be better toavoid topical debates, and allocate any extra time to debates lasting,perhaps, an hour, on regional subjects, for which there was a growing demand.The following points were also made:(a) It was generally acceptable, and would be most convenient for the staff of the House, that morning sittings should be on Mondaysand Wednesdays.
(b) Although the Opposition were likely to allow their Membersa free vote on morning sittings, and there was some pressure for theGovernment to do likewise, steps should be taken to ensure thatGovernment supporters voted in sufficient numbers to ensure thatthe necessary Sessional Orders implementing the proposed changesin procedure were carried.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that a specialist committee on science and technology should be set up and favoured the appointment of one,experimentally for one year, on the work of the Ministry ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food. The Minister of Agriculture should now consider the proposal further, in consultation with the secretaries of State for Scotland and for Wales. The Cabinet were agreed inprinciple that, as an experiment during the current Session, thereshould be two morning sittings a week, on Mondays and Wednesdays.The business taken in the mornings should include adjournmentdebates and might also include short debates on regional matters.Otherwise the Cabinet approved the proposals of the ministerial committee on Parliamentary Procedure. He would discuss with theLord President the draft of the statement to be made in theforthcoming debate in the light of the Cabinets views and would,if necessary, arrange for it to be further discussed by Ministers.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland andthe Secretary of State for Wales, to consider in the lightof the discussion the possible establishment of a SelectCommittee on the work of his Department.(2) Agreed in principle that there should be experimentalmorning sittings on Mondays and Wednesdays, and thatthe business to be taken should be as proposed by theSelect Committee on Procedure, with the addition ofadjournment debates and, if time permitted, short debates on regional matters.(3) Approved the remaining proposals in C (66) 163.(4) Agreed that there should not be a free vote as far as government supporters were concerned in the forth-coming debate on procedure in the House of Commons.(5) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider, with theLord President of the Council, in the light of thediscussion, the statement to be made in the debate onthe Governments proposals.
public expenditure,1967-68(previous reference:CC (66) 57thConclusions,Minute 2)LocalAuthorityOtherEnvironmentalServicesPolice andPrisonsSECRET4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (C (66) 158) covering a report bythe Committee on Public Expenditure, and memoranda by theMinister of Social Security (C (66) 157 and 161), the Minister without portfolio (C (66) 159), the Lord President of the Council (C (66) 160)and the Secretary of State for Education and Science (C (66) 166).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the proposed reduction of  12 million in expenditure on local authority &quot;otherenvironmental services&quot; related to capital expenditure, and wastherefore separate from the reduction of  30 million in current expenditure on miscellaneous environmental services which had beendiscussed by the Cabinet the previous week (CC (66) 56th Conclusions,Minute 6). The cuts would involve reductions in capital expenditureon parks and pleasure grounds, and in some less essential work onwater supply and sewerage schemes.In discussion it was pointed out that the Department ofEducation and Science had been encouraging schools to join with local authorities in projects for swimming baths. Some of these&quot; dual user &quot; schemes might be frustrated or delayed by the reductionsnow proposed. It was however accepted that the proposals allowed a margin to provide for works which were urgently necessary and works in areas of high unemployment.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal of the Committee on public expenditure that capital expenditure on other environ-mental services in 1967-68 should be reduced by 12 million.The Home Secretary said that the reductions proposed by theCommittee on Public Expenditure in expenditure on police andprisons would mean that the rate of increase in that expenditure was less than the average rate of increase in public expenditure in1967-68, despite the importance of maintaining law and order andthe serious consequences that might arise if the government appeared to be failing to take the steps necessary to do so. He could accept reductions of  600,000, which would result from deferringwork on the police college and police training centres, but he wouldbe placed in serious difficulty by any proposal that further reductions should be made. It was particularly important that he shouldhave approval for additional expenditure of  2-5 million oncommunications equipment and patrol cars for the police.In discussion it was pointed out that the proposed expenditureon communications equipment and patrol cars was an &quot; additional&quot;programme for the purposes of this exercise, and would be for separate discussion. The Committee on Public Expenditure hadbeen asked to recommend a reduction of  6 - 8 million in expenditureon police and prisons, but had accepted that the reduction shouldnot exceed  1 million.  This would leave the Home Secretary free
to continue to build up the police establishment and to recruit prison officers.The Prime Minister said that in view of the differingconsiderations, the issue should be further discussed after decisions had been taken on the remaining items. Meanwhile the proposal that expenditure on police and prisons in 1967-68 should be reducedby  1 million should stand.The Cabinet (2) Agreed to resume consideration of expenditure on police andprisons after discussing the remaining proposals of theCommittee on Public Expenditure.There was general agreement with the proposals of theCommittee on Public Expenditure for reducing miscellaneousexpenditure on education and increasing fees for evening institutesand for further education. The proposal to increase fees for overseasstudents at universities should be considered further in connectionwith the aid programme. It was agreed that a cut in the grants to direct grant schools at this stage might prejudice the willingness ofthese schools to play their part in plans for comprehensive education;moreover, a reduction in the capitation grants to direct grant schoolswould mean an increase of the order of  25 a year in fees for pupils,which would in many cases fall upon local authorities. This proposal should not therefore be pursued, on the understanding that theSecretary of State for Education and Science would find savings of 1 million by other means. It was accepted that the proposed reductions in vacation grants for students and increases in parentalcontributions would not only cause an immediate adverse reactionamong students and their parents but would also prejudice the chances of introducing major changes in the system of studentsupport, with the firm prospect of substantial long-term savings, from september 1968.The Cabinet (3) Approved the proposal of the Committee on public expenditure for a saving of  3 - 8 million in miscellaneousexpenditure on education in 1967-68.(4) Approved the proposal of the Committee on public expenditure that savings of  2-2 million in 1967-68should be realised by raising the fees for evening institutesand for further education.(5) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary ofState for Education and Science and the Minister of overseas Development to give further consideration, inconnection with the aid programme, to the proposal for increasing fees for overseas students at universities.(6) Agreed that there should be no reduction in the capitationgrants to direct grant schools, on the understanding thatthe Secretary of State for Education and Science would
EducationCharges andFamilyEndowmentachieve savings of  1 million in his programme by other means.(7) Agreed that there should be no reduction in vacation grants for students and no increase in parental contributions forstudents in advance of the major changes in the system of student support which the Secretary of State for education and Science was planning to introduce from September1968.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the proposed increasein charges for school meals would save  20 million in a full year and 12 million in 1967-68. The cost of meals had grown steadily sincecharges were last increased in 1957&apos;to Is. and was now 2s. 6d. Theproposed charge of Is. 6d. would roughly restore the 1957 relationship to the cost of meals. The position of families with lower incomeswould be safeguarded by the new supplementary benefit provisions,which would have the effect that a family with three children wouldnot have to bear the charges until its net income reached  15 a week on average. The balance of opinion in the Committee on public expenditure supported the proposed increased charge, provided thatsome arrangement were made to improve the position of the poorerfamilies: the possibilities of doing this within an acceptable limit ofadditional expenditure required further consideration.The Ministerial Committee on Social Services had favoured anincrease of family allowances, associated with a reduction of incometax child allowances, which would restrict the benefit of the increase to those paying less than the standard rate of tax. There were however substantial objections both of policy and practice to sucha scheme, which would involve a major disturbance of the taxposition of 4 million families for the sake of a relatively small minority of families in need. The implications of such a schemerequired fuller study, but the introduction of the additional charges should not be made conditional on any improvements in family allowances which would cost more than the amount saved by the extra charges. In present economic circumstances it was essentialthat any additional expenditure should be concentrated on the limited area of need, which was confined to the 160,000 familiesshown by the recent Ministry of Social Security survey to haveincomes below the new supplementary benefit level. Such a concentration could not be achieved through an adjustment of tax allowances. Moreover, such a scheme would have the effect thathusbands who were, or as a result became, tax payers, would suffera reduction in net pay which would be widely unpopular, whichwould reduce their taxable capacity, and which might stimulatewage claims notwithstanding the extra family allowances payable totheir wives. Nor could the Inland Revenue bring such a scheme into operation from April 1967, even if it were acceptable in principle.On the other hand, a means-tested type of scheme could be introduced in autumn 1967 and could give more help to the poorest families,and at lower cost, than any scheme not involving a means test.Further study should be given to the possibility of devising an
acceptable scheme of this nature for introduction in 1967 at a cost of around  10 million in that year.The Minister of State, Department of Education and Science,said that, the National Plan had stated that educational spendingwould increase faster than the average for all services, yetnothwithstanding this statement, and the close link between education and long-term economic growth, the proposed reductions in educational expenditure would reverse this priority. In the context of educational expenditure, however, the proposed increase in thecharge for school meals could be accepted. The poorest families whohad been getting school meals free would continue to do so, and thenew supplementary benefit scales would result in some childrenqualifying for free meals who did not qualify at present.The Minister without Portfolio said that half of the proposedtotal reductions in expenditure would come from the social servicesfield. It was desirable that the effects of these reductions should beconsidered together, and in particular that the proposed increase in charges for school meals and welfare milk should be considered in parallel with the level of family allowances. The Ministry of social security survey had shown that, while there were about 160,000families (with 500,000 children) with incomes below the newsupplementary benefit level, there were also a large number of families with incomes very little higher. These families would be adversely affected by the proposed increase in charges for school meals and the abolition of free milk. Quite apart, however, from theproposal for higher charges, there was much public concern withthe problem of poverty among families with children and, when theMinistry&apos;s survey was published next year, there would be strongcriticisms if nothing had been done to help those families.The majority of the Ministerial Committee on Social services were opposed in principle to any extension of means-tested payments in this field; such payments to persons in full-time work werecalculated to destroy incentives and, even if introduced only as an interim measure, would be likely to result in the indefinitepostponement of any more radical reform of family endowment.The majority of the Committee, therefore, would advocate anincrease of family allowances, associated with a reduction of incometax child allowances. While the introduction of such a scheme from april 1967 might impose severe difficulties on the Inland Revenue,the possibility of its introduction later should be further studied.In discussion there was general agreement that an increase in thecharges for school meals should be conditional on the developmentof an acceptable scheme for helping the poorer families and that thepractical implications, as well as the implications for policy, of anincrease in family allowances, associated with a reduction of incometax child allowances, should be further examined as a means ofgiving this help. Such a scheme would be of assistance to the government&apos;s policy on incomes and would enable the Government
to avoid the criticism that would otherwise arise when the results ofthe Ministry&apos;s survey were published.In further discussion it was suggested that, if such a schemeproved acceptable in principle, there would be advantage if it couldbe introduced in autumn 1967 at the same time as it was proposedto increase the charges for school meals. It was also suggested thatthe proposed increases in the charge for welfare milk should be deferred to the autumn, since similar considerations arose in respectof them. It was pointed out, however, that the reduction of theincome tax child allowance in the middle of the tax year would present the Inland Revenue with the substantial administrativeproblem of recoding some 4 million cases. Further, a new or increased tax liability would be created retrospectively in respect ofthe preceding months of the tax year, and this would double theactual payments to be made in the remainder of that year, soimposing an unacceptable burden on tax payers with families. Thepossibility of avoiding this effect would need to be further considered.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet would be prepared to agree that the charge for school meals should be increased from Is. to Is. 6d. and the priceof welfare milk from 4d. to 6d. a pint in the autumn of 1967,conditionally on the working out of an acceptable family endowmentscheme which would, amongst other things, help to reduce the impact of these increases on families less well able to afford them. TheChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister without Portfolio,as Chairman of the Ministerial Committee on Social Services, should now discuss how the further consideration of family endowmentshould be handled. In reviewing the range of schemes, they should examine further the implications, for social and taxation policies andalso for tax administration, of schemes combining increases in family allowances concurrent with reductions of income tax child allowanceswithin acceptable limits of additional expenditure, and coming intoeffect in the autumn of 1967. Any scheme involving tax allowances should seek to avoid the imposition of retrospective tax liabilities inthe course of the financial year. They should report to the Cabinetin time to enable a final decision to be taken on the provision to beincluded in the Estimates for 1967-68. Meanwhile the estimates should provisionally be prepared on the basis of the increased charges.The statement that the Government would continue to give a high priority to the measures designed to meet family needs shouldconsequently be retained in the draft White Paper on Prices and incomes criteria during the period of severe restraint.The Cabinet (8) Approved the proposal of the Ministerial Committee on public Expenditure that the charge for school mealsshould be increased by 6d. in September 1967, subject toan acceptable scheme being devised for improving theprovision for poorer families.
(9) Agreed that the charge for welfare milk should be increasedto 6d. a pint from September 1967, subject to thecondition in Conclusion (8).(10) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister without Portfolio, to arrange for urgent consideration to be given to an acceptable family endowment scheme in accordance with the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.(11) Agreed to resume their discussion of family endowment inthe light of Conclusion (10).The Minister of Social Security said that the proposal by theCommittee on Public Expenditure that the uprating of pension benefits on the next occasion should be confined to a rise of 10s., totake effect in November 1967, would not accord with the pledge given by the Labour Party in their Election Manifesto that pensions should be raised to keep in step with the level of earnings. Theproposal was, moreover, substantially less favourable to pensionersthan any action taken by the previous Administration during their period of office. The increases which had been made in schemes ofsupplementary benefit did not cover all cases of hardship and thepresent proposal would reduce the comparative level of the standardof living of old people and the sick substantially below that of therest of the community. The rise in pensions should therefore be 13s.Even this would be Is. less than required to keep them in line withthe rise in the level of earnings but taken in conjunction with theimprovement in supplementary benefits would be acceptable. Givenour present serious financial difficulties the increase might however be delayed until October 1967, so reducing by  53 million the levelof expenditure which she had previously proposed.In discussion it was the general view that, however regrettably,our present economic circumstances made it necessary to accept thatthe increase should be no higher than 10s. It was, furthermore,pointed out that this increase would mean that the present administration had raised the level of pensions by 22s. 6d. in aperiod of three years compared with a total increase of 37s. 6d. overthe 13 years of office of the previous Administration. Furthermore,there had been recent increases in supplementary benefits, whichwould be still further increased by some 5 per cent in the autumn of1967, and these had effected a further substantial improvement in thegeneral level of social benefits.It was also suggested that the delay between the announcementof a decision in Parliament to raise benefits and the payment of the increases in the following October would subject the Government tosevere criticism, similar to that which had occurred on the occasion of the previous rise in pensions. It was, however, the general viewthat provided it were made clear at the time of the originalannouncement that the decision to pay the benefits from the followingautumn was one deliberately taken on financial grounds, and wasnot due to administrative delays, any criticism should not be serious.
AdministrativeandMiscellaneousServicesResumptionof discussion the Cabinet (12) Agreed that pension benefits should be uprated by 10s. forthe pension for the single person (and other benefitscorrespondingly) with effect from the end of October1967.The Home Secretary said that the proposal by the Committee on public Expenditure to reduce expenditure on administrative and miscellaneous services by  5-6 million included reductions totalling 1-8 million in expenditure on courts and on fire services. He could accept a reduction of  800,000 but the higher figure would mean thathe would be unable to increase manpower in the fire services, andwould have to reduce expenditure on fire appliances by 50 per centin 1967-68. It would also mean that no new court buildings couldbe started until 1968.The Lord Chancellor said that the lack of an adequate numberof courts was causing serious congestion and delays in the hearingsof cases both in London and in the provinces. The United kingdom was spending relatively less than any other Western democracy onthe administration of justice.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would need to complete their discussion on expenditure on administrative and miscellaneousservices, and to resume their consideration of expenditure on industrial technology (aviation) and police and prisons, at a further meeting the following week.The Cabinet (13) Agreed to resume their discussion of the public expenditure programme for 1967-68 at a subsequent meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,17th November, 1966.
