CC 25 (66)secret parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. Parliament would rise for the Whitsun Adjournment on Friday, 27th May untilMonday, 13th June.In discussion it was pointed out that if it were necessary,because of the seamerfs strike, to proclaim an Emergency more than five days before Parliament resumed or to pass emergency regulations under such a Proclamation before then, such action should be taken before the Whitsun Adjournment since otherwise it would benecessary for Parliament to be recalled. It was agreed that thisshould be further considered under a later item of the agenda.The Prime Minister said that it might be desirable for him tomake a further statement the following Monday on South Arabia,to counter the allegation that he had misled the House of commons on the course of earlier discussions with the leaders of the south arabian Federation on the future of our base in Aden. Such astatement might avoid the need for a debate on a motion of censurewhich would both pre-empt Parliamentary time otherwise availablefor legislation and also prejudice the forthcoming discussions with south Arabian representatives the following week. If the issue were pressed in the House of Commons, it might prove desirable to propose the appointment of a Select Committee to enquire into thecircumstances relating to the allegation.In discussion it was the general view that it would be preferable to seek to avoid both a debate and the appointment of a SelectCommittee of Inquiry since either would run a serious risk ofprejudicing the forthcoming discussions.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would consider thematter further in the light of the discussion.Oversea AffairsGibraltar(previous reference:CC (65) 8thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that the previous day he had hadan initial discussion with the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs.Despite the fact that he had urged the need to avoid public statements by either side at the present stage in order to avoid prejudicing the negotiations, the Spanish Minister had subsequentlyissued a statement to the Press on the proposals which he had putforward in discussion. These were that the two Governments should sign a Convention which would provide for-(i) the cancellation of Article 10 of the Treaty of Utrecht, 1713,which gave the United Kingdom a legal right to the Rock.Gibraltar would thereupon revert to Spain;(ii) the acceptance by Spain of a United Kingdom militarybase in Gibraltar. Its structure, legal position andco-ordination with the defence organisation of Spain orof the free world would be negotiated in a special agreement to be attached to the Convention;
Rhodesia(previous reference:CC(66) 24thConclusions,Minute 2)(iii) the establishment of a legal regime to protect the interestof the present citizens of Gibraltar, who would retain their United Kingdom nationality, and of a personalstatute guaranteeing fundamental rights, such as freedomof religion and the inhabitants&apos; right of residence, with aguarantee of permanence in their place of work;(iv) the Convention to become effective after the two additionalagreements, referred to in (ii) and (iii) had been signedand registered in the United Nations.It would be necessary for him to issue a statement to counter theviews expressed by the Spanish Minister, in which he would makeit clear that the United Kingdom had in no way violated theprovisions of the Treaty of Utrecht and that the Government were concerned to defend the rights of the Gibraltarians.In the course of discussion with the Spanish Minister, he had said that it would be helpful to the negotiations if the SpanishGovernment would remove or lessen the restrictions which they had at present imposed on the frontier with Gibraltar. The SpanishMinister had said that his Government would consider doing so ifwe, for our part, would take down the present boundary fence.There might be defence objections to doing so, but we would consider the proposal and further negotiations over the whole fieldwould take place between United Kingdom and Spanish officials.These would deal essentially with the peripheral aspects of thedispute and we should not be prepared to make any concessions onsovereignty. If our proposals failed to achieve agreement, we wouldthen propose that the dispute should be referred to the international court of Justice.The Colonial Secretary said that he had kept in close touch withGibraltarian Ministers during the discussions leading up to the initiation of the present negotiations, and he was considering various ways, including the possibility of conducting a plebiscite in Gibraltar,in which we might counter the views put forward by the SpanishGovernment both here and at the United Nations.The Prime Minister said that there had been no substantialdevelopments in the informal talks between the United Kingdomand Rhodesian officials since the position had last been reported to cabinet. There would be a further meeting that day with a view tofact-finding talks subsequently continuing in Salisbury in order toascertain whether a basis existed for negotiations and, if so, with whom such negotiations could take place. The talks had so farrevealed a significant change in Rhodesian thinking, in particular inthe regime&apos;s attitude to the prospect of majority rule; they were nowconcerned to explore the means by which the proper interests of theEuropean minority might be protected thereafter. This change,which might even lead to a split in the illegal regime, was no doubt inconsequence of the fact that our economic sanctions were beginning to take effect to a greater degree than was as yet publicly apparent.It required further sounding, which could best be carried out in rhodesia, possibly under the aegis of the Governor. The means by
IndustrialDisputesSeamen&apos;s strike(previous reference:CC (66) 24thConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Minister of Labour said that the full effects of thestrike were not yet apparent since seamen were going on strike only as their ships reached United Kingdom ports. He had been considering what moves it was open to the Government to take inpresent circumstances. If there were any indication from either theNational Union of Seamen (McManus) or from the Shipping Federationwhich suggested that it might be useful for him to see them he would of course do so, but this seemed most unlikely during the course ofthe week. The earliest time when he might himself take the initiative in asking them to come and see him would be at the beginning of thefollowing week. At such meetings he might again explore thepossibility of the strike being called off on the basis of an interimsettlement on either of the terms agreed by the Shipping Federationbefore the strike started. These provided for either an interim increase of 3 per cent on basic wage rates, or the implementation ofthe first stage of the three-stage offer, coupled with the appointmentof a Court of Inquiry. The second suggestion had not been put tothe executive of the McManus before the strike, because it was certainthat it would not then be accepted and the likelihood of it being accepted the following week was very slight. He might also discuss further with the McManus and the Shipping Federation the proposal put to the Union by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) before the strikestarted, which was that there should be an interim settlement onthe basis of overtime pay for Sunday working, without the consequential adjustment of the entitlement to paid leave specified by the Shipping Federation as a necessary accompaniment.Whatever the outcome of the talks the Government were committed to setting up a Court of Inquiry into the dispute and intoworking conditions at sea. It was arguable that, even if the strikewere not called off, it would be right to appoint such a Court, whichmight then produce a quick report on the dispute itself: this couldbe the basis for a settlement. There were however clear objectionsto such a course. At such time as the Court of Inquiry were appointed the terms of reference might be:&quot; To inquire into:(i) the causes and circumstances of the present dispute betweenthe Shipping Federation and the National Union of seamen;which the acceptability of any proposals to the population of rhodesia as a whole could be ascertained, including discussions withthe leaders of African nationalist parties in Rhodesia, would be amost important aspect of any negotiations which might take place.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it must also berecognised that the continuation of sanctions imposed a substantial and unwelcome burden on the United Kingdom economy and onour balance of payments.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.
(ii) terms and conditions of service of seamen, taking accountof technological change and the need for an efficient and competitive shipping industry;(iii) relations between shipowners, officers and seamen;(iv) the law, including the Merchant Shipping Act,  1894relevant to paragraphs 2 and 3 above;and to report.&quot;In discussion it was the general view that a governmentalintervention in the dispute in order to seek further concessions tothe McManus in pay and conditions of service would be contrary to thenational interest. The country would then suffer both the industrialdislocation of the strike itself and the grave economic consequences of concessions on pay which would totally undermine theGovernments policy on prices and incomes, gravely weaken sterling and entail the adoption of a stern deflationary policy which it hadbeen the Governments objective to avoid. It was the general viewthat the proposals put forward by the TUC would be open to substantial objection on these grounds. It was recognised that i theconsequences of maintaining the Governments position was likelyto be a prolonged strike which might well spread to other sectionsof the community and particularly to the docks; and it was important that the justification for the Governments policy should be made clear to the public and that their full support should be obtained.In these circumstances it was the general view that it would be imprudent to appoint the Court of Inquiry at this stage, without theagreement of both parties to the dispute, since there would then beno further means open to the Government at a later stage to providemediation and to seek a settlement, short of proposing unacceptableconcessions on pay. The Cabinet were also informed that a reviewof Part II of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894 had been carried out over the previous 18 months by the Board of Trade in discussionwith representatives of the shipowners and the seamen and agreement had been reached on changes, ad referendum to the ShippingFederation and the McManus. This review might, however, now beoutdated by the current dispute.In further discussion, the Cabinet considered the desirability ofan early proclamation of an Emergency.The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial Committee on emergencies had reviewed the situation and that there was no immediate need for the Government to take powers under such a proclamation. Powers would, however, be needed if the armed forces were to be used in moving merchant ships or supplies or iffood prices were to be subject to control. The timing of a proclamation must also be considered in the light of theGovernments public position in respect of the strike and of theParliamentary time-table, since regulations made under the proclamation would lapse if they were not the subject of an affirmative resolution within seven days of their being made. It would, therefore,be necessary for regulations which were required in the following three weeks to be so approved by Parliament before the whitsun recess or, alternatively, for Parliament to be recalled before 13th June.
secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs(C (66) 69), setting out the conclusions of the Ministerial Committeeon Iron and Steel Nationalisation on the desirability of extending the provisions of the Bill to the British Iron and Steel Federation(BISF) and on the timing of the introduction of the Bill within the1966-67 Session.Iron and steel nationalisation(previous reference:CC(66) 23rdConclusions,Minute 3)In discussion there was general agreement that the balance ofadvantage lay in an Emergency being proclaimed on the following monday and that all the regulations which were ready and required should then be laid before Parliament the same evening and debatedbefore the Whitsun Recess. It was also the general view that the proclamation should be made before the Minister of Labour sawrepresentatives of the McManus or of the Shipping Federation.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that grave economic consequences would ensueif further concessions on pay and conditions were made to the NUSin order to end the strike, though they recognised that this entailedthe country being prepared to face a prolonged and perhapswidespread industrial dispute. It might prove desirable at a later stage in the dispute to appoint a Court of Inquiry on the lines proposed by the Minister of Labour, but the time had not yet arrivedwhen such action could usefully be taken. An Emergency shouldbe proclaimed on the following Monday and any regulations whichwould be necessary at the present stage should be laid beforeParliament the same evening and debated before the Whitsun Recess.The Ministerial Committee on Emergencies should consider that afternoon the scope and terms of the regulations which should belaid. They should also consider the publicity which should be givento the Governmenfs position in the dispute. The Minister of labour would invite representatives of the McManus and of the ShippingFederation to come and see him early the following week.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the ministerial committee on Emergencies to consider the arrangementsfor the proclamation of an Emergency on the following monday, the scope and terms of the emergency regulations to be laid before Parliament the same evening and the publicity to be given to the Governmenfs policy,on the lines indicated in discussion.(3) Took note that the Minister of Labour would askrepresentatives of the National Union of Seamen and theShipping Federation to come and see him early in thefollowing week and invited him to be guided in thosetalks by the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
The First Secretary of State said that the Committee were agreedthat the provisions of the Bill should not be extended to cover theBISF, since this would give rise to considerable drafting difficulties and would delay the introduction and passage of the Bill, so reducingthe period available to the new Corporation for planning a smoothtransition to public ownership. This aspect could best be dealt withsubsequently by the Minister of Power under the terms of the Act.As regards the timing of the introduction of the Bill, the ministerial committee had concluded that there would be no advantage in any delay, and some disadvantage through postponing effective controlof the industry, reducing the chances of co-operation from it, anddelaying desirable developments within it. Compensation had beenconsidered by the Ministers immediately concerned and their conclusions would be put before the Cabinet at a later stage.The Minister of Power said that the more rapidly the Bill wastaken, the better the prospect of achieving vesting day about themiddle of 1967; this would mitigate the financial problems ofcompensation. Moreover, desirable measures of rationalisation and modernisation in the industry were at present being held up becauseof uncertainty about its future. It was, therefore, urgent to proceedwith the Bill as quickly as possible.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that since the ministerial Committee had completed their report the BISF had written to the Minister of Power making proposals for the future ofthe industry. These were for a loose-knit supervisory authority with18 out of the 26 appointments on the authority to be filled from private industry: they also provided for the possibility of Governmentownership of the firms involved up to 50 per cent of the equity. TheCabinet had rejected proposals for less than 100 per cent ownership and these proposals were clearly unacceptable. There had also beenapproaches to Ministers from individual firms in the industry, urging that mixed ownership, including both Government majorityshareholdings in the firms now concerned and Government minorityshareholdings in other units not at present covered by the draft Bill,might produce a better integrated industry and greater co-operation from the industry than the Governmenfs present proposals.In the light of these developments, it was suggested that the viewsof the industry should be further explored before the Bill was introduced: a refusal to do so would indicate unnecessary rigidityand might commit the Government to a Bill the precise provisions ofwhich might later be found to be unsuitable for the best, technicalsolutions. A 100 per cent ownership of the 12 main firms in an industry of over 300 firms was not necessarily the right organisation in that it would break links between complementary firms and alsoforgo the possible advantages of a wider though partial public ownership. Only discussion would show whether the co-operationof the industry, with all the advantages this entailed, could beobtained on acceptable terms. Such discussion need not compromisethe introduction of the Bill in its present form if thereafter this proveddesirable; nor need it delay its introduction since in any event aSecond Reading was not possible before the middle of July.
On the other hand it was argued that the disadvantages offurther attempts to explore the attitude of the industry outweighedthese possible gains. Any change from the present basis of 100 percent ownership would involve extensive redrafting and might entailhybridity, so involving an unacceptable delay in the Bill being passed.Such delay would be politically embarrassing and would do graveharm to the industry and to the economy by delaying there organisation necessary to achieve greater efficiency. Within theambit of the present Bill it should be possible to achieve satisfactory arrangements for an integrated industry: the Organising Committeeand the Corporation would, if there were no delay, have a year tosettle the organisation of the industry.In further discussion on the timing and the introduction of theBill, the Cabinet were informed that it would not be possible to takethe Second Reading of the Bill before the middle or the third week of July. There was general agreement that in these circumstances the Bill should not be published before the Recess or unduly long before the Second Reading. The normal interval between publication and Second Reading would afford reasonable opportunity toascertain whether the industry had any acceptable proposals to putforward without compromising the present Bill.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Minister of Power should inform the leadersof the industry the following week of the Governments decision toproceed with the Bill in its present form, but that they would welcomediscussion&apos; with them on the best technical organisation of theindustry within the ambit of the Bill as now drafted. The Bill shouldbe introduced in the week beginning 19th June with a view to aSecond Reading on 19th July, the date of the Second Reading beingannounced at the time the Bill was introduced.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Power to consult the leaders of the steel industry on the lines indicated by the Prime minister in his summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council, in consultationwith the Minister of Power, to arrange for the introductionand Second Reading of the Iron and Steel NationalisationBill in the week beginning 19th June and on 19th July,1966, respectively.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,19th May, 1966.
