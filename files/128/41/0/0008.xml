SubjectDefence Review:Statement on the Defence Estimates, 1966: Part I
Defence ReviewStatement onthe defence estimates, 1966:Parti(previous reference:CC(65) 33rdConclusions,Minute 3)*The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Defence (C (66) 33), to which was appended the draft of aStatement on the Defence Estimates, 1966: Part I.The Secretary of State for Defence said that he had set threetargets for the review of our defence expenditure. The first was toreduce the burden on resources by some 16 per cent as comparedwith the plans of the previous Administration: the second to reducethe burden on foreign exchange: and the third to reduce the excessive strain upon our military resources.  1,200 million over a10-year period had already been saved by the decisions which theGovernment had taken on the aircraft programme. defence expenditure in the following year would be just below the ceiling of 2,000 million at 1964 prices, but because of certain expenditure hadinevitably been deferred while decisions were being taken on theDefence Review, there would be a slight increase thereafter until the target figure was met in 1969-70. The economies which had so far been achieved had been on equipment and without any diminution of our military capability, i.e., solely by getting better value for money . There still remained, however, a gap of  100 million betweenthe target figure and the expenditure which would be incurred on existing plans in 1969-70 and this gap could only be closed by reducing commitments. The Defence Review had achieved certainmajor reductions, primarily in the Mediterranean and the middle east, in relation to Malta, Cyprus, Libya and Aden. A small increaseof facilities was necessary in the Persian Gulf in order to compensate for the loss of Aden. In the Far East we planned a substantial reduction of our forces as soon as confrontation came to an end. TheMinisters in charge of the oversea Departments did not believe thatit would be politically possible for us to stay in Singapore for any considerable period thereafter and if no alternative facilities were provided in Australia it would no longer be practicable for us to station substantial forces in the Far East. This would result insubstantial savings in foreign exchange and resources.The total reductions which would result from these proposalsstill left a gap of some  50 million between the target and theestimate in 1969-70. If this could be reduced to  25 million, the target could then be achieved by a number of minor savings. Itshould, however, be borne in mind that the existing estimate includedprovision of  50 million for contingencies. Such provision was not normally made in estimates, but it would be prudent to include it inthe present instance. The necessary savings of  50 million might beachieved in a number of ways; by failure, owing to difficulties inrecruitment, to maintain the carriers in service for as long as was proposed; by the further reduction of commitments which was likelyto occur, whether in the Far East through the ending of confrontation and our withdrawal from Singapore, in the Middle Eastthrough the ending of the Kuwait commitment as a result of the actions of the present Kuwaiti Government, or by the reduction of* Previously recorded as a Confidential Annex.
our forces in Germany if our requirements for offsetting foreign exchange were not met; or finally by cutting out the PI 127.As regards foreign exchange the proposals provided for a cut of 75 million (from  350 million to  275 million a year) in the totalwhich was involved on the plans as they stood a year ago. this latter figure, which would amount to about 6 per cent of our totalimports, did not, moreover, take into account the very substantialoffsets which should be achieved through our agreements with theUnited States and Federal German Governments. The proposalsalso provided for a reduction in the present overstrain of theServices.The largest reductions in our forces would be effected in respectof the Royal Navy, primarily through the carriers being phased outby 1975 at the latest. The Royal Air Force would remain about thesame size as at present, but it should be borne in mind that it wouldhave to take over certain of the tasks which at present wereperformed by the Royal Navy and that very large savings had alreadybeen achieved. The Army would be reduced from some 195,000 men,including the Gurkhas, to 176,000 men, including the disbandment of the Gurkhas. In considering the equipment of the forces it was important to recognise that the carriers and the F-111A were in no sense alternatives. All the Chiefs of Staff and all the Service Boardsagreed that the F-111A was essential to enable the forces to carryout the tasks which would be laid upon them over the next decade.The Chief of the Naval Staff and the Admiralty Board were alone in believing that the maintenance of the carriers was necessary forthis task.The Foreign Secretary said that we had two major aims. Thefirst was to be in a position to defend the United Kingdom and our freedom. The Atlantic Alliance was of primary importance in this regard and it would be important that we should not disrupt it bydecisions relating to the stationing of our forces in Europe. the steps which were envisaged were, however, acceptable from this pointof view and the United States Government were fully aware of what we proposed. The second aim was to play in an unstable world a proper part, commensurate with our resources, in the preservation of world peace. The large cut envisaged in our commitments in theMediterranean and the Middle East would involve certain risks which could nevertheless be accepted, but further cuts at the present stage would be impracticable, though the Kuwait commitment mightwell wither away over the next few years. It would, however, be imprudent for us to abandon it unilaterally. The course of events in the Far East was difficult to foresee. The cost of our forces inthis area was very high and the relationship between our interestsand our defence expenditure was much less favourable than in theMiddle East. Such expenditure was inevitable as long asconfrontation continued, but it was hoped that this might, at leasttacitly, be abandoned before long. We had made it clear to our allies that thereafter we believed that it was unlikely that we shouldbe able to remain in Singapore for any considerable period.
In considering the appropriate balance between what the UnitedKingdom could afford and what part she should play in world affairs neither aspect could be regarded as overriding. Our capacity to carry out certain commitments was inevitably limited by the strain on our resources, but to cut our commitments beyond a certain point might have consequences for world stability which would cause even greater damage to our economic position.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the target of 2,000 million at 1964 prices for defence expenditure in 1969-70 hadbeen taken as a starting point for the review of governmentalexpenditure as a whole by the Public Expenditure Committee. the excess of  50 million which was at present estimated would inevitablyaffect other programmes of expenditure and it would be imprudentto seek to meet this point by making no allowance for contingencies.He accepted the view put forward by the Secretary of State for defence on the desirability of our maintaining a military presence in the Far East, but the question was whether we were at presentproposing to play too large a part in relation to our resources. there might also be further scope for economies in the Middle East,particularly in relation to the building up of our facilities at Sharjahand the level of forces which it was proposed to retain in Cyprus.The excess of expenditure over the target might also be cut by not continuing the P-1127. This expenditure was not justified on military grounds on a balance of priorities in relation to otherdefence expenditure and the cost involved was high in relation tothe political and industrial advantages. Alternatively, the moneycould be found by a further reduction in commitments and there wasin any event cause for concern at the wide range of commitments which it was still proposed to retain, since these might at any timeinvolve the escalation of our military tasks. It might be that in theevent the target of  2,000 million could be met by the withering awayof certain commitments in the Middle East and Far East but theplan as it stood did not contain a guarantee that we should succeed in achieving it.The Prime Minister said that in comparing future expenditure by the Home Departments and by the Ministry of Defence it mustbe borne in mind that our plans provided for the expansion of civil expenditure at the rate of 4J per cent a year, whereas defence expenditure had to be heavily cut, with all the implications whichthis involved for our position overseas. In considering the excessof  50 million it was questionable whether the present allowance for contingencies might not be excessive, having regard to the extent towhich work on research and development, which was the main causeof the escalation in expenditure, had already been cut by the changein our aircraft programme. In considering the future of the P-1127the Cabinet would wish to have in mind not only the implications for our military capacity but also those for the future of the UnitedKingdom aircraft industry if this aircraft were abandoned. It wouldin any event be necessary to review the future of this aircraft the
following October in the light of the progress then made and it wouldbe desirable at that time to consider what prospect there was forsales to foreign countries.More broadly, in considering the burden of defence on our resources, due regard must be had to the importance of ourmaintenance of a world role in relation to the willingness of overseacountries to support sterling. No specific connection had ever beenmade by oversea Governments between these two aspects, but wecould not expect that if we cut our oversea commitments moredrastically other countries would necessarily be so readily preparedto assist us in other respects. A further factor of major importancein considering our role East of Suez was that it was primarily in this area that the real danger of a world war now lay and in our own interests we must be prepared to play a part in seeking to maintainstability.The following main points were made in discussion:(a) Defence expenditure represented a little over 7 per cent ofour Gross National Product; by 1969-70 it would be about 6 percent. A comparable figure for the United States was at present8 - 7 per cent and this might well rise while the war in Vietnamlasted. For France the figure was 6-5 per cent and was likely to go up owing to the cost of the French nuclear deterrent. The Germanfigure was about 5 per cent and this would strengthen our positionin negotiating the offset of our foreign exchange costs. It was difficult to attribute defence expenditure as a whole to the differenttheatres, owing to the impossibility of allocating preciselyexpenditure in the United Kingdom, but in 1969-70 defence expenditure overseas could be roughly divided between NATO(50 per cent), Indo/Pacific (40 per cent) and Mediterranean/middle east (10 per cent).(b) Paragraph 22 of the White Paper would be strengthened tomake clear that our ground forces in Germany would only bemaintained at about their existing level provided that some means could be found of meeting the foreign exchange cost. At presentour forces in Germany formed, in effect, part of the Strategic Reserveon which we needed to draw in order to meet emergencies outside europe; if we brought forces back to the United Kingdom, weshould save some foreign exchange but would incur heavy capital costs for accommodation. If, however, we could reduce our commitments outside Europe, a reduction in the size of the Armymight be possible and we should then be able to withdraw someforces from Germany if we wished to do so. An arms control agreement in Europe might also make possible a general reductionin the level of NATO forces.(c) It was suggested in discussion of paragraph 28 that it wouldbe unwise to publish our intention to reduce our forces in Malta;this could affect the result of the Maltese elections to be held thisyear and would make more difficult the negotiations to which wewere committed by the Defence Agreement.  It was, however, the
general view that the White Paper should not be less specific than was now proposed about the decision to reduce our defenceestablishment in Malta.(d) The decision to leave Aden when South Arabia becameindependent represented a major reduction in commitments and paragraph 29 would be expanded to bring this out more clearly. Thequestion was, however, raised whether we need maintain our commitment to CENTO and a military presence in the Persian Gulf.It was pointed out that future developments might relieve us of theCENTO commitment, but if we now took the initiative in abrogatingit this might well cause the Shah of Iran to change his pro-Westernalignment. In the Persian Gulf we intended to reduce the commitment to Kuwait and it seemed likely that the KuwaitGovernment would either wish to end the Defence Agreement or would increase their support for our opponents in the area so thatthe Agreement could no longer be maintained. It would, however,be disadvantageous for us to initiate its termination. Terminationwould enable us to make substantial savings in expenditure on theGulf: a total and abrupt withdrawal from the area would, however,leave a vacuum which might lead to war between Iraq, Iran andSaudi Arabia, with a consequent grave disruption of the oil supplies for the West. Our aim must be to phase out our withdrawal slowlyin order to leave behind a stable situation. Moreover, without theexistence of such bases in the Middle East as Aden or Masirahintervention in Africa, such as the recent despatch of RAF aircraft to Zambia, would be more difficult, if not impossible.(e) It was suggested that once confrontation was over therewould be no justification for maintaining large military forces inthe Far East, since this was an area in which we had little directconcern; the White Paper indeed implied that we should welcomeconditions which made it impossible for us to remain in singapore and Malaysia since this would enable us to make large savings. Itwas, however, pointed out that the Indo/Pacific was the area ofgreatest uncertainty and the risk of a major war starting there was far higher than it now was in Europe. It was impossible to say how the situation in Vietnam or confrontation would develop. We hopedthat confrontation would end and that it would be possible to buildup a block of neutral States in South-East Asia. If, however, weannounced now our intention to leave Malaysia and Singapore whenconfrontation ended, there was a risk that others, including thePeople&apos;s Republic of China, might try to take over our position andthis could lead to a complete breakdown of stability which our continued presence could prevent. If, however, as we thought likely,political developments in Malaysia and Singapore after the end of confrontation made it impossible for us to remain there, we couldonly establish forces in Australia&apos;to the extent that facilities wereavailable. It was clear that within the next three years facilities could not be constructed for more than about half the forces whichwe had planned to keep in the Far East, and the australian government were opposed to the stationing of substantial United
Kingdom ground forces in Australia. They would probably welcomeUnited Kingdom air forces and might be able to make facilities available for some naval forces. It seemed probable therefore that,if we had to leave Malaysia and Singapore in a few years&apos; time, thelevel of our forces in the Far East would then be substantially lower than was now envisaged, with consequent savings in foreign exchange and perhaps in total budgetary cost.(/) It was suggested that paragraph 12 of the White paper should make clear not only the Governmenfs intention tointernationalise our nuclear strategic forces but also to undertake nofurther development of nuclear weapons. It was confirmed that nodevelopment or expenditure was currently being undertaken on thenext generation of nuclear weapons; and the resources devoted tothe military nuclear programme were now very small. It was agreedthat this paragraph of the White Paper should be further considered in the light of the discussion.(g) The military reductions which we intended to make wouldhave economic consequences in a number of countries, such as malta and Singapore. These were being studied, but it was clear that nofurther economic aid would be available within the present totalallocation. If further aid were to be given, this could only be doneby offsetting to some extent the savings in defence expenditure.(h) The force structure proposed by the Secretary of State for defence would not meet the figure of  2,000 million at 1964 pricesunless further economies were made and even at the level of 2,000 million defence expenditure in 1969-70 would impose an undue strain on our resources. On the other hand there seemed areasonable prospect that further economies could be made and thatsome of our commitments, particularly in the Middle East and theFar East, could be further reduced without our having to take theinitiative in abrogating them. If, however, decisions were taken nowinvolving major changes in regard to commitments or equipment,this would reopen the assumptions on which the proposed forcestructure had been based. If the force structure were, however,accepted, this should be on the understanding that a sustained effort would be made to achieve further economies and to this end defence expenditure should be subject to close annual review.(i) Certain other amendments in the draft White Paper were agreed.  ,  -The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would wish to continue their consideration of the draft white Paper at a further meeting later that day. MeanwhileMinisters should send any drafting amendments to the Secretary ofState for Defence and he would consider with the latter whetheramendments could suitably be made to the White Paper in regardto our military nuclear programme. It was also agreed that a sustained effort would be required if the ceiling of  2,000 million at1964 prices in 1969-70 were to be achieved and that to this enddefence expenditure year by year should be subject to close scrutiny.
The Cabinet (1) Agreed to resume their consideration of the draft white paper later that day.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider with theSecretary of State for Defence the passage in the draft white Paper dealing with our military nuclearprogramme.(3) Agreed that, in order to achieve the ceiling of  2,000 million at 1964 prices in 1969-70, defence expenditure should besubject to close annual review.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th February, 1966.
