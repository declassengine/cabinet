Subject:Rhodesia
Rhodesia(Previous1W1V1VUVW .CC(66) 65thConclusions,Minute 2)secret the Cabinet considered a memorandum by the commonwealth secretary (C (66) 179) on Rhodesia.The Commonwealth Secretary said that at the Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers the previous September we had gained their acquiescence in our further attempt to induce the illegal regime to end the rebellion. We had also made a commitment toproceed with mandatory sanctions, and to declare that we would notgrant independence before majority rule, if the rebellion were notended before the end of the year. The rejection by the illegal regimeof the working document drawn up on HMS Tiger left us with no alternative but to proceed with that commitment. We were accordingly proposing in the Security Council of the United nations that effective and selective mandatory sanctions should be imposedagainst Rhodesia. The prospect was that these would have asubstantial, but not a crippling effect on the Rhodesian economy and would reduce its level by some 25 per cent compared with thatprevailing before the illegal declaration of independence (i.d.i.) andwith the reduction of some 15 per cent achieved by the presentvoluntary sanctions.. Nevertheless, the Rhodesians could withstand even severemandatory sanctions provided they could count on the support ofSouth Africa. The South African attitude had consistently been thatthey would not interfere with &quot; normal trade &quot; and that they wouldnot undertake any economic boycotts. It seemed probable, therefore,that they would fail to comply with mandatory sanctions, in which event we could either do nothing, or prepare for measures leading to confrontation with South Africa, or invite consultation in thesematters with the South African Government. The first would leave us open to violent attack in the United Nations and theCommonwealth, the second would involve unacceptable risks to our economy and we should therefore choose the third course, thoughit would be more effective if our exchanges with the South african government were conducted unobtrusively. It was vital to ourown interests that we should not allow mandatory sanctions todevelop into economic warfare with South Africa.After the outcome of the talks in HMS Tiger, and particularlyafter our undertaking came into force that we would not grant independence before majority rule, it would be virtually impossibleto reach a settlement with the present regime and the most we could hope for was that over a long period opposition to the regime wouldassert itself. Meanwhile we should encourage the, Governor to stayas a focus of loyalty and it would probably be in our interest toretain the British Residual Mission as long as it was open to us todo so. We should also make it clear to the Europeans in Rhodesiathat though their independence under European rule was nowprecluded they could nevertheless look forward, if they returnedto legality, to something on the lines of the 1961 Constitution.  This
tmight mean a long period of Government prior to majority ruleduring which the Africans would be prepared for their responsibilities and the general administration of the country would continue muchas before the i.d.i. It was possible that the illegal regime woulddeclare a republic, in which event we should advise all public servants in Rhodesia not to continue to serve.Before embarking on the present phase of action Ministers had considered possible alternative courses, including the military invasion of Rhodesia, mandatory sanctions against South Africa and handingour responsibility for Rhodesia over to the United Nations. Therewere overwhelming objections to any of these courses at the presenttime. Nevertheless, if mandatory sanctions should fail in their effect,it might well prove that although we could not as yet transfer responsibility to the United Nations this would in the longer termbe the least damaging course open to us. Meanwhile, we shouldundoubtedly have grave difficulty in maintaining good relations with commonwealth countries in Africa and we could not overlook the commitment we had given at the last Meeting of commonwealth prime Ministers that a further Meeting would be held soon if the illegal regime were not brought speedily to an end.Our own interests were to achieve a settlement of the problem as speedily as possible but there now seemed to be no honourableway of doing this by agreement. Both for reasons of domestic policyand because of our external interests there was no alternative toour determination to end the rebellion. On the other hand, our own economic interests must equally be taken into account. The loss toour balance of payments already incurred by sanctions against rhodesia was, in total, of the order of  50 million a year. Aconfrontation with South Africa would involve an annual loss ofover  250 million of exports, a large rise in the prices of our imports and a net loss of over  80 million of investment income and ofinvisible exports. We clearly could not afford to pay this price.Our economic interests in other African countries approximatelybalanced those in South Africa. Furthermore we were dependenton Zambia for 40 per cent of our copper imports, costing over 63 million in the first ten months of 1966: if these supplies were cut off the additional cost would be far greater. The ZambianGovernment had now indicated that they were ready to signimmediately the memorandum of understanding with us by whichwe would provide some  13 million towards the cost of their measuresto improve transport, in order to make them less dependent upontransit through Rhodesia and upon Rhodesian supplies. We would thereby facilitate their imports of oil and other essential supplies andthe export of copper. We should have to consider the action weshould now take in relation to this agreement in the light of thevicious attacks on our policy which had recently been made at theUnited Nations by the Zambian Minister of Foreign Affairs.In these circumstances, we should aim to bring economic sanctions against Rhodesia to the pitch of maximum effectiveness,limited only by the need to avoid confrontation with South Africa,
from whom we should seek as much practical help as could besecured. We should also seek to bring home to the Europeans in rhodesia their isolation in the world and the hopelessness of any future under the present regime. We should also seek to explain to them what a settlement with us would now involve. At a later stage we might possibly look to use the good offices of other countries,particularly Australia and New Zealand. We must however face the prospect of a long period during which sanctions would continue and we should be subject to continuing criticism in the commonwealth and at the United Nations. We must also face the fact that, ifSouth Africa were prepared to give sufficient support to the illegal regime, Rhodesia might eventually fall within the South African orbit.The Foreign Secretary said that the discussions which he had held during his recent visit to the United Nations to negotiateagreement on the resolution on mandatory sanctions had initiallybeen most difficult and contentious, particularly with therepresentatives of other Commonwealth countries. A particularsource of difficulty was that the representatives of Uganda and Nigeriaon the Security Council had been put in the position of having to speak and negotiate there as representatives of a group of 36 african countries at the United Nations and not as representatives of their individual countries. They had, therefore, had relatively littlefreedom of manoeuvre, although they were personally most helpful.In general the pressure of African countries for measures which would lead to confrontation with South Africa had been held off for onlya limited time. It had been necessary to undertake that we wouldmake a periodic report to the Secretary-General of the United nations on our assessment of the effect of sanctions: this report could thenbe attached to the report which he would in turn make to the security council. Nevertheless a clear understanding with the african members of the Commonwealth had been secured on an acceptablebasis on which the resolution might go forward. The latest reportssince his return indicated however that there was renewed pressure for a widening of the resolution in terms which we might not beable to accept. In particular the Zambian Minister of ForeignAffairs was pressing hard that the export of Rhodesian coal shouldbe prohibited, although this would cut off the major supply for the zambian copper mines. It appeared that he took the view that weshould then compensate Zambia for the economic loss to her thatwould be involved.iIn discussion there was general agreement with theCommonwealth Secretary&apos;s memorandum. It seemed most unlikelythat there would be any immediate move by the moderates in rhodesia to overthrow the regime. It was however possible thatMr. Smith might be expelled by his own extremist colleagues. Thiswould have the advantage of making clear where the real power in Rhodesia now lay and might in the longer run therefore be advantageous to us.  It would not however assist in bringing about
such a development if United Kingdom Ministers were openly torefer to the possibility, though we could make clear the extent towhich Mr. Smith, during the discussions on HMS Tiger, was preparedto act against the extremists in his party.It must however be assumed that the regime would continue in power for some time.   If we received Commonwealth support for the action now proposed in the United Nations we should be committed to the related section of the Commonwealth PrimeMinisters&apos; communique; we should have to withdraw all previousproposals for a constitutional settlement and undertake not to submit to the United Kingdom Parliament any settlement  involvingindependence before majority rule.   We need not reiterate this ina formal declaration but it would have to be made clear in parliament that this was the Governments position.   This would much reduceany chance of a negotiated settlement and we must assume that thepresent Rhodesian regime would not at any time agree to end the rebellion and return to the 1961 Constitution without independence.We could not however foresee at this stage how the situation in rhodesia would develop.   There was unlikely to be any early breakin morale but in time, as a result of the pressures exerted by sanctions and by our propaganda, there might arise an opposition to the regime and new men with whom we could deal.   This process would inevitably involve negotiation with them and we must not be thought to be insistent on unconditional surrender.   In negotiation we should of course have to insist on an ending of the rebellion and a returnto constitutional rule and we could not accept any reversion to theproposals in the working document.   We should not however simplyenvisage a return to the position existing before i.d.i.   We shouldalso need to have considered in advance the measures required forthe education and training of the Africans, so that Rhodesia couldprogress over a period to majority rule and to independence.   this might involve financial and other assistance from the UnitedKingdom.   It.must also be recognised that, throughout the period between a return to constitutional rule and eventual independence,we should be subject to heavy and continuing international, andparticularly African, pressure to advance the date of independencebeyond the date which we considered reasonable.   We should thusattract some of the odium which at present attached to Mr. Smith.However this might be,  it would be important, while future developments were so uncertain, that we should not tie our handsby public declarations on the course which we might adopt in circumstances when such negotiations seemed possible and thusrestrict our freedom of action.   If for instance after the present stage at the United Nations the Commonwealth countries were subsequently to press for enforcement action against South Africa,contrary to their agreement in the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos;communique, we could if we so wished regard ourselves as released from our obligation not to consider the grant of independence before majority rule.   Similarly, we should avoid any reaffirmation of ourassurance that we would in no circumstances contemplate the use of force.
It was suggested that a Commission, with suitable all-partymembership, might be established to consider future constitutional arrangements for Rhodesia and the measures by which rhodesia would advance to majority rule and achieve independence. We could thus demonstrate that the United Kingdom Government were not simply demanding unconditional surrender and a return to the 1961Constitution but had positive plans for Rhodesia&apos;s future. Thiscourse might also enable us to escape from the restrictions imposedhitherto by the fact that a settlement had only seemed possible onthe basis of amendments to the 1961 Constitution. The Commissionneed not confine its studies to such a basis. Its appointment might encourage liberal opinion in Rhodesia and would counteract pressureswhich might otherwise arise in this country during the coming monthsf or a resumption of negotiations with the present Rhodesian regime.It was also suggested that the Commission might also visit Rhodesia,if the regime permitted their entry, not in order to negotiate but toobtain the views of all sections of Rhodesian opinion. While therewas general support in principle for the suggestion of a Commissiondoubt was however expressed about the advisability of takingimmediate steps to establish it and about the way in which it should operate. In particular it was suggested that a visit by the Commissionto Rhodesia, whatever its declared purpose, would arouse suspicion that we were prepared to resume negotiations with the regime.It would be better, on this view, to give time for mandatory sanctionsto exert an effect before adopting new constitutional plans whichmight, in the light of future developments, prove inappropriate andunduly restrict our freedom of action.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) With the adoption of mandatory sanctions it would be reasonable that the United Nations should assume a greater measureof responsibility for putting them into effect and that this should notbe left entirely to the United Kingdom. The establishment of a united Nations Commission to supervise the application of sanctionshad been suggested by some of the African delegations but such aCommission would make it more difficult for us to retain controland would be likely to increase the pressure for enforcement actionagainst South Africa. Some members of the Security Council wouldin any event resist a move to entrust the Secretary-General with theresponsibility of supervising the application of sanctions; if theopportunity offered, we should seek to expose the opposition of such members to the effective working of the policy of sanctions. As a compromise we had proposed that the Secretary-General should makeperiodic reports to the Security Council and we would provide him with assessments of the way in which sanctions were working. Itshould thus be possible to bring United Nations pressure to bearagainst any countries which were not observing the resolution. this might be more effective than our own pressure and correspondinglyrelieve some of the odium from which we at present suffered.(b) While the time had not yet come for us to be able to transfer responsibility for Rhodesia to the United Nations, the possibility of
doing so should remain under study. If mandatory sanctions failedin their effect it might well prove the least damaging course open tous and would certainly be preferable to a surrender to the regime.(c) Voluntary sanctions had had a significant effect. There wasa degree of European unemployment; some Europeans were now taking jobs hitherto held by Africans and a number had emigratedto South Africa. Most of the present tobacco crop remained unsoldand the regime would probably have to buy in most of the new crop in the spring. It need not be assumed that mandatory sanctions would fail, although they might well take a considerable time to operate and we could not count on them bringing an early end tothe rebellion.(d) The effectiveness of sanctions would depend above all onthe policy of Portugal and South Africa, particularly in regard tothe embargo on oil supplies to Rhodesia. It seemed likely thatPortugal would comply with the United Nations resolution,particularly in view of her current difficulties in Macao. SouthAfrica had hitherto based her policy on &quot; normal trade&quot; withRhodesia but had not interpreted this to mean that trade should bekept down to pre-i.d.i. levels. It now seemed likely that South Africawould adopt a more cautious policy and if the supply of oil to rhodesia through Mozambique were stopped it might not be whollyreplaced by supplies from South Africa. After the adoption of theUnited Nations resolution we should invite consultation with theSouth African Government and bring home to them the serious consequences if they supported the regime in defiance of the united nations.(e) There were Press reports of the assembly of foreign motor vehicles in British plants in Rhodesia and it was clear that someUnited Kingdom manufacturers, such as the British MotorCorporation and Rovers, had had such arrangements in mind. Theyhad been warned against this but it seemed doubtful whether foreigncountries at least would take effective action unless there were a mandatory United Nations ban on the import into Rhodesia of motor vehicles, aircraft and components. We could accept a suitableamendment to extend our draft resolution in this sense. We had however hitherto resisted pressure to extend the resolution to coverimports into Rhodesia apart from oil; to do so would increase the pressure for a complete embargo on imports with the added riskof confrontation with South Africa.(/) We should take advantage of any opportunity to invoke thegood offices of other countries, particularly the Old commonwealth and the United States, as suggesting in the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;smemorandum. Meanwhile we might at once consult the australian government about the possibility of their encouraging Europeanemigration from Rhodesia to Australia. Given the relatively small numbers of the European community this could have a considerableimpact in Rhodesia.(g) We should need to consider the Zambian Governmenfsrequest for signature of the agreement providing for a further  13-85
million of aid. The agreement would in any case require someamendment in the light of developments since it had been drawnup and we should need to consider the position in the light of theUnited Nations resolution and the effect which this might have onthe Zambian economy. While we should take account of Zambiandifficulties and need not be unduly influenced by their irresponsiblecriticisms of the United Kingdom our attitude must depend on ourown interests including the need to safeguard our copper supplies.It would also be important that any agreement with Zambia shouldnot be signed until we had acceptable undertakings in relation to the zambian sterling balances and until we had also secured satisfactionon the status of our Service personnel in Zambia. In any event,the memorandum should not be signed until a resolution onmandatory sanctions in terms acceptable to us had been passed bythe Security Council.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet took note of the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s paper. It mightbe desirable in the light of the development of the situation to reorganise the structure of Cabinet Committees dealing with Rhodesia.Meanwhile in view of the difference of opinion which had been expressed about the proposal for a Commission to study future constitutional arrangements and the progress of Rhodesia to majority rule and to independence he would consult further with the ministers directly concerned and arrange for a further discussion by the Cabinetearly in the new year. The Foreign Secretary should consult withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Commonwealth Secretaryabout extending the United Nations resolution on Rhodesia to cover the import of motor vehicles, aircraft and components. TheCommonwealth Secretary should consult the Australian government about the possibility of encouraging European emigration from rhodesia to Australia.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C (66) 179.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with &apos;the Ministers primarily concerned, would give furtherconsideration to the question of establishing a Commissionto study future constitutional arrangements for Rhodesia.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the commonwealth secretary and the Minister of Technology, to considerextending the United Nations resolution on Rhodesiato cover the import of motor vehicles, aircraft and components.(4) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to undertakeconsultations with the Australian Government about thepossibility of encouraging European emigration from rhodesia to Australia.
(5) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Ministers primarily concerned, to give furtherconsideration in the light of the discussion to signing thememorandum of understanding with the ZambianGovernment.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13 th December, 1966.J
