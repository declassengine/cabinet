secret parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord President said that, on present indications, the time required for the remainder of the Finance Bill and for the selective employment Payments Bill was likely to be such as to necessitateParliament continuing to sit during the second week in August,unless discussion were restricted by the passing of a guillotine motion.On balance it was desirable for such a motion to be passed and this might allow a maximum of three days for the Committee stage ofthe Selective Employment Payments Bill. In order to ensureadequate debate of the more important clauses of the Bill it wouldalso be desirable for the motion to allot the time available for various sections of the Bill, and for it to be introduced before the committee stage.In discussion it was urged that such limitation of the discussionof the Bill would be unwelcome to a number of members of both parties and that it would be preferable for Parliament to prolong itssitting until the second week in August. It was, however, the general view that a guillotine motion on the lines proposed by the lord president would allow adequate time for discussion of the importantfeatures of the Bill and that the balance of advantage lay in such a motion being passed, so allowing Parliament to rise at the end of thefirst week of August in accordance with the present plan.It was, however, suggested that since difficulties of this naturerelating to important Bills arose every year shortly before the summer Recess, because of the time taken for discussion of theFinance Bill, it would be desirable for the Finance Bill procedure tobe reviewed.  There was general agreement with this proposal.The Cabinet &apos;(1) Invited the Lord President of the Council, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Whip,to introduce a motion for the guillotine procedure inrespect of the remaining stages of the Finance Bill andof the Selective Employment Payments Bill, on the lines indicated in discussion.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for aCommittee of the Ministers primarily concerned toexamine the procedure for dealing with Finance Billswith a view to shortening the time required for their discussion on the floor of the House of Commons.
Iron and SteelNationalisationCompensationProvisions(previous reference:CC(65) 28thConclusions,Minute 2)SECRET*2. The Cabinet were informed of the provisions for compensation which were proposed for the nationalisation of ironand steel companies.The Prime Minister said that in accordance with previouspractice the initial discussion of the appropriate terms ofcompensation for the nationalisation of iron and steel companies hadbeen confined to the Ministers immediately concerned.The Minister of Power said that the Governments previousproposals for compensation were based on stock exchange valuesover the five years from October 1959 to October 1964. The totalcost on this basis was approximately  550 million. This had been criticised at the time as over-generous: nevertheless, a clear and specific undertaking had been given by the Government. TheMinisters immediately concerned had considered whether it wouldbe appropriate to adopt a similar basis of compensation in theIron and Steel Bill and, after discussing a number of possibilities,had concluded that the fairest and also the simplest method was merely to bring forward the five-year period which had previously been adopted, in the light of the time which had elapsed since thepublication of the Governments original proposals. It was henceproposed to adopt the five-year period April 1961 to April 1966. Thetotal cost would be approximately  484 million, since the adoption ofthis period did not involve taking into calculation a period ofparticularly high speculative values after the General Election of1959. This proposal must be considered in the light of the valuationat approximately  967 million of the total assets of the companies concerned and its adoption would undoubtedly arouse strong criticism both in the United Kingdom and in financial circles overseas.Discussion showed general approval for the proposals outlined by the Minister of Power.The Cabinet Approved the basis of compensation for the nationalisation of iron and steel companies proposed by the Minister of power.Oversea affairs vietnam(previous reference:CC(66) 5thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Prime Minister recalled that he had made a statement inthe House of Commons on the preceding day, expressing theGovernments regret at the United States bombing of the oil storagetanks at Hanoi and Haiphong. Press reports that there had been a recent hardening of the attitude of the United States Government inrespect of negotiations to end the Vietnam conflict were, however,without foundation.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
EuropeanEconomicCommunitySouth ArabiaRhodesia(previous reference:CC(66) 25thConclusions,Minute 2)The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the recentPress report, based on his speech at the Western European Union,that the United Kingdom had decided in principle to seek entry intothe Community, were also quite inaccurate and his speech had doneno more than reflect the views on policy which had been expressedin earlier Ministerial statements.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that consideration was being given to the proposal which had been put forward by  Thant, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, that a united Nations Mission should be sent to South Arabia: the balanceof advantage was however difficult to determine and a decision hadnot yet been reached on the attitude which the United KingdomGovernment should take.The Prime Minister said that the informal talks between UnitedKingdom and Rhodesian officials in Salisbury were making no progress. There was some evidence that the leader of the illegal regime, Mr. Smith, took the view that we might be prepared to make concessions because of our economic difficulties arising from the seamen&apos;s strike. It might be necessary to have a pause in the talks,during which time the continuance and, wherever possible, the strengthening of economic sanctions might be expected to have a growing effect on European opinion in Rhodesia.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.PublicExpenditureLocal AuthorityHousingProgramme(previous reference:CC(65) 68thConclusions,Minute 6)confidential. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Housing and Local Government (C (66) 92), amemorandum by the Secretary of State for Wales (C (66) 93) and amemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C (66) 95) aboutthe housing programme.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that, takingboth the public and private sectors together, housing starts in 1965,1966 and 1967 should total 392,000, 400,000 and between 435,000 and450,000 respectively; and completions should number 382,000,400,000 and 435,000 respectively. The vital issue was not to secure400,000 completions in the current year but to ensure that the rateof completions rose from the virtually static level of the last threeyears towards the target of 500,000 for 1970. For this purposedecisions were necessary in the present year.In July 1965 the Cabinet had agreed that public sector approvalsshould be restricted to 150,000 for 1965 and 1966 but had agreedthat, if private sector performance lagged, public sector activity
CONFIDENTIALshould be increased. When he had invoked this proviso in thefollowing December the Cabinet had been advised that the deterioration in the private sector would be likely to be reversed andthat private sector performance would increase by 10 per cent in1966. They had therefore deferred a decision until the statistics gave a more certain indication. He had postponed a further submission to Cabinet for seven months; but it was now clear that private sectorstarts in 1966 would still be about 210,000 (i.e., no higher than in1965) as compared with 247,000 in 1964 under the conservative government. It was now essential, therefore, to increase public sector approvals in order to make good the deficiency in the private sector; and he proposed that, for this purpose, the local authority housing programmes in England should be increased by 7,500approvals for general needs in 1966 and by 7,100 approvals for miners&apos; houses in 1967. These proposals were based on theassumption that new financial measures would be taken to restoreprivate confidence in the private sector. Even so the Governmentcould not rely on the private sector to restore the situation completely;and, if further financial stringency developed, even the more limitedcontribution from the private sector which he was now envisagingmight not be realised.The additional authorisations which he proposed for the public sector would have to be allocated to non-priority areas, because the programmes in priority areas were already using to the full theresources available. But the private sector shortfall was mainlyconcentrated in the South and Midlands; and since it was in these areas that the local authority programmes had been curtailed, come degree of reinstatement of the reductions could be justified. Theproposed increase in approvals for miners&apos; houses did not fall, strictly,within the programme; nor could these houses be regarded as fallingin a priority category. But they could be justified by reference tobroader considerations of policy connected with the future of the coalmining industry.The Prime Minister said he had held a series of meetings withthe Ministers concerned to give preliminary consideration to theproblems now before Cabinet. In these meetings it had been recommended, the Chancellor of the Exchequer reserving hisposition, that the proposed increase of 7,500 in public sectorauthorisations for England in 1966 should be approved; and it hadbeen unanimously agreed to recommend that the 7,100 authorisationsfor miners&apos; houses for England in 1967 should also be accepted onthe understanding that the latter should be included within whatevertotal of authorisations was agreed for the public sector for 1967.Since it was uniquely difficult to regulate the total housing programme in the light of the large private sector element which was not subjectto control, the public sector should be used as a balancing factor inorder to ensure that both sectors, taken together, reached the approved total target. It followed that the public sector programme should be subject to adjustment from time to time in the light of achievement in the private sector.
CONFIDENTIAL7The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the issue before theCabinet was the extent to which the Government should use thepublic sector as a counterpoise to the private sector. Starts in thepublic sector had not yet matched the approvals already given andif the performance of the private sector revived demand could be over-stimulated, with a resultant excessive call on resources. Theproposals before the Cabinet involved a considerable addition to the authorised total of public expenditure, which was already excessivein the light of the failure of the rate of economic growth to achieve its target. This would inevitably require either an increase in taxation or a reduction of departmental programmes of expenditure,which were already in excess of the planned 4j per cent rate of increase. The Cabinet would shortly need to consider this situationand its implications. Meantime, there lay ahead a difficult problemof relating resources to programmes; and, if first priority wereaccorded to the objective of building 500,000 houses a year by 1970,there would have to be at best no increases, and more probably someearly reductions, in other programmes.At this point the Chancellor of the Exchequer had to leave theCabinet.In discussion it was suggested that the housing programme hadbeen agreed by the Cabinet in the previous year on the basis thatthe demand on resources required to build one house was broadly the same in the public sector as in the private sector; a substitution of houses in one sector for houses in the other sector need not involve,therefore, any extra call on resources. The housing programme was now falling behind schedule; and, unless steps were now taken in thepublic sector to counter this tendency, there would be an increasinglyserious shortfall in the total number of houses built. Moreover, therecommendations of the Ministerial Committee on Housing providedfor a slowing down in the public sector at a later date, if it were foundthat the performance in the private sector was ceasing to lag behindschedule. Indeed, the facts that the housing programme fell broadlyas to one-half into the public sector and one-half into the private sector and that the performance of the former could be relativelyeasily regulated were reasons for treating the housing programmedifferently from the other sectors of public expenditure.On the other hand it was argued that, even if a decision toincrease housebuilding in the public sector were necessary in thelight of the prospects of the housing programme considered in isolation, such a decision should not be taken before the pendingreview of public expenditure, which would be bound to be a verycritical one. The proposals under discussion would offset the decrease in privately financed housing by an increase in publiclyfinanced housing; and in present circumstances, unless taxation were increased, this might well require a reduction in other publiclyfinanced programmes. The argument that shortfalls in private sector housing could be made good by equivalent increases in public sector
8CONFIDENTIALhousing without involving any additional call on resources was validonly on the assumption that the resources released by the shortfallhad no other alternative use than public sector housing, whereasthey were more likely to be absorbed by the demands of private consumption, e.g., in connection with the service industries. Butthis was not necessarily true. The resources in question might beused, for example, for the construction of local authority houses forsale; and the fact that such houses, as distinct from houses built forletting, were not included in the total of public sector housingillustrated the inadequacy of the existing arrangements for regulating the total housing programme. Moreover, if a failure of economic growth to reach its target were allowed to entail undue reductions in public sector programmes, these in turn might lead to a furthershortfall in growth, and so provoke a damaging spiral of decliningactivity. From this point of view it would be desirable, in theforthcoming review of public expenditure, to give consideration tothe techniques used in the review in order to ensure that the financial considerations involved were not allowed to distort the balance ofadvantage expressed in terms of real resources.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet endorsed the proposals of the Minister of housing for an increase of 7,500 in authorisations in the localauthority housing programme for England for 1966. the consequential addition of  31 million to public expenditure shouldnot be included in the target for the public expenditure review insuch a manner as to prejudice other parts of the public expenditure programme. The increase in authorisations was on the understandingthat if, in later reviews of the housing programme, it were found that private building was no longer falling short of its target, public sectorauthorisations might then be reduced accordingly. Similarly theproposal for 7,100 authorisations for miners&apos; houses for England for1967 should be approved; but in any future reviews of the housing programme these authorisations should count against the totalauthorisations for the public sector for England for 1967. It wouldbe necessary, during the forthcoming review of public expenditure,to give careful consideration to the question of the relationship between financial and real resources. In advance of that review theTreasury and the Ministry of Housing and Local Government should examine the comparative unit costs of public and private sectorhousebuilding, and should consider the position of local authorityhouses built for sale in relation to the review of public expenditure.The additional 1,000 houses for miners in Wales proposed by theSecretary of State for Wales in C (66) 93 raised rather more complexissues, which might require further consideration.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.
SECRETCC 33 (66)5. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of aviation (C (66) 88), the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(C (66) 89) and the Attorney-General (C (66) 90) on the ConcordProject.The Minister of Aviation said that the position on the Concordproject was in essence little different from that when it was reviewed by the Government immediately on taking office. Furtherauthorisations were now urgently needed if the development of the concord was to continue; and a decision now would in effect commit the Government to completing the development unless someunforeseen major technical difficulty arose. Since the project was last considered, the estimate of the cost of development tocertification of airworthiness had risen to  370 million, of which theUnited Kingdom&apos;s share would be  185 million. Additionaldevelopment after certification and provision for contingencies were likely to bring the total United Kingdom liability on development to 250 million. A decision now to authorise the remainder of thedevelopment programme up to certification would involve an expenditure of a further  145 million over the next five years. Inaddition, working capital for production would have to be providedby the two Governments; the sums outstanding were likely to reach a maximum of  75 million to  110 million for each country in about five or six years&apos; time, but this would be gradually reduced as aircraft were sold.So far the development programme was going according to plan and was proving technically successful. There was no reason to suppose that the Concord could not fly in time to give the three to four years&apos; lead on the production of the United States supersonic transport which would be necessary to enable sales to be made inany quantity. Officials of the two Governments had estimated thatsales might total 150 aircraft, and market studies carried out by united States companies to ascertain sales prospects for their ownaircraft tended to confirm this estimate. Operating costs and salesprospects could however, be adversely affected if restrictions were imposed upon the use of Concord over inhabited areas because ofthe effects of sonic bang, on which it had not yet been possible tocarry out substantial tests.In all the circumstances, and in view of the legal advice and thepolitical objections to withdrawing, it appeared necessary to authorisethe remainder of the development programme of the Concord up tocertification of airworthiness, even though other uses for the economic resources involved might well have proved to be more advantageous.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the foreign secretary and he saw no alternative to proceeding with the Concordproject. The legal advice seemed to make it clear that it would cost the United Kingdom, in financial terms, nearly as much to withdrawAircraftIndustryThe ConcordProject
as to stay in. From the political point of view a second attempt towithdraw from the Concord project could irreparably damage ourreputation for reliability in joint projects of this kind.The Attorney-General said that, having once again reviewed the United Kingdom&apos;s legal position, he could only confirm that therewas no legally defensible way of withdrawing from our obligation under the agreement or of placing a limit on our financial liability under it. If we were to seek to withdraw from the treaty unilaterally,we should face the risk of proceedings in the International Court ofJustice, which could order us to compensate the French for theadditional cost of having to complete the project on their own.In discussion there was general agreement that the economiccase for withdrawing from the project was stronger than ever; butthe consequences of unilateral withdrawal would be very serious andit would be much to be preferred that any decision on the future ofthe project should be taken in full association with the FrenchGovernment. They had to face the same escalation of costs as we did, and there was reason to think that they were concerned aboutthe rising financial commitment. Admittedly M. Pisani, the french minister mainly concerned, had informed the Minister of Aviationthat the French Government had none the less decided to go ahead,and any attempts to explore the French position would have to be conducted with great care. It might, however, be possible to work towards a joint position whereby co-operative efforts would by mutual agreement be concentrated on projects of greater intrinsic advantagethan Concord. The first opportunity for talks at governmental levelwas likely to arise when the French Prime Minister, M. Pompidou,visited London in the first week of July, and it might be appropriate for the Prime Minister on that occasion, without giving M. Pompidouthe impression that we were contemplating unilateral withdrawal,to suggest that the great cost of development (which might well be considerably greater even than the current estimates suggested), andthe risk of restrictions on use because of the sonic bang, made itdesirable to have a further technical and commercial reappraisal ofthe Concord project as a use of the two Governments&apos; resources.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) The Report of the Anglo-French Committee of Officials,dated 13th May, 1966, made it impossible for the United KingdomGovernment to argue that the technical viability of the project was at present open to question. The Government were at least to someextent committed by the views expressed by this Committee, which included United Kingdom officials. It was however argued that thedetails of their report did not support its conclusions. It was also suggested that the Committee of Officials was naturally concernednarrowly with the Concord project, and that it was desirable that united Kingdom officials on the Committee should be made moreaware of the wider economic problems with which the projectpresented the Government and of the serious misgivings of Ministersabout it. The agreement of officials to any future reports should have full regard to these considerations.
(b) It might be that the risk of our being taken to theInternational Court of Justice by the French Government, in theevent of unilateral withdrawal, was being overstated. If we were going ahead with co-operative ventures in other fields (for instance,the Channel Tunnel, other Anglo-French aircraft projects and theEuropean Launcher Development Organisation), it was unlikely thatthe French Government would in practice proceed to ultimatemeasures if we withdrew from Concord. Even if they were to do so,it could not necessarily be assumed that the costs which we might haveto meet would be as great as those which we should face if we continued with the project.(c) One major uncertainty in assessing the future of the Concordwas the effect of sonic bangs. It was suggested that the Governmentwould be exposed to considerable criticism and large claims fornuisance and damages if they undertook a testing programme whichwas inherently likely to damage property and perhaps even damagepeople, and would therefore be ill-advised to test the effects of sonicbang on large centres of population without legislation that would limit their liability for damages. On the other hand it was argued that low-flying Royal Air Force aircraft already on occasion brokethe sound barrier, and that even without legislation the Ministry ofDefence had not had to face undue claims for damages. urgent consideration should be given to further studies of the effects of sonicbang on the operating costs and sales prospects of the Concord, andto the possibility of more extensive tests of the effects of the sonic bangin highly populated areas.(d) It was suggested that if it were agreed not to withdrawunilaterally, and if it proved that the French Government were determined to continue with the project, it might be possible toraise with them the possibility of associating other European countries with the development in such a way as to spread the costs. On theother hand- experience suggested that technical collaboration inprojects of this nature between more than two nations was unlikely to prove efficient and on balance it was felt to be preferable not to pursue this proposal. A major consideration if the project were tobe completed was that this should be done as rapidly as possible,since otherwise the prospect for sales would be gravely damaged. -The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet remained seriously concerned about the Concord project.The consequences of unilateral withdrawal were, however, such thatit was highly desirable that any decisions affecting future developmentof the project should be taken jointly with the French Government.The Government should therefore take such opportunities as mightbe open to them to discover more about the views of the FrenchGovernment on the future of the project, and in particular aboutthe extent to which the anxieties of the Cabinet about rising costs and commercial prospects were shared by French Ministers. Hewould himself seek an opportunity to raise this matter withM. Pompidou, when he came to London, in such a way as not to
arouse suspicion that we were once again seriously contemplatingunilateral withdrawal. In particular he would endeavour to discoverwhether the French Government had taken sufficient account of thepossible effects of restrictions on use on account of the sonic bangupon the operating costs and sales prospects of the Concord; and,if opportunity arose, he might be able to put into M. Pompidou&apos;mind the thought that a further joint appraisal of commercial prospects in the light of technical considerations and rising costsmight be useful. In the meantime the Minister of Aviation shouldurgently consider how the consequences of the sonic bang could bemore thoroughly tested and should re-examine the commercial prospects for the Concord in relation to technical considerations and rising costs, and particularly in relation to the probable consequences of restrictions on use because of the sonic bang. In reporting further to the Cabinet on these matters the Minister of Aviation would nodoubt wish to clarify the position of the United kingdom representatives on the Anglo-French Committee of Officials chargedwith the supervision of the Concord project. He should also consider in consultation with the Attorney-General whether the additionalcosts arising from the need to deal with the sonic bang could not properly be advanced as a technical drawback which would legallyjustify our withdrawal. The Cabinet would resume their consideration of the Concord project in the light of his talks withM. Pompidou and the further report from the Minister of Aviation.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would seek to raise theproblem of the Concord project in his discussions withM. Pompidou, on the lines indicated in his summing&apos; upof their discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation, in consultation as necessary with the Secretary of State for Defence and the Attorney-General, to consider how the consequences of sonic bangcould be more thoroughly tested and to circulate as quickly as possible a further report on the commercial prospects for the Concord in relation to technical consideration (and particularly the sonic bang) and rising costs of development, including the question whether such considerations constituted a technical drawback whichwould legally justify our withdrawal.(3) Agreed to resume discussion of the Concord project at a later meeting, in the light of the Prime Ministers talks withM. Pompidou and of the further report by the Ministerof Aviation.
Space Policy:EuropeanLauncherDevelopmentOrganisation(previous reference:CC(66) 27thConclusions,Minute 2)secret . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Ministry of aviation (C (66) 91) on the European Launcher development organisation (ELDO).The Minister of Aviation recalled that at their meeting on 9th June the Cabinet had authorised him to make clear to the ELDOMinisterial Conference our serious doubts about the viability of theOrganisation, but to state that the Government would be prepared to reconsider their position if (1) our future contribution were reduced to not more than25 per cent;(2) the contribution were subject to an absolute limit of, say, 40 million; and(3) arrangements were agreed for an annual review of theprogramme and for safeguards against automaticcommitments to escalating costs.The Final Resolution of the Conference proposed, subject to theconfirmation of Member Governments, a new scale of contributions from 1st January, 1967, and a limitation of the financial commitments of Member States to agreed annual amounts and agreed ceilings for individual programmes. The proposed United Kingdom contributionwas 27 per cent, which was a rounding up of the contributionappropriate to our proportionate share, based on respective gross national Products, of 26 - 55 per cent. This would involve an increasein our previously contemplated expenditure over the six years 1966-72to  44 -18 million. Since the Conference it had appeared that theFrench Government were concerned that the proposed Frenchcontribution of 25 per cent, as compared with the United Kingdomand German contributions of 27 per cent, would imply a position ofinferiority on their part in the Organisation and be damaging to their national prestige; they might, therefore, wish to increase the Frenchcontribution to 26 per cent as part of a revision of contributions which would reduce the United Kingdom and German percentagesto a similar amount. The third desideratum of the Cabinet had alsobeen agreed in principle, but it now appeared that there was considerable dissension on the means by which legal effect should begiven to it.In these circumstances, he proposed at the next ELDOMinisterial Conference on 7th July to confirm continued UnitedKingdom participation in the ELDO-A programme and to agree to united Kingdom participation in the further programme (ELDO-PAS) on the basis of the proposed new scale of contributions from 1st January, 1967, subject to satisfactory arrangements being agreed for the review of programmes and for safeguards against escalatingcosts. The question of making a statement to that effect in a debate in the House of Commons (as proposed in his memorandum) wouldnot now arise as the debate would not take place.
In discussion it was urged that, since it had proved impossible in negotiation to achieve in full the conditions which the Cabinet had laid down, the United Kingdom should now withdraw from furtherparticipation in the ELDO programmes, having regard to the absenceof scientific, technological or economic justification for them. It was,however, the general view that for the reasons which had been developed in earlier Cabinet discussion such action would on balancebe disadvantageous if it were based solely on the marginal increase inthe United Kingdom percentage and total contributions, thoughevery effort should be made to seek agreement to the reduction ofour percentage contribution to 26 per cent (with a corresponding reduction in our total commitment of  1-25 million) in the light ofthe reported attitude of the French Government. Nevertheless, therewas general agreement that it was of crucial importance that adequatelegal provision should be made by amendments to the convention or the Financial Protocol not only for the annual review of the costof the ELDO programmes, but also for a number of appropriatebreak points which would permit the United Kingdom (and other member Governments) to withdraw if costs rose to an unacceptablelevel.In further discussion it was urged that we should support the location of the equatorial launching site in Australia rather than&apos;in french Guiana, but it was the general view that this was a matter which would require future consideration in the light of thediscussion at the forthcoming ELDO Ministerial Conference.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were on balance agreed that at the forthcoming ELDOMinisterial Conference the Minister of Aviation should be authorisedto confirm continued United Kingdom participation in the ELDO-a programme and participation in the further programme (ELDO-PAS)on the basis that, with effect from 1st January, 1967, the UnitedKingdom percentage contribution would be a maximum of 27 percent and our total contribution a maximum of  44-18 million. TheMinister of Aviation should nevertheless seek, on the basis of the reported attitude of the French Government, to reduce our contribution to 26 per cent, with a corresponding reduction in our total contribution. It would, however, be crucial to our agreement to continue on such terms that satisfactory amendments to theConvention or the Financial Protocol should be agreed whereby therewould not only be annual reviews of the cost of the ELDOprogrammes but also provision for a number of break points at whichthe United Kingdom could withdraw from further participation in programmes if the Government judged this desirable because ofincreasing costs. Unless such provision were agreed, the UnitedKingdom would not be prepared to continue to participate. ,The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Aviation to be guided at the ELDOMinisterial Conference on 7th July by the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
CONFIDENTIALBroadcasting(previous reference:CC(66) 16thConclusions,Minute 6)PirateBroadcastingCONFIDENTIAL7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Postmaster-General (C (66) 94) on pirate broadcasting.The Postmaster-General recalled that the Government were committed by an International Agreement to legislate against thepirate broadcasting stations but that it had not hitherto proved possible to find legislative time for a Bill to implement this undertaking. There had recently, however, been a number of developments which made the introduction of this legislation urgent.New pirate stations had been established and more were threatened,including one with political objectives, and there was increasingcomplaint from European countries of interference with theirdomestic services. In addition, there had been violence beyond thereach of police action, and gangsterism was developing: theGovernment^ will and ability to enforce law and order were nowalso at issue. There was damaging public and Press criticism of theGovernment^ inaction and there would in consequence now be lesspolitical difficulty in introducing legislation: the passage of the bill would be further assisted if his proposals for the provision ofsubstitute sources of light music proved acceptable, but thepublication of legislation against the pirate stations need not awaitdecisions on these proposals. He accordingly sought the agreementof the Cabinet that such legislation should be introduced before the summer Recess and its subsequent passage expedited. In themeantime he had under consideration the institution of proceedings under existing legislation against stations within territorial limits.In discussion there was general agreement that legislation againstthe pirate stations should be introduced before the Recess and thatits further stages should be taken in the autumn.The Cabinet -  \\(1) Approved C (66) 94.(2) Invited the Postmaster-General to bring before the legislation committee the Marine Broadcasting (Offences) Bill.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,30th June, 1966.15
