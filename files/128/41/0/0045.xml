SubjectRhodesiaCommonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Conference
RhodesiaCommonwealthPrimeMinisters&apos;Conference(previous reference:CC(66) 44thConclusions,Minute 2)CC 45 (66)secret the Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Affairs (C (66) 128) on Rhodesia and theCommonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting, to which was appendedthe draft of a statement to the Meeting on behalf of the UnitedKingdom Government.The Commonwealth Secretary said that we had been undergreat pressure at the Meeting and, although we had had support from the old Commonwealth countries and from Malaysia, virtually all other Commonwealth Heads of Delegations had pressed us touse military force, or to declare that there would be no independencebefore majority rule, or to propose mandatory sanctions. unless this pressure could be met in some degree there was a risk that some members would leave the Commonwealth, with a consequentialblow to confidence in the Commonwealth association which could have serious lasting results.There was an approximate balance of view among the Heads of delegations on whether or not force should be used, and it seemed unlikely that there would be any withdrawal from the Commonwealthif we did not concede this course. We had always taken the viewthat we would not use force save to restore law and order, and weshould maintain this stand.&apos; The pressure for a declaration that we would not concedeindependence before majority rule placed us in a more serious difficulty. So far we had never conceded this point, and if we were now to do so it would be clear that it was in consequence of pressure from the Commonwealth and it would destroy any hope ofan agreed settlement in Rhodesia. Nevertheless, it might be possibleto maintain the position on this aspect at the Meeting by making clear what was involved in the application of the fifth principle(that any Constitution providing for independence must be acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole), on the lines suggested in thedraft statement.As regards mandatory sanctions, there would be no difficultyin accepting these on Rhodesian exports of selected raw materials,but this by itself would not be enough to get general Commonwealthacceptance of our policy and there would be strong pressure forsome action in respect of oil. Mandatory sanctions on exports of selected raw materials, which on the basis of the proposalputforward by the Canadian Prime Minister might be chrome, asbestos,copper, iron ore and pig-iron, and perhaps tobacco, would constitute a valuable strengthening of sanctions, since they would affect themain remaining exports of Rhodesia other than those going to zambia. The question was whether, having regard to the risk ofescalation leading to economic.war with South Africa, we could agree to oil sanctions in any form and, if so, whether they should be general or should be limited to Mozambique and whether theyshould be introduced now or delayed until, say, 1st December.  A
ban on oil going through Mozambique, which appeared to be themain source of leakage at present, would be quite ineffective, sinceadequate oil supplies could readily pass through South Africa. Inthese circumstances we should be under heavy pressure to agree tothe extension of mandatory oil sanctions and if they were to be imposed they should cover supplies through South Africa as well asthrough Mozambique. If we could obtain agreement at the Meetingon selective sanctions, then there was a reasonable prospect that in subsequent debate in the Security Council we should be successful in preventing their extension in a manner which would cause gravedamage to our economy.As regards timing, there would on balance be advantage indeferring action until 1st December, when the United nations assembly would still be in session, since this would give further-time to reach a settlement in Rhodesia, provided we were toundertake that if the rebellion had not ended by then we wouldthen agree to limited mandatory sanctions being imposed. In thesecircumstances we should seek agreement at the Meeting on thebasis of the draft statement appended to C (66) 128, which declaredour position on the following lines. We proposed the formationby the Governor, after the end of the rebellion, of a broad-basedGovernment representative of all races in Rhodesia, with responsibility for the armed forces and the police in the Governor^hands. We would then seek to devise a Constitution to besubmitted to the Rhodesian people as a whole for their acceptance.It would be for consideration how far Commonwealth members could be associated with the test of acceptability, and in any event we should wish to continue the fullest consultation with all Membersof the Commonwealth on these matters. We would propose to acquaint the Governor with these proposals and arrange for consultations to be held with all sections of opinion in Rhodesia.If by 1st December, 1966, they were not accepted, we would beprepared to agree to appropriate mandatory sanctions under chapter VII of the United Nations Charter involving selectedRhodesian exports and sanctions against the import of oil intoRhodesia.The Prime Minister said that many representatives at theCommonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting felt frustrated because oftheir powerlessness to act against Rhodesia. Nevertheless most ofthe speeches had shown some sense of responsibility and certainspeakers had explicitly recognised that the United Kingdom couldnot engage in economic warfare with South Africa. It had beensuggested that we had misled the Commonwealth about the grantof independence before majority rule. This was not true; our position had been fully set out by the Commonwealth Secretary at theCommonwealth Conference in 1965 and in the Blue Book issued bythe Government in November 1965. Our intention to seek asettlement on the basis of the six principles, of which the first wasthat there was to be unimpeded progress to majority rule and thesecond that there should be no retrogressive amendments of theConstitution, made it clear that independence could come before
majority rule if this were acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as awhole. To declare that we would not grant independence before majority rule would therefore be.a reversal of policy which wouldlay the Government open to severe criticism in Parliament. Theposition would however change if Mr. Smith, the leader of the illegal regime, rejected all reasonable offers and this could be made clear to him when the offers were made. The fifth principle would givethe Rhodesian Africans a veto on the grant of independence before majority rule and we could stress at the Commonwealth conference the safeguards on which we should insist in order to counter anysuspicion that the fifth principle would not be fairly applied. TheRhodesion Nationalist leaders would have to be released andallowed to propagate their views so long as they actedconstitutionally. We could also provide for Commonwealthassociation, for instance, by means of observers if there were to bea referendum, or by consulting certain Commonwealth Heads of governments about the membership of the Royal Commission. Asregards mandatory sanctions it was the virtually unanimous viewof the Conference that there must be some move in this direction.If agreement could be reached at the Conference on limited sanctionsit would be possible to count on Commonwealth support to resist pressure at the United Nations to extend the scope of sanctions,particularly against South Africa. Without such agreement weshould be under immediate pressure at the United Nations involving the risk of confrontation with South Africa. The Canadian proposalfor a selective mandatory ban on Rhodesian exports would not initself be sufficient and some action against oil supplies to rhodesia would be essential. He would himself favour limiting oil sanctionsinitially to Mozambique since this would gain time before thequestion of South African involvement was raised. It was accepted that the main leak in the oil embargo at present was the railwaythrough Mozambique, whether the oil itself originated in the refinery at Lourenco Marques or in South Africa.In discussion there was general agreement on the importanceof securing agreement at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos;Meeting. Apart from the other serious consequences of disagreement and of the possible break-up of the Commonwealth,our subsequent position at the United Nations in respect of rhodesia would be gravely embarrassed. Agreement at the Meetingon the action to be taken in the United Nations would give us a pledge of Commonwealth support in the Security Council and theexercise of Commonwealth influence with other members of the afro-Asian group against pressure for more extreme measures. Ifthe Meeting broke down we should meet almost united opposition in the Security Council and the Assembly and would face the dilemma of using our veto or accepting economic confrontation with south Africa. The prospect of reaching agreement would dependon our ability to satisfy the majority of the Commonwealth on thequestion of not granting independence before majority rule and onthe scope of mandatory sanctions.
The explanation of the meaning of the fifth principle and the safeguards which we would attach, including Commonwealthparticipation, on the lines suggested in paragraph 4 of the draft statement, might satisfy the other Members of the Commonwealththat they need not insist at this stage on a declaration that therewould be no independence before majority rule. On the otherhand they might argue that if the distinction between the fifthprinciple and the declaration were so slight we ought to be readyto make the declaration forthwith; a refusal to do so, particularly ifit were known that after the Conference we would be having furthertalks with the illegal regime, would increase suspicion about our intentions. It could also be argued that in the light of past experience and in view of the behaviour of the illegal regime,particularly the recent attempt to amend the Constitution, no constitutional provision to prevent retrogressive amendment wouldin practice be effective and hence that we could not in fact grant independence before majority rule; to announce this would be achange of policy but one which could be justified by the change inthe situation since the illegal declaration of independence. Asagainst this it was argued that to declare now that there would beno independence before majority rule would be regarded as a surrender to African pressure. It would remove any prospect of reaching a negotiated settlement arid would drive Rhodesia into the arms of South Africa., The position would be different if all reasonable, proposals for a settlement had been rejected by the illegal regime. The change of policy which the declaration would represent could then be more easily justified in. this country.Moreover, if Mr. Smith had made it clear that he would not accept any reasonable settlement the South African Government would beless likely to support him. There were therefore strong arguments for deferring a declaration that there would be no independencebefore majority rule until a further attempt had been made tosecure a negotiated settlement. The question was whether theCommonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting could be brought toaccept this.In discussion of sanctions there was general agreement on thedesirability of imposing a mandatory ban on certain Rhodesianexports. The major difficulty was in respect of oil. There wouldbe the gravest objections to the imposition of mandatory sanctionson the supply of oil to Rhodesia through all countries, since thiswould immediately involve a confrontation with South Africa withthe risk either that the United Nations would be seen to be ineffective, or that sanctions would then be imposed against SouthAfrica with consequent catastrophic results for the United kingdom economy. It was, however, argued that the imposition of mandatorysanctions on the transit of oil through Mozambique could bejustified on the grourid that this was at present the main source ofsupply to Rhodesia. The sanction, could be imposed without involving South Africa, in that, although the supplies in questionpassed into South Africa at one stage, they had subsequently topass through Mozambique again in order to reach Rhodesia via theMalvernia railway.   If Portugal did not accept such sanctions, it
would then be necessary to reduce supplies of oil to Mozambiqueitself, or to cut them off completely. There would be no insuperable difficulty in enforcing such a blockade provided that adequate naval forces could be made available. It was pointed out however that inthat event there would be no difficulty in Rhodesian requirementsbeing met by the increase of oil supplies from South Africa overthe Beit Bridge at comparatively small additional cost. Theimposition of even limited sanctions in respect of oil would therefore eventually lead to a confrontation with South Africa. Itwas, however, argued that such confrontation would not arise forsome time, that this would provide more opportunity for an agreed settlement in Rhodesia, and, furthermore, that the threat of suchconfrontation might well lead the South African Government toput further pressure upon Mr. Smith to accept our proposals for asettlement.On the other hand, it was pointed out that a cut-off of oilpassing through Mozambique would cut off supplies to Swaziland,that traffic over the Bechuanaland railway could hardly be exempted and henceJhat there would be a grave threat to suppliesof all kinds to the two remaining Protectorates of Bechuanalandand Basutoland. Bechuanaland was particularly vulnerable to south African pressure since the cut-off of the railway would in practical terms mean starvation for its people, as Bechuanaland was now in its sixth year of famine and was dependent on supplies offood coming over the railway. Since Rhodesia had adequate supplies to meet any temporary inconvenience that might result, itwas argued that it was not on balance desirable to seek theimposition of limited sanctions unless there was good reason to expect that, in the time before this led to confrontation with SouthAfrica, Mr. Smith was likely to accept a settlement on our terms.It was also maintained that there was grave objection of principle to imposing mandatory sanctions on Portugal alone, that it wouldbe apparent that this action had been taken solely because we were only prepared to have a confrontation with the smaller and weakerof the two countries concerned in supplying oil, and that ourconsequent position would be indefensible.On balance, however, there was a wide measure of support forthe view that, despite the difficulties and the risks involved, it mightbe necessary to accept limited mandatory oil sanctions in respect of oil passing through Mozambique if this proved necessary in orderto obtain agreement at the Meeting of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters to our policy on Rhodesia. It was suggested that there might be advantage if any statement to the Meeting were to confineour proposal to the acceptance of limited mandatory oil sanctionsin general terms rather than to make it explicit that the proposalrelated solely to oil passing through Mozambique. It was, however,the general view that this course might lead to a misunderstanding of what was involved, and hence to a breakdown of the agreementwith Commonwealth countries when the matter was raised in specificterms at the United Nations.
Discussion then turned to the timing for the introduction of mandatory sanctions, both in respect of selected exports and inrespect of certain imports of oil, and to the handling of the complex of issues on which agreement might be sought at the meeting.As regards the timing of the introduction of mandatorysanctions, the view was expressed that it might not be possible toobtain the agreement of other Commonwealth Members to a courseof action which involved postponement of the introduction of suchsanctions until 1st December. Even if such agreement proved possible, there might subsequently be renewed suspicions, particularlyin respect of any further talks that might then be held withRhodesia, and consequently agreement to our policy by african members of the Commonwealth might not be forthcoming in subsequent discussion at the United Nations. On the other hand,it was argued that the delay in the introduction of such sanctions would enable us to put further pressure upon Mr. Smith without incurring the difficulties which mandatory sanctions would imposefor our relations with other countries, as well as in respect of the talks themselves. In particular, they would give time to ascertain the likely position of the South African Government under whateverPrime Minister might succeed Dr. Verwoerd and would make thatGovernment more likely to bring pressure to bear upon Mr. Smithto accept our proposals for a settlement. In the light of theseconflicting considerations, there was general agreement that thequestion of timing turned primarily on the acceptability of postponement to the Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.In considering the bases of agreement as a whole at theMeeting it was suggested in the light of the views expressed earlier in discussion that if it proved necessary in order to obtain, theagreement of the Commonwealth Heads of Delegations to our policy on Rhodesia we should be prepared to move to a statement thatno independence would be granted before majority rule. It shouldbe made clear at the same time that we did not envisage earlyindependence with majority rule and that the period of politicaldependence of Rhodesia would probably last a considerable numberof years. This course commanded general assent. It was also suggested that if necessary, in order to obtain agreement, we might also commit ourselves to accepting the imposition of widermandatory oil sanctions, but it was the general view that this coursewould involve unacceptable risk to the position of the UnitedKingdom.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that he should endeavour to seek agreement at theMeeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers on the basis of thestatement attached to C (66) 128 save that we could only acceptmandatory oil sanctions if they were limited to the transit of oilthrough Mozambique. It would be necessary in addition to offer to have a resumption of the Meeting in the spring, at a time whenthe sale of the Rhodesian tobacco crop would bring the maximumeconomic pressure to bear upon Mr. Smith to accept our terms for
a settlement. We might also offer to Mr. Smith, as one of the alternatives, a small Commonwealth Mission, at the level of PrimeMinister or its broad equivalence, under the chairmanship of theCanadian Prime Minister, to consult all shades of opinion in rhodesia and seek the basis of a settlement. In any event, such a body would be desirable as a continuing consultative body onRhodesian policy in future. We should also offer to involve such a body in the ascertainment of the fifth principle, e.g., by havingCommonwealth observers if there were a Referendum, or by seeking the recommendations of the Commonwealth Heads of Governmentsconcerned in the Mission of suitable members for a RoyalCommission. The Cabinet were also of the view that he should, ifit were necessary in order to obtain agreement, commit the UnitedKingdom Government to a statement that independence would notbe granted to Rhodesia before majority rule. It would have beendesirable in principle to hold a further Cabinet meeting before making such a statement, if it were deemed necessary to make.it,but the Cabinet felt that the publicity which would inevitablyaccompany their meeting for this purpose, with the implication thatthe statement had only been made in deference to Commonwealthpressure, was such as to make a meeting undesirable. It might,however, be possible to hold a meeting of the Committee ofMinisters more immediately concerned with the Rhodesian question and only to hold a subsequent meeting of the Cabinet if discussion at that Committee suggested that this was necessary.The Cabinet (1) Approved C (66) 128, subject to the qualification indicated by the Prime Minister.(2) Agreed that the statement of the United KingdomGovernmenfs position at the Meeting of commonwealth prime Ministers might, if necessary in order to obtain agreement at the Meeting, be amplified as indicated bythe Prime Minister in his summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,10th September, 1966.
