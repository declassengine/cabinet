IndustrialDisputesSeamen&apos;strike(previous reference :CC (66) 29thConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary(C (66) 84), to which was attached a report by officials on the actionto be taken in the light of the seamen&apos;s strike, together with a Noteby the Home Secretary (C (66) 85), summarising the views of the ministerial Committee on Emergencies on the recommendations inthe report by officials.The Prime Minister said that in accordance with the discussion in Cabinet on 16th June he had, on the following day, had discussions with the leaders of the Shipping Federation and the National Unionof Seamen (McManus). He had been able to bring the two sides together for a joint discussion of the possibilities of a settlement; but it had become clear that the discussions were fruitless. He had then met thefull Executive of the McManus and had made clear to them the government&apos;s view of the position; but the Union had decided onthe following day to continue the strike. Both he and the Ministerof Labour had felt that many members of the McManus Executive wouldhave supported a return to work if they had been free from pressuresagainst this course. The General Secretary of the McManus (Mr. Hogarth)had considered the possibility of taking a ballot on the question of continuing the strike; but there were formidable objections to this.In the last ballot taken by the McManus for the election of the ExecutiveCommittee only 5,000 out of 55,000 members had voted. Moreover,the method of balloting presented great difficulties for seamen on long voyages and both the question to be put and the recordingof votes offering opportunities for manipulation. There were considerable uncertainties as to the Union&apos;s roll of membership,which included many who had not been to sea for a considerable time; and a ballot could not be taken in less than a fortnight at best.For all these reasons he and the Minister of Labour had come tothe same view as Mr. Hogarth.The strike now showed signs of disintegrating; but the samepressures to maintain it were being brought to bear in the ports asin the Executive Committee. It was quite clear that the executive of the McManus were being subjected to organised pressure by their moremilitant members, inspired by a small group who were not membersof the Executive but were meeting daily to further the extension ofthe strike. The existence and methods of the group were known tosome members both of the Press and of the Executive of the NUSitself; and it was for these reasons that he had thought it right, inagreement with the Minister of Labour, to bring these facts, by meansof his statement in the House of Commons on the previous day, tothe notice of the country and the main body of the membership ofthe Union. Thereafter he had again seen Mr. Hogarth to tell himsomething of the background of the dispute as indicated in his parliamentary statement.....The Home Secretary said that at the meeting of the ministerial committee on Emergencies on the preceding day it had become apparent that action under the Emergency Powers might not become necessary before the end of the week. The Committee had therefore
thought it right to advise the Cabinet in the terms of his NoteC (66) 85, namely, that the Proclamation of Emergency should be renewed and a further set of Emergency regulations made on22nd June; that the existing policy of avoiding emergency actionwhich could have serious industrial consequences should becontinued; but that Departments should authorise more liberally,as necessary, the exceptional use of sea, air or road transport andother facilities for the movement of goods.In discussion it was urged that whilst the first of these recommendations was essential and the third unexceptionable inthe circumstances, some firmer action than was proposed in thesecond recommendation was necessary, in view of the Union&apos;decision to continue the strike and of the Prime Ministers statement in the House of Commons about the background of this decision.For this purpose the setting up of Port Emergency Committees(PECs) would be appropriate as indicating the governments determination to be prepared for an extension of the strike, withoutimmediately involving provocative action.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) If the strike continued, it would sooner or later become necessary to use the Emergency Powers in the ports; and themachinery for this purpose, in the shape of the PECs, should beready and waiting. The preparations already made, however, wouldenable these Committees to be set up at a few hours notice; and itmight be an error in tactics to establish them until there wasmanifestly work for them to do.(b) A further argument against premature action in relation tothe PECs was the fact that the absence of congestion in the ports sofar was largely due to the agreement reached early in the strikebetween the McManus and the Transport and General Workers&apos; union to keep open certain berths. In the light of this it would be bothwrong and provocative to set up the PECs before they were needed to deal with actual congestion.(c) On the other hand it was difficult to justify the renewal ofEmergency Powers if they were not used; and, given that theOpposition were likely to challenge the renewal, there would be advantage in being able to point to at least one instance in whichthey had been put into effect. Moreover, even though it had notbeen necessary to use the Powers, it might become necessary to do soat short notice. Their renewal was therefore fully justified on these grounds; and similar considerations would be understood as applying to the establishment of the PECs.id) If a demonstration of firm action was called for, it wouldbe best for this to be at the points where it had alreadybecome necessary. The strike had already caused considerable damage to the economy of the Scottish Islands. So far the minimum of essentials had been taken in and nothing had been brought out,with consequential damage to the Islands&apos; exports to the mainlandof fish, livestock and livestock products. On the other hand royal navy ships were not suitable for the purpose envisaged; and thearrangements made by the Ministerial Committee on Emergencies
on the preceding day would now allow the export of bacon and cheese, although not fish products.(e) Seamen terminating their contract at the end of a voyagewould qualify for unemployment benefit provided that they were not going back to sea and were seeking work ashore. The Ministry ofLabour was trying to estimate the number of cases of this kind,though there was considerable difficulty in determining how manycould be classified as cases of where the strike was being subsidised.In further discussion it was stated that the main effect of thestrike on United Kingdom trade to date had been to delay heavyexports to Australia and New Zealand. Surplus air freight capacity for exports to distant markets as well as to Europe was still available;but the air freight charges were not economic. It had been ascertained that the Royal Air Force (RAF) could carry 4,000 tons of goods aweek to Europe and a few hundred tons to Australia and NewZealand; but the problem of uneconomic cost would still arise.Between 70 and 80 per cent of exports were getting away in foreign ships; and the main use of air freight would be for exporters in exceptional difficulties. The Board of Trade were investigating ascheme whereby in such cases they could be asked for assistance in securing air freightage from the RAF.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the two recommendations of the ministerial committee on Emergencies, that the Proclamation of emergency should be renewed and a further set of Emergency Regulations madeon the 22nd June and that Departments should authorise moreliberally, as necessary, the exceptional use of sea, air or road transport and other facilities for the movement of goods. Thebalance of opinion was that PECs should also be established on22nd June.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for the Home Department toarrange for the renewal of the Proclamation of emergency and of the Emergency Regulations, and for a furtherRegulation, conferring certain Emergency Powers on theMinistry of Aviation, to be made on 22nd June.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Home Department toinform Departments that the exceptional use of sea, airor road transport and other facilities for the movement ofgoods might now be authorised more liberally, as necessityarose.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for the Home Department, inconsultation with the Minister of Labour and the Ministerof Transport, to arrange for the Port emergency committees to be constituted forthwith and for a public announcement of this to be made on 22nd June.
confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State (C (66) 79) on the Channel Tunnel.The First Secretary of State said that, after preliminary studieshad shown that as between a Channel tunnel and a bridge theadvantage was decisively in favour of the former, the previous administration, in conjunction with the French Government, had decided in February 1964 to carry out a detailed examination of thetechnical feasibility of, and economic case for, a tunnel. The present estimates were that a tunnel with a very large capacity for freight,passengers and accompanied cars would take about five years tobuild and cost  134 million ( 160 million inclusive of capital charges and interest capitalised over the construction period). A joint official report on problems of organisation and finance would be ready inJuly, but all the technical and economic assessments required for adecision in principle were already available. There would be political advantage in reaching such a decision by the time the French PrimeMinister and Foreign Minister paid their visit to the United kingdom on 6th July.The technical and economic appraisal showed that a bored tunnelwas technically feasible and that there was no serious geologicalimpediment. Its construction would not impose a serious additional burden on United Kingdom resources. On the latest estimates oftraffic demand the overall net economic benefit, as compared withmeeting traffic requirements by surface or air transport, was between 250 million and  350 million and the &quot; discounted cash flow &quot; rateof return was between 17 and 21 per cent. This clearly allowed amplemargin for contingencies.The construction of the Channel Tunnel would increase theattractiveness of the Channel port area of the South-East region, butthe growth of trade with Europe would in any event tend to have this effect: nor would a stimulus to growth in the part of Kent concernedbe unwelcome. The opening of a direct rail link with Europe could lead to better use of the railways and bring to United Kingdomdeep-sea ports ocean-bound traffic which would otherwise go to continental ports. The net effect on regional development wasunquantifiable and though, on balance, it appeared that it would benecessary to strengthen the Governmenfs control over regionalindustrial development, any disadvantages in this field were greatlyoutweighed by the economic advantages of the Tunnel as a whole.In the Ministerial Committee on Economic Development therehad been some reservations on the estimates of cost and traffic andon the regional consequences, but the main difficulty arose in respectof organisation and finance. It was clear from the discussions between French and United Kingdom officials that the FrenchGovernment would insist that the Tunnel should be constructed asa basically private enterprise, raising its own capital. They would,however, agree that it should be operated by a public authority which,it was suggested, should have the right to acquire all the rights ofthe Tunnel after a certain period. It would be necessary for the lease
CONFIDENTIAL7agreement to provide the equity holders with the prospect of areasonable return on their investment, while ensuring that they didnot reap excessive profits. While there was objection on grounds ofprinciple to the construction and ownership in the initial period ofthe Tunnel by private enterprise, the balance of advantage lay in accepting the French view. There were, moreover, certaincompensating advantages in that this arrangement would relieve theheavy pressure upon United Kingdom public finance in the periodinvolved and might facilitate the investment of European funds inthe project. In these circumstances, the Committee on balance hadtaken the view that the Government should now decide in principle to go ahead with the Channel Tunnel without delay, on the basisof a private enterprise company to construct and hold it and a public authority to operate it, subject to detailed negotiations with theFrench Government and the private interests concerned on the termsinvolved. These should include the reservation of the UnitedKingdom right in principle to participate in the equity of the investment company and to a guarantee of unrestricted access to theTunnel for through traffic between the United Kingdom and continental countries other than France.In discussion it was urged that the objection in principle to private enterprise constructing and owning the Tunnel in the initial period should be overriding. The use of the term &quot; risk capital &quot; wasinappropriate in the circumstances involved, irt that no substantialrisk would be borne by private enterprise and it was unacceptablethat private capital should obtain a rate of profit which might beincommensurate with the degree of risk involved. It was also suggested that the increased economic attractiveness of the South-East region arising from the construction of the Tunnel would be damaging to the Governments regional policy and the economic interests of other regions of Great Britain. There might also be advantage in waiting for the fuller studies which would be availablein July before deciding in favour of a tunnel, rather than, say, a cross-channel bridge, or in favour of a rail tunnel rather than a road and rail tunnel combined.It was, however, the general view that the further studies whichwould become available would not affect the broad technical andeconomic appraisal which had already been made and which showeddecisive economic arguments in favour of the construction of a tunnelfor rail traffic. The Cabinet were informed that there were noobjections on defence grounds to this proposal. As regards the regional consequences it was pointed out that, while further studywas required, the considerations were by no means wholly one-sided!The growth of United Kingdom trade with Europe would in any event have implications for the economic growth of the South-East.The construction of a rail tunnel would however enhance theeconomic attractiveness of rail transport and this, in addition to its value for its own sake, could if properly exploited improve theeconomic competitiveness of regions other than the South East, aswell as that of the United Kingdom deep sea ports. In considering
the question of public ownership it was also the general view that,while in principle such ownership would have been desirableif acceptable to the French Government (whose attitude was determined by their own Budget difficulties rather than on ideologicalgrounds), there were substantial financial advantages in theconstruction being financed by private capital. This would relieve the pressure upon public financing in the period involved and, in additionto attracting European investment, was calculated to cause lessadditional strain upon United Kingdom financial resources as awhole. In this connection, however, the negotiation of theGovernments option to acquire the rights of the Tunnel at a later date would be of particular importance.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement with the proposals put forward in thememorandum by the First Secretary of State and further action should proceed accordingly. Additionally it would be necessary tocarry out a detailed study of the regional consequences of theconstruction of the Tunnel and for consideration to be given to thepossible need for measures to be taken by the Government to counteract any undue stimulus to the development of the South Eastregion.The Cabinet (1) Approved C (66) 79.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Economic Development toconsider, on the basis of a draft prepared by the Ministerof Transport, the statement which should be made to theFrench Prime Minister on 6th July.(3) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theMinisters concerned, to arrange for a further detailed study of the regional implications of a decision in principle to construct the Channel Tunnel and of any further measures which the Government might need to take tomaintain their regional development policy.secret.  The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the first secretary of State on prices and incomes policy (C (66) 81), on thedraft Prices and Incomes Bill (C (66) 80) and on pay review machinery(C (66) 82); and a memorandum by the Minister of Labour (C (66)CC (66) 23rd    33) on arbitration and courts of inquiry.Conclusions,Minute 3) The First Secretary of State said that it would be convenient first to consider the issues of policy raised in his memorandum on prices and incomes policy (C (66) 81), because decisions on other matters before the Cabinet would largely flow from the major decisions ofpolicy. Since the Government took office they had been developing a policy for productivity, prices and incomes which was designed,on the basis of co-operation and agreement with representative bodiesPrices and&apos;   incomes policy(previous reference :
on both sides of industry, to bring about a gradual but lastingimprovement in the relationship between the growth of prices and incomes and the growth of national productivity. The initial steps,which had not been easy to achieve, had been to secure agreement to a joint declaration of intent and to the principles of prices and incomes policy as set out in the White Paper (Cmnd. 2639). At that stage the Government had deliberately rejected any idea of a standstillin the level of prices and incomes, mainly on the ground that it wouldmake impossible any attempt to work out a longer-term policy for prices and incomes and productivity. It had always been recognisedthat the policy would be effective only over a time; none the less inthe 14 months since the White Paper was published there had forseveral reasons been less success than might have been hoped in achieving some restraint in the growth of personal incomes in relationto the growth of productivity. Despite the fact that the level ofemployment and of industrial investment had been maintained, andthe volume of imports increased, production and output per headhad risen less than had been expected. The Governmenfs relativesuccess in holding down prices, at any rate up to the end of March1966, at a time when incomes were continuing to rise had added tothe pressure of demand. It was now necessary to decide whether tocontinue broadly on the lines of the existing policy, developing it within the limits set by the general basis of co-operation and agreement on which it was founded and recognising that it could notbe expected to have dramatic results over a short period of time;or whether the exigencies of the economic situation demanded more drastic measures, in particular the institution of a prices and incomesstandstill.His own view was that the Government should not seek tointroduce a standstill. This would seriously prejudice the chances of the longer-term policy and of retaining support for that policy;the measure of influence on wage claims which the EconomicCommittee of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) had graduallyachieved would be lost; and a standstill was bound to be unfair inits incidence, partcularly on wages and salaries in the public sectorwhere the Government would be able and bound to insist upon itsimposition. If it were accepted that there should be no standstill,the alternative was to carry forward the existing policy, by developing the principles in agreement with the TUC and the Confederation ofBritish Industries (CBI) and others, by changes in pay review and arbitration machinery on the lines discussed in C (66) 82, and bythe introduction of the Prices and Incomes Bill in order to givestatutory force to the early warning system, on the lines suggestedin C (66) 80. At the same time the Government would need to reaffirm that it was their policy to aim at a rising rate of growth and a proper relationship between incomes and growth; and it wouldbe necessary to consider further why the measures taken so far toencourage the growth of industrial productivity had been lesssuccessful than might have been hoped.
A decision on this major question of policy was a necessary preliminary to a decision on the Prices and Incomes Bill, since it wouldin his view be inappropriate to introduce the Bill if the government decided to adopt a policy of a prices and incomes standstill.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he accepted the first secretary&apos;s approach to prices and incomes policy, which was animportant element in the education of public opinion in a democracyabout the consequences of maintaining a high level of employment.Nevertheless, the policy had not so far succeeded in substantiallymoderating the growth of incomes; and the balance of paymentssituation was such that it was not possible simply to rely on leaving the policy to achieve its results in the fullness of time. Apart fromany other measures that might be necessary and it must berecognised that the effect of the selective employment tax would beto impose a considerable measure of deflation between Septemberwhen collection of the tax would start and February when repaymentswould start he considered that the measures proposed by the first secretary of State should be supplemented by an announcement thatthe norm for increases in prices and incomes for the next 12 months should be nil and that any increases at all would need to be strictlyjustified by the criteria which had been laid down. It might bedesirable to accompany such a move by a public gesture of some kind to encourage voluntary offers of temporary reductions in largerincomes.In discussion the view was expressed that the prices and incomes policy had been misconceived from the outset and represented the wrong approach to the problems with which it sought to deal. The policy had, if anything, accelerated the pressure of incomes inflation by encouraging attempts to seek to anticipate its effects. On this basis it would be preferable that the Governmentshould not proceed with the Prices and Incomes Bill, which wasincompatible with the Governmenfs relationship with industry andthe trade union movement, and should consider other means of achieving the aims of their economic policies.On the other hand there was a wide measure of agreement thatthe Government had been right to initiate a prices and incomes policy in the form and manner which they had adopted, that thearguments against a prices and incomes standstill were cogent andthat the right course of action was to proceed on the general lines proposed by the First Secretary of State. At the same time it couldbe argued that the Government had relied on the prices and incomes policy for more than it could be expected to achieve and had on occasion tended to defer difficult but necessary decisions in a mistakenover-reliance on the policy for fear of prejudicing it. If, therefore, theGovernment now decided to continue this policy, the Cabinet shouldwithout delay take stock of the whole range of economic prospectsand strategy for the next four or five years, in order to review theprices and incomes policy in its wider context and to consider whatalternative or supplementary measures were available and whatdecisions on policy might need to be taken on the assumption that only a gradual development of prices and incomes policy could be
expected. Such a review should concentrate primarily on thepossibility of further action to encourage the growth of industrial productivity.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) While a norm of nil, on the lines suggested by the Chancellorof the Exchequer, would differ from a standstill in that it would leave room for price and income increases in exceptional cases, itwould be widely regarded as a standstill; and for this reason it mightwell be impossible to combine it with the introduction of the prices and Incomes Bill. On the other hand it might be desirable to suggest a norm of less than the present 3-3-1- per cent, perhaps onecorresponding to the actual increase in productivity, although it hadto be remembered that the 3-3-J per cent figure had been agreed bythe TUC and the CBI and that they would not necessarily accept a lower figure. There might, indeed, be some advantage in not naminga figure or range of figures since any figure tended to set not a normbut a minimum for increases of wages and salaries.(b) There might well be more public support now than beforefor a standstill, or for a lower norm, if the need for it could be clearlyexplained to public opinion.(c) The reasons for the lack of success of the prices and incomes policy in achieving the necessary degree of restraint so far werecomplex. One reason was that some of those who supported thepolicy in principle did not carry that support through in practice.Another reason was a lack of the necessary degree of voluntarydiscipline. A third reason was a general impression among lowerpaid workers that the policy was enforced upon them more rigorouslythan upon some of those who were more highly paid. TheGovernments own decisions in certain cases, e.g., judges anddoctors, had contributed to this impression. It might be desirableto re-examine the possibility of a two-standard norm, with a higher rate for lower paid than for higher paid people, although inemployments where income levels covered a wide range this would create problems in relation to differentials. It would also be desirableto make it clear that the policy applied not just to weekly wage earners and public servants but also to the higher salary levels in industry and commerce and to professional fees, dividends and rents.(d) There would be some presentational advantages if the prices and Incomes Bill gave powers to require not only compulsorynotification of dividend increases but also a temporary standstill, aswith prices and salaries and wages. It was recognised, however, thatthere would be formidable difficulties about a statutory power torequire a standstill on dividends; the tuc&apos;s Economic Committeehad reluctantly accepted the objections as decisive.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas a substantial measure of support for the general objectives of theprices and incomes policy as stated in the First Secretary of State&apos;smemorandum (C (66) 81). The immediate need was to put the First
Secretary in a position to meet the Parliamentary Labour Party thefollowing day. Sufficient measure of agreement had been reached on general principles to enable the Cabinet to authorise the first secretary to say that the Government were maintaining their intentionof introducing a Prices and Incomes Bill. He might indicate, however,that the Government were prepared to have further consultations with those concerned before the Second Reading of the Bill; andhe should emphasise that the Bill would contain provision enabling the Government to require compulsory notification and to allowreference to the Prices and Incomes Board, of dividend increases. Heshould also emphasise there was no provision for imprisonment as adirect penalty of failure to comply with any provision of the Bill andthat penalties for non-payment of fines, whether imposed under this or other legislation, were being considered as a general question bythe Home Secretary in relation to the forthcoming Criminal justice bill.  Discussion of the details of the draft Prices and Incomes bill and of the proposed modifications of pay review and arbitrationmachinery should be resumed, in the light of the First Secretary ofState&apos;s report on his meeting with the Parliamentary Labour Party,at the next meeting of the Cabinet.  Arrangements would be madefor the Cabinet at an early meeting to have a full discussion ofeconomic prospects and policies, in which the development of theprices and incomes policy could take its place particularly in relationto the achievement of a faster rate of industrial growth and higher productivity.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the First Secretary of State should inform theParliamentary Labour Party at their meeting on 22nd Junethat the Government intended to proceed with theintroduction of a Prices and Incomes Bill and should explain the Governments proposals in relation both todividends and to penalties for offences under the Bill.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion on the prices and incomes policy and of the Prices and Incomes Bill and pay reviewmachinery at their meeting on 23rd June.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for anearly meeting of the Cabinet for a wide-ranging review on the lines indicated in his summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21 June, 1966
