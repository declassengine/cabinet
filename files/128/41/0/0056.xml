confidential. The Prime Minister said that it would shortly be necessaryfor the Cabinet to resume their discussion of the question whetherMinisters should accept invitations to give evidence to royal commissions; and for this purpose the Minister of Housing andLocal Government would circulate a report of his discussion withthe Chairman of the Royal Commission on English LocalGovernment. Meanwhile, a number of Ministers had receivedinvitations to give evidence to the Commission; these should be heldin suspense until the Cabinet had given further consideration to theissue of principle involved.The Cabinet Agreed that, pending further discussion, Ministers shouldtake no action as regards invitations to give evidence to royal Commissions.secret. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C (66) 155), to which were attached the drafts of a parliamentary statement to be made by the Prime Minister and ofa supplementary answer on the position of the Government inrelation to the European Economic Community (e.c.).In discussion of the draft statement the following points weremade:(a) It was suggested that the term &quot; entry &quot; should not be used at various points in the draft in relation to possible United kingdom membership of the e.c.. It was, however, the general view that anyother term would not be relevant to the issues which must be investigated, and would also give rise to damaging misunderstanding of the Governmenfs position.(b) It was suggested that the draft statement should make itclear that the visits by the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretarywere not only to investigate the terms which we might hope to securein negotiation for entry into the Community, but also, as had beenagreed in the Cabinefs earlier discussion, to urge the member countries of the e.c. to adopt a forthcoming attitude towards the kennedy Round of tariff negotiations. It was, however, the general view that this latter aspect could more appropriately be brought outin reply to a supplementary question.CC 56 (66)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
(c) It was suggested that the statement should refer toconsultations with other Commonwealth Governments &quot; at all stages&quot;. It was, however, argued that this would unduly hamperthe Government in their investigations and in subsequent negotiations and would also be liable to lead to embarrassing leakages ofinformation on the progress of those investigations. The term&quot; throughout&quot; would be preferable. It was also agreed that, if thequestion were raised of the desirability of holding a conference withother Commonwealth Governments in parallel with the proposed conference of Heads of Government of the European Free trade association (EFTA), the Government could reasonably stand on theposition that there was a substantial difference between the two groups, in that a number of our partners in EFTA were likely to wishto join the e.c. themselves, unlike the other members of theCommonwealth. Furthermore, there were frequent CommonwealthMeetings which would afford ample opportunity for discussion ofthese matters on a Commonwealth basis.(d) It was suggested that the draft answer to a supplementaryquestion about the Treaty of Rome should not state that the treaty was not &quot; in itself &quot; an impediment to United Kingdom entry intothe Community. There was general agreement, however, that these words should be retained and that the remainder of the statementadequately covered the reservations which the Government would need to make. It would, however, be preferable to delete the words&quot; the terms of &quot; (the Treaty) since it would no doubt be necessary, ifwe were to accede to the Treaty and perhaps in consequence of anyadaptations which we might negotiate, to amend its precise terms.Several other drafting amendments were also agreed.The Cabinet . Approved the draft statement and draft answer to a supplementary question attached to C(66) 155, subject tothe amendments agreed in discussion.SECRETOverseaAffairsChina(previous reference:CC(66) 51stConclusions,Minute 4)4. The Foreign Secretary said that he had previouslyconsidered whether the United Kingdom should vote in the united nations General Assembly not only for the admission to the united nations of the People&apos;s Republic of China, but also in favour ofregarding this issue as a procedural question (which could be passedby a simple majority) rather than as an important question (onwhich a two-thirds majority was required). He had come to theview that in existing international circumstances it would not on thenext occasion be appropriate for the Government to change the standthey had previously maintained that this was an important question.In the following year, however, we might seek to organise a widermeasure of support, not only for the admission of the People&apos;republic of China, but also for a vote in favour of regarding this as a procedural issue.
CC 56 (66)Soviet Union(previous reference:CC(66) 39thConclusions,Minute 3)The Prime Minister said that there had been a warm response from the Soviet Government to the proposal that the Soviet PrimeMinister, Mr. Kosygin, should visit the United Kingdom thefollowing year. The date would probably be early in February.This was a further indication that the attitude of theSoviet Government on a number of international issues might become more flexible.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister andthe Foreign Secretary.Prices andIncomesPolicyDraft white paper onPeriod ofSevereRestraint(previous reference:CC (66) 49thConclusions)secret. The Cabinet had before them a note by the First Secretaryof State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs (C (66) 151) towhich was attached a draft White Paper on the Governments policy on prices and incomes during the period of severe restraint.The First Secretary of State said that the draft which he had circulated would now need extensive revision in the light of hisfurther consultations with the Confederation of British Industry(CBI) and Trades Union Congress (TUC) and of further considerationby the Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes of the problems which would arise in the public sector. He hoped to circulate a revised draft for consideration by the Cabinet on Tuesday of thefollowing week.The attitude of both the CBI and the TUC as revealed during his consultations was somewhat ambivalent. On the one hand theywere anxious to be consulted about the policy to be followed duringthe period of severe restraint, but on the other they sawdisadvantages in being associated too closely with the promulgationof criteria for regulating prices and incomes. The CBI had said thatthey would be able to ensure observance of the criteria by their members without the intervention of the Government. This couldnot be accepted since they could not be expected to be as firm inrestraining price increases as the Government would wish. On theother hand, it was important not to rebuff them since theGovernment would need the maximum help from them if there wereto be continued restrain on prices and incomes after the first halfof 1967. It would in any event be desirable to have earlyconsultation with the CBI before making any Orders under Part iv of the Prices and Incomes Act, though this would not preclude theGovernment from dealing direct on such issues with the firms concerned. The TUC were divided, some members holding that the tuc&apos;s own vetting machinery should be the principal instrument for ensuring restraint on incomes, while others were reluctant to see
the TUC assume such a responsibility. Nevertheless it might still bepossible to draft the passages in the White Paper relating to vettingin a way acceptable to both the CBI and the TUC as well as to theGovernment.Before the White Paper was published, some ministers concerned with pay in the public sector would need to consult themanagement and staff sides in their respective fields. Wherearrangements had already been made for such consultations, theyshould, if possible, now be postponed until the Cabinet had approved a revised draft. The consultations could be carried out quickly andit should be possible to complete them in time to allow publicationof the White Paper by the end of the following week or shortly after.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that hehad arranged consultations with representatives of local authorities for the following day. The local authorities were fully aware of the consultations that had taken place with other bodies and a postponement of the discussions would damage relations with them.We could rely on those concerned to keep the discussions strictly confidential.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The revisions which would need to be made to the draft white Paper were not so radical as to make it essential to postpone the consultations with the local authorities.(b) Arrangements for the notification of increases of prices should cover charges for services as well as prices of goods,particularly having regard to experience in such cases as theimposition of increased charges by the Road Haulage Associationcontrary to the Governments wishes.(c) After the standstill, a number of applications for increasedfares in passenger transport would, probably be made to the traffic commissioners. If the Commissioners approved any such applications, the question would arise whether their decision shouldbe overruled by the exercise of powers under Part IV of the prices and Incomes Act. Such decisions would need to be considered inaccordance with the criteria for prices and charges during the periodof severe restraint and it might prove necessary to reverse thedecisions by an Order under Part IV.(d) The criteria for prices in paragraph II 5 of the draft wouldmean that some increases would be justified during the period of severe restraint. Too restrictive criteria would, however, adversely affect industrial investment and it was essential that this should be avoided. The criteria envisaged that there might be exceptional circumstances in which, without some increase in price, &quot; the receipts of an enterprise are not adequate to enable it to maintain efficiency and undertake desirable investment&quot;. The CBI had objected tothe word &quot; desirable&quot; in this passage on the ground that theGovernment would not be in a position to judge which investmentwas desirable and which was not. Nevertheless the word should beretained, since otherwise this criterion might prove too wide.
(e) It was suggested that it should be made clear inparagraph II 5 of the draft that increases of prices might be justifiedto enable an enterprise to recoup increases in costs which had arisenduring or before the standstill. The general view was, however, thatthis would be undesirable since it might lead to pressure for acorresponding measure of retrospection in respect of incomes.(/) It was urged that the passage on the rents of local authority housing (paragraph III 2) should not be in such terms as to encouragelocal authorities to hold down rents where this would lead to a consequential increase in rates. The deferment of increases of rentsduring the standstill was creating particular difficulties in Scotland,where in addition to the repercussions on rates there had been a consequential reduction in the amount of Exchequer grant to certainlocal authorities. Nevertheless there would be disadvantages in sodrafting this section as to seem to invite increases in rents and it wasthe general view that the existing draft, which did not rule outincreases, struck the right balance.(g) The form in which the White Paper was presented might befurther considered with a view to bringing out the salient points moreprominently. It was pointed out, however, that the wording of the crucial passages in the White Paper would be primarily determinedby the course of negotiation, and could not subsequently be amendedsolely for presentational reasons. On the other hand the public presentation of the White Paper would be of great importance ingaining acceptance of the policy. A simpler and shorter documentshould therefore be prepared for issue to the Press at the time of publication.(h) The Government should avoid making any commitments atthe present time which would limit their freedom of action in relationto prices and incomes in the period following that of severe restraint.There would also be grave objection at that time to any extension ofthe currency of the compulsory powers in Part IV of the Prices and incomes Act: the activation of Part II of the Act might prove to bethe right course.(/) The White Paper should be published with the minimum of delay since the Departments concerned would need as much time aspossible to formulate guidance in response to requests for its detailedinterpretation before the period of severe restraint began.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussions, said that theFirst Secretary of State should now arrange for the draft to be revised in the light of the discussion and circulated for considerationby the Cabinet on the following Tuesday. Arrangements should alsobe made for the preparation of a simpler explanatory document tobe available for release to the Press at the time of publication.Ministers concerned with pay in the public sector who were proposing to consult management or staff organisations on the content of theWhite Paper should not do so until the draft had been approved bythe Cabinet, except where there were special circumstances rendering
it undesirable to postpone arrangements which had already beenmade, as in the case mentioned by the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment.The Cabinet (1) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for a revised version of the draft White Paper annexed to C (66) 151 tobe circulated for consideration by the Cabinet on15th November.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for thepreparation of a suitable Press release to accompany thepublication of the White Paper.(3) Agreed that the Ministers concerned with pay in the public sector should postpone consultations with management and staff sides until after the draft White Paper had beenapproved by Cabinet, except in cases where postponement would prejudice good relations with the organisations concerned.PublicExpenditureLocalAuthorityCurrentExpenditure(England andWales):1967-68 and1968-69(previous reference:CC (66) 43rdConclusions,Minute 3)secret . The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C (66) 152) and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment (C (66) 154) about current expenditure by localauthorities in England and Wales in 1967-68 and 1968-69.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the current expenditure of local authorities in England and Wales had been growing rapidly over the last few years, and they had now submittedestimates for further substantial increases in 1967-68 and 1968-69.There was general agreement between Departments that it would be reasonable to propose reductions of  127 million in the estimates for1967-68 and  140 million in the estimates for 1968-69 to take accountof over-estimating., Even after these reductions, however, theestimates would still exceed the figures in the public expenditure survey by  52 million in 1967-68 and  74 million in 1968-69. the ministerial Committee on Public Expenditure had come to theconclusion that, at a time when the Government themselves were having to restrict the growth of their expenditure in various desirablefields, it would be reasonable to expect local authorities to accept some restraint on the rate of growth of their expenditure and thedevelopment of their services. The Committee therefore proposedthat, for the purposes of negotiations on the rate support grant, theestimates of expenditure should be further reduced by  30 million in 1967-68 and  45 million in 1968-69. It would be for localauthorities to decide how to restrict their expenditure in consequence,though it would be the basis of the Governmenfs proposals that therestriction should be in respect of miscellaneous environmental services rather than on services such as education and local health.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that therate of growth in local authority expenditure represented partly the
increased cost of services (including higher loan charges) and partlyinevitable and indeed desirable expansion of services. It would bedifficult for local authorities to change the pattern of their expenditure at short notice. They had statutory duties to complywith. The standstill on the rents of council houses had added tothe burden that had to be carried on rates. In these circumstanceslocal authorities might be reluctant to co-operate in the reductionsproposed by the Committee on Public Expenditure; and theGovernment had no power to direct them. They would regard theattitude proposed, particularly in the context of the first year underthe new grant system, as a breach of faith and as going back onpledges that had been given by the Government. While some localauthorities might be able to reduce expenditure, it seemed likely that many of them would not alter their plans; in this case the onlyeffect of what the Committee on Public Expenditure proposed wouldbe to increase the rates. If the Cabinet decided that it was necessaryto seek the further reductions, he would wish to be in a position tosay that it was the view of the Government that in the interests ofthe economy as a whole the expenditure of local authorities shouldnot exceed the total which would result.In discussion the following points were made:(a) A decision on this matter was being sought before theCabinet considered public expenditure in 1967-68 as a whole, becauseof the need to start negotiations with local authorities. It was,however, difficult to take a view on this proposal without knowingwhat further proposals the Committee on Public Expenditure might make for reductions in expenditure in 1967-68 which would affectlocal authorities.(b) Any general statement which the Minister of Housing might make on the lines he had suggested would need to be qualified inorder to take account of the further decisions which the cabinet might take when they came to review the programme of public expenditure and to avoid prejudicing the Governments position insubsequently presenting such decisions to local authorities. Itwould be important in these circumstances to say nothing that mightbe construed as final agreement by the Government to a particularlevel of local authority expenditure.(c) There was probably scope for restricting expenditure oninessential services and on general administration in localgovernment. Many local authorities were already concerned aboutthe rate of growth of their expenditure, and many were anxious toavoid increasing rate poundages in the coming year. They mightnot in practice find too unwelcome a reduction in expenditure forwhich they could blame the Government.(d) If the Cabinet approved the proposals of the ministerial committee on Public Expenditure, it should be on the basis that if in the negotiations officials encountered strong objections, which they considered to be well founded, they should report back in order that ministers might review the matter.
(e) The negotiations on the rate support grant were country-wide, and it was not possible to operate differentially in favour oflocal authorities in development areas where the proposals mightoperate harshly in present circumstances. There might, however, bescope for the Board of Trade to give assistance for particular services required for industrial development in development areas under existing powers or in other ways and the problem of these areas should be considered on a wider basis.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were in general agreement with the proposals made by the ministerial Committee on Public Expenditure, on the understandingthat, if the further reductions proposed met with strenuous and well founded objections, there would be an opportunity for Ministers toconsider the matter further. While it would not be possible to discriminate in favour of development areas in negotiations on therate support grant, the President of the Board of Trade should consider more generally what further measures could be taken tomaintain the level of economic activity in those areas.The Cabinet (1) Approved C (66) 152, subject to the understanding indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to circulate a paper to the Ministerial Steering Committee on economic policy, on further measures which might be taken toavoid an excessive decline in the level of economic activity in development areas during the next fewmonths.ParliamentTelevisingParliamentaryProceedings(previous reference:CC(65) 31stConclusions,Minute 5)confidential . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council and the Lord Privy Seal (C (66) 147) ontelevising Parliamentary proceedings.The Lord President said that the Select Committee on broadcasting of Proceedings in the House of Commons had now recommended that recordings of the proceedings of the House couldbe made available to the broadcasting organisations to be recorded and edited for use in their radio and television programmes. TheSelect Committee had, however, also recommended that, before afinal decision was reached, an experiment on closed circuits, in sound and vision, should be conducted for Members of Parliament only.The House of Lords had already decided in principle that it would welcome the televising of some of its proceedings for an experimental period, and a Select Committee had been set up to consider how this could best be carried into effect. This Committee was likely torecommend to the House of Lords that it should co-operate with the commons in a joint experiment. It would be necessary to arrangeshortly for the subject to be debated in both Houses.
The House of Commons Select Committee had envisaged an experiment lasting two months in the period immediately after christmas, when the broadcasting authorities could most easily makestaff and equipment available. However, any experiment whichexcluded simultaneous televising of the proceedings of the House ofLords would be unrealistic, and consultation with the broadcasting authorities had shown that, while very willing to mount an experiment, they would have difficulty in making available the specialist staff and equipment to cover proceedings in both houses for as long as two months. It was doubtful in any event whether an experiment for as long as this was necessary and, in view of theheavy costs involved, the experiment should last no longer than wasnecessary to enable conclusions to be drawn. He and the lord privy Seal recommended, therefore, that the experiment should belimited to five weeks, during which the two broadcasting authorities would operate alternately. It was essential that, in addition toclosed circuit transmission, the experiment should also includespecimen edited programmes since it would be largely on these thatit would be judged. It was desirable that the experiment should extend to all aspects of the proceedings of the House which wereJikely to be comprised within programmes broadcast underpermanent arrangements, and consequently the experiment should include the televising of proceedings in a Standing Committee andpossibly also of a Select Committee. In addition, during the finalweek of the experiment the House of Lords would be covered. the bbc would also provide specimen edited programmes on radio aswell as television.The Select Committee had recommended that the additional costfalling on the broadcasting authorities as a result of the experimentshould be borne by public funds, and this would necessitatesupplementary estimates for  150,000 and  18,000 respectively forthe House of Commons and the House of Lords votes. the supervision of the experiment in the Commons would be conductedunder the aegis of a new sub-committee of the Select Committee on house of Commons Services. The House of Lords experimentwould be supervised by the Television and AdministrationCommittees acting jointly. ,With the Lord Privy Seal he sought the Cabinefs agreement that proposals for an experiment on these line should be put to bothHouses in the forthcoming debates. It was likely that the opposition would support an experiment although they might be opposed toits extension to Standing Committees or Select Committees.In discussion it was suggested that it would be important thatno indication should be given at the present stage that theGovernment accepted in principle the televising of proceedings ofParliament or favoured any particular form of permanent arrangements. It was clearly impracticable to arrange for theproceedings of Parliament to be broadcast continuously, and it was
suggested that, if the editing of short excerpts was left to the broadcasting authorities themselves, there was a risk both that theywould not be sufficiently responsible and that the editors would besubject to continuous complaint and pressure from individual members. It would be important in any event to ensure that excerptswere used solely in straightforward reporting of parliamentary-proceedings, or at most news programmes, and that they should notbe used in the magazine type of programme. It was also suggestedthat if the broadcast programmes were relatively short there wouldbe criticism of the cost of the arrangements. It was pointed out,however, that whatever views might be held as to the desirability oftelevising Parliament, or might be formed as a result of the experiment, it would be difficult for the Government to oppose an experiment, confined to closed circuit television, in view of therecommendation of the Select Committee, more particularly if, as seemed likely, a majority in both Houses supported it.In further discussion of the proposed experiment it wassuggested that the introduction of the necessary supplementary estimates in the current financial year would provoke the criticism that this expenditure would be particularly inopportune at a timewhen Government spending in the social services field was beingseverely restricted. It was suggested that it might be right to requirethe broadcasting authorities themselves to meet the cost of the experiment in view of the potential benefits to them of permanent arrangements for televising Parliament. On the other hand, it waspointed out that the Select Committee had recommended that parliament should bear the cost of the experiment and that control could best be maintained over it on this basis; and that the broadcasting authorities would be unlikely to agree to proceed withthe experiment if they had to pay for it. Deferment of the experiment might, however, be taken as indicating that theGovernment were in fact opposed to it.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) If the experiment were deferred it was unlikely that it couldbe mounted before January 1968 since it was only in the periodfollowing the Christmas Recess that the broadcasting authorities could make available the specialist staff and equipment.(b) It would be desirable to exclude the Press from the experimental transmissions. There would, however, be strong pressure from the Press to view them and it might be necessary toarrange for one open day.(c) If the Commons debate preceded the report of the House ofLords Select Committee, care would have to be taken not to anticipate the conclusions of the latter.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that,without commitment to any permanent arrangements for televisingthe proceedings of Parliament, the Cabinet on balance agreed thatthe Government spokesmen in the forthcoming debates should indicate that the Government would be prepared to provide the
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,10th November, 1966.facilities for an experiment on the lines proposed by the lord president and the Lord Privy Seal. The issue should be left to a free vote but it should be made clear that, in view of the restrictions imposed on public expenditure generally, the Government would think it right that any experiment should be deferred, if necessaryuntil the early part of 1968.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President and the Lord Privy Seal toarrange for the debates in both Houses on televisingproceedings of Parliament to be conducted on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up of their discussion.
