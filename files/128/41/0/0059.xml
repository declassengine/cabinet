Prices andIncomesPolicyWhite paper on prices and IncomesCriteria duringthe Periodof severe restraint(previous reference:CC(66) 58thConclusions,Minute 1)CC 59 (66)confidential. The First Secretary of State said that he had been shownin confidence a copy of the statement which the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) were proposing to issue after the publication of theWhite Paper on Prices and Incomes Criteria during the Period of severe Restraint. While the statement would record that the TUCwould have due regard to the criteria, it would make it clear thatthey did not regard themselves as bound by them, and as nowdrafted it was sharply critical of certain sections of the White Paper.In particular, the TUC regarded the Governmenfs position ondividends as disingenuous, they considered the sections on prices to be to mild in relation to the section on wages, and they feared that the effect of what was said about productivity agreements would serve to discourage such agreements (though there were known tobe several waiting to go forward). The TUC also thought that thepublic services were being treated unfairly. The criticisms werestronger than the discussions with the representatives of the TUChad led him to expect, but it was clear that, even if criticisms onthese lines had been voiced earlier, it would have been impossiblefor the Government completely to meet them. He would be meetingthe General-Secretary of the TUC later in the day, and would endeavour to persuade him to modify the statement, pointing outthe possible dangers inherent in an overt division of opinion betweenthe Government and the TUC on prices and incomes policy. Itwas unlikely, however, that the general line of the tuc&apos;s note couldbe altered. In general, there were signs that the TUC line on prices and incomes policy was beginning increasingly to diverge from thatof the Government.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the First Secretary of state on the reaction of the Trades Union Congress to the white paper on Prices and Incomes Criteria in the Period of severe Restraint.PublicExpenditure1967-68(previous reference:CC(66) 58thConclusions,Minute 4)AdministrativeandMiscellaneousServicesSECRET2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C (66) 158) covering a reportby the Committee on Public Expenditure, a note by the Secretaryof the Cabinet (C (66) 169) covering a report on space technologyby the Official Committee on Science and Technology, and amemorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretary of Statefor Economic Affairs (C (66) 170) on finance for container ships.The Home Secretary said that he was prepared to accept areduction of  2 million (as opposed to the  2 - 9 million allowed forin the proposals by the Committee on Public Expenditure) in hisshare of expenditure on administrative and miscellaneous services in1967-68. In so far as this affected the fire services it might need to be taken into account in negotiations with local authorites onthe rate support grant.
The Cabinet- -(1) Agreed that provision for administrative and miscellaneousexpenditure in 1967-68 should be reduced by  4- 7 million.Police and The Home Secretary said that in the light of previous discussionPrisons and further consideration he was reluctantly prepared to accept the reductions proposed by the Committee on Public Expenditure in expenditure on police and prisons in 1967-68.The Cabinet (2) Approved the proposals of the Committee on public expenditure that expenditure on police and prisons in1967-68 should be reduced by  1 million.Aviation and The Minister of Aviation said that the BLACK ARROWSpace programme on space technology had already been reduced from 43-7 million to  26-5 million over eight years. The extramuralexpenditure in 1967-68 would be  2-1 million. If the project were cancelled, cancellation charges of  0-4 million would be incurred in1967-68, reducing the net saving to  T7 million. The black arrow programme could not be regarded as an alternative to our contribution to the European Launcher Development Organisation(ELDO) and the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO).It was necessary to maintain a national space programme both to sustain our technological contributions to ELDO and ESRO and toreap their benefits and to retain a national capability in these fields.It would be inappropriate to cancel the BLACK ARROW programme at a time when we were making proposals for a Europeantechnological community. For the sake of keeping the black arrow programme in being he would be prepared to investigate the possibility of making further cuts of  1 million in the aeronautical research programme, though expenditure on his Vote for that programme in 1967-68 had already been reduced by  700,000.In discussion it was suggested that we were unlikely to deriveany economic, military or political benefit from the BLACK arrow programme and that by cancelling it we should not be opting outof space technology: our five-year programme of work in the spacefield amounted to  90 million, of which BLACK ARROW onlyaccounted for some  16 million. Nor was the programme justified by its indirect technological benefits: greater benefits in the industrial field generally would accrue from the expenditure of a similar amountof money on programmes directly related to particular industries.Such resources as we could make available for development projectscould most advantageously be concentrated on projects with a lowratio of expenditure on research and development to production costs: in other words, on smaller projects with large sales prospects.On the other hand it was argued that the level of expenditurenow proposed for the BLACK ARROW programme was a smallprice to pay for the maintenance of a national space capability(especially as this concerned the field of communications, where wehad hitherto held a commanding lead) and that this was indeed a
necessary complement to our international collaboration. In the context of our relationship with Europe, there would be politicalbenefits to be gained from continuing with the programme. to argue that it was never right to proceed with a research anddevelopment project unless direct economic benefits could be foreseenwould be to take too narrow a view and to limit the scope fortechnological progress. If the programme were continued, we should however seek to obtain a contribution to its cost by the industrialfirms concerned. In any event, if such programmes were to beundertaken at all, they should be carried out resolutely and with all appropriate urgency.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that the BLACK ARROW programme shouldnot be cancelled without some further evaluation of its priority inrelation to other research and development expenditure of atechnological nature. Now that the Ministry of Aviation&apos;s remainingfunctions were to be taken over by the Minister of Technology, theMinister of Technology would be in a position to evaluate this programme in relation to other research and development programmes, both within and outside the defence field. The black arrow programme should continue for a further year. If at theend of the year the Minister of Technology, after undertaking suchan evaluation, considered that the BLACK ARROW programme should have priority over other programmes and was prepared tomake savings elsewhere in order to make this possible, the black arrow programme could go ahead; if on the other hand he decided that other programmes were more important, then black arrow could be brought to an end. In the meantime the Ministerof Aviation should examine as a matter of urgency the possibilityof making further savings in expenditure on aeronautical research in 1967-68, with a view to achieving further reductions of  1 million in his own Vote and Defence Votes taken together.The Cabinet-(3) Agreed that the BLACK ARROW programme shouldcontinue through 1967-68, and approved expenditure of 2-1 million in 1967-68 accordingly.(4) Invited the Minister of Technology, in consultation as appropriate with the Secretary of State for Defence, toarrange for an evaluation of the BLACK arrow programme and its priority in relation to other research and development projects, on the lines indicated by thePrime Minister.(5) Invited the Minister of Aviation, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of Statefor Defence, to consider means of reducing expenditureon aeronautical research in 1967-68 by  1 million in total(on Ministry of Aviation and Defence Votes together).
Finance for The First Secretary of State said that the Ministerial CommitteeContainer Ships on Economjc Development had agreed that provision should beincluded in the Bill to set up the Shipbuilding Industry Board foran additional credit of  30 million to be made available to shippingfirms placing orders for United Kingdom ships, where the orderswould enable an important development of ship design or constructionto be undertaken in United Kingdom yards and would contribute to the formation of groups in shipbuilding which would be to the longer term advantage of the industry. The immediate purpose ofthis provision would be to enable United Kingdom shipbuilders to compete on level credit terms with Japanese shipbuilders for ordersshortly to be placed by a United Kingdom consortium for containerships to the value of  27 million. Expenditure on this accountrepayable over the loan period might amount to  10 million in1967-68. The total cost to the, Exchequer of grants to bridge the gap between the Exchequer lending rate and the lower interest ratesavailable from oversea competitors would amount to a maximum of about  \ million spread over the period of the loans. The Ministryof Technology would consider whether any compensating saving forthe grant could be secured elsewhere in their estimates.The Cabinet (6) Took note, with approval, of the decision of the ministerial committee on Economic Development that provision should be included in the Bill to set up a shipbuilding industry Board on the lines indicated by the First Secretaryof State.Defence The Lord Chancellor said that, at a time when the Governmentwere severely restricting the growth of social expenditure, the levelof Government expenditure on defence was still too high. In the longer term significant savings could be achieved only by not placingnew orders for major weapons and equipment. It was forconsideration whether the Government should now announce that,in view of the economic situation, they had decided not for thetime being to place the order for a sixth attack submarine (which was due to be placed early in 1967).The Secretary of State for Defence said that it was important for the maintenance of the labour force in shipyards and for economy in construction costs to keep an even flow of orders to shipbuilders.These objectives would be frustrated if the order for a sixth attacksubmarine were to be deferred. The shipbuilding programme hadbeen extensively considered in the Defence Review, and the needfor this submarine (which had no connection with the Polarisprogramme) had been fully established and was not now in question.He hoped to be able to achieve the reduction of  50 million in defence expenditure in 1967-68 for which the Chancellor of the exchequer had asked, and in the longer term further reductions in defence expenditure might be achieved as a result of further studies whichwere now in progress. It would be wrong to take piecemeal decisions on particular orders.
commercial policy(previous reference:CC(66) 51stConclusions,Minute 6)Sale of BAC-11Aircraft to indian AirlinesCorporationSECRET3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C (66) 165) about export credit for the saleof BAC-111 aircraft to the Indian Airlines Corporation (IAC).The President of the Board of Trade said it was necessary to resolve a difference of view which had arisen in the Sub-Committeeion External Economic Policy of the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Development on a proposal that the present limit of  20million on officially insured business with India on credit terms inexcess of five years should be waived in order to make possible thesale of BAC-111 aircraft to the I AC. The I AC would shortly need to replace its fleet of Viscounts and the first choice for a replacementwould probably be the BAC-111, in which case the order wouldbe worth  9-5 million. The Indians had made it clear that theywould require credit spread over ten years. The  20 million limitwas however already fully subscribed and he had therefore proposedthat the limit should be lifted to make the sale possible. Thisproposal had been supported by a majority of the Sub-committee but the Treasury Ministers had been unable to accept it. Thedifficulty was whether, given the present and prospective state ofthe Indian economy, there was sufficient likelihood of repaymentto justify extending credit cover for a sale of this kind. It was clearthat, if the sale of BAC-llls were prevented, the Indians would meet their needs by buying from one of our competitors. Those ministers who favoured extension of the limit argued that, even on the mostpessimistic assumption about the prospects of repayment, downpayments would exceed the import content of the aircraft and therewould therefore be a net benefit to the balance of payments. Furtherbenefits would follow from the sale of spares which would be paid for in cash and from the boost to the sales prospects of the BAC-111in other markets. The Indians had always been punctilious in settling commercial debts and there was no reason to suppose thatAfter discussion, in which stress was laid upon the importanceof putting to good use resources released by reductions in the defence programme, The Prime Minister, summing up, said that defence expenditure had to be considered as a whole. To take a decisionon a particular project as a public gesture might seriously interferewith sensible defence planning. The results of the further studiesto which the Secretary of State for Defence had referred would indue course be brought before Ministers, who would then have to balance the economic advantages of further reductions in defence expenditure against the potential defence risks and political consequences which such reductions would entail.The Cabinet (7) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion on defence.
they would change this policy. While they were expected to askfor the refinancing of their intergovernmental debt, there was noreason why the British share of refinancing should be higher if the indians bought British aircraft rather than foreign. There weresevere obstacles to the sale of British aircraft in many overseas markets; if the sale were allowed to go by default, this would greatlydamage morale in the industry. Nor could it be assumed that, ifthe order were lost, the manufacturing resources involved would be devoted to exports elsewhere. The  20 million limit should thereforebe waived to permit this particular sale.In discussion it was pointed out that the Advisory Council ofthe Export Credits Guarantee Departments (ECGD) had not beenprepared to accept this credit for insurance on normal commercialterms; any decision to provide cover for it would therefore haveto be taken by the Government in the national interest. In the lightof the grave position of the Indian economy, with imports greatly in excess of exports and with a very large deficit financed by aid,it could well be, if the proposed sale went through, that the resultingdebt would have to be refinanced and that we with other creditorswould be expected to bear our due share of the burden. To raisethe present limit on credit cover would, on this view, mean providingspecial assistance to the aircraft industry, which was not recommendedby the Plowden Report. The sale should therefore only be allowedto go through if the transaction were regarded as aid and thenecessary finance were provided as part of the aid programme.On the other hand it was pointed out that India&apos;scredit-worthiness had recently been improved since the $900 million of non-project aid which the World Bank thought was necessaryto meet her needs would now be available. To prevent the salewould have a serious effect on our relations with India, and wouldbe particularly unfortunate in view of the impending Indian generalelection there. The Indians would certainly buy aircraft elsewhereand if any part of the debt had in the event to be refinanced, weshould still be under pressure to use our aid programme for thatpurpose. While in that event the financial burden upon us wouldbe no less than if the aircraft were British our aid would then be devoted to refinancing debts arising from purchases from our competitors. It was not the case that the Advisory Council of theECGD had taken the view that the transaction was commerciallyunsound:, it was in fact precluded from considering cover on terms in excess of five years, and the present sale fell into that category.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet took the view that the Government would bejustified in waiving the  20 million limit to meet this case.The Cabinet-Agreed that the  20 million limit on officially insuredbusiness with India on credit terms in excess of five years should be raised to accommodate the sale of BAC-111aircraft to the Indian Airlines Corporation.
commercial policy(previous reference:CC(66) 51stConclusions,Minute 6)ECGD cover for ArgentinaSECRET4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C (66) 164) about credit cover for exportsto Argentina.The President of the Board of Trade said that the Sub-Committeeof the Ministerial Committee on Economic Development had been unable to reach agreement on his proposal that the percentage riskon capital goods exports to Argentina which was covered by theExport Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) under Section 2 ofthe Export Guarantee Act 1949 should be raised from the present figure of 75 per cent to 90 per cent. The limit was fixed in March1965 when it was also decided that cover under Section 2 shouldbe subject to a limit of  6 million on debts maturing in any oneyear. Since the limit of 75 per cent had been imposed, there hadbeen virtually no business covered under Section 2 and there wasno doubt that the main reason for this was that exporters were notprepared to take on this type of business unless the percentage ofrisk officially insured was brought up to the normal level of 90 percent.A majority of the Sub-Committee had supported the proposal.Cover up to the normal 90 per cent was available for exports toother Latin American countries, whose credit-worthiness was not significantly different from that of Argentina. It had not been necessary to refinance more than 10 per cent of the Argentinebusiness to the value of  143 million covered by the ECGD between1955 and 1965, and the benefits to our balance of payments over this period had thus been considerable. It could not be assumed that,if we did not sell our capital goods to Argentina, we should be ableto export them to more credit-worthy markets. A substantial order for aircraft was at stake, as Handley Page were at present negotiatinga contract for the supply of aircraft worth  8-9 million to theArgentine armed services. Argentina offered a promising market for aircraft exports but this could not be exploited if the industry were required to carry an excessive percentage of risk.In the Sub-Committee&apos;s discussion, the Chief Secretary, Treasury,had suggested a compromise whereby the percentage limit would be lifted to 90 per cent but the limit on annual maturities would bereduced from  6 million to  3 million. This proposal had not however commended itself to the majority of the Sub-Committee.A decision to allow cover up to an annual limit of  6 million hadbeen taken in 1965 but had been rendered valueless by the 75 percent limit on percentage cover. It was illogical now to reduce thefirst limit because the second was being increased.In discussion it was suggested that our past experience of theneed to refinance a proportion of Argentine debts was likely to be repeated in the future. The policies of the present argentine government were not reassuring. It was notable that West germany was now reducing the percentage of credit cover on exports to
10 SECRET-. - iArgentina from 80 per cent to 75 per cent. While only 10 per cent of Argentine business covered by ECGD had had to be refinancedover the period of 1955-65, some  40 million of the debt incurredduring that period was still outstanding at the end of 1965. Animportant factor limiting exports to Argentina was the impositionof restrictions by the Argentinians themselves. If we were to extendmore liberal credit terms, there was a strong possibility that our aid programme would suffer in consequence of the need to refinancepart of the debts, to the detriment of exports under tied aid to othermarkets.It was argued on the other hand that the export ofcapital goods to Argentina was of considerable importance to someof our major industries and it was justifiable to incur some degreeof risk in order to secure a reasonable share of this trade. Therewere good prospects of sales to Argentina of further aircraft andof naval vessels which would be frustrated if the present limit onpercentage cover were maintained. Whilst it was right to controlexport credit for Argentina by means of limits on the amount ofcover granted, the present limit of 75 per cent cover had provedtoo stringent; and might with advantage be extended to 90 per centcover, with an upper limit of  4^ million, instead of the present  million, on annual maturities.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet agreed that, while an increase in the percentagecover from 75 per cent to 90 per cent would be justified, it wouldbe desirable to circumscribe the risks involved by some reduction ofthe present limit of  6 million on annual maturities. A limit of 4J million should be sufficient to accommodate the major part ofbusiness now in prospect.IThe Cabinet (1) Agreed that the percentage risk on exports to Argentinacovered by the Export Credits Guarantee department under Section 2 of the Export Guarantee Act 1949 shouldbe raised to 90 per cent.(2) Agreed that the limit on annual maturities of debts covered in accordance with Conclusion (1) should be  4-^ million.&apos; RoyalCommissionsEvidence by ministers tothe RoyalCommission onEnglish LocalGovernment(previous reference:CC(66) 56thConclusions,Minute 2)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of housing and Local Government (C (66) 162) about invitations whichthe Royal Commission on English Local Government had issued to various Ministers to give evidence to them, informally and withoutpublication.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that theChairman of the Royal Commission had told him that they had greatly valued the informal discussions which they had already had with certain Ministers, which they regarded as complementingdepartmental evidence; but he would nevertheless fully understand
if Ministers, individually or collectively, considered that no further consultation of such kind should take place. As the Cabinet had agreed at their previous discussion he had explained to the Chairmanthe objections to such consultations but he hoped to continue hisown personal contacts with the Chairman.He had also considered the evidence which his Ministry were proposing to give to the Royal Commission and had given instructions that it should be couched in such a form as not to prejudge whateverdecisions the Government might eventually wish to reach on theCommission^ recommendations. This evidence was being concertedwith the other Ministries primarily concerned and would then come before the Home Affairs Committee.In discussion it was argued that there was objection in principle to Ministers giving evidence to Royal Commissions, howeverinformally, on the ground that this would inhibit the Governmenfsfreedom of action in taking decisions in the light of the Commission^eventual report. It was suggested that similar considerations appliedto evidence by officials which might appear to indicate a governmentalconclusion on the issues before the Commission. There was,however, general agreement that it was essential that the machineryof government should provide for Royal Commissions all the relevant facts and considerations in order to enable them to carry out their task. Much would inevitably depend on the issues in question:for example, a Royal Commission concerned with the law ondivorce would have less need for departmental evidence than woulda Royal Commission on Local Government. It would, however, be important that evidence by Ministries should be so framed as notto imply that the Government as such were pressing a particular course of action upon the Royal Commission, nor should it be insuch terms as to embarrass the Government politically, or to inhibittheir subsequent freedom of action in the light of the Commission^report.In further discussion it was the general view that different considerations applied to evidence given by Ministries and evidenceby Ministers. There were three possible stages in evidence byMinistries; the provision of the facts; the administrative and technical consideration arising from those facts which were relevant to eachMinistry&apos;s own task; and the conclusions which might be drawn from the first two stages as to the solution of the problem. Thefacts must be made available as fully and freely as the commission might require and each Ministry should also put forward in evidencean analysis of the various administrative and technical considerationsrelevant to their own task. It would be acceptable, and indeeddesirable, that this analysis might, if the facts so warranted, give a clear lead as to the requirements of an individual Ministry in thefield in question. It would not, however, be appropriate that theevidence should specifically propose a solution to the problem,whether in respect of a particular Ministry or, a fortiori, in respectof the Government as a whole: nor should there be any submission
of evidence agreed between Ministries which put forward a solution on behalf of Whitehall as a whole. In submitting evidence of this nature, it would be appropriate that the evidence should first besubmitted by each Ministry to their Minister to ensure that he wasnot opposed to it in principle, and that no part of it would be politically embarrassing, but it would be neither necessary nordesirable that the Minister should be called upon to approve theevidence as such.As regards Ministers themselves, it was the general view thaton balance it would be wrong that Ministers should decline to make their knowledge and experience available to a Royal Commissionif the Commission so desired. Much would no doubt turn in practice on the views of the Chairman on the course which should be followed in this regard. It would be preferable that Ministers should give evidence after the submission of evidence by their Ministries and essential that their own evidence should be informal and not onthe record. It was, however, recognised that there was a special difficulty in respect of Scottish Commissions, since whereas in respectof England each Ministry and Minister might appropriately give evidence on the considerations relevant to their particular taskwithout involving a collective governmental view on the solution, inScotland one Minister was responsible for the whole range of issues and his evidence might therefore be viewed as constituting a greaterdegree of governmental commitment. There was, furthermore, aparticular difficulty in respect of the Royal Commission on scottish local Government, in that two members of the Commission were members of Parliament and there would be therefore a greater riskof political embarrassment if the Secretary of State for scotland were to give evidence, however informally.The Cabinet-CD Agreed that individual Ministries should give evidence to royal Commissions on the facts and on the full range of administrative and technical considerations relevant to each Ministry&apos;s task, but that this evidence shouldnot indicate any general governmental view on thesolutions which should be devised to the problems beforethe Royal Commission.(2) Agreed that, save where special considerations arose on thelines indicated in discussion, Ministers should feel free to accept invitations from the Chairman of royal commissions to give evidence provided that this were done informally and not on the record and that it didnot purport to put forward a collective governmentalview on the conclusions which should emerge.Cabinet Office, S.W.J,22 nd November, 1966.
