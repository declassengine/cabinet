secret parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord President said that if further difficulties arose incompleting the remaining stages of the Prices and Incomes Bill itmight be necessary to defer the Second Reading of the industrial reorganisation Corporation Bill until after the Summer Recess.OverseaAffairsIndonesia(previous reference:CC (66) 40thConclusions,Minute 1)China(previous reference:CC (66) 24thConclusions,Minute 2)Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (66) 34thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that there had been a number ofrecent developments in Indonesia, some of which were contrary toour interests, but on balance the general trend of events appeared tobe favourable to us. There had been a further incident in Sarawakin which a Gurkha soldier had been wounded and it appeared thatIndonesian soldiers had been involved. We had agreed with theMalaysian Government how publicity for this incident should be handled and it was hoped that it would not result in any delay inthe ratification of the Bangkok Agreement on the ending of confrontation. We were also discussing with the MalaysianGovernment how thereafter they should take over full militaryresponsibility in the Borneo territories on the withdrawal of UnitedKingdom forces. President Sukarno had made a violent speechreaffirming confrontation on the swearing in of the new Cabinet on28th July, but in the upshot this had redounded to our advantage inthat it had led to sharp reactions in the Indonesian Press. It wasalso noteworthy that General Suharto, rather than President Sukarno,had taken the chair when the Cabinet subsequently met. TheForeign Minister, Mr. Malik, was still confident that the BangkokAgreement would be ratified.Four of the leading members of the Government of the People&apos;republic of China had recently been removed from office, whilePresident Mao Tse-tung, who had been ill for some time, appearednow to have fully recovered his health, and retained his dominantposition. These changes were part of a cultural revolution whichhad started the previous September. It did not appear that thiswould involve any change in China&apos;s external policy and the stresswhich was laid on the part to be played by the army in industry and agriculture suggested that there was no intention of their undertaking a military commitment in Vietnam.The Prime Minister said that the Ministers primarily concernedwith Rhodesia had met the previous day to consider the handling ofthe next stage of events, with particular reference to the Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers in September. Developments ofany importance would, when worked out in detail, be brought beforethe Cabinet. Meanwhile, he proposed to make a statement in theHouse of Commons the following Monday on the resumption of talks between United Kingdom and Rhodesian officials in Salisbury. his statement would make it clear that the next round of talks would be devoted primarily to discussion of the fifth of the six principles which
the Government had laid down for a settlement of the dispute (the fifth principle related to the acceptability of any new constitution to the people of Rhodesia as a whole) and to the return to constitutional rule as a precursor to any formal negotiations. Hewould also state that no irrevocable step would be taken by theGovernment in respect of the Rhodesian situation except in circumstances when this could be considered by Parliament: ifnecessary Parliament would be recalled during the Recess to enablethis to be done. The Zambian Government would be informed ofthis statement and the timing of the talks would be related to the resumption of negotiations with the Zambian Government on furtherUnited Kingdom aid.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.secret. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the economicsituation.The Cabinets discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately in the bound volume of Most Confidential Recordsheld by the Secretary of the Cabinet.CONFIDENTIALShipbuilding 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the President ofIndustry        the Board of Xrade (c (66) 126) on the reorganisation of the geddes shipbuilding industry.Report onReorganisation The President of the Board of Trade said that the Report of the shipbuilding Inquiry Committee under the chairmanship ofMr. R. Geddes, which was published in March, had recommended radical reorganisation of the shipbuilding industry and theabandonment of restrictive practices, with the creation of anindependent Shipbuilding Industry Board with powers to make loans and grants out of public funds up to a total of  374- million over five years in order to facilitate the concentration of the existing27 major yards into four or five large groups. An essential part ofthe Geddes Committee&apos;s proposals had been a timetable for theirimplementation, giving the two sides of industry three months towork out their considered reactions and providing for government decisions shortly thereafter.The Ministerial Committee on Productivity had broadly agreedthat the Government should accept the recommendations of the geddes Report, and a place had been kept in the current year&apos;slegislative programme for the necessary legislation. Some membersof the Committee had, however, taken the view that an announcementat the present time might be interpreted as being inconsistent withthe Governments recent economic measures and could therefore be damaging to confidence in sterling. On the other hand, if anannouncement of the Governments decision were delayed, the senseEconomicSituation(previous reference:CC (66) 41stConclusions,Minute 2)
CONFIDENTIAL5of urgency in the industry would be lost, the fresh start in industrial relations which the industry had been trying to make would falter,and confidence in the industry&apos;s future would be sapped. there organisation of the shipbuilding industry could make a valuable contribution to economic recovery, and a Government announcement in this sense should not be damaging to confidence. The expenditure involved over the next one and a half to two years would be small,and there was no need at this stage for the Government to commit themselves to any particular figure of expenditure during this period.He therefore sought authority to announce before the summer recess that the Government had decided to set up the proposedShipbuilding Industry Board and to provide the finance proposed bythe Geddes Committee over a period of five years; that the necessary legislation would be introduced in the current session; that theGovernment would be putting into effect the concession on indirect taxation for which legislative powers had already been taken; andthat the Government would be prepared to use naval procurementorders for the purpose of facilitating and encouraging reorganisation.In discussion it was pointed out that a decision to go ahead withthe Geddes proposals involved a judgment on priorities in public expenditure before the latter could be considered as a whole. none the less there was general agreement that Government decisions,broadly in the sense described by the President of the Board of Trade,should be announced before the Summer Recess, with an emphasis on their relevance to economic recovery. The announcement shouldstress the measures which were being taken on both sides of industryto follow up the Geddes Report, and in particular the agreement ondemarcation recently concluded by the unions which should be valuable in avoiding strikes on this score in future. It should alsostress that governmental assistance would be devoted to industrialgroups which would be fully viable.There was also general agreement that, while the Governmentshould be prepared to use their procurement powers in pursuit ofwider objectives, the implications of doing so in this case neededfurther consideration. There was a danger that the concentration ofnaval orders on three particular yards would deprive other yards(including F airfields) of business which was the foundation of valuableexport orders; nor could it be accepted without further consideration that a policy which ex hypothesi involved not accepting the lowesttender was necessarily conducive to industrial efficiency, quite apartfrom its implications for governmental expenditure. There wasfurthermore a danger that a statement on the use of Governmentprocurement orders made in too positive or minatory a form couldprejudice the readiness of the industry to co-operate in the changesrequired to reorganise and rationalise the industry. While thePresident^ statement should retain a reference to the possibility ofthe Government using their procurement powers, the form of wordsso far agreed went too far, and a new form of words should be agreedwhich would constitute a less positive commitment and would avoid the dangers that would arise from the statement hitherto envisaged.
6CONFIDENTIALThe Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that the President of the Board of trade should announce governmental decisions on the reorganisation ofthe shipbuilding industry on the lines of the proposals in the GeddesReport. The form of words to be adopted on the use of procurementpowers should be agreed between the Ministers concerned. Theannouncement should be made in a statement in the House ofCommons before the Summer Recess; its precise timing would be amatter for discussion with the Lord President of the Council.The Cabinet invited the President of the Board of Trade (1) To announce before the Summer Recess the government&apos;s decision broadly to accept the proposals in the GeddesReport, to set up a Shipbuilding Industry Board, toprovide finance on the lines proposed in the GeddesReport for assistance to the industry over a period ofyears, to introduce the necessary legislation in the current session, and to put into effect the concession on indirect taxation for which powers had been taken in this yeafsFinance Bill.(2) To agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretaryof State for Defence and the Minister of Technology a form of words to be adopted on the possibility of the useof Governmenfs procurement powers for the purpose of promoting rationalisation, taking account of the points made in discussion.(3) To agree the timing of his statement with the Lord Presidentof the Council.CONFIDENTIALPenal Reform(previous reference:CC (65) 67thConclusions,Minute 3)criminla justice Bill5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C (66) 124) on proposals for a Criminal Justice Bill.The Home Secretary said that a place was reserved for a criminal Justice Bill in the legislative programme for the current session and there would be advantage in introducing a majorreforming measure which made no demands on the country&apos;resources. The Cabinet had already approved his predecessor^proposals for the release of prisoners on licence, subject to conditions,after serving a third of their sentence, and for the substitution forthe preventive detention of persistent offenders of longer sentences of imprisonment. He now proposed measures to reduce the numberof short sentences, which tended to blunt the deterrent effect of imprisonment by acclimatising offenders to it. It was proposed:(a) to require the courts to suspend sentences of six months orless for offences other than violence or sexual assaultwhere the offender had not previously had a custodialsentence, and to permit them to suspend sentences of upto two years. The requirement to suspend short sentenceswould not be welcome to all sentencing authorities, butobjection should be reduced by the exception for the offences of personal violence;
&apos; 7 260CC 42 (66)(b) to take power to provide by order, as soon as adequateinstitutions for treating drunkenness were available, thatthe offence of being drunk and disorderly should nolonger be punishable with imprisonment;(c) to enable the courts to attach earnings for the satisfaction offines and to restrict their powers to commit defaulters to prison. Further consideration was being given to theseproposals in the light of the possibility that offendersunder the Prices and Incomes Bill who had the means topay in court but refused to do so might be committed to prison;(d) to restrict the power of the courts to remand in custodypersons accused of minor offences.An essential part of the proposals, which might be criticised insome quarters as being lenient to offenders, would be the introductionof majority verdicts of 10 to 2 in criminal cases. There was reasonto think that persons responsible for the organisation of majorcriminal conspiracies were securing acquittal by the subornation ofjurors. The judges were unanimously in favour of the majorityverdict, which was likely to be acceptable to public opinion also. Asa safeguard against unconsidered verdicts, it was proposed to provide that a majority verdict should not be returned after less than two hours&apos; discussion, and the system would be further strengthened byimplementing the recommendation of the Committee on JuryService (the Morris Committee) that persons convicted of seriouscrime should be disqualified from jury service; those who had been sentenced to five years&apos; imprisonment or more would be disqualifiedfor life.The Bill would give effect to the recommendations of theCommittee on Legal Aid in Criminal Proceedings (the WidgeryCommittee) that the availability of legal advice in criminal cases should be extended and that persons given legal aid should berequired to make a contribution appropriate to their means. other recommendations of the Committee could be implemented by thecourts awarding legal aid more freely within their present powers, andit was proposed to emphasise to them the importance of viewing theCommittee&apos;s recommendations as part of a single scheme so that additional expenditure did not arise before the arrangements forsecuring contributions came into effect.The Government were already committed to legislation to permit a limited use of written evidence in committal proceedings and to restrict the reporting of those proceedings. There was now, however,considerable support for more far-reaching changes, and it was proposed that committal proceedings should be held only if the prosecution or defence wanted witnesses&apos; evidence to be given at that stage orally, other evidence taking the form of written statements.In this context it seemed right that, if the defence wished theproceedings to be reported, the restrictions on publication should notapply. It was also proposed that accused persons should be requiredto give notice before trial of a defence of alibi, to prevent the
8CONFIDENTIALprosecution being deprived of the opportunity to investigate theevidence, and to make minor amendments in court procedure whichwould prevent persons charged with trivial offences being arrestedif they failed to appear in court. The Prison Act, 1952, would be amended to abolish corporal punishment for disciplinary offences in prison; maximum fines now out of date because of changes in thevalue of money would be increased; and provision would be madeto extend a magistrates&apos; courfs powers to order the taking offingerprints and apply them to palmprints. Other minor andtechnical amendments would be made in the law on probation andafter-care, and on the administration of criminal justice.In discussion the following principal points were made:(a) While suspended sentences were an advance on the merelynegative recourse to short terms of imprisonment, they were not in themselves a constructive form of treatment and might be criticised on the ground that the offenders concerned were not to be made subject to supervision. It would be important to continue to buildup the constructive forces within the penal system.(b) The Trades Union Congress had abandoned their previousopposition to the attachment of earnings other than as a means of collecting maintenance. In their evidence to the Committee on civil Debt they had advocated attachment as a means of collectingdebts, and they had specifically confirmed that they were preparedto see this method used for the enforcement of fines.(c) If juries were enabled to return majority verdicts there mightbe a risk that, particularly in motoring cases or those involvingoffences with a political element, a majority of the jury would be prejudiced, and that only the insistence of a conscientious minoritywould ensure a just verdict. There was some safeguard against this in the proposal of the Morris Committee that the basis of jury service should be broadened by replacing the property qualification by aqualification based on the electoral register (which, since it appliedto civil as well as to criminal juries, would be implemented in separate legislation), and in the provisions of the Road Safety Bill for offencesinvolving alcohol to be proved by the use of scientific tests.(d) The mounting cost of the legal aid scheme gave cause for anxiety, and it was desirable that the Ministers concerned should examine the way in which the scheme was now developing.(e) The proposal to abolish corporal punishment in prisonswould be opposed by the Prison Officers&apos; Association and was likelyto be controversial. Corporal punishment was, however, anantiquated method of punishment which many countries no longerfound necessary in their prisons, and prison governors were in favourof its abolition.(/) The proposed Bill would not apply to Scotland, though there might be pressure for similar arrangements to be adopted there. Theproposals would not, however, be entirely acceptable in Scotland,in particular the compulsory suspension of short sentences of imprisonment and the restriction of the powers of the courts to commit for non-payment of fines and to remand in custody.
BroadcastingandTelevisionBroadcastingPolicy:Draft white paper(previous reference:CC(66) 16thConclusions,Minute 6)secret . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (C (66) 125) to which was attached a draft white Paper on broadcasting policy.The Lord President recalled that on taking office in 1964 theGovernment had been met with a request from the british broadcasting Corporation (BBC) to increase the licence fee from 4 to  6 in order to finance their expenditure until 1970. TheGovernment had subsequently agreed to an interim increase of  1,pending the outcome of their review of broadcasting policy.Following discussion of the proposals which the Ministerial Committeeon Broadcasting put forward in February 1966, the Cabinet had decided that Exchequer subvention should be rejected as a means of financing the BBC, and that the licence should remain the sole source of finance, in view of the strong objection offered by the corporation to advertising. The Prime Minister had seen the Vice-Chairman ofthe Board of Governors of the BBC and Director-General and made it clear that the Government could not agree to an early increase inthe licence fee and could not accept that the fee should automaticallybe increased to meet the whole of the BBCs deficit. The BBC had then offered, subject to certain conditions, to cut their expenditureso as to dispense with the need for an increase in the licence fee until april 1968. The Ministerial Committee had examined the implications of the BBCs proposals and were now satisfied after taking account of the effect of the Selective Employment Tax on theCC 42 (66)The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were in general in agreement with the Home Secretary^proposals. Further consideration should be given, in consultationwith the First Secretary of State and the Attorney-General to theproblem of the enforcement of fines for offences under the Prices and incomes Bill, and if a solution could not be found the matter mighthave to be submitted to the Cabinet again. The Home secretary should also consider, in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer and other Ministers concerned, the development and rising cost of the legal aid system.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary to consider further, inconsultation with the First Secretary of State and the attorney-General, the powers proposed to be conferred on the courts for the enforcement of fines.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the LordChancellor, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the attorney-General, to consider the development of thelegal aid scheme, with particular reference to its cost.(3) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, approved the proposals inC (66) 124 for a Criminal Justice Bill to be introduced inthe current Session of Parliament.
BBC, that the Corporation could make the necessary economies inorder to enable an increase in the licence fee to be deferred until thebeginning of 1968 at the earliest without any significant effect on services to the public. Whether they might manage a little longerwould depend on the effect of the administrative and legislativemeasures which the Government were taking to reduce licenceevasion. The proposals now put forward in the draft White paper had been framed with the object of limiting additional expenditureon broadcasting as far as possible in view of the current economicsituation and therefore departed from the proposals which had beenput forward earlier in the year. The Ministerial Committee had concluded that there should at present be no increase in the hours of broadcasting, that a fourth television network should not beestablished for the time being and that progress with local sound broadcasting should be limited to an experiment to be conducted bythe BBC. The publication of the Bill to suppress the pirate radio stations had created a need to provide a substitute programme, andthe Committee had concluded that this could be done in time, andwithout substantially increased expenditure, only if the BBC were authorised to broadcast a continuous music programme on thewavelength at present used for the Light Programme. It had been announced during debate in Parliament that the Governmentwere considering the establishment of a National BroadcastingCommission, but the BBC and the Independent Television Authority(ITA) had raised strong objection since they feared that such aCommission would threaten their authority and responsibility, andthe Ministerial Committee had concluded that the proposal shouldnot be pursued. The White Paper, however, referred to thedevelopment of machinery for consultation between the twocorporations on common matters of policy.There was strong pressure for the publication of the government&apos;s review of broadcasting, particularly since thepublication of the legislation to suppress the pirate stations, as it was known that the Government were considering the possibility ofproviding a substitute service. He sought the Cabinet&apos;s agreement tothe publication of the draft White Paper, preferably towards the endof August, when it would be likely to receive considerable publicity.In discussion of the White Paper, the following principal points were made:(a) Broadcasting developments. A reference should be made inparagraph 4 to the development of stereophonic sound broadcasting.(b) BBC finance. The statement in paragraph 10, that thereshould be no change at present in the arrangements for financing the bbc, would prompt questions on arrangements in the longer term.It was suggested that it would be necessary to undertake a fundamental review of the problems of financing public servicebroadcasting, since it seemed unlikely that the BBC, in competition with commercial broadcasting, could continue to be financed entirely from licence revenue and that this examination should extend to the role which advertising ought to play in BBC finance. It was agreedthat the word &quot; January &quot; should be omitted from the final sentence of paragraph 10.
(c) Licence evasion. Introduction of the Governmentslegislation against evasion was now urgent and the White paper should say that a Bill would be introduced in the autumn. It mightbe desirable to indicate that the Government proposed to provide that no receiver should be installed until a licence had been issued, amatter on which negotiations were currently being held with theretailers.(d) Fourth network. The passage in square brackets inparagraph 17 was intended to avoid any implication that proposalsfor the University of the Air had been abandoned. It was, however,undesirable that this should be associated with the section of theWhite Paper on the fourth television network, and the passage should find a place elsewhere in the White Paper.(e) Local sound broadcasting. It was suggested that an experiment was required to establish whether there was sufficientdemand for local sound broadcasting, and whether sufficient localmaterial would be available, to justify the establishment of a systemof local stations over the country as a whole. The BBC should beused for the experiment, since they had the facilities to conduct it without substantial additional capital expenditure and because any new local corporations set up for the purpose would probably haveto rely largely, if not entirely, on advertising, which was open to objection. It was desirable that an early experiment should beundertaken if the strong pressure from commercial interests toestablish themselves in this field were to be resisted. The proposedestablishment of local broadcasting councils in connection with the experiment would ensure a local character for the programmes. Onthe other hand, it was argued that the outcome of the experimentwould be prejudiced by using the BBC, who were unlikely to provideprogrammes with popular local appeal; and that once the BBC were established in this field it would be very difficult to refuse to allow them to continue when the experiment was completed; that the experiment would further increase their expenditure and the needfor a higher licence fee; and that it was wrong in principle that thecost of a local service should be financed from a national licence.Since the pirate radio stations operated to some extent as local stations, consideration ought to be given to the possibility of usinglocal stations, financed from advertising, to broadcast popular musicprogrammes in substitution for those at present provided by thepirate stations. Such stations would meet widespread populardemand at no cost to public funds and would be a source of revenuethrough the taxation of advertising. Local stations would have to broadcast on very high frequency (VHF); this might lead to anincrease in the imports of foreign sets since VHF transistor receiverswere not widely manufactured in this country, but might on the otherhand stimulate domestic manufacture of such sets.(/) Continuous music service. It was suggested that the essentialneed was to provide, without substantial additional capitalexpenditure, a substitute for the service provided by the piratestations, which could be introduced when these were suppressedearly in 1967.   The establishment of a new corporation, financed
from advertising, and using the present BBC wavelength of 247 metresto broadcast a continuous music programme, might take two yearsand cost over  2 million, since it would be necessary for such a corporation to build its own transmitting stations. The BBCtransmitters could not be made available if the medium wave coverageof the BBCs Light Programme were to be maintained in the northand west, where it had a considerable audience, particularly in the rural areas. It would also be undesirable in present circumstances toset up a new service, financed from advertising, which would increasethe demand for consumer goods. Moreover, there was objection toextending the scope of advertising in the field of broadcasting. Onthe other hand, it was suggested that the type of service that would beprovided by the BBC, who were limited by their agreements withthe Musicians&apos; Union in the amount of time they could devote torecorded music, would not in fact meet the demand or provide a range of choice. It was suggested that further consideration shouldbe given urgently to the technical possibility of establishing newtransmitting stations, possibly operating on VHF, to transmit a popular music programme in time to coincide with the disappearance of the pirate stations.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that before decisions could be taken on local sound broadcasting and theestablishment of a music programme the Cabinet required a technicalappraisal of the possibility and implications of setting up stations to transmit, soon after the end of the year, programmes similar to those provided by the pirate stations; these might either be local stationsoperating on VHF, or stations using the BBCs present medium 247metre wavelength. The Cabinet would also require an appraisal ofthe possibility of financing such a service, whether operated by the bbc or otherwise, from advertising. The Postmaster-General should submit a report in the first instance to the Ministerial Committee on broadcasting who should report to the Cabinet before the end ofSeptember. No indication could be given in the meantime to the bbc of the Government^ conclusions on their finances.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Postmaster-General to submit to the ministerial committee on Broadcasting a technical appraisal on thelines indicated in the Prime Ministers summing up oftheir discussion.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting in thelight of a report by the Ministerial Committee on thematerial submitted in accordance with (1).Cabinet Office, S.W.1,4th August, 1966.
