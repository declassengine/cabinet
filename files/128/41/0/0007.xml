leasehold reform(previous reference:CC(65) 73rdConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Lord Presidentof the Council (C (66) 29) and the Lord Chancellor (C (66) 30) onleasehold reform.The Lord President recalled that the Cabinet had considered inDecember proposals for leasehold reform submitted by the ministerial committee on Legislation on Rent, Land Commission and leasehold enfranchisement and had thought them to be too confiscatory intheir effect. They had asked the Committee to submit alternative proposals, bearing in mind the desirability of producing a &quot; fairprice &quot; less than the current market value of the freeholders interest,of giving security to leaseholders who did not wish to enfranchise,and of so framing the scheme that it could be applied to public authorities. The Committee had considered various possibilities, but had been unable to reach complete agreement. The majority of theCommittee proposed a scheme which differed in several respects fromthat originally submitted. It was now proposed that a leaseholderqualified to benefit under the scheme should be one who held at aground rent the lease of a house originally granted for more than21 years and had occupied the house as a residence for at least fiveyears. Qualified leaseholders would be entitled to an extension ofthe lease for 50 years at a ground rent which, after the expiry of theoriginal lease, would be the modern ground rent and would besubject to review after 25 years, and to enfranchise at the value ofthe freeholder^ interest as depreciated by the extension of the lease.In other words, the freeholder would be entitled to site value as partof the value of the land and buildings, subject to the lease and its extension and disregarding the value of the buildings on reversion.Where the Land Commission determined that there was development value in the site, the leaseholder would pay in addition to the sitevalue the development value as modified by the unexpired periodof the lease. The freeholder would have the right during the originallease to resist either enfranchisement or extension on the ground thathe wanted the property for occupation by himself or his family andwould suffer greater hardship than the leaseholder if he could notrecover possession; and during the extension he would have theright, oh cause shown, to obtain possession compulsorily forredevelopment by buying out the leaseholders interest in the extendedlease. The scheme should apply to leases held from public authoritiessubject to modifications designed to ensure that the leaseholders didnot acquire development rights and could be debarred fromenfranchising where a public authority had purchased the land for early development. These proposals could be defended on theprinciple that in social equity the bricks and mortar belonged to the leaseholder and the land to the freeholder. The site value formulawould give the freeholder neither more nor less than the value of hisCC 7 (66)Parliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
interest in the land for existing use; and the price would be less thanthe market value of the freeholders interest under the existing law,except where the reversion was too far distant to affect market valuewhen the enfranchisement price would be same as the value of thefreeholder^ existing interest. It was proposed that the scheme shouldbe outlined in a White Paper which would be published in time to be debated in the House of Commons towards the end of February.The Lord Chancellor said that he was unable to accept theproposals of the majority of the Ministerial Committee because inthe majority of cases they would produce results more confiscatorythan the original proposals. He accepted that, where the leaseholderor his forebears had built the house, it was inequitable that the house should revert to the freeholder at the end of the lease; but bothfreehold and leasehold interests in property might change handsseveral times during the lifetime of a lease; the reversion might be bought by a person who wished to occupy the house on retirement,and the last few years of the lease might be acquired by a purchaser,not interested in lengthy occupation, for a small sum which did not reflect the value of the bricks and mortar. The proposalsrecommended by the majority of the Ministerial Committee wouldenable a leaseholder who bought a short-term to acquire for a smallsum a property which he could immediately sell with vacantpossession at a substantial profit to which he had no moral claim.This situation could be prevented by the provision, included in theproposals originally submitted to the Cabinet, that leaseholders whobought leases when they had less than 21 years to run should not beentitled to an extension of the lease but should enfranchise at fullmarket value; and this was the solution to the problem which theLaw Officers would prefer. An alternative, which avoided drawingan arbitrary line between those who would benefit fully from thelegislation and those who would not, would be to relate the price ofenfranchisement to the leaseholder^ merits by requiring him to paythe value which the freeholders interest would have at the date ofenfranchisement, if it were subject to a lease which still had as longto run as the period originally acquired by the leaseholder or hisforebears. The leaseholder would then pay in up-to-date money terms the additional amount which he would have had to pay whenhe bought his lease if he had instead bought the freehold, and thiswas the result which ought in equity to be achieved. Failing this, itwould be possible to reduce the uncovenanted benefits given to the purchaser of a short term of a lease by reducing from 50 years to21 years the proposed entitlement to an extension of the lease. Thiswould not, however, substantially reduce the uncovenanted benefits which such a leaseholder could obtain by enfranchisement.He was also unable to agree that the freeholder should be deniedthe right to resist enfranchisement during the remainder of theexisting lease on the ground that he wished to redevelop theproperty. This would in effect put an end to future plannedredevelopment of leasehold property by private landlords and wouldbe inconsistent with the public interest. The freeholder who could show a settled intention to develop should be able to resist
enfranchisement or an extension of the lease, subject to payment ofcompensation equal to the leaseholders interest as enhanced by theproposed legislation.The Attorney-General said that it was important that proposalswhich involved the compulsory transfer of property from one privateindividual to another should rest on a clear basis of principle whichcould be justified in public discussion. The principle underlying thepolicy of enfranchisement was that the leaseholder had paid for thevalue of the bricks and mortar. Where the lease had been acquiredwith 21 years to run the leaseholder would in fact pay about half thebricks and mortar value (and from this point of view a period of30 years might be more appropriate); but where he acquired much less than 21 years he would in effect have brought merely the rightto occupy the house for a period without any expectation that itwould become his, and he was not entitled on the basis of thefundamental principle to the same benefits as the leaseholder whohad acquired the lease with a long period to run. It would bedefensible, however, to give the leaseholder who acquired a leasewith less than 21 years to run the right, as had originally been proposed, to enfranchise compulsorily at full market value, and thiswould confer a considerable benefit upon him because it wouldenable him to acquire the property at substantially less than its valuewith vacant possession.In discussion there was general agreement that the site valueformula for enfranchisement proposed by the majority of the ministerial Committee was acceptable, and that the only question a tissue was whether all holders of leases originally granted for morethan 21 years who had occupied the property as a residence for fiveyears should be entitled to enfranchise on these terms, or only thosewho had purchased their leases while they still had more than21 years to run.  It was argued that, while the first alternative hadthe merit of simplicity, simplicity should not be pursued at the expenseof equity, and in equity it was right that a distinction should be drawn between those who had paid for the whole, or at least the greaterpart, of the value of the bricks and mortar and those who hadpurchased the fag-end of a lease for sums well below that value.There was reason to think that in recent years the public had become increasingly aware of this distinction and would accept the applicationof different terms for enfranchisement to the different categories ofleaseholder. In any event, the Government were pledged to providefor enfranchisement on &quot; fair terms&quot; and they were under no obligation to go beyond their pledge and to satisfy expectations of profit among leaseholders who, having bought a short term of a lease,had no moral claim to benefit from proposals designed to do justice to the leaseholder who had acquired or inherited a long term.  Onthe other hand, it was argued that, in view of the frequency withwhich leasehold interests changed hands and of the fact that owingto the housing shortage of the past 25 years many people had beenable to obtain accommodation only by buying leases, to confine the
application of the site value formula to persons who had acquiredleases with more than 21 years to run would be to exclude from itsbenefits considerable numbers of leaseholders who had some claimto consideration and who would undoubtedly be severely critical of ascheme which differentiated against them. Moreover, there was noreason in equity why the freeholder should benefit from the fact thatthe leasehold interest in his property had changed hands recently,and it might be difficult to satisfy leaseholders of the fairness of a formula which resulted in different prices being paid forenfranchisement of similar properties.In further discussion it was suggested that it might be possiblet&apos;o reduce the number of leaseholders who would be givenundeserved benefits, either by increasing the qualifying period of residence to seven years or by reducing from 21 years to 12 years the period which must have been purchased in order to qualify forthe full benefits of the scheme. The first proposal would, however, bedifficult to justify in the light of the fact that property interestschanged hands on an average once in seven years; and to reduce to12 years the period which the leaseholder must have acquired woulddefeat the object which it was sought to achieve of fixing the period at 21 years, since 21 years was the shortest period at which it couldbe said that the leaseholder had acquired a substantial portion of thevalue of the bricks and mortar. It would consequently not bepossible to defend a 12-year period on any basis of principle. Since,however, adoption of the 21-year period would exclude a considerablenumber of leaseholders from the benefits which the government&apos;s policy was designed to confer, it seemed better to adopt the proposalsof the majority of the Ministerial Committee and to confine the qualifications for enjoying these benefits to possession of a leaseoriginally granted for 21 years and five years residential occupationof the property.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, on balance, the Cabinet favoured the acceptance of the recommendationsof the majority of the Ministerial Committee as set out in C (66) 29,subject to further consideration, on the basis of alternative passages in the draft White Paper, of the rights of the freeholder to resistenfranchisement on the ground that he wished to redevelop theproperty. It was agreed that the scheme set out in C (66) 29 shouldbe applied to leasehold property owned by public authorities, subjectto the modifications proposed.The Cabinet-.(1) Approved the proposals for leasehold reform set out inC (66) 29, subject to further consideration of the right ofthe freeholder to resist enfranchisement on the groundthat he wished to redevelop the property.(2) Invited the Minister of Land and Natural Resources tosubmit a draft White Paper on Leasehold Reform forconsideration at an early meeting.
3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C (66) 31) to which was attached a copy of a minute fromthe Home Secretary to the Prime Minister on the emergency measuresto be taken should the threatened rail strike materialise.The First Secretary of State said that he, the Minister of Labourand the Minister of Transport had that morning held a meeting witha negotiating committee representing the railway unions. He had explained that the Government were prepared to accept thatconcessions should be made in respect of certain improvements infringe benefits, relating to improved leave entitlements, the date of introduction of a 40-hour working week and pension arrangements and also to accept that the date of the 3\ per cent pay increase shouldbe brought forward from 1st October, which was the daterecommended by the National Board for Prices and Incomes, to 1st September. He had also made it clear that the Government werenot prepared to accept that any further concessions should be made.It appeared that the unions, other than the National Union of railwaymen (NUR), would be prepared to accept a settlement onthis basis, but the negotiating representatives of the NUR hadconfined themselves to a statement that they would discuss the matter further with the Union Executive. The outcome was uncertain.The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial Committee on emergencies had met the previous afternoon under his chairmanshipto review the preparations being made to maintain essential supplies and services should the strike materialise. A number of detailed arrangements had been approved, together with the draft of theEmergency Regulations, which were for practical purposes identical with those used in 1960. There were, however, two major issues onwhich a decision was required. The first was whether the emergency regulations should be made and laid before Parliament on Saturday,12th February, or on Monday, 14th February. If made on the latterday they would not be in force until the following day, but this wouldnot have serious practical disadvantages and on balance theCommittee recommended that the Regulations should be laid onMonday, 14th February. A number of announcements would,however, have to be issued before then, to give detailed guidance tothe public, if they were to be effective by the Monday and theCommittee therefore considered it important that there should be anearly statement of the Governments plans as a whole which should include, or cover, all the necessary departmental statements. Thisshould be made at the latest by the following morning and preferablyby that evening.In discussion there was general agreement that the statementproposed by the Home Secretary should be made that evening.The Prime Minister said that the subsequent detailed handling of the dispute should be further considered by the Ministers mostimmediately concerned, who should also consider the text of theGovernment statement to be issued from 10 Downing Street.  The
balance of advantage probably lay in making the emergency regulations on the Monday, but this also would be considered bythe group of Ministers concerned. The issues involved would bebrought before the Cabinet again if necessary.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theMinisters immediately concerned to discuss further the handling of the dispute and the text of a statement to bemade that evening on the preparations being made tomaintain essential supplies and services.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,10th February, 1966.
