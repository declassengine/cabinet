RhodesiaSECRET1.   The Cabinet discussed Rhodesia in relation to the outcomeCommonwealth ^ 0f trJe recent Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers, the actionPrime Ministers&apos;which should bg takgn jq thg Ught of that Meeting and tne demandConference(previous reference:CC (66) 45thConclusions)by the Leader of the Opposition for the recall of Parliament on theground that the Government had changed its policy.Meeting of Commonwealth Prime ministers the Commonwealth Secretary said that the Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers had ended the previous day. It hadbeen concerned almost exclusively with Rhodesia and other items onthe agenda had been disposed of quickly and summarily at the end.We had been under very heavy pressure in respect of our policy on rhodesia and one particularly disturbing feature of the Meeting hadbeen the establishment of a caucus, comprising the African, Asianand West Indian Members other than Malaysia and Malawi. Thiscaucus had conferred separately on Rhodesia. It had been used asa means of pressure on those of its more moderate Members to acceptextreme views and subsequently to prevent the acceptance of reasonable compromises by the Meeting. The proceedings had beendiscourteous to the Meeting as a whole, in that the other Membersof the Commonwealth had frequently been kept waiting in formalsessions for a considerable time while the caucus conferred.In the Meeting, approximately half the Members had been infavour of the use of force to defeat the illegal regime and just under two-thirds had been in favour of a declaration that no independence would be granted before majority rule. A somewhat smaller numberhad favoured seeking the approval of the Security Council forcomprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the united nations, Charter. It had only been through the exercise of greatpatience and firmness that agreement had finally been reached onthe terms of the communique.In discussion concern was expressed at the emergence of thecaucus and the consequent serious change in procedure and tone ofthe Meeting as compared with other Commonwealth Meetings. Itwas suggested that the outcome called for a review of the future ofthe Commonwealth in relation to the interests of the United Kingdom.There was general agreement that such a review might be desirableafter sufficient time had elapsed to enable the Meeting that had justterminated to be seen in perspective. In considering the outcome,however, it was also necessary to bear in mind that the firm attitude which had been adopted by the United Kingdom had made clear tothe other Members the extent to which their interests too mightsuffer if the Commonwealth were to break up and this realisationmight, in certain respects at least, give greater cohesion to theCommonwealth in future. The test of this would be duringsubsequent discussions on Rhodesian problems at the United nations and in particular whether or not the Commonwealth Members thenstood by their agreement, as expressed in the communique, to limit the extent of mandatory sanctions.
Further action the Commonwealth Secretary said that the communique agreed by the Meeting expressed the unanimity of the Commonwealth onthe need to bring the rebellion speedily to an end. It noted thedecision of the United Kingdom Government that after the illegal regime was ended the Governor would then form a broadly-basedgovernment with which the United Kingdom Government would beprepared to negotiate a constitutional settlement. This would bedirected to achieving majority rule on the basis of the six principles.In the interim period the armed forces and the police would beresponsible to the Governor. We contemplated that other Membersof the Commonwealth might be associated either with devising a newconstitution to this end (as an alternative to the necessary amendmentof the 1961 Constitution) or with the means for ascertaining the acceptability of whatever constitution was proposed. The caucushad at the Meeting asked that the Commonwealth Prime ministers should have the right of veto on the acceptability of the constitution,but this had been denied and we had maintained the position thatthe United Kingdom Government would be responsible for devisingthe means of testing acceptability, whether by the appointment of a royal Commission or otherwise. It was made clear that noindependence would be granted before majority rule unless this course was acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole. the communique also stated that political detainees in Rhodesia must be released provided they conducted themselves lawfully and peacefully.A senior official of the Commonwealth Office had flown out to rhodesia to acquaint the Governor with the course of discussion atthe Meeting leading up to the communique. The Governor had alsobeen informed that it was contemplated that the commonwealth secretary might visit Rhodesia and inform the illegal regime, throughthe Governor, of the proposals which the United KingdomGovernment were prepared to put forward. No action would ofcourse be taken which might be regarded as recognition of the regime.In discussion the Cabinet first considered whether it would bedesirable for the Commonwealth Secretary to visit Rhodesia in theimmediate future, before the conference of the Rhodesia Front Party(the Rhodesia Front Congress) which was due to be held towards theend of the following week. The arguments were finely balanced andit was the general view that the decision should turn on the course recommended by the Governor after he had ascertained the reactions of Mr. Smith, the leader of the illegal regime, to the proposal for the visit. In any event, however, it would be undesirable for theCommonwealth Secretary to remain in Rhodesia during the Congress.To avoid any suggestion that inadequate time had been allowed for mr. Smith to consider the terms of a settlement which the UnitedKingdom Government would be prepared to accept, it would however be preferable that, if the Commonwealth Secretary were in the eventto go to Salisbury before the Congress, he should not return in thisperiod to the United Kingdom but should visit anotherCommonwealth country. Subject to the outcome of the Congress,he should then return to Rhodesia and be prepared to spend a fortnight or so there in order to allow ample time for discussions.
In further discussion it was pointed out that Mr. Smith wouldnot be prepared to hand over power to the Governor so that the lattercould then form a broadly-based government, unless he were firstaware of the form of constitution which the United KingdomGovernment would accept as a basis of a settlement. It would,therefore, be necessary for the Commonwealth Secretary to make clear what that constitution might be, on the lines which had alreadybeen discussed between United Kingdom and Rhodesian officials inthe informal talks, though formal negotiations would only be held with the duly constituted Government thereafter. It would also bedesirable for the Commonwealth Secretary to offer Mr. Smith anumber of other possible courses, such as the association of commonwealth experts in devising a wholly new constitution, or a visit of a small Mission of Commonwealth Heads of government under the chairmanship of the Canadian Prime Minister. None ofthese might prove acceptable to Mr. Smith, but if he were to rejectthem all it would demonstrate beyond doubt that he was not genuinelyprepared to contemplate a settlement.Should Mr. Smith not have accepted by December a settlement on the basis of the six principles, then we were committed by the communique to withdraw all our offers so far, to decline to submit to Parliament any settlement which involved independence before majority rule and, provided that we had the full support of commonwealth representatives at the United Nations, to join insponsoring in the Security Council a resolution providing for selectivemandatory economic sanctions against Rhodesia. If that supportwere however not forthcoming, then the whose basis of agreement atthe recent Meeting would be called into question and our hands wouldbe free. We had in any event made it clear at the Meeting that wewere not prepared to contemplate sanctions which would involve us in economic warfare with South Africa.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet were agreed that after a long enough period had elapsed to enable the Meeting of Commonwealth Prime ministers which had just ended to be seen in proper perspective it might bedesirable to review United Kingdom interests in relation to the futureof the Commonwealth.Meanwhile the Cabinet were agreed that the commonwealth secretary should be authorised to visit Rhodesia in the near future,provided unacceptable obstacles were not imposed by the illegal regime. The timing of the visit in relation to the Rhodesia FrontCongress would be a matter for decision by the commonwealth secretary, in consultation with himself, in the light of the Governorsrecommendations after Mr. Smith&apos;s reaction to the proposal had been ascertained. It was agreed that if the Commonwealth Secretary wereto go out before the Congress he would not stay in Rhodesia duringits course, but should visit another Commonwealth country. In any event he should spend ample time in Rhodesia to enable a numberof alternative courses of action to be fully discussed with Mr. Smith.
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Commonwealth Secretary should visitRhodesia in the near future on the conditions and subjectto the considerations indicated by the Prime Minister inhis summing up of their discussion.Recall of parliament the Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the Leader of theOpposition, Mr. Heath, had written to him asking that Parliament be recalled to discuss the Rhodesian situation on the ground that the government&apos;s agreement to the action detailed in the communiqueconstituted a change of policy and hence that Parliament should be recalled in view of the Governmenfs commitment to do so in that event.In discussion there was general agreement that, since the questionof a change in the Governmenfs policy would only arise shouldMr. Smith refuse to agree to a settlement on the conditions whichthe Government had specified throughout as being necessary, therewas no justification on that account for the recall of Parliament.In further discussion it was suggested that it might however benecessary to recall Parliament because the Government might haveto bring into effect in the near future Part IV of the Prices and incomes Bill. Judgment would be given in the courts on 27th or28th September on two cases relating to the payment of increased wages under contract, and it was likely that judgment would be givenin favour of the appellants. In that event it would be necessary, inorder to maintain the Governmenfs policy on prices and incomes, tobring Part IV of the Bill into operation with the minimum of delay.This required an affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliamentwithin 28 days, and while it might not be necessary on this accountalone to recall Parliament earlier, it might prove politically desirableto do so. This, however, could only be decided in the light of the judgment of the court on the two cases in question and of thediscussions which would subsequently be necessary both with the confederation of British Industries and with the Trades UnionCongress.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that a reply should be sent to the Leader of theOpposition declining to recall Parliament for discussionof the Governmenfs policy on Rhodesia.AgricultureAgriculturalCredit(previous reference:CC (66) 43rdConclusions,Minute 3&quot;kCONFIDENTIAL2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the minister without Portfolio (C (66) 129) reporting conclusions of the Committeeon Agricultural Policy, and by the Minister of Agriculture, fisheries and Food (C (66) 130), and the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C (66) 131) on Agricultural Credit.
The Minister without Portfolio recalled that the Cabinet had asked the Committee on Agricultural Policy (CC (66) 43rd Meeting,Minute 3) to consider whether greater savings of imports ofagricultural commodities could be achieved without serious damage to our international trading relationships, commitments and policies.The Committee had unanimously taken the view that as the objectives for the saving of imports set for agriculture last year under theNational Plan had been thoroughly considered in regard both to theuse of national resources and to the implications for our tradingrelationships, and as there had also been consultations with our overseas suppliers before the objectives were adopted, it would be unwise to reopen these discussions, with a view to increasing the objectives for production, so soon after the announcement of the Plan.The Agricultural Ministers had, however, drawn the Committee&apos;attention to certain risks threatening the achievement of the existingobjectives for the saving of imports under the Plan. The agricultural ministers had pointed out that there had been a sharp decline in pig production and in the breeding herd, and there had been no dissent from their proposal for an early announcement that the middle bandof the flexible price guarantee for pigs should be raised by 400,000pigs at the 1967 Farm Price Review. The Committee had also considered the interpretation of two assurances in the 1966 farm price Review White Paper concerning productivity and milk; theseinterpretations had been under discussion with the farmers since thelast Review, and ought now to be settled. Here also the Committeehad reached unanimous agreement on forms of words set out in thereport before Cabinet (C (66) 129) which the Minister of Agriculturemight use on these points in an early statement about agricultural policy.It had not, however, been possible to reach agreement in theCommittee, or subsequently, on the Agricultural Ministers1proposition that a statement should be made putting credit for agriculture on the same basis as credit for manufacturing industry,subject to the overriding priority of credit for manufacturing exports.There had been considerable agitation in the agricultural Press whichcontrasted the instructions to the banks about credit restrictions withthe Governmenfs emphasis on the need for increased agricultural production to reduce imports. There was some question how far the agitation about agricultural credit was based on a real and widespread shortage of credit and how far upon considerations) of prestige arising from the priority apparently given to credit for manufacturing industry. In his view it would certainly be impossiblefor the Minister of Agriculture to make a major speech with theobject of fostering the restoration of confidence in agriculture without saying something reassuring about credit, which was currently in the forefront of agricultural discussion. The Agricultural Ministers had,therefore, submitted a case on this to the Cabinet, and the chancellor had similarly circulated a statement of the countervailingconsiderations.
The Minister of Agriculture said that he and his colleagues had examined carefully whether the objectives for agricultural production could be increased, and also how far the industry was progressingtowards the achievement of the objectives set under the selective expansion programme adopted the previous year. This examinationconfirmed that our international trading position in respect of the commodities for which there was further scope for reducing importsdid not afford any room for manoeuvre, particularly in view of theimminence of the Kennedy Round talks. The Agricultural Ministers&apos;anxiety at the moment was much more to restore confidence in theindustry so as to assure the achievement of current objectives. Atpresent these were at risk, as regards beef because the dairy herd wasstatic, and as regards pigmeat because of the decline in productionand in breeding stock. There was unease generally in the industryabout the extent to which farmers would themselves be allowed to benefit from their increasing productivity, and about the currentshortage of credit.He therefore welcomed the agreement reached by the Committeeon Agricultural Policy on the first three proposals of the agricultural ministers. On the outstanding matter of credit policy, the latter had considerable evidence that uneven application of the creditrestrictions by the banks was depriving farmers of normal seasonalrequirements for credit, and also that agriculture was being moreseverely treated than industry in respect of its short and medium-term requirements for credit in respect of livestock, plant and buildings.There was no dispute about long-term credit for land purchase, forwhich the facilities of the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation wereavailable.It was not consistent to ask farmers to produce more and saveimports, and to deny them the finance necessary to do this. the picture of the availability of credit was uneven; but the agricultural ministers were satisfied, both from evidence of individual cases andfrom statements received from the banks themselves, that farm creditwas being unduly restricted, and that it was necessary to make clearthat there had been no change in the Governments agricultural policy,to clarify the instructions to the banks about credit accordingly, andin particular to place agriculture in this respect on a par withproductive investment under manufacturing industry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was content withthe conclusions reached by the Committee on Agricultural Policy asregards objectives for production, pigs, and the assurances on milk and productivity.There were however difficulties as regards credit. The facts werenot agreed. He had spoken to the banks after correspondence withthe Minister of Agriculture in August and there was no doubt in the minds of the banks about their instructions. The administration ofthese instructions was bound to be somewhat uneven as betweenseveral thousand bank managers, but the broad policy was clear.Normal seasonal requirements for credit were being met, and the banks had no evidence of sales at distressed prices for lack of credit.The banks knew that if they had to exceed the 105 per cent limit forCONFIDENTIAL
The Cabinet-(1) Approved the conclusions of the Agricultural PolicyCommittee in respect of the further assurances to farmerson milk, productivity, and the middle band of the pigsguarantee.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to confirm with thebanking authorities that the position on agricultural creditwas in accordance with his statement to Cabinet.seasonal purposes, they were free to do so. The banks also had full authority to give credit (since this was self-liquidating) over two to three years for purchase of livestock. As regards credit for plant and buildings, he was advised that agriculture was doing as well asmanufacturing industry, save in regard to the overriding priority for exports. There had been complaints that farmers could not getlong-term credit for land purchase, and it was true that this had been stopped, but it was in any event wrong that farmers should look tothe banks for this type of finance. He agreed that the Minister ofAgriculture should make a speech with the objective of restoringconfidence, in which full use should be made of the agreedreassurances in respect of pigs, milk and productivity, together witha statement he had drafted about the availability of credit facilities,on the lines which he had just indicated. This should meet the reasonable needs of the farmers.In discussion it was stated that there was considerable evidencethat the banks were applying the credit restrictions in Scotland withgreat severity as regards capital investment, and unevenly as regardsseasonal requirements; it had been necessary for some farmers to selllivestock as a result. On the other hand the banks&apos; view was thatsome fall from the unduly high livestock price of the previous year was inevitable. The banks themselves had confirmed in correspondence that they did not regard agriculture as entitled to thesame priority for credit as manufacturing industry, and this appearedto substantiate the complaints that had been received from farmers.On the other hand, while the proposition that agriculture should beput on a par with productive industry (save for priority for exports)appeared prima facie to be reasonable, the needs of agriculture were so different from those of industry that such an instruction would notbe meaningful to the banks.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that if it seemed that the banks were in fact acting in the way described to theChancellor, there should be no significant problem; it would thereforebe helpful if they could be asked to confirm that this was the position.In the meantime, the Agriculture Ministers might consider the draft statement on credit to which the Chancellor had referred, and ifthere had not been time to agree it before the Chancellors imminentdeparture for North America he would himself consider what formof words might be used, within the existing policy on credit.
(3) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food tomake an early public statement reaffirming theGovernments agricultural policy and incorporating thepoints agreed in the Cabinefs discussion.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would if necessaryconsider the form of words relating to credit to be usedin the statement covered by conclusion (3).Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th September, 1966.
