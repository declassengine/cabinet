The Foreign Secretary said that he proposed to circulate a paper to the Cabinet giving his impressions after his recent tourof Peru, Chile and the Argentine, in the course of which he had had discussions with all our Ambassadors in Latin America. Itwas clear that there was much for the United Kingdom to do inorder to make up ground that had been lost commercially in latin america over recent decades. There were opportunities for theexpansion of our trade and, in particular, for the sale of capital goods. There was also a greater appreciation than hitherto ofeconomic priorities on the part of Latin American Governments,which suggested that these countries would be more reliablecustomers in future. Furthermore, despite the continued existenceof highly privileged sections of the community, and the dangereither of Communist Governments assuming power in some countries or of a continuation of the previous pattern of alternatingmilitary dictatorships in others, there was now a real prospect ofthe emergence of a number of democratic regimes.The French Government had now delivered what was practicallyan ultimatum to their partners in the European economic community. It did not, however, appear that the remaining five members of the Community would, as they had done in the past,give way in the face of French intransigence.We should welcome the outcome of the mediation by theSoviet Government at the meeting in Tashkent between India and pakistan and the Soviet Prime Minister Mr. Kosygin was to becongratulated on the outcome. We must not, however, be over-optimistic in drawing from this event conclusions on the likelihood that the Soviet Union would in future be more willingto work with the West for common objectives. Basically they would continue to be opposed to us, but the containment of the People&apos;republic of China was clearly an important part of their policyand it was no doubt principally on this account that their effortsat mediation at Tashkent had been made.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.LocalGovernmentFinanceDomesticRatepayers(previous reference:CC(65) 48thConclusions,Minute 1)secret. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of housing and Local Government (C (66) 1) and by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C (66) 2) on Local Government Finance.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that inSeptember the Cabinet had approved (CC (65) 48th Conclusions,Minute 1) proposals for a new system of financial assistance tolocal authorities designed to keep the growth of rates broadly in line with the growth of the economy. It was estimated that thenew system would increase the amount of Exchequer grants to
local authorities as compared with existing arrangements by about 30 million in the first year,  60 million in the second year andso on. The Cabinet had also agreed to a major revision in thearrangements for both capital and revenue grants to local authorities.Discussions had been held on these matters with representativesof local authorities. In the light of these discussions and of furtherconsideration some changes now appeared desirable.As regards the structure of grants, the capital grant for theconstruction and improvement of main roads should be retainedat its present level of 75 per cent instead of being reduced to the50 per cent which was to apply to other capital grants. As regardsrevenue grants, there should be a flat increase of  5 million for assisting county boroughs and Inner London boroughs withhighways maintenance, and, more important, the separate educationgrant of 50 per cent of expenditure should be merged in the general grant because of the presentational problems in introducing a50 per cent grant in place of the previous 60 per cent.A separate issue arose on the distribution of the additionalExchequer assistance involved in the new proposals. It seemed likely that under the present arrangements the increase in the ratesin 1967-68 would be of the order of lid. in the  . The additionalExchequer assistance of  25 to  30 million would reduce theaverage increase in rates to 8 - 2d. in the  . In view of the smallnessof this relief it would be desirable to use the additional Exchequerassistance to reduce the rates of domestic ratepayers only. If this were done, it would mean that the rise in domestic rates would beabout 5-6d. in the   or half what it would otherwise be.It was unfortunate, but inevitable, that the increase inExchequer assistance could, at this stage, amount to little morethan tinkering with the problem while a major reform of localgovernment finance was being worked out. This would probablyneed to be part of the general reform of the structure and thefunctions of local government. The Government were pledged toshift a major part of the burden of local expenditure from theratepayer to the taxpayer: but in present circumstances it wasimpossible to make a major shift because of the difficulties of raising national levels of taxation further. Moreover, under thepresent system of local government the transfer of too great a partof local expenditure would tend to undermine the effectiveness oflocal government. A transfer of the order of  30 million a year was therefore the maximum which could be contemplated in thenext few years. It had originally been intended to restrict the risein the rate burden to the rate of growth in national income and forany excess in local expenditure over this figure to be met from theExchequer. It was however clear from the discussions with the localauthorities that there would be great difficulties in carrying throughthe necessary calculations and that it would be better to base thenew scheme on an increase in the proportion of local expendituremet by the Exchequer of 1 per cent each year. This would inpractice amount to an additional  30 million or so every year.
The Prime Minister said that, in view of the objections raisedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer to some of the proposals madeby the Minister of Housing in connection with the structure ofthe grants system, he had asked for a report from the official committee on Local Government Finance to be prepared on these aspects. Discussion of them should be deferred until the report was available. The question of distribution of the additional Exchequerassistance could however be discussed as a separate issue.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was no prospectat present of finding any alternative to the rates as a source oftaxation for raising  1,000 million a year. Moreover the level oflocal expenditure must continue to rise sharply so long as successive governments made major increases in social expenditure. the concentration of the additional Exchequer assistance upon the domestic ratepayer would not in practice have great advantages,since there would, in any case, be a substantial increase in the rate burden. Equally there was no great objection to this course if theCabinet considered it desirable. The arrangement would, however,mean that the amount of rates paid by industry and commerce wouldbe higher than under the scheme previously approved. Since industryand commerce could charge rates as a business expense, therewould be a reduction in receipts from Corporation Tax which mustbe taken into account in calculating the cost to the Exchequer ofthe new arrangements. Further consideration would have to begiven to the amount available for assistance to domestic ratepayersin the light of this factor, which might involve as much as 1\ million a year.In discussion it was suggested that a disadvantage of the new proposal would be that the increases in local expenditure at the margin would appear to be paid by industry and commercewhereas under the arrangements previously agreed they appearedto be paid by the Exchequer and this might influence local councils to reduce local expenditure on such services as education. It could also be argued that industry and commerce did not benefit frommuch of the local expenditure and that it was wrong for a higher rate burden to be imposed upon them than .upon domestic rate payers. Furthermore the new arrangements would be particularly favourable to areas which were predominantlyresidential and the relief to domestic ratepayers might vary considerably from one area to another. This might be difficult todefend and there might therefore be a case for maintaining thescheme originally agreed for one or two years and postponing any major reform until later.On the other hand it was argued that industry and commercewere already treated more favourably than domestic ratepayerssince they could charge rates as an expense for calculation ofCorporation Tax. Moreover, the decision to postpone the nextrevaluation of property would probably bring more benefit to industry than to domestic ratepayers. Concentrating assistance on domestic ratepayers would also assuage some of the objections now
being voiced by ratepayers to the introduction of the rate rebatescheme for poorer ratepayers, part of which was being borne byother ratepayers. In general, considerable support was expressedfor the view that, since any additional Exchequer assistance mustbe limited, it would be highly desirable to concentrate it on domestic ratepayers.In further discussion it was emphasised that the rating system was manifestly unfair because of its regressive character and it wasurgent to decide how best it could be made more equitable. the ministerial Committee on Local Government Finance had considered reports on the possibility of graduating the level of ratesin relation to rateable values. But this could not be fairly doneuntil more information was available from a pilot survey aboutthe relation between rateable values and incomes. An alternativeapproach might be to link the amount of rates paid directly withincomes. This, however, raised major administrative problems,though when income tax arrangements were dealt with bycomputers it might well be possible to devise a link with incometax or even to have a separate local income tax with rates fixedindividually by local authorities.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thegeneral view of the Cabinet was that additional Exchequerassistance should be concentrated on the domestic ratepayer. the exact amount and the method of distribution should be determinedby the Ministers concerned. There was also general agreement thatall possible supplementary sources of local revenue, including thepossibility of local broadcasting stations carrying advertisements,should be pursued in order to reduce the burden on the rates. Inthe longer term every effort should be made to devise a moreequitable system of local government finance. The prospectsopened up by the use of computers for the income tax system should be kept in mind, even if they could not be introduced forseveral years. In the meantime the Ministers concerned should discuss further a statement of the Governmenfs policy for the longterm on local government finance, including the need to recast itin order to remove the present regressive character of the rating system and, if possible, to make it progressive in its effect.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in paragraph 16 (1) and (2) ofC(66) 1.(2) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government, inconsultation with the other Ministers concerned, todetermine the amount to be used for the relief of domestic ratepayers and the method of distributionbetween local authorities.(3) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government, inconsultation with the other Ministers concerned, andhaving regard to the points made in discussion, toconsider further the remaining issues indicated in thePrime Ministers summing up.
Pay of the armed Forces(previous reference:CC(65) 63rdConclusions,Minute 2)Pay of theHigher CivilService(previous reference:CC(65) 62ndConclusions,Minute 4)Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.CC 2 (66)SECRETPrices and *3.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the First Secretaryincomes Policy of Statg and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs (C (66) 8)to which were attached copies of reports by the National board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) on the pay of the Armed forces and of the Higher Civil Service, and a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland on Scottish Teachers&apos; Salaries.The First Secretary of State said that he had now receivedthe reports prepared by the NBPI as a result of the referencesapproved by the Cabinet the previous November, and it wasnecessary to decide whether to accept and implement the Board&apos;srecommendations and whether to publish their reports. It wouldbe very difficult to withhold publication. The reports of royal commissions and the NBPI was a Royal Commission werecustomarily published, and failure to do so would set an embarrassing precedent. Moreover, the Government were boundto be faced with strong demands for publication. In his view theGovernment were virtually bound to accept the report on armed forces&apos; pay, in view of the emphasis laid by the NBPI upon theextent of the Governments commitment to the Grigg formula untilanother system had been adopted. The report on Higher CivilService pay should similarly be accepted. Though the standing advisory Committee on the Pay of the Higher Civil Service (the franks Committee) had indicated briefly that they had taken theeconomic situation into account, it had not been possible to be sure that their recommendations had been tested by the criteria of theGovernments policy on prices and incomes. The NBPI had nowfound that the Committee&apos;s recommendations were in accordancewith the policy, and had given cogent reasons for the increase atUnder-Secretary level, which was required to restore a reasonablepattern of differentials. For the Higher Civil Service as a whole the average increase was within the norm, and the NBPI had saidthat it would contribute to the need to balance above averageincreases in income with increases below the average. In generalthe Government would be in an indefensible position if, at a timewhen they were pressing other interests to accept reports by the nbpi which created difficulties for them, the Government rejectedrecommendations which they found politically inconvenient. Itwould not be desirable to pay increases to the Armed Forces by instalments, as had been done in 1962. On balance the right course was that the reports should be accepted, published and implemented.In discussion, though there was general agreement thatthe Government could hardly do otherwise than accept therecommendations on Armed Forces&apos; pay, it was argued that theconsequences of accepting both reports at the present time,particularly in view of the imminence of a railway strike as a resultof the recommendations by the NBPI on railwaymen&apos;s wages, couldbe very serious. It would be difficult to explain to railwaymendisappointed at an award of only 3i per cent (which was also now
based on a comparability of earnings as opposed to the previouscomparison based on wage rates) how it was justifiable within the incomes policy to pay to those who were already on high rates of pay increases which in some cases amounted in absolute terms toas much as some workers earned in total. The Government werenot bound to accept the reports of the NBPI and must retain theright of final decision. There was a danger that not enoughprecision was being given to the doctrine implicit in the concept ofthe norm that, if money incomes were to rise at a certain average rate, some people would receive less than the average. There were also strong arguments for applying a different norm for those on higher levels of pay from that applied for those on lower levels of pay, in order to achieve a measure of income redistribution and allow the wages of lower paid workers to rise without breachingthe objectives of incomes policy. The view was however expressed that the latter would be a difficult policy to sustain and would notbe consistent with the practice of many unions: only recently two major unions which supported the prices and incomes policy had,with the approval of their members, secured more generous ratesof increases for more highly skilled and paid men than for lowerpaid and unskilled men.In the light of these considerations the proposal was made that the implementation of the Franks Committee&apos;s recommendations should be phased so that the Higher Civil Service received increases of 3^ per cent from 1st January, 1966, and the balance from 1st January, 1967.On the other hand, although the immediate difficulties thatwould follow from accepting the two reports were generally recognised, it was argued that these considerations should not provedecisive. It would be difficult for the Government to reject ormodify the Franks Committee&apos;s recommendations, now that theyhad been approved by the NBPI and it would be represented that,if the Government were in any event unwilling to accept theCommittee&apos;s recommendations, the right course would have been to decide accordingly when they received them and not to refer themto the NBPI. If the reports were accepted, they would, however,have to be very carefully presented: for instance, it should bestressed that the increase in total emoluments of the Armed Forcesaveraged \1\ per cent, that the Grigg system for settling armed forces&apos; pay was to be reviewed, and that the increase for theHigher Civil Service, taken as a whole, was of the order of 6 percent for a period of two years and thus within the norm of 3 to3^ per cent per year.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that on balance the Cabinet inclined to the view that bothreports of the NBPI should be accepted, despite the immediatepolitical difficulties. The presentation of the reports would be very important, and it would be desirable for the First Secretary ofState to agree the terms of his announcement with the ministers directly concerned. In the light of the discussion it was clear thatthere was need for a further review of the application of the principle
SECRET&apos; 9     31ScottishTeachers&apos;Salaries(previous reference:CC(65) 73rdConclusions,Minute 3)The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the reports by the NBPI on the pay of the armed Forces and of the Higher Civil Service shouldbe accepted, implemented and published.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State to agree the terms and timing of an announcement of the Governments decisions with the Ministers chiefly concerned, taking account ofthe points made in discussion.(3) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation withother Ministers concerned, to consider how the remainingpoints made in the Prime Ministers summing up couldbe incorporated in the development of the government&apos;s policy on prices and incomes.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that on 23rd Decemberthe Cabinet had decided that the salary increase for scottish teachers should be reduced from an average of 15 per cent from 1st April, 1966, as recommended by the negotiating body, to anaverage of 13 per cent from the same date in order, having regardto the increase received by English teachers from 1st April, 1965,to minimise the risk of damage to the policy on incomes. TheCabinet had also decided that the NBPI should be asked to considerwhether this would put Scottish teachers into a fair relationship with English teachers; if not, what further adjustment was requiredto achieve that objective; and how to ensure that in future english and Scottish teachers&apos; salaries came up for review simultaneously,in order to minimise the risk of &quot; leapfrogging &quot;. He proposed to implement the Cabinefs decision by increasing all scales and ratesfor Scottish teachers by a uniform 13 per cent. This would be adifferent pattern of distribution from that recommended by the negotiating body and that adopted for English teachers, wherebyproportionately larger increases had been given to the basic scale and smaller increases at higher points. In Scotland the basic scaleapplied in general only to non-graduate women teachers, of whom there was no shortage, and it would be indefensible to give largerincreases to them than to the graduate men teachers whom it was more important to recruit. The Chancellor of the Exchequer,however, feared that, if the increases were given uniformly at all points and the NBPI were subsequently asked to consider whetherof fair comparisons in the determination of incomes, particularly inthe public services. This review should be conducted centrally, andshould cover both the Civil Service and the Armed Forces, as wellas other services in which it had been applied. Further consideration should also be given to the possibility that, within a norm of 3 to3i per cent a year, increases above the average might apply tothose who were underpaid as a result of distortions in salaryrelativities. This might call for some modification of, or additionto, the terms of reference of the NBPI.
the increases put Scottish teachers into a fair relationship withEnglish teachers, they were likely to find that a 13 per cent increase on the basic scale in Scotland did not put the teachers concernedinto a fair relationship with teachers on the basic scale in England;that there was a danger that they would in consequence recommendfurther increases on the Scottish basic scale without countervailingreductions at higher levels; and that this would lead to further&quot; leapfrogging &quot;.In discussion it was suggested that the difficulty would beremoved if the NBPI were not asked to consider whether the increaseproposed would put Scottish teachers into a fair relationship withEnglish teachers but solely whether the overall increase of 13 percent represented a fair relationship with the overall increase receivedby the latter. In that event however it would be for consideration whether to proceed with the other parts of the proposed reference.If all the NBPI were being asked to do was to suggest means of ensuring that in future English and Scottish teachers&apos; salaries came up for review simultaneously, this should be a matter which theDepartments concerned could settle for themselves without theassistance of the Board. It was however urged that it would be inconsistent with the Cabinefs original decision completely toabandon the reference to the NBPI for an assessment of the fairnessof the average increase in relation to English teachers, though theproposed terms of reference might be reframed in such a way asto ensure that the NBPI considered only the comparison overalland did not make comparisons at particular levels.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that ifthe Secretary of State for Scotland distributed the 13 per cent increase uniformly, it would be important to avoid allowing the nbpi specifically to compare increases in the basic scales in thetwo countries. There were still some doubts whether this couldbe achieved by reframing the terms of reference to the Board orwhether a reference so altered would be worth making. Thequestion of the terms in which such a reference should be made should be considered further by the First Secretary of State, theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Secretary of State for Education and Science. The matter should not be referred back to the Cabinet unless the fourMinisters were unable to agree. The Cabinet agreed that draftsalary scales for Scottish teachers should be published as theSecretary of State for Scotland proposed but this should not be doneuntil the terms of reference had been settled.The Cabinet (1) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State forScotland and the Secretary of State for Education and science, to determine the terms in which a reference should be made to the National Board for Prices and incomes on the salaries of Scottish teachers.
(2) Agreed, subject to Conclusion (1), that the Secretary ofState for Scotland should publish draft salary scales forScottish teachers giving a uniform increase of 13 per cent at all levels.PublicExpenditure1966-67Estimates(previous references:CC(65) 41stConclusions:CC(65) 43rdConclusions,Minute 3 and cc(65) 45thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C (66) 11) about the 1966-67 Estimates and amemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(C (66) 12) about the Estimates for the European launcher development Organisation (ELDO).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the 1966-67Estimates had been settled for all the major programmes. Thefigures for the major civil programmes were based on the public expenditure programme approved by the Cabinet in the summer of 1965. The Defence Budget had been settled (apart from the pay increases) at about the same money figure as in the previous year and the remaining items had been pruned with the samestandards of stringency. There remained, however, certain items ofexpenditure on which agreement had not been reached with theMinisters concerned. These had been discussed by the public expenditure Committee, whose recommendations were set out inC (66) 11. They were all items which contained a significantproportion of overseas expenditure: since the balance of paymentsforecasts for 1966 were less favourable than had been hoped, it was particularly important to contain the expansion of government expenditure overseas. The Foreign Secretary, although a memberof the Public Expenditure Committee, had been out of thecountry when this met and had reserved his position on therecommendations.ELDOThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the recommendationof the Committee was to restrict provision in the Estimates to 8 million on the basis of terminating our commitment in March1966. A note would be included that the actual sum was dependent on the decisions to be taken at the meeting of the ELDOCouncil in that month.The Foreign Secretary said that the Cabinefs decision to terminate our commitment to ELDO might call for reconsiderationin the light of subsequent events but, however that might be, thepresent proposal would have unfortunate consequences for our foreign policy. We had voted for the adoption of a budget forELDO for 1966 on the basis of the continuation of the programme and it would be regarded by the other Governments as a breach of faith if we now failed to provide for it in our own estimates onthe same basis. A figure of  12 million should therefore be inserted,with a note that the item might be subject to adjustment in thelight of the meeting in March.
The Minister of Aviation agreed with the Foreign Secretary&apos;view on the provision to be made. Our commitment to ELDOshould be terminated but the course proposed by the Committeewould fail to minimise the political damage of this decision.In discussion it was suggested that there were several indications that the political reactions to our decision might be less strong than had been suggested. For example, discussion at the ScienceConference of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation andDevelopment had shown considerable support for our view thatsome of the technological programmes were too costly. To include 12 million in the Estimates would be likely to mislead otherGovernments about our determination to terminate the commitment.Summing up this part of the discussion, the Prime ministers aid that the Cabinet were on balance agreed that provision for 8 million should be made in the Estimates, together with a suitablenote as proposed in C (66) 11.Overseas information the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the departmentsconcerned with overseas information had proposed an increase of 3 million (10 per cent) in their Estimates for 1966-67. TheCommittee had taken the view that substantial economies shouldbe made, by cutting out the less essential items and that an increaseof  1 million should be adequate.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the figure of  32-million had been prepared on an austerity basis. In the light ofthe increase in costs and the commitment to participation in the montreal Exhibition it would involve a cut in our existing services.In discussion there was much support for the Committee&apos;view but considerable anxiety was expressed that the necessary cuts would be made by economies in the overseas services of the british broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and in work connected with tradepromotion rather than on less essential kinds of information work.Summing up this part of the discussion, the Prime ministers aid that the Cabinet desired more information about the services which would be curtailed if the recommendation of the Committeewere adopted, though it was their view that the provision shouldnot in any event exceed  31-6 million. The Ministers concerned should arrange for a paper to be prepared setting out the broadbreakdown of the expenditure covered by such a programme. Theyshould also show what further services would need to be reduced or abandoned in order to bring the provision down to  30-6 million.On the basis of such a report the Cabinet would be able to take afinal decision. In establishing priorities the Ministers concerned should seek to avoid cuts in the overseas services of the BBC andin work connected with the promotion of exports.Defence and the  Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the committee recommended reductions in the departmental proposals for military aid to India, and to Malaysia and for the amount spent on military
training facilities for Commonwealth officers and the secondmentof United Kingdom officers to Commonwealth Forces.Discussion showed general agreement with this view.The Minister of Overseas Development said that some items in the Overseas Aid Programme were of an essentially militarynature. The decision to incur additional expenditure in Aden which fell on the Programme but was in support of military activity had further eroded the  12 million which had been included in the1966-67 Programme to cover contingencies. Allowing for theadditional amount already authorised for Colonial territories, forAden and for famine relief in India, the amount set aside for contingencies was now virtually exhausted, without any provisionfor further expenditure in Rhodesia when constitutional Governmentwas restored, or for the programme for drought relief throughoutSouthern Africa.Overseas representationBuildingsThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Committee had asked the Ministers concerned to make a reduction of about 4 million on the Diplomatic Service Estimate, by making somereductions in staff, and on buildings overseas.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Works, said thatafter the discussion by the Committee it was proposed to reducethe Estimate to . 8f million, slightly below the figure for theprevious year.In discussion there was general agreement that this figure should be adopted. It was. however, suggested that standards of accommodation and furnishings adopted by the overseas departments for their missions were sometimes higher thannecessary.Summing up this part of the discussion, the Prime ministers aid that the Estimate should be fixed at  8f million for 1966-67.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, should, however, arrange for a thorough review of the standards of accommodation adoptedoverseas to see whether changes might be made which would affectgreater economies in the future.Diplomatic service the Foreign Secretary said that the Estimate for the diplomatic service was substantially below the Public Expenditure forecastmade in 1965, allowing for changes in salary levels and other costssince the date of the Estimate. There was increasing pressure onthe trade services of the Embassies, which were given first priorityand also on Consular work in view of the increasing number oftourists. There was thorough and detailed inspection of the starringof all overseas posts and the adoption of an arbitrary cut in numbers on the scale suggested by the Public expenditure committee would be quite impracticable.   Some small savings in
staff might be made but any large-scale reduction would not resultin savings in 1966-67 in view of the cost of compensation, etc. Itwould be impossible to make any saving on the scale of allowances,which had only recently been introduced after an independentreport and which were essential to enable individuals without privatemeans to enter the Diplomatic Service. It might however bepossible to reduce the Estimate for the Diplomatic Services by 4- million.After discussion the Prime Minister said that there was a case for considering whether the present scale of activities in certainoversea posts was still necessary when so much more was donedirectly between Ministers or at International Organisations. Thisshould be further examined as should the scale of entertainment.However, the Estimate for the Diplomatic Service and overseasbuildings should be adopted with a combined reduction of 1-7 million for 1966-67.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the following provisions should be included inthe 1966-67 Estimates.(i) For ELDO  8 million with a note that it would be finally settled in the light of inter-Governmentaldiscussions in March.(ii) On Defence Aid on the basis set out in Annex Cto C(66) 11.(iii) On Overseas Representation  35-3 million for the diplomatic Service and  8-7 million for public building overseas.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Ministers concerned, to arrange for the preparationof a paper showing what cuts in overseas information services would be necessary to reduce expenditure from  31-6 million to  30 - 6 million.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion of the provision on overseas information in the light of Conclusion (2).(4) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the commonwealth secretary to consider further the arrangement foroversea representation in the light of the points raised in discussion.SECRETWinter r 5.   The Prime Minister said that news had just been receivedEmergencies 0f a breakdown of gas supply in the Midlands which would resultin some 450 firms being unable to continue operations. Thesituation required urgent consideration by the Ministers primarily concerned and they should meet to consider the situation inconsultation with the Committee on Winter Emergencies under thechairmanship of the Lord Privy Seal.
The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with theMinisters concerned, to arrange for the Committee onWinter Emergencies to give urgent consideration to thesituation in the light of the Prime Minister^ statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,20th January, 1966.
