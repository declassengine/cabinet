Cabinet(previous reference:CC (66) 39thConclusions,Minute 2)In discussion it was suggested that there were no grounds forobjecting in principle to the display of a plaque recording the cabinet&apos;s meeting in the hotel, particularly in the light of the precedent provided by the plaque in the Inverness Town Hallcommemorating the Cabinet meeting which had been held there in1921. But there could be no question of its containing any statement purporting to describe the business which had been before ministers or the decisions which they had reached.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would convey to themanagement of the Grand Hotel, Brighton, their decisions on the suggestion that the hotel should place on permanentdisplay a plaque commemorating the Cabinefs meetingthere on 4th October.CONFIDENTIALRoyal 2.   The Prime Minister said that it had recently come to hisCommissions attention that the Royal Commission on English Local Governmenthad invited a number of Ministers and representatives of theOpposition to discuss informally with them some of the issues arisingfrom their terms of reference. There were occasions on which itmight be proper for a Minister to give formal evidence to a RoyalCommission, e.g., the Lord Chancellor, as head of the Judiciary, inrelation to a Royal Commission which was concerned with someissue of judicial practice or organisation. But the question whether. . Ministers   should   give   evidence,   even   informally,   to   royal commissions concerned with more political matters was morearguable; and the Cabinet should consider the questions ofprinciple involved.In discussion it was suggested that in certain circumstances itcould be helpful, both to the Royal Commission concerned and tothe Government, that Ministers should have an opportunity toexpress their views to the Commission, provided that the proceedings were on an informal basis and that no record of the evidence wastaken or published. Some Ministers had already accepted on this basis the invitation from the Royal Commission on English LocalGovernment.    On the other  hand  any  arrangement wherebyCC 51 (66)confidential. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he hadreceived from the management of the Grand Hotel, Brighton, asuggestion that the hotel should place on permanent display a plaquecommemorating the meeting of the Cabinet which had been heldthere on 4th October. It was suggested that the plaque shouldincorporate facsimile signatures of the members of the Cabinet andshould indicate the business which the Cabinet had transacted.
4CONFIDENTIALMinisters were regarded as free to express individual views to a royal Commission, even informally, could be held to be open to serious objection, partly on the ground that it might engendersuspicion that the Government were seeking privately to influence the findings of a body which they had established in order to give them impartial advice on some politically contentious issue andpartly on the ground that it would create a potential risk of subsequent embarrassment to the Government if some of its members were known to have expressed views which, whether or not theywere endorsed by the Royal Commission, were not necessarily incomplete harmony with the policy of the Government as a whole.This inhibition need not prevent the Chairman of a RoyalCommission from seeking a private discussion with a Minister on occasion, in order to ascertain his views on some specific issue withinthe Commission^ terms of reference which affected him personally inhis capacity as the responsible Minister. But on the more general question of the relations between Ministers and Royal Commissionsit would be wiser to adhere to the principle that all the factual advice and information which a Commission required should be providedby officials and that Ministers should not be involved in theCommission^ deliberations on the issues of policy in question.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, suggested thatthe Chairman of the Royal Commission on English LocalGovernment should be approached in this sense and that arrange-ments should be made to put the procedure in this respect on a moreregular basis for the future.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government toask the Chairman of the Royal Commission on EnglishLocal Government to reconsider, in the light of the issues raised in their discussion, the invitation which theCommission had issued to certain members of theGovernment to give informal evidence to them; and toreport to the Prime Minister the Chairman&apos;s reaction.(2) Agreed that in future Secretaries of Royal Commissionsshould be instructed to consult the Cabinet Office beforeissuing invitations to Ministers to give evidence and thatany Minister receiving such an invitation should similarlyconsult the Cabinet Office before accepting it.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would make the necessary arrangements to give effect to Conclusion (2) above.confidential parliament 3.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
OverseaAffairsForeignSecretary^visit to theUnited Statesand Canada(previous reference:CC (66) 50thConclusions,Minute 2)CC 51 (66)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that on his recent visit to new york and Washington he had had a series of discussions, which onthe whole were encouraging, with Mr. Gromyko, the Soviet ForeignMinister. There were indications of a distinct movement in theSoviet attitude towards agreement with the West on a number ofissues, though not as yet on Vietnam. Mr. Gromyko had made itclear that the first essential in the Soviet view was for the UnitedStates bombing of North Vietnam to stop, but though he had given no indication of what, if any, action they might then be able to take,it was clear that they were anxious to see a solution and to continue discussions. It was no doubt partly with this in view that he hadbeen invited to make an early visit to Moscow. Mr. Gromyko had,however, shown great interest in the early conclusion of a treaty onthe non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and there was some reasonto hope that an acceptable formula might be found on the main points of difficulty, relating to the possible transfer of nuclear weapons to an alliance. The Soviet Union did not appear to be asinterested as had been expected in the extension of the Test BanTreaty, but agreement had nearly been reached on a treaty on theuse of outer space. If, therefore, some move forward could be madeon Vietnam it was possible that this might result in a number ofhelpful international agreements in other spheres, though it wouldbe imprudent to be unduly optimistic at this stage. In particular, itwas important that we should not express such optimism in public statements.In discussions with the President and with members of theUnited States Administration it had been made clear that they were ready to end the bombing of North Vietnam if there were any reasonable chance whatsoever that this might elicit a significantresponse by the Government of. North Vietnam, leading toconsultations about ways in which the conflict could be brought toan end. The United States Administration had also shown themselves understanding of our own difficulties in bearing theforeign exchange costs of our forces in Germany at their present level, but were naturally concerned that we should not take unilateral action to reduce or weaken our forces which might further imperil the Alliance.As regards the admission of the Peopled Republic of China tothe United Nations, it appeared that opinion, both in theAdministration and publicly in the United States, was now lessfirmly resistant to admission than had hitherto been the case,particularly if such admission were accepted in a form which didnot appear too dramatic a diplomatic defeat for the United StatesGovernment.He had subsequently visited Ottawa, partly because it was important to avoid any impression that United Kingdom Ministersvisiting North America were solely concerned with the United States,and partly for discussions about the need to move the Council of
Gibraltar(previous reference-CC (66) 50thConclusions,Minute 2)Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (66) 50thConclusions,Minute 3)Nigeria(previous reference:CC (66) 50thConclusions,Minute 2)the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation from Paris, in view of theFrench withdrawal from the Organisation. Until recently bothDenmark and Canada had been opposed to the move, but both had now accepted its desirability and it appeared likely that the movewould be agreed at the next meeting of the Council in December.It had been necessary to react promptly to the action of theSpanish Government in closing the customs post at La Linea onthe Gibraltar frontier immediately before the resumption of talks between officials on the dispute about Gibraltar. He had inconsequence announced publicly the proposal, which we had hithertointended to put to the Spanish Government at a later stage in thecourse of the talks, that the dispute over the sovereignty of gibraltar should be referred to the International Court of Justice.The Spanish Government had not as yet rejected this proposal andthey had asked that the next round of talks should be in Madrid.It would be difficult to refuse this invitation since the previous fourrounds had all been in London, but it was necessary to bear in mind that the Governor of Gibraltar had expressed some concern at theeffect there if we accepted the invitation.The Commonwealth Secretary said that Sir Morrice James, a deputy Under-Secretary of State in the Commonwealth Office, whohad taken the statement of the Governmenfs terms on Rhodesia to salisbury, had had a further meeting with Mr. Smith, the leader ofthe illegal regime, the preceding day. Mr. Smith had said that hewould send a letter, probably later the following week, giving the detailed comments of the illegal regime on our proposals. It was almost certain that these would amount to a rejection.In Nigeria there was still an uneasy calm, and some public services had been resumed in the Northern Region. There had beenanxiety that the Yorubas in the West might attack Ibos, but so farthere had been no further outbreak of violence there.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary andthe Commonwealth Secretary.broadcasting and television broadcasting:Draft white paper(previous reference:CC (66) 42ndConclusions,Minute 6)secret. The Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the Postmaster-General (C(66) 141) to which was attached a draft White Paper on broadcasting Policy.The Postmaster-General recalled that, following their previous discussion of the draft White Paper, the Cabinet had asked him toconsider the possibility of establishing a new service, financed from advertising, to broadcast programmes which would meet the demandfor continuous &quot; pop &quot; music when the legislation to suppress the&quot; pirate&quot; radio stations took effect; it was also in mind that anetwork of local sound stations should also be established andfinanced on the same basis. His examination of this possibility had shown that the establishment of a new corporation to run such a
service would require legislation; that it would not be possible forany new service to broadcast continuous &quot; pop &quot; music because ofthe attitude of the Musicians&apos; Union; that the establishment of anew service would take up to two years, because of the need to legislate and the time needed to acquire sites and to build and equipnew transmitting stations; and that additional capital and operatingexpenditure together would reach a peak of some  6^- million in three years&apos; time. The new corporation would need an initial capitalloan from the Exchequer of some  5 million. Though the prospects for repayment would be uncertain, it was possible that by the fourthyear advertising income might meet the operational costs of the new service. These conclusions had been considered by a meeting of theMinisters primarily concerned under the Prime Ministerschairmanship. This meeting had concluded that a popular musicprogramme ought to be introduced to coincide with the disappearance of the &quot; pirate &quot; radio stations, even though it couldnot satisfy the demand for continuous &quot; pop &quot; music, and it wasagreed that such a programme could only be introduced in time ifit were provided by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).The meeting had, however, not been able to reach agreement on afurther proposal that a new corporation to be financed from advertising should be set up as soon as possible to take over fromthe BBC the broadcasting of the new programme and to establishalso a network of local radio stations. While there might beobjection in present economic circumstances to the additional demand on resources that would be created by the establishment ofa new broadcasting service, and while the introduction of a newoutlet for advertising might similarly be open to objection, themeeting had, on balance, favoured this proposal, and it had beenembodied in the draft White Paper now before the Cabinet.He had ascertained informally from the Chairman of the governors of the BBC that they would, with reluctance, be preparedto broadcast a music programme in the interim period while a new corporation was being established. They might, however, feel itnecessary subsequently to continue broadcasting such a programme in competition with the new corporation, and in that event mightwant to use the wavelength at present allotted to the Home service in the North-East of England, which would then have to share a programme with Northern Ireland. He had also had discussions with the Musicians&apos; Union who had objections to the introduction of advertising on sound radio. If the Cabinet approved the draft ofthe White Paper at present before them, further consultation withthe BBC and with the Musicians&apos; Union would be required.In discussion it was suggested that if, as proposed, the new corporation were allotted the present medium wavelength(247 metres) with which the BBC supplemented their long wavetransmission of the Light programme, there would be substantialareas in Wales and Scotland where this service, which includedpopular non-musical programmes, could not be received. It waspointed out, however, that reception on very high frequencies
(VHF) would be available and that manufacturers were planning tomake transistor sets with a capacity to receive on VHF, if there were a demand for it.In further discussion it was suggested that the advantage to be gained by establishing a new corporation on the lines proposed would be small in relation to the disadvantages.   Whereas the programmes which it could broadcast would not meet the demandfor continuous &quot; pop&quot; music and would only duplicate a servicethat could be provided much more cheaply by the BBC, the proposed new service would disrupt the BBCs existing services, would create an extra demand on resources, and in particular an increase inconsumer demand, that was unacceptable in present economic circumstances. The view was also expressed that the acceptance of advertising on sound broadcasting was objectionable in principle.Furthermore by depriving the Press, particularly the local Press, of advertising revenue, the financial difficulties of the newspaperindustry would be increased and a tendency to mergers andmonopoly increased.   Moreover, the solvency of the new service would be uncertain and further subsidy from the Government mightbe required.   It was pointed out that light music was already available from one or other of the BBCs existing services for by far the greater part of the day, and it was suggested that it would be preferable to defer a decision on the establishment of a new serviceuntil it was clear how far the BBC could, in fact, meet the demandfor a more popular type of music programme than was at present provided.   That demand might in any event have been over-estimated.   It was further suggested that before resources were committed to the establishment of a network of local sound stations,it would be preferable to conduct an experiment through the BBCto ascertain the demand for such a local service and the availability of local programme material.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the use of the BBCto broadcast the continuous music programme, otherwise than as an interim arrangement, and to conduct an experiment in broadcasting,could only increase the pressure on the licence fee. It was suggestedthat unless a means could be found of supplementing the licence fee as a means of financing public service broadcasting, desirabledevelopment of the latter, and even the maintenance of presentstandards, would inevitably be threatened by the difficulty ofincreasing the licence fee. It was also suggested that in particularlocal sound broadcasting ought to be developed as a means of assisting the Open University and to provide an outlet for localinitiative and talent which the BBC were unlikely to be able tofurnish. The establishment of a new corporation financed from advertising would enable the new music programme and local sound broadcasting to be introduced on a self-financing basis, and would open the way for the subsequent establishment on the same basis ofthe fourth television network. Since the new corporation, unlike theIndependent Television Authority, would be responsible itself for providing programmes, on the lines recommended by the PilkingtonCommittee for Independent Television, there would be less risk of
a lowering of the standard of programmes. It was also suggestedthat, if the new corporation achieved a surplus, it might be possibleto apply this indirectly to supplementing the revenue of the BBC,who would in practice be unlikely to reject it. It was further suggested that, because of pressure on the programme, legislation would not be possible in the current session, and that therefore thenew corporation could not begin to operate before 1970 at earliest;in consequence the extra capital and other expenditure and any^consequent additional consumer demand would not be incurredduring the present period of economic difficulty.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet were agreed that the BBC should be asked toprovide a popular music programme as soon as the legislation to suppress the &quot; pirate &quot; radio stations took effect. On the balanceof considerations the Cabinet favoured, in the longer term, the subsequent establishment of a new corporation, financed from advertising, to take over the running of the new programme fromthe BBC and to set up a network of local sound stations. the timetable for its establishment should, however, be left open and legislation would not in any event be possible in the current session.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Postmaster-General to discuss with the Chairmanof the BBC the provision of a music programme on247 metres as an interim arrangement.(2) Approved in principle the proposal to establish a newbroadcasting corporation, financed by advertising, toprovide a national popular music programme and a service of local sound broadcasting, subject to considera-tion in due course of the timetable for its introduction.The draft White paper in discussion of the draft White Paper on Broadcasting it wassuggested that the supplementary licence fee of  5 proposed forcolour television sets would, when taken together with the high initialcost or rental of the sets, unduly discourage demand and hence hinderthe development of manufacturing and export potential. On theother hand, it was pointed out that the proposed licence fee wouldbe relatively insignificant for those who could afford the high costof sets. In view of the difficulty of making any subsequent increases in the licence fee, it was important to fix the initial fee at a level which would not need to be increased for a number of years andwould, as the ownership of colour television sets spread, provide anew element of buoyancy in the BBCs licence revenue.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) While the experiment in pay television would have to beallowed to go forward, it was important to prevent a situationdeveloping in which the licensee might be able to deny the vast majority of television viewers the opportunity of viewing majorsporting events.
(b) If the BBC were to contain their costs it was important thatthere should be no general increase in broadcasting hours, but it wasin mind that an increase of an hour a day might be given to independent television.Summing up this part of the discussion the Prime Minister saidthat the Cabinet approved the draft White Paper on Broadcastingsubject to the amendments agreed at their previous discussion.Subject to his further consultations with the BBC and the Musicians&apos;Union, the Postmaster-General should arrange for its publication assoon as possible.The Cabinet (3) Approved the draft White Paper annexed to C (66) 141subject to the amendments agreed at their previous discussion.(4) Invited the Postmaster-General, in consultation with theLord President of the Council, to arrange for its early publication.CONFIDENTIALCommercialPolicy-(previous reference:CC (66) 38thConclusions)ImportArrangementsfor Apples andPears6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the President ofthe Board of Trade (C (66) 143) about the import arrangements forapples and pears.The President of the Board of Trade said that it was necessaryfor the Cabinet to resolve a difference of view which had arisen inthe Sub-Committee on External Economic Policy of the ministerial committee on Economic Development, relating to proposals forliberalising the quota arrangements for imports of apples and pears.The real protection to our industry was by quota from all sources,except the sterling area. The quota level for apples was at present15,200 tons for the period July to December and 68,750 tons for theperiod January to June. There was an annual quota for pears of28,000 tons. These restrictions, in common with similar restrictions imposed by continental countries, were contrary to our obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). TheSub-Committee had in the preceding July agreed on balance that thefollowing revised quota arrangements should be introduced as from 1st January, 1967:(a) An apple quota of 37,000 tons for the months of january and February.(b) Thereafter a quota-free period for both apples and pearscovering the months from March to July inclusive.(c) The present six-monthly apple quota of 15,200 tons to applyto the five months from August to December inclusive.(d) The present annual pear quota of 28,000 tons to apply tothe seven months from August to February inclusive.
These arrangements were, however, subject to consultations withthe Australian and New Zealand Governments. In addition theCanadian Government and the National Farmers&apos; Union (NFU)had also been consulted. The oversea Governments were stronglycritical of the proposals, while the NFU challenged them as contraryto the import saving role allotted to the home industry under theNational Economic Plan and argued that the new proposals would lead to heavy imports from Europe and low prices for the home producer at the beginning and end of the home marketing season.In further discussion in the Sub-Committee, the Minister ofAgriculture, with the support of the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State, Commonwealth Office, had argued that the proposals shouldnot be pursued at the present time, that the action was untimelyand that we should instead concentrate on seeking an agreement onliberalisation in the negotiations in the Kennedy Round. other ministers, however, favoured maintaining the view previously takenby the Committee. The reactions of those consulted were in their view on the lines that had been expected and no new factors had emerged. We must have regard primarily to the effect of themeasures on our balance of payments and while these could not be precisely quantified it was thought possible that the introduction ofthe revised arrangements might produce import savings of from 200,000 to  500,000, since it was expected that the increase in imports would be more than offset by the fall in price. The effectof the existing quotas was to maintain prices of apples and pears and hence of other fruit at artificially high levels and the change would therefore be advantageous to the home consumer, while the interestsof home growers would not be significantly prejudiced becausequotas would remain for the period of the home marketing season.Nor were apples and pears likely to figure appreciably in the kennedy Round negotiations and we could not, in any event, expect to obtain substantial concessions in return for liberalising restrictions which were contrary to our obligations under the GATT. We should therefore announce in the course of the next week or so that revisedquotas would be introduced from 1st January on the lines originally proposed.The Minister of Agriculture said that he was not opposed to theliberalisation of the quotas at a later stage, but we should firstascertain whether we could obtain concessions in the kennedy round for doing so. Moreover, the revised quotas would seriouslydamage the interests of home growers and would adversely affect oursuppliers in Australia and New Zealand. It was doubtful if theywould result in any substantial benefit to the balance of payments and would hence be contrary to our need to reduce imports, while they would expose us to dumping from France and Italy, wheresurpluses had been built up in the past few years as a result of newplantings encouraged for political reasons. Exploratory discussions on the United Kingdom proposals had already begun in Geneva andwe should not jeopardise the prospect of a settlement on such a basisby taking unilateral action now.
12CONFIDENTIALIn discussion doubt was expressed on the likelihood that theproposed liberalisation of quotas would result in such a reduction in price as to offset the increase in imports and hence whether therewould be any benefit to our balance of payments. It was also thegeneral view that it would be preferable first to ascertain whether any concessions could be obtained in the course of the negotiations on the Kennedy Round in return for the liberalisation of quotaswhich was contemplated.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no change should be made in the existing arrangements for quotas for apples and pears for thecoming year.(2) Agreed to consider the matter further at a later date in thelight of progress in negotiations in Geneva on the kennedy Round.AircraftIndustryFuture ofAirframeIndustry(previous reference:CC (66) 41stConclusions,Minute 6)theCONFIDENTIAL7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Education and Science (C (66) 142) on the future of the airframe industry.The Secretary of State for Education and Science recalled thatat their meeting on 2nd August the Cabinet had approved theappointment of a Sub-Committee to consider and make recommendations on the future of the airframe industry, andspecifically of the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) and hawker siddeley Aviation Limited (HSA), the two main companies in theindustry. The Sub-Committee had now considered this matter.Most members considered that nothing was likely to be gained bypostponing a decision on the future of the airframe industry andthat, in view of the delay since the publication of the PlowdenReport on the Aircraft Industry (Cmnd. 2853), it was desirable toreach a decision as soon as possible in order to end uncertainty inthe industry. There was general agreement that the Governmentcould not leave the present position unchanged. The suggestion inthe Plowden Report that the Government should take a majorityholding in the two companies was impracticable, because it wouldnot be accepted by the companies. There was thus a clear choice between two courses of action:1. To take over the whole of the equity of BAC, and thenmerge BAC and HSA in a new company in which the former BACequity would represent a substantial minority shareholding for theGovernment, or . To take both companies into 100 per cent public ownership,bringing them as separate companies under a new public corporation, which would also take over responsibility for otherairframe interests in public ownership and would be charged withthe duty of rationalising the industry.The Sub-Committee had been unable to agree upon a recommenda-tion on the choice between these two courses.
The case for a solution through a minority shareholding solutionrested on the argument that the essential objectives could be more easily achieved by this course:(i) It would give the best prospect of keeping in the industry a. management which would effectively carry through the rationalisation and merger that were agreed to bedesirable. It was difficult to see why design staff in BACshould object so strongly to such a solution as to prefer to leave the industry rather than to continue on this basis.(ii) Combined with the Governments position as a majorpurchaser and source of funds, it would give theGovernment a sufficient measure of influence in the affairs of the industry, while preserving an element ofcommercial discipline and expertise in the management.(iii) It was likely to lead to rather less political difficulty than100 per cent nationalisation.&apos; (i(iv) It would be substantially cheaper for the Exchequer.(v) It would avoid saddling the Government with entireresponsibility for an industry that was about to enter intoa phase of contraction.(vi) To take a minority shareholding at this stage would not preclude taking the industry into full public ownershipat a later stage, if it later proved necessary or desirableto do so.(vii) Full nationalisation now could not however well be reversed later.These arguments suggested that a minority shareholding would bethe preferable solution.The Minister of Aviation said that he saw the attraction in theproposal for a minority shareholding, which had indeed been thebasis of a plan which he had earlier discussed with representativesof the industry. Either of the two solutions before the Cabinet could probably be negotiated with the industry, though it would become more difficult to reach an agreed conclusion if a number of projects for new aircraft were cancelled. While it could not be taken for granted that the present Hawker Siddeley management would be wholly unavailable to a public corporation, it was probable that theywould not, and it might admittedly not be easy to find a sufficientlygood management for the industry, if it were brought wholly under public ownership. The objections to taking over a contractingindustry also had force. None the less the balance of advantage wasin his view in favour of taking both companies wholly into public ownership:(viii) There would, be powerful objections to the deliberatecreation of a monopoly under the predominant control ofprivate enterprise in an industry so heavily dependent on government money.
(ix) It would be difficult to justify taking BAC into public ownership and then merging it into a new privateenterprise company, the majority shareholding in whichwould be privately held.(x) Only 100 per cent nationalisation would make it possibleto achieve the reduction of detailed financial andtechnical control of projects by the Government, whichhad been one of the main objectives of the plowden committee&apos;s recommendations and should make possibleconsiderable reductions in the staff of his Department.(xi) It would remove the risk of public concern at the possibilityof private firms making excessive profits out of public money.(xii) Because the Government were so deeply involved in the affairs of the industry as the major purchaser and source of funds, the Government would in any event be held responsible for the difficult decisions which rationalisationand contraction would entail.In discussion it was suggested that there would be some advantage in deferring a decision on the following grounds:(a) Uncertainties about a number of projects (for instance, theP-1127 and the Anglo-French Variable Geometry aircraft) meant that the outlook for the industry was at present uncertain. while a decision on the structure of the industry could not be deferredindefinitely, there might be advantage in awaiting the resolution ofsome of the existing uncertainties.(b) Before a decision was taken, it might be desirable toconsider further how best to ensure a maximum return on the moneyput into the industry by the Government. Further consideration might also need to be given to the position of Rolls-Royce limited and the effect upon them of whatever was proposed for the futureof the airframe industry, though it could be argued that Rolls-Roycewould be more greatly affected by the programme of the industry than by the form of its ownership.It proved, however, to be the general view that on balance,despite these difficulties, a decision could not be further delayedwithout damage to the future of the industry. In discussion of theform of the solution it was suggested that the industry were likely in future to look to the Government for the whole of the financerequired for development not only of military projects but also ofall major civil projects. The Governments stake in the indusrty was very large: Government expenditure in the industry every yearamounted to more than three times the total value of the equity ofthe two companies. In these circumstances the retention of amajority shareholding&apos; by private enterprise was unlikely in practice to ensure effectively the retention of commercial disciplines. It wasagreed that the Government would probably need to supplement a minority shareholding with reserve powers on certain matters, suchas the appointment of the chairman, the disposal of major assets and proposals to increase the capital, and reserve powers of this kindmight well be little less objectionable to the majority of the
CC 51 (66)shareholders than a majority Government shareholding. The best course might well, therefore, be to take both companies wholly into public ownership.On the other hand it was argued that the considerations of management should be decisive. There was general agreement thatit would be desirable to retain the Hawker Siddeley management incharge of the industry, but it seemed certain that there was no prospect of retaining that management for a publicly owned industry.It might well be that the Government would in any event carry alarge measure of responsibility for the affairs of the industry, but100 per cent nationalisation would not make it any easier for theGovernment to carry that responsibility; indeed it would add to theproblems with which the Government would have to deal, and theprospect of taking over an industry which was bound to contractover the next few years was an unattractive one. On broadergrounds it was the predominant view that the objections to 100 percent nationalisation developed by the Secretary of State for education and Science outweighed the advantages.The following points were also made:(c) If the industry were taken into public ownership, it might be preferable to set up a new authority on the lines of the UnitedKingdom Atomic Energy Authority, rather than to follow the pattern of the other nationalised industries.id) It was highly questionable whether 100 per cent nationalisa-tion would make it possible to reduce substantially the requirements for detailed governmental financial and technical control of aircraft projects, in view of the inevitable differences of interest between apublic corporation and the Government.(e) It was possible that, if the Government decided in favourof the minority shareholding solution, Hawker Siddeley would beprepared themselves to make an offer to acquire BAC, on the basisof an understanding that the Government would later purchase a minority shareholding in the combined HSA-BAC. BAC might,however, be reluctant to negotiate with Hawker Siddeley on such aproposition.(/) It was not clear whether it would be possible under existing statutory powers for the Government to acquire the equity of BACor a share in the equity of a new company combining the assets ofBAC and HSA. The Minister of Aviation was precluded by statutefrom holding shares in a company making aircraft. It was, however,possible that the President of the Board of Trade might haveappropriate powers. 100 per cent nationalisation would in any caserequire new legislation; if it were decided to seek a solution through a minority shareholding, the Minister of Aviation should consider, inconsultation with the President of the Board of Trade and the LawOfficers, whether it was possible for the Government to acquireBAC, or a minority shareholding in a new company, within existing statutory powers, and, if not, what legislative provisions would berequired to enable them to do so. A place had been reserved in thelegislative programme for legislation on the aircraft industry, whichwould in any event be required for the acquisition of BeagleAircraft Co. Ltd. It would be desirable, if possible, to avoid further
legislation for the acquisition of BAC, or of a minority shareholdingin a new company; if such legislation proved inescapable, it wouldbe desirable to make the provisions as brief as possible.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of view in the Cabinet was in favour of reaching a decisionon the future of the airframe industry without further delay, andof adopting a solution whereby the Government would hold a minority shareholding, in partnership with the Hawker Siddeleygroup, in a new company combining the assets of the existing HSAand BAC and under the direction of the existing Hawker Siddeleymanagement. Further consideration should be given to whether this result could best be achieved by the Government taking over BACand then merging their holding of BAC into a new company withHSA, or by allowing Hawker Siddeley to acquire BAC and thennegotiating with Hawker Siddeley on the formation of a new mergedcompany with a minority Government shareholding. The need for legislation and the form it should take called for further examination.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that Government policy for the airframe industry should be to bring into being a new company, comprising the assets of the British Aircraft Corporation and hawker siddeley Aviation Limited, in which the Hawker Siddeleygroup would hold a majority and the Government asubstantial minority of the equity.(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation, in consultation with thePresident of the Board of Trade and the Law Officers, toconsider, on the lines suggested in discussion, whether theGovernment could acquire the equity of the british aircraft Corporation, or a minority shareholding in theproposed new company, within existing statutory powers;and, if not, what legislative provision would be requiredto enable them to do so.(3) Invited the Minister of Aviation to consider, in the light ofthese consultations and after discussion with other ministers concerned, whether the Government should seek to acquire the British Aircraft Corporation as a preliminary to the proposed merger with hawker siddeley Aviation Limited, or whether Hawker Siddeleyshould be encouraged themselves to acquire the british aircraft Corporation, on the understanding that theGovernment would in due course take a substantialminority shareholding in a new company combining theBritish Aircraft Corporation and Hawker SiddeleyAviation Limited.(4) Invited the Minister of Aviation to bring before the ministerial Committee on Economic Development, any matters arising in the course of the consultations andconsiderations under Conclusions (2) and (3) above which required collective consideration by Ministers before he informed leading representatives of the industry in confidence of the Governmenfs decision and embarkedupon negotiations to put it into effect.
