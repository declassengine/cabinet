GeneralElectionProcedure1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that, inaccordance with precedent, an Election Business Committee wouldbe appointed to supervise the work of advising Governmentcandidates about the replies which they should return toquestionnaires and other enquiries put to them during the campaign.A memorandum defining the composition and functions of thisCommittee would shortly be circulated. It should be noted that thepurpose of the Committee was primarily to provide or verify factual information and that, as regards enquiries from or on behalf ofLabour Party candidates, its role in relation to issues of LabourParty policy should be confined to checking guidance provided in thefirst instance by Party Headquarters.Instructions would also be issued on the use of official transport and the granting of Press interviews by Ministers during the Election.Broadcasting arrangements would be based on an agreement recently concluded between the political Parties and the broadcasting authorities, whereby proposals for broadcasts by Parliamentarycandidates would be channelled through national and regional PartyHeadquarters.In view of the many demands on the short amount ofParliamentary time which would now be available it would bedesirable to reduce as far as possible the number of Ministerialstatements in Parliament which were at present envisaged. On thesame basis there should be little scope for the publication of furtherWhite Papers. In addition it would be necessary to give urgent consideration to the text of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the prorogation of Parliament, which would be delivered on the morning of10th March.  The Dissolution would follow later on the same day.The Cabinet (1) Took note of these statements by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Lord President to arrange to review, and toreduce as far as possible, the number of Ministerialstatements to be made during the remainder of the present parliament.(3) Invited the Lord President to arrange for a draft of the queen&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament to beprepared as a matter of urgency, for consideration by theCabinet at a meeting in the near future.broadcasting and television broadcasting:Draft white paper(previous reference:CC (66) 11thConclusions,Minute 4)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Postmaster-General (C (66) 42) to which was attached a draft White Paper on broadcasting.The Postmaster-General said that the draft of the White paper had been revised in the light of the Cabinefs previous discussion andof the Prime Ministers discussion with the British broadcasting corporation (BBC). The draft now before them contained, inaddition to his earlier proposals for colour television, extended hours
of broadcasting, local sound radio, a National BroadcastingCommission and more intensive measures against licence evasion,new proposals for financing the BBC and for the establishment of anational music network to replace the BBCs Light Programme. it also proposed that the University of the Air should be established onBBC-2 and that there should be no allocation of the fourth televisionchannel for the time being. It was desirable that an early announcement should be made of the Governmenfs policy on broadcasting, since the present uncertainty was giving rise todamaging speculation; but, in accordance with the views expressedunder Item 1, it might be preferable to dispense with a White paper and to indicate the Governmenfs intentions by means of an early statement in Parliament.The Prime Minister said that he had now received from the vice--Chairman of the BBC (Lord Fulton) a statement of the BBCspreliminary views on the suggestions which he had discussed with lord Fulton and the Director-General of the BBC (Sir Hugh Greene).Briefly, by restricting certain activities which the BBC considered desirable though not essential, and by the strictest economy, the BBCthought that they could maintain their services until 1968 on therevenue produced by the present  5 licence fee, provided that therewas legislation on the lines proposed by the Postmaster-General toreduce licence evasion and that steps were taken to prevent theindependent programme companies from taking advantage (forexample through an extension of hours of broadcasting or additional programme expenditure) of the limitations which economy would impose on the BBC. On this basis the BBC thought that an increasein the licence fee to  6 in 1968 would be sufficient until the mid-1970s. While this statement was encouraging, it raised certain important issues of policy which would need to be further exploredwith the BBC, and in the meantime it might not be possible to reach conclusions on the proposals in the draft White Paper.In discussion there was general agreement that the statement ofthe BBCs views appeared to offer a promising basis for further negotiation, but since the statement represented a considerable changeof attitude its implications would need to be fully considered before decisions could be announced. Moreover, some of the proposals inthe draft White Paper were not urgent and would not be welcome tothe BBC, and their publication at this stage might prejudicenegotiation on the main issue of finance. On the other hand, it waspossible that the Government would be questioned on particularissues, and, while it might not be appropriate to volunteer astatement, the Postmaster-General should be in a position to dealwith any questions which might arise.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) The BBCs statement in response to the Prime Minister^enquiries might, on further examination in the light of discussion withthe BBC, enable an early indication to be given that no increase inthe licence fee would be needed before 1968.
(b) While it would be desirable to announce an early decisionto introduce colour television in order to enable our manufacturers to establish themselves in this market, it was necessary to weighagainst this advantage the substantial diversion of resources whichwould result and the extent to which it might initially be necessaryto import components from the United States. Moreover, it was still possible that a more satisfactory system of transmission wouldbe devised; and it was open to doubt whether the BBCs estimate ofthe cost to them of introducing colour television was correct. before reaching a decision it was desirable to consider further both the costto the BBC and the priority which it would be appropriate to give to colour television in relation to other demands on the country&apos;resources.(c) There appeared to be little public interest in the establishmentof local community stations, and the suggestion that they should be financed in part from advertising might be open to objection. Itwould be desirable to consider further how the local broadcasting authorities were to be composed and in particular what part localauthorities were to play in them.(d) Even if local broadcasting authorities were not established in the near future, there would be some advantage in setting up aNational Broadcasting Commission; but this would not be welcome to the BBC and it would be preferable not to announce a decisionon it at present.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that the BBCs recent letter, which he would circulate to the Cabinet, seemed to offer a new basis for negotiationon finance, but that it would need to be more fully examined withthe BBC before conclusions could be reached. An early announce-ment might have to be made, however, and the Postmaster-general should therefore prepare, in the light of their discussion and of an examination of the BBCs letter, a draft of what might be said on broadcasting policy either by way of a statement or in answer to questions. Before the Cabinet reached a conclusion on colour television, the technical, financial and economic considerations should be further evaluated, and the First Secretary should arrange,in consultation with the Ministers principally concerned, for a factualmemorandum to be prepared. However, the Cabinet considered thatit would be preferable to avoid for the time being any announcement on the fourth network or on local community stations.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would circulate to theCabinet the BBCs reply to his enquiries.(2) Invited the Postmaster-General to consider, in the light oftheir discussion and of the letter from the BBC to thePrime Minister, what might be said on the subject of broadcasting policy, either by way of a statement or in
answer to questions, and to circulate a memorandum forconsideration at an early meeting.(3) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with thePresident of the Board of Trade, the Minister of technology and the Postmaster-General, to circulate amemorandum on the technical, financial and economic considerations involved in proceeding with colour television.(4) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.Social Services(previous reference:CC (65) 70thConclusions,Minute 2)Ministryof social security:Draft WhitePaper3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister ofPensions and National Insurance (C (66) 44), to which was attached the draft of a White Paper on the Ministry of Social Security.The Prime Minister said that it might be appropriate to make public the substance of the draft White Paper on the Ministry of social Security by means of a brief statement in the House ofCommons, followed by a Press Conference for which a somewhatfuller explanatory document might be provided.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance said that she had hoped that it might be possible to publish a White Paper inthis instance because her proposals would not represent a new initiative, but rather the development of a theme which had alreadybeen introduced in a party political broadcast and in a speech bythe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in the Debate on the welfare State on 23rd February, in which he had promised that afurther statement would be made. Some fuller statement of theGovernments intentions was necessary to forestall possible criticism that they had failed to deal with the problems which they had originally hoped to solve by the introduction of the income guarantee, but, if a White Paper were thought inappropriate, astatement in the House of Commons would serve this purpose.In discussion it was agreed that publicity should be given to thesubstance of the proposed White Paper by means of a statement inthe House of Commons followed by a Press Conference.The Cabinet then considered the content of the proposed statement.  The following principal points were made:(a) At the previous discussion it had been agreed that it wouldbe necessary to associate with the announcement of the changes in national assistance a statement about the consequential proposal to limit the next general increase of benefits. This would not now be appropriate, but it would be the more important that the changes should be announced in general terms which would not allow themto be costed, and it was also necessary to avoid drawing attention tothe question whether the non-contributory benefits would be liable to taxation. In certain circumstances a person with substantialdisregards who received the new allowance and a high rent allowancemight have an income above the taxable level, and this problem
would have to be considered. It would be inequitable thatpensioners who had not contributed to their pension should be free of tax, whereas those who had contributed were not, and it waspossible that the level of income tax exemption was too low. Forthe purpose of an immediate statement, however, it was important not to give such detail about the proposed new disregards as to draw attention to the taxation point. The Board of Inland Revenue had also suggested that it might be desirable to avoid calling the newpayment a pension, since normally pensions were liable to tax. Itwas pointed out, on the other hand, that it was desirable in referring to disregards to make it clear that the injustices which at presentdisturbed public opinion would be removed, in particular theinflexible operation of the upper limit for disregards and the distinction between war savings and other forms of saving. Subjectto this, the purpose of the statement should be to indicate that thenew form of assistance would be set in a different context from theold rather than to create any expectation that the amounts would beincreased, and for this purpose the reference to disregards could bein general terms.(b) The reference in paragraph 12 of the draft White Paper to the help which old people needed to obtain from the health and welfare services had been deliberately drafted in somewhat vague termsbecause the means of detecting needs of this kind were underconsideration by the Ministerial Committee on the Social Services,and it would not be possible for decisions to be taken in the nearfuture.(c) References in paragraphs 12 and 13 to cash grants and toparallels with national assistance might suggest that the proposed changes were changes of name rather than of substance. these terms should therefore be avoided and it should be made clear in what way the proposed new Commission would differ from theNational Assistance Board. The last sentence of paragraph 13 might with advantage be omitted, or redrafted.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theMinister of Pensions and National Insurance should recast in thelight of the discussion the draft White Paper in the form of astatement to be made in the House of Commons. She should consult the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the references todisregards at present in paragraph 12, and submit a new draft to theCabinet for consideration at their next meeting.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Pensions and National insurance to recast the draft White Paper annexed to C (66) 44 on thelines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up oftheir discussion, and to submit a new draft for consideration at their next meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,1st March, 1966.
