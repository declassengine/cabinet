CC 65 (66)confidential parliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. Parliament wouldadjourn on Wednesday, 21st December and reassemble on Tuesday,17th January.Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (66) 64thConclusions,Minute 1)secret. The Cabinet considered the action which the Governmentshould take if the illegal regime in Rhodesia were to indicate thatthey would accept the proposal which had been put forward by theOpposition in the House of Commons for the immediate appointmentof a Royal Commission to test public opinion in Rhodesia on the acceptability of the proposed new constitution. The proposalcontemplated that the Royal Commission would conduct its workwhile the illegal regime continued in power and maintained theirso-called independence. It was the general view of the Cabinet thata Commission in such circumstances would not be capable of carryingout any fair or adequate test of public opinion in Rhodesia even ifcensorship were to be lifted and political detainees released. Thiswas primarily because it would appear, at least to the Africans of rhodesia, that the choice before them was either acceptance of theproposed new constitution or the continuance of the illegal regimeas it was at present constituted. Furthermore, many who might be opposed to the new constitution would, because of the prospect thatthe illegal regime would continue in power, not feel free to speakagainst it lest they might subsequently be victimised, or even put in detention. In any event, the proposal put forward by the Oppositiondid not indicate what attitude either they or the illegal regime wouldtake if the Royal Commission, despite the difficulties of operating insuch conditions, should come to the view that the proposed newconstitution was not acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole.For these reasons the proposal, even if the illegal regime purported to accept it, could not be accepted by the Government.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would be guided by thepoints raised in discussion in the continuance of the debate on Rhodesia that afternoon in the House of Commons.In further discussion reference was made to the speech to bemade later that day by the Foreign Secretary at the Security Councilof the United Nations on mandatory sanctions relating to oil. Therewas general agreement that on the question of enforcement action itwould be important that the speech should follow closely the line which had been taken by the Prime Minister in his statement in theHouse of Commons on Monday, 5th December and that the textshould be agreed between Ministers primarily concerned.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to consider,in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer anc
the Commonwealth Secretary and in the light of thediscussion, the text of the telegram to be sent to theForeign Secretary regarding the wording of his statement in the Security Council on enforcement action againstSouth Africa in respect of mandatory sanctions.OverseaAffairsGermany(previous reference:CC(66) 61stConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that it wouldbe necessary to make an early public statement of the Governmenfsacceptance of the offer made by the President of the United states for a United States payment to us of $35 million during 1967,provided that the United Kingdom for her part did not disrupt the tripartite talks with the United States and Germany by withdrawingforces, or reducing their combat capability by making savings in theirlogistic support, before the end of June 1967. Meanwhile, the tripartite talks had resulted in a report to the North Atlantic treaty organisation on the extent of the indications which the alliancemight expect to receive of any attack by the Soviet Union, but therewas as yet an unbridgeable gap between the position of the UnitedKingdom on the one hand, and the United States and federal german Governments on the other, on the level of forces whichshould be maintained by the alliance in Europe. This might be partly due to the fact that neither the United States nor Germanrepresentatives were in a position to commit their Governments, thelatter because a new Federal Government was in process offormation. It was possible that better progress might be achievedtowards reaching agreement early in the new year.In discussion it was suggested that there might be objection toa public statement regarding the United States offer of $35 million on the ground that this might indicate that for the first time theUnited Kingdom was accepting a subvention which imposedrestrictions upon her foreign policy. It was, however, the general view that a statement could not in any event be avoided, since thepayment would inevitably become known. Moreover, it would otherwise be embarrassing to explain the delay in the withdrawal ofour forces in order to reduce our foreign exchange costs in Germany:the United States offer could thus properly be presented asconsistent with the line that the Government had taken throughoutthat our forces would not be withdrawn provided that our foreign exchange costs were met in one way or another.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Defence, to consider further in thelight of the discussion the terms of the statement whichshould be made before the end of the year about theacceptance of the United States offer of $35 million related to the maintenance of our forces in Germany at theirpresent level up to the end of June 1967.
broadcasting and TelevisionBroadcastingDraft white paper(previous reference:CC(66) 51stConclusions,Minute 5)cc 65 (66)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Postmaster-General (C(66) 177), to which was annexed a draft White Paper on broadcasting Policy.The Postmaster-General recalled that the Cabinet had agreed at a previous meeting that the White Paper should propose the setting up of a new Corporation, which should be financed from advertising revenue and which would take over the mediumwavelength on which the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)broadcast its Light programme. The new Corporation would alsobe responsible for establishing a network of local broadcasting stations. Since it would take about two years to establish the new corporation, the BBC would, in the meantime, be asked under theseproposals to broadcast a continuous programme of popular musicon the Light programme medium wavelength; the introduction ofthis new programme would coincide with the suppression of the&quot; pirate &quot; stations, under the legislation at present awaiting a SecondReading. The Cabinet had invited him to consult with the BBCand the Musicians&apos; Union before publishing his White Paper.From these consultations, however, it had become clear that theMusicians&apos; Union would refuse to co-operate, not only with any new service which was financed from advertising, but also with the BBCin providing the interim music programme, if it were theGovernments declared intention to hand it over later to the new service financed by advertising. Doubt would thus be cast on the credibility of the Governments two main proposals. While it waspossible that the Union&apos;s objection might be overcome in the longer term, it was clear that it would not in these circumstances be possiblefor the BBC to introduce a continuous popular music programme inthe meantime. The need to provide an alternative to the programmes by the &quot; pirate &quot; stations was paramount, and this needcould only be met by authorising the BBC to provide the proposedmusic programme on a long-term basis and abandoning the proposalto establish a new service financed from advertising. The BBCwould now propose to remodel the Light programme in order toinclude, not only more music, but music of a more popular type.He also proposed that the BBC should conduct an experiment in, local sound broadcasting by nine stations to establish not onlythe need for such a service but also the availability of localprogramme material and the possibility of procuring sufficient financefrom local sources other than advertising. The proposed stations would be sufficiently widely spread to enable general conclusions tobe drawn from the experiment. They would broadcast for some18 hours a day, including perhaps six hours&apos; broadcasting of localmaterial. He would propose to set up a local broadcasting council for each station, which would play a formative part in thedevelopment of programme policy and content. While the BBCwould seek to provide services for local bodies, such as the local
authority, local universities, chambers of trade, arts associations andchurches and to obtain payments for them, it would be made clearthat there should be no direct subvention from the rates. The white paper would also make it clear that there was no permanentcommitment to the BBC, or indeed to any particular form of constitution and finance, if a permanent service were eventually tobe authorised.In discussion it was suggested that the proposal to leavethe popular music programme with the BBC, instead of transferringit later to a new Corporation to be financed from advertising, would expose the Government to criticism for giving way to the Union.Further, the introduction of advertising would provide a means of developing broadcasting and television in the future to an extent which would not be possible within the limitations of finance bylicensing, and this advantage would be forgone. For these reasons it would be better to face the issue of advertising with the Union nowrather than later and to maintain the earlier proposals approved bythe Cabinet.On the other hand, there was general recognition that, if theWhite Paper were to adhere to the proposals previously agreed, theopposition of the Union was likely to make it impossible for the bbc to introduce the popular music programme when it was needed.While the view was expressed that the introduction of finance byadvertising would lead to a lowering of the standards of radiobroadcasting, it would be important that, even if the proposal toestablish a service financed by advertising were abandoned, at least for the time being, the White Paper should contain no indication thatfinance by advertising had been rejected in principle.In further discussion of the proposal that the BBC should conduct an experiment in local sound broadcasting, doubt was expressed whether local finance was likely to be forthcoming on thescale required, and it was suggested that it might in practice bedifficult, if the experiment were otherwise successful, to removecontrol from the BBC and to avoid finance by licensing. It waspointed out that the Government were currently asking localauthorities for drastic reductions in their expenditure and that itwould be inconsistent at the same time to suggest new forms ofexpenditure for local radio services. It was further suggested thatthere was already adequate domestic radio coverage and that theproposals to increase those services at the present time would beinopportune. ,On the other hand, it was pointed out that local stations couldmeet local needs for which the present regional services could notcater. Consultation with local authorities had shown that a numberof large towns favoured the establishment of local stations, and therewas at least a possibility, which ought to be explored by experiment,that strongly based local systems might develop to the general benefitof the community as in the United States. The cost of the experimentwould be no more than  50,000 a year per station and any extra expenditure by local authorities in respect of radio publicity services
aircraft industry(previous reference:CC(66) 59thConclusions,Minute 3)BeagleAircraftCompany5. The First Secretary of State said that at a meeting theprevious day of the Ministerial Committee on Economic Develop-ment most of the members had taken the view that the Governmentshould not proceed with the acquisition of the Beagle AircraftCompany, contrary to the decision reached by the Government inthe previous July.That decision had been taken on the basis that the cost of purchase would be about  1^ million and that a further  2-4 million would have to be provided by the Government to offset losses whichthe Company was expected to incur up to 1970-71.  Following thewere likely to be matched by reductions in expenditure on other forms of publicity. It would be difficult to conduct an experimentwith fewer than the nine stations proposed, if reliable conclusions were to be drawn. The number could, however, be increased if anytown later put forward proposals with an adequate assurance offinancial support.1&quot; ...... ........ ^      .The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on a balance of considerations the Cabinet agreed that the White paper on Broadcasting Policy should not propose the establishment of anew Corporation, financed by advertising, to take over from the BBCthe proposed popular music programme which they would beauthorised to broadcast on their Light programme medium wave-length. The Cabinet were also agreed that on balance it would beworthwhile instituting an experiment in local sound broadcasting, tobe run by the BBC, involving perhaps nine stations. One purposeof the experiment would be to ascertain the extent to which local stations could be supported from local sources of finance, but itwould be important that the White Paper should not, in referring to finance from local authority sources, appear to conflict with thepresent restrictions on local authority expenditure, and the timing ofits publication would require careful consideration from that pointof view. The White Paper should also avoid any indication thatadvertising had been rejected in principle as a source of finance.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Postmaster-General, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Education and Science and theMinister of Housing and Local Government, to considerthe wording of paragraph 41 of the draft White Paper inaccordance with the summing up of their discussion bythe Prime Minister.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1), approved the White Paperannexed to C (66) 177 and invited the Postmaster-General,in consultation with the Lord President of the Council, toarrange for its early publication.
decision in July, a price of  1-45 million had subsequently been negotiated but the agreement had not yet been signed on behalf ofthe Government. From further subsequent investigation of theCompany&apos;s prospects it had emerged that the expected losses up to1970-71 would be  3-1 million as compared with the original estimate of  2^- million. The return on the investment, calculatedover a period of 13 years, was now estimated at only 3 per cent asagainst the estimate in July of 6-2 per cent. It would probably bepossible in the light of the deterioration in the Company&apos;s prospectsto renegotiate the purchase price at a lower figure of perhaps 1 million, but even so the return on the investment would be only4 per cent.In the discussion at the Ministerial Committee, some ministers had favoured completing the acquisition on the grounds that theGovernment were justified in taking some risk in view of theCompany&apos;s export potential; but the evidence on this was in his viewdoubtful. Most members of the Committee held that theGovernment would not be justified in going ahead in view of thelower expected return on capital. It was widely felt that if thepresent estimates of future prospects had been before Ministers inJuly the decision to acquire the Company would not have been taken.Moreover even the revised estimates might prove to be overoptimistic. It would be disastrous to go ahead unless more efficient management of the Company could be secured, but experience withother publicly controlled firms was not encouraging in this respect.Other aircraft companies, notably Handley Page Limited and theGeneral Dynamics Corporation of the United States, had investigatedthe position of the Company but had not been interested inacquiring it. For these reasons, most members of the Committee feltthat the necessary expenditure could be more profitably devoted toother uses. A decision was urgently required, both because theCompany were holding their Annual General Meeting the following week and because the Government were at present financing theCompany at a cost of some  50,000 a week.The Minister of Aviation said that the easiest course would beto proceed with acquisition, since the Government had already spentsome  700,000 in covering the Company&apos;s operating losses. But even before the revised estimates of future prospects had been obtained,the advantages of the project had been marginal from the government&apos;s point of view. The Company would have to exportthe major proportion of its output and this would be difficult sincethe main market was in the United States where the competition in light aircraft was severe. If there could be an assurance that thecost to the Exchequer would be limited to the present estimatedlosses, it might be justifiable to go ahead; but once the Governmenthad acquired the Company it would be difficult to dispose of it, evenif there were continuing heavy losses.In discussion it was argued that the export prospects of theCompany were not sufficient to justify acquisition by theGovernment.   It was doubtful if the Company would succeed in
breaking into the American market where home manufacturers wereproducing aircraft of better quality at prices comparable with thoseof Beagle aircraft. It would be difficult for a small firm to develop the necessary marketing and after-sales organisation which was essential for the export trade. There were doubts about the technicalquality of Beagle aircraft and there was no assurance that it wouldbe possible to secure efficient management.On the other hand it was argued that the increase of some 700,000 in the total of losses expected up to 1970-71 was not asufficient ground for reversing the decision taken in July. This might in any case be partly offset by a lower purchase price. No newinformation had since emerged to suggest that the Company&apos;s exportprospects would be worse than they were then thought to be. TheCompany&apos;s products had been among the most successful of our aircraft exports. Its export earnings in 1966 amounted to  2 million;a total of 387 aircraft had been sold abroad and 49 export orders were now in hand. The low return on the investment could beregarded as an export subsidy of a kind which would not infringeour international obligations. The United Kingdom should be ableto compete in light aircraft better than in heavy aircraft whereresearch and development formed a much larger element in costs. Itshould be possible to secure efficient management, bearing in mind that there would be less need for technical expertise than in themanufacture of heavy aircraft. If the Government now decided towithdraw, they would be criticised for vacillation and would incuroutright losses probably in excess of  1 million.In further discussion it was suggested that, if the government decided to proceed with acquisition, the assistance of the industrial reorganisation Corporation should be sought in securing efficient management. The Corporation might consider the possibility ofmerging Beagle with another aircraft company, though it was arguable on the basis of United States experience that themanufacture of light aircraft was more economically carried out bya specialist firm.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed on balance that the Government should proceedwith the acquisition of the Beagle Aircraft Company. The Ministerof Aviation should make an announcement accordingly and should pursue the necessary negotiations. In doing so he should seek agreement to a very substantially lower purchase price, in view ofthe present commercial prospects of the Company. The assistanceof the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation should be sought forthe purpose of securing efficient management for the Company,whether through merger with another company or by other means.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Government should proceed with theacquisition of the Beagle Aircraft Company.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th December, 1966.(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation to make an announcementaccordingly and to proceed with the necessary negotiations on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up of their discussion.(3) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theMinister of Aviation, to seek the assistance of theIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation in securing the efficient management of the Company, whether throughmerger with another company or by other means.
