CC 34 (66)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.secret. The Prime Minister said that little progress had been madein the informal talks between United Kingdom and Rhodesianofficials. The Rhodesians had been less forthcoming than in theearlier talks in London and we had consequently considered itdesirable to have a pause, during which time it was hoped that the continuing pressure of economic sanctions would induce a change of attitude on the part of the illegal regime. The action which weshould take in the next phase was being considered by the ministerial Committee concerned.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that hewas concerned at the views expressed in the Foreign Secretary&apos;sguidance telegram to oversea missions (No. 188 of 29th June) on ourrelations with Europe. These views did not appear to accord withthose which had been taken by the Cabinet.In discussion it was maintained that the telegram in question was in fact in full accord with the views publicly expressed by ministers on the basis of the policy approved by the Cabinet. In thecourse of discussions earlier that day with the French PrimeMinister, M. Pompidou, the Governments position had been fullyreserved in accordance with that policy. Detailed studies of the issues which would arise if the United Kingdom were to enter theCommunity were being prepared by officials and would shortly beconsidered by Ministers. Further discussion by the Cabinet of the issues of policy involved could best take place on the basis of the studies in question.The Prime Minister said that a statement had been published that morning that he would visit Moscow on 16th to 18th July tosee the British Trade Fair and that he would be the guest of theSoviet Premier, Mr. Kosygin. In the course of talks which he wouldhave with the latter he would explore the possibility of an initiativewhich might lead to negotiations in respect of the conflict inViet-Nam.confidential. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Transport (C (66) 97) to which was attached a draft ofa White Paper on Transport Policy.The Minister of Transport said that the draft White Paper hadbeen very fully considered by the- Ministerial Committee onEconomic Development.   The text had since been extensively7159-1
4CONFIDENTIALredrafted to take account of the comments made in these discussions.The issues of policy were now agreed and, whilst some few editorialchanges remained to be made, none of them involved matters of substance. In view of the acknowledged long-standing need for a comprehensive account of transport policy, she was anxious to havethe draft published as a White Paper on Tuesday, 19th July.In discussion it was urged that, quite apart from the references to future legislation and future public expenditure, the publicationof a comprehensive White Paper of this nature, setting out the shape of transport policy for several years ahead and inevitably overlappingwith other fields of policy, might provoke demands for further white papers in those fields, for which the White Paper itself would be a precedent. On the other hand, it was pointed out that, since a comprehensive statement of transport policy had been promised forsome time and could not easily be further delayed, the White paper would meet a clear need. Indeed, there might well be a substantialdemand from the public, and particularly from the transport industry,for a popular version of the White Paper.In discussion of the text a number of drafting amendments werenoted and the following points made:Chapter X.   Summary(a) Paragraph 1. Steps were being taken to strengthen the regional planning machinery in view of the increased strain whichwould be placed upon it by the execution of the policies set forth inthe draft.(b) Paragraph 3 committed the Government, or the localauthorities, to financial responsibility for losses on railway servicesretained for social reasons. This should not prejudge the outcome of future discussions as to the pattern of public expenditure on this or other programmes. The paragraph could be accepted on that basis; the more so, as a major objective of the new transport policy was to reduce the size of the railways deficit, rather than transferdeficits from one authority to another.(c) Paragraph 6. One object of the discussions envisaged in thisparagraph was to secure the assent of the trade unions to a policyof &quot; open terminals &quot;.(d) Paragraph 22. It would be inexpedient to commit allconurbation transport authorities to joint local authority control.The statement should be qualified by the insertion of the word&quot;normally&quot; before &quot;under joint local authority control&quot;; and bydetailed reference in the main text of the White Paper to the positionin Scotland, to be agreed between the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of Transport. As regards the integration of publicpassenger transport services throughout the conurbations, it was theMinisters intention that this should be done so far as possible on thebasis of public ownership, the local authorities acquiring privatepassenger transport services. There was as yet, however, nolegislative authority for this, and it was not therefore possible to go further than the statement in the draft. It should also be made clearthat the integration of public passenger transport services through
CONFIDENTIAL&quot;5   210the establishment of conurbation transport authorities could be encouraged without prejudice to the work of the Royal Commissionon Local Government, and a sentence to that effect should beinserted at the end of paragraph 22.(e) Paragraph 23, which also envisaged future legislation and increased public expenditure, was acceptable on the basis that it didnot prejudge later decisions under either head. References to future legislation were necessary because it would be impossible in many respects to carry out the proposed policy until the necessary powers had been secured by the amendment of the Transport Act, 1962.It had been envisaged that a Bill for this purpose should be a feature of the legislation in the next Session. The paragraph should be amended to make it clear that financial help would be provided for&quot; transport authorities&quot; as appropriate, and not solely for localauthorities.(/) Paragraph 27. The total of financial commitments involvedin port improvements should be that provided for in the national plan (which should be explicitly referred to) and the period of theprovision should be precisely stated.(g) Paragraph 33. The first sentence should refer to the &quot; localauthorities and other appropriate bodies in the regions concerned &quot;to make it clear that the views of all organisations concerned withthe preservation of amenities could be heard and taken into account.(h) It might be desirable for the Annex, setting out the preamble and terms of reference for the Joint Steering Group andExpert Working Party, to include the names of the members of thosebodies, in recognition of the considerable time they were giving tothis study. Further consideration should be given to this in the lightof precedents.In further discussion it was suggested that the draft did not sufficiently bring out the part civil aviation should play in the planning of an integrated transport system, especially as regardsairports and their communications, and that the sequence of chaptersmight be reordered; for example, by putting the section dealing withrailway freight immediately after the section dealing with freightpassenger traffic.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the draft White Paper for publication on19th July subject to the amendments indicated in discussion and onthe basis that general references to future legislation and public expenditure did not constitute any commitment on the timing ofsuch measures, nor on their scope and form in relation to legislation and expenditure in other fields.The Cabinet -(1) Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theother Ministers concerned, to arrange for the revision ofthe draft on the lines agreed in discussion and, in
6CONFIDENTIALconsultation with the Lord President of the Council, toarrange for its publication.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to consider the desirabilityof publishing a short version of the White Paper designed for the general public.CONFIDENTIALAppointmentof justices of the peace in Englandand Wales(previous reference:CC (65) 69thConclusions,Minute 5)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C (66) 96) on the appointment of Justices of the peace in England and Wales.The Lord Chancellor recalled that the Cabinet had invited himto bring before them proposals for improving the arrangements forselecting Justices of the Peace in England and Wales. His proposals had been considered by the Home Affairs Committee, who, subjectto certain minor qualifications, were in favour of them. For morethan a century there had been complaint that the appointment ofJustices was unfairly biased in favour of the predominant political party, and the methods of selection had been the subject of two royal commissions-those of 1910-11 and 1948-49. The first RoyalCommission had expressed themselves strongly in favour of removingpolitical opinions and services from the factors affecting selection: the paramount consideration should be the character, intelligence,repute and judicial temperament of the candidate, and the Benchshould include people of all social classes and all shades of opinion.The second Royal Commission had endorsed these views and furtherrecommended that the Advisory Committees, on whose adviceJustices were appointed, should themselves represent a cross-sectionof the community without a preponderance of persons appointedbecause of their affiliation with political parties. Nevertheless, therewas continuing criticism that an unduly high proportion of Justiceswas drawn from the relatively small body of people active in localpolitics, that political affiliations were still an important factor inselection, and in some areas the Bench was predominantly of one party. Given the increasing difficulty of the work of Justices,personal suitability must be a paramount consideration and, subjectto this, it was more important that the Bench should be widely representative of all sections of society than that it should representa balance of political opinions. The key to ensuring that Justiceswere in fact selected on this basis lay in reforming the AdvisoryCommittees and in ensuring that suitable candidates for appointment to the Bench were not prevented from serving by considerations offinancial loss. It was therefore proposed to reduce the politicalelement in the Advisory Committees to one representative of eachof the main parties, to draw the other members from a range of socialbackgrounds sufficient to ensure that the Committees had a widepersonal knowledge of the community, to limit the period of service to six years, and, where appropriate, to appoint a person other thanthe Lord Lieutenant as chairman of County Committees. The HomeAffairs Committee had already agreed that the allowance for financial
CONFIDENTIAL7loss payable to Justices should be at the increased rate recently approved for members of local authorities, and that they shouldreceive subsistence allowances whether or not they served less than three miles from home.In the context of the improved selection and training of the main body of Justices, it would be anomalous to retain ex officio Justiceswho were not selected for their personal suitability and for the mostpart would not undergo training. The Cabinet had deferred adecision on proposals to abolish ex officio Justices pendingconsideration of improved methods of selection, and in themeantime there had been consultation with the associationsrepresenting local authorities, of whom the County councils association had agreed to abolition, but the associations representingMunicipal Corporations and Urban and Rural District Councils hadnot, though they recognised that there should be restrictions on exofficio Justices sitting on the Bench if they did not undergo training.In discussion there was general agreement that the objectiveshould be to secure the appointment of Justices with suitable personalqualifications drawn from all sections of the community. Theappropriate means of securing this would no doubt be the carefulselection of the members of the Advisory Committees, but it wassuggested that it could not be assumed that a reduction of theinfluence of political parties on the Advisory Committees and thesubstitution of professional persons, such as doctors, selected fortheir knowledge of the community, could be relied upon to securethe appointment of an adequate proportion of Justices from the lowerincome groups. In some areas it would remain true that pressure from the local Labour Party would be required to ensure theappointment of an adequate number of manual workers. On theother hand, it was urged that experience in cognate fields had shownthat nomination by political organisations did not produce the mostsuitable people. Selection by a broadly based Advisory Committeewould be likely to produce a better Bench from the point of view ofthe interests of lower income groups than selection on predominantlypolitical grounds. Since, however, the difficulty of securing a properdiversity on the Bench might well lie partly in the fact that peoplewell qualified to serve were not known to the Advisory Committees,or to those who submitted recommendations to them, it might be useful if the Committees consulted the local Member of Parliamentwho had a wide knowledge of the people in his constituency. Theymight also be asked to have regard to the desirability of drawingJustices from a wide variety of neighbourhoods: at present a high proportion of Justices appeared to live in the better-off residentialareas.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed in principle that Justices should be selected for their personal qualifications and with the object of producing a Benchrepresentative of all sections of the community. They also agreedthat the Advisory Committees should be reformed on the lines
proposed; and in making his selection and in supervising theCommittees&apos; work, the Lord Chancellor should have in mind thepoints raised in their discussion. Against the background of these new proposals the Cabinet agreed to the abolition of ex officioJustices in England and Wales, but, since Privy Councillors wouldbe among those who would lose this status, the Lord chancellor should inform The Queen of his proposals.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C (66) 96 for the reform of thearrangements for selecting Justices of the Peace and theabolition of ex officio Justices in England and Wales.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,7th July, 1966.
