THIS-IS A COPY. THE ORIGINAL ISCLOSepUNDER SECTION 5f I)&apos; OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACTCC 47 (66)CONFIDENTIALafion 1.   The Prime Minister said that it would be desirable to give&quot;5 some consideration to the possibility of improving the arrangementsfor the presentation of the Governments policies to domestic publicopinion. There was no case for creating any new body in the natureor a Ministry of Information, or even for making any one minister responsible for presenting departmental policies to the Press and the vpublic generally. Individual Ministers should continue to beresponsible for presenting and explaining their own departmentalpolicies and. where appropriate e.g., in relation to foreign andeconomic policy in certain respects for co-ordinating the public presentation of the policies of related departments. Subject tothese reservations, however, there would be advantage in promotingan inquiry to ascertain what improvements might be made ininterdepartmental machinery in the field of home information services in order to ensure the most timely, effective and consistentpublic presentation of the Governments policies as a whole; and he proposed that the Lord President of the Council, with appropriateofficial assistance, should conduct an investigation for this purpose.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal.Its importance was illustrated by a recent incident when a decisionon the application of the Governments policy on prices and incomesto the Clyde Shipbuilding Agreement had had to be taken by senior ministers at short notice and its publication had entailed some riskof embarrassment to other Ministers who might be affected by it but had not had an opportunity to participate in the discussion orto be informed of its outcome before the decision was made public.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, that the Prime Minister would invite the Lord President of the Council to conduct an inquiry with the following terms of reference &apos;&apos; To recommend what improvements are requiredin interdepartmental machinery in the field of homeinformation services in order to ensure the most timely,effective and consistent public presentation of theGovernments policies, without prejudice to the normalresponsibility of individual Ministers for the presentation of their own departmental - policies and for theco-ordination, in appropriate cases, of the policies ofrelated departments.&quot;
Vietnam(previous reference :CC (66) 41stConclusions,Minute 4)UnitedNationsConventionon theEliminationof all Forms ofRacialDiscrimination(previous reference :CC (65) 31stConclusions,Minute 3)The Foreign Secretary said that he would shortly be going to new York to attend the meeting of the United Nations assembly and, while there, would naturally have an opportunity to discuss with the representatives of the United States, Soviet and otherGovernments whether there was any prospect of an improvementin the Vietnam situation.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statements.        iSECRET3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeiSecretary (C (66) 132) about the United Nations Convention on tElimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, to which was appended a report by an official working group on the implications of the Convention.The Foreign Secretary said that the United Nations Conventiotwas open for signature and ratification: 25 States had signed am the United States had announced their intention of signingAdherence to the Convention was likely to be regarded as atouch-stone in matters of racial discrimination, and there would be strong pressure on the United Kingdom to become a party to it.On the other hand, much of the Convention was badly drafted andobscure, and it was in some respects likely to create difficulties forthe United Kingdom. It would be necessary to associate withsignature a reservation on Rhodesia and also certain statements of interpretation which might themselves attract criticism and couldnot be relied upon entirely to remove the difficulties.SECRET
A particular difficulty arose from the fact that the Conventioncontained no territorial application clause, and acceptance by theUnited Kingdom would bind its dependent territories. There would therefore have to be a reservation about the application of theConvention to Rhodesia, and this could most clearly be justified ifmade in the near future. Further, acceptance of the convention would make it very difficult to legislate to restrict the right of entry into the United Kingdom of the many coloured United kingdom citizens in Commonwealth countries. There were also difficulties arising from Article 4 of the Convention, which dealt with freedomof speech and association, and it would be necessary to make asuitable statement of interpretation to avoid conflict with the traditional rights of freedom of speech and of association in thiscountry. Article 6 which required the provision of legal remediesagainst racial discrimination and a right to seek reparation orsatisfaction for damage suffered, might not be fully covered by thelaw and also require a statement of interpretation; it had beenpossible to devise a form of words which avoided bringing the race Relations Act into issue. Article 15, which provided forconsideration of petitions from dependent territories, had been opposed by the United Kingdom throughout the negotiations on theConvention on the grounds that it applied only to colonial territories, while making no comparable provision for States without such territories, and purported to establish a procedure applicableto dependent territories of States whether or not those States had become parties. It would be necessary to make an interpretativestatement reiterating our objections and making it clear that theArticle was acceptable only because of the importance we attachedto the Convention as a whole; consultation with our dependent territories had been on the basis that such a statement would bemade. Finally, Article 20 stipulated that a reservation shall not be permitted if at least two-thirds of the parties &quot;to the Conventionobject to it and, in view of the risk that our proposed reservation on rhodesia might fail under this procedure, it would be necessary tomake clear that we interpreted the Article in the sense that rejection of a reservation would result in the reserving State ceasing to beregarded as a party to the Convention.These difficulties had been considered fully by the HomeAffairs Committee which had concluded that on balance there was strong advantage in early signature. Agreement had also beenreached on the form of words which should be used in relation tothe reservation on Rhodesia and the interpretative statements.Signature would not commit us to eventual ratification, and adecision to ratify could be considered later in the light ofinternational reactions to our reservation and interpretativestatements. In particular, the Home Affairs Committee had concluded that the risk of an influx of United Kingdom citizens of Asian origin was insufficient to justify a refusal to sign theConvention. The dependent territories had been informed of our intention to sign. Nineteen had so far replied, including those most likely to be affected, and all had accepted the proposals, subject only
to reservations which would have to be made in the special caseof Fiji. It was unlikely that the remaining six territories would offerobjection.He sought the agreement of the Cabinet to early signature ofthe Convention in view of the strong presentational advantages ofthis course in the General Assembly of the United Nations. the precise timing would be settled in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary and the United Kingdom representative in the United Nations.In discussion there was general agreement that the balance ofadvantage lay in early signature of the Convention, subject to the reservation and interpretative statements proposed, and the followingprincipal points were made:(a) It was important to avoid bringing the application of the race Relations Act into issue. The Government of Northern Ireland,to which this legislation did not extend, were content with the formof statement now proposed.(b) While there might be as many as 2 million coloured UnitedKingdom citizens in Commonwealth countries who had anunrestricted right of entry to the United Kingdom, the rate of inflowhad been only 6,000 in 1965 and was likely to show a relatively small increase in 1966. Even without the Convention, legislation to restrict their entry would be difficult, but it would be desirableto defer ratification as long as possible in case the problem becameacute.(c) While there was strong objection to Article 15, refusal to sign on this account would have little advantage, since petitions fromdependent territories could be considered by the proposed Committeewhether or not the State concerned was a party to the Convention.(d) There was a possibility of difficulty arising in relation to hong Kong if the question of racial discrimination there were brought before the Committee established under Article 15.(e) We should not be alone in making signature subject toreservations.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that theCabinet were agreed that the balance of advantage lay in earlysignature of the Convention, subject to the reservation on rhodesia and the statements of interpretation proposed by the foreign secretary, and subject to consideration of the outstanding repliesfrom the dependent territories. The timing of the announcementof our intention to sign and of signature should be settled by theForeign Secretary in consultation with the Commonwealth secretary and the Colonial Secretary. The question of ratification would fall to be considered later.The Cabinet Approved C (66) 132.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd September, 1966.
