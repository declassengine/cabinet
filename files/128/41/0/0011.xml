Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (66) 3rdConclusions,Minute 3)2.   The Prime Minister said that there had recently beenindications that the embargo on oil supplies to Rhodesia was beingevaded by the organisation of supplies by road over the Beit Bridgefrom South Africa.  These did not as yet amount to a substantialflow of oil, but the indications were nevertheless disturbing, inrelation both to the prospective improvement of Rhodesia&apos;s supplies and to the political reactions of African countries.   A thorough investigation, through all possible sources of information, was beingcarried out to ascertain the precise extent of the flow. We were alsoin touch with the South African Government and would endeavourto persuade them to take the necessary measures to reduce oil exportsto Rhodesia via South Africa to the level of the very limited quantities which had passed before the illegal declaration of independence. So far, the policy of Dr. Verwoerd, the Prime Ministerof South Africa, and of his Government in maintaining a strictattitude of neutrality towards the dispute had in fact been helpful tous.  We must, however, recognise that the strong pressure of opinion among the South African electorate which was sympathetic to the illegal regime coupled with the fact that a general election was dueto be held in South Africa in March and that the opposing united party had declared themselves in favour of providing assistance to rhodesia would make the position of the South African Governmentin this matter extremely delicate and limit the extent to which they (would feel able to take specific measures to meet our representations.Nevertheless, we should make clear to them the strong probability that, if such action were not taken, there would be a Resolution inthe United Nations using the language of Chapter VII of the united nations Charter, which would call for an oil embargo on the wholeof Southern Africa.  It would be unwise for the United KingdomGovernment to take the initiative in raising this aspect publicly, butit might well be that one of the moderate African leaders, such as president Kenyatta of Kenya, would do so.The Commonwealth Secretary said that pressure had alreadybeen brought to bear upon us by African Governments to close thisgap in the oil embargo. A meeting of the Organisation of AfricanUnity was due to be held at the end of the month and, unless wecould by then demonstrate that the gap had been substantially closed,the meeting might develop in a way which would seriouslyembarrass us. He had arranged to hold a meeting of the Common-wealth Sanctions Committee the following week in an effort to anticipate some of the criticisms.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister and theCommonwealth Secretary.Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
LeaseholdReformDraft white paper(previous reference:CC(66) 7thConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Cabinet considered a note by the Minister of Land and natural Resources (C (66) 36) to which was appended a draft white paper on Leasehold Reform in England and Wales.In discussion it was suggested that it would be possible to publish the White Paper either in the form of the draft appended to C (66) 36, which was designed to give a lively and attractivesummary of the main principles of the Governments proposals forthe benefit of the general public, or in the form of a less colourfuldocument, which would be confined to a detailed description of theproposals themselves and would be addressed mainly to the professional reader. There would be some advantage in publishinga lively statement, provided that it did not simplify to the point ofinaccuracy, and, subject to careful examination from this point ofview, the present draft would serve this purpose. It would bedesirable, however, to make available to the Press a statement,preferably with illustrative examples, which would set out theproposals in terms which would be easier for the public to understand,and such a statement was in preparation. It was agreed that, afterthe discussion of basic points of principle arising on the draft, the text should be further considered in detail by the Ministers primarily concerned. It was desirable that the White Paper should, if possible,be published on the following day.In discussion of the text of the White Paper a number of drafting amendments were proposed and the following main points weremade:(a) Paragraph 1 should be expanded in order to set out more clearly the moral justification for leasehold reform. It wasinaccurate to say that the effect of. the Landlord and Tenant Act,1954, in depreciating drastically the value of the landlords interesthad been unexpected. It had been predicted and intentional and themeasure now proposed was therefore not wholly novel butrepresented a further development in line with that policy.(b) In paragraph 2 and elsewhere in the draft it would not be wholly appropriate to describe the solution proposed by theGovernment simply as &quot; just&quot;. It must be recognised that any possible solution would inevitably give rise to a number ofanomalies and that it would hence be preferable to present themeasure proposed as the only practicable solution.(c) In discussion of paragraph 12 it was suggested that the definition of the assessment of site value was obscure to the layman.It was, however, agreed that it must be in terms which would convey the Governments intention precisely to professional valuers and theCabinet were informed that the definition proposed was based onprofessional advice.(d) In discussion of paragraph 16 (d) the point was made thatany reference to Crown Estates and Royal Duchies should beagreed before publication with The Queen&apos;s advisers in respect ofthese bodies.
C 11(66)The Cabinet then discussed in relation to paragraph 17 the issueof principle on which alternative versions were put forward in thedraft White Paper.The Lord Chancellor said that the leasehold system was animportant method of providing relatively cheap houses for sale. TheBill would, for reasons of equity, impose restraints on the currentoperation of the system. It would be undesirable that in addition the Bill should prevent the development of property by privatefreeholders on the expiry of current leases since this would gravelyhamper the development of large estates, on the basis of which muchof the housing in London and elsewhere had been built and henceeffectively put an end to the leasehold system, with furtherconsequential increases in the price of houses for sale.The Minister of Land and Natural Resources said that theinclusion of a provision on the lines proposed by the LordChancellor would effectively stultify the basic purpose of the Bill inthat it would enable the large development companies to evade theprovision for leasehold enfranchisement.In discussion it was the general view that, despite the difficultieswhich might be caused to desirable large-scale development ofleasehold property, it was nevertheless unacceptable to include aprovision which might so seriously damage the main purpose of the government&apos;s proposals.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement with the view of the Minister of Land and natural Resources that during the existing lease the landlord shouldhave the right to resist either enfranchisement or an extension of the lease only if he wanted the house on its expiry for occupation by himself or his family and if his hardship would be greater than theleaseholders if this intention were frustrated, and that this provision should not be extended to cases where the landlord intended on the expiry of the lease to redevelop the property. The draft of the white paper should now be further considered by the Ministers primarily concerned in the light of the Cabinefs discussion and should bepublished as soon as possible thereafter.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the landlord should not have the right duringthe existing term of the lease to resist eitherenfranchisement or the extension of the lease on theground that he intended after its expiry to redevelop theproperty.(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council, in consultationwith the Lord Chancellor, the Minister of Land and natural Resources and the Financial Secretary, Treasury,to revise the draft of the White Paper in the light of their discussion.
(3) Agreed that, subject to Conclusion (2), the draft white paper on Leasehold Reform should be published as soonas possible.broadcasting and TelevisionDraft white paper on broadcasting(previous reference:CC(66) 10thConclusions)4. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of a memorandumby the Postmaster-General (C (66) 32) to which was attached a draft white Paper on Broadcasting.The Prime Minister said that, together with the Lord Presidentof the Council and the Postmaster-General, he had discussed withthe Vice-Chairman of the Governors and the Director-General of theBritish Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the Corporation^ financial problems and the proposal to authorise advertising on the LightProgramme. He had made it clear that the Government haddismissed the possibility of direct Exchequer subvention, and that,while they did not rule out an increase of the licence fee in due course to cover perhaps half of the BBCs increase in expenditure, theycould not accept that the licence should automatically be raised tocover the whole of the BBCs deficit. He had also made it clear thatno increase in the licence could be accepted until the Governmentwere assured that every other source of cash saving or of revenuehad been explored. Specific possibilities which he had put to the bbc included more intensive measures to reduce licence evasion,investigation of the BBC by the Treasury Organisation and MethodsDepartment, realisation of capital assets such as the Langham Placebuilding, acceptance of advertising on the Light Programme, sale ofagency services and programmes to local community stations,payment by the University of the Air for transmission of its programmes on BBC-2, and acceptance of a ceiling on their expenditure. The BBC were very ready to co-operate in measuresto reduce evasion and had reacted favourably to the suggestion of a treasury Organisation and Methods investigation and to the possible use of BBC-2 by the University of the Air. They had undertaken to send him as soon as possible their considered views on these andthe other possibilities discussed. They had, however, reaffirmedtheir total opposition to advertising on the Light Programme since they feared that, once the principle had been admitted, it would bedifficult to resist its extension to their other services.Pending the receipt of the BBCs detailed views, he suggestedthat further consideration of their financing should be deferred. TheCabinet should, however, consider the need for an early White paper in the light of the other proposals contained in the Postmaster-General&apos;s draft.The Postmaster-General said that, because of the firmundertakings given to review broadcasting policy, it was desirable to publish a White Paper as soon as possible. In particular,manufacturers were anxious that an early decision should be taken on colour television. It was also desirable to offer through the LightProgramme and local community stations some alternative to the type of service at present provided by the pirate radio stations. By
a combination of the possibilities which had emerged from thediscussions in the Cabinet and with the BBC, a solution to the BBCsfinancial problems could be devised and presented together with hisother proposals.In discussion it was pointed out that the proposal to introducecolour television would lead to a substantial increase in the demand on resources and in the import of colour television sets which werenot yet manufactured in the United Kingdom. It was also suggestedthat, although the Postmaster-General&apos;s Television AdvisoryCommittee had made a strong recommendation in favour of the PALcolour system, it was possible that the National Electronic research council, who were currently studying the problem, might recommendsome different system. A decision now to adopt the present systemmight prove to be premature and might therefore put manufacturers and exporters at a disadvantage in future. On the other hand, it wassuggested that it would help United Kingdom manufacturers todevelop their industrial capacity, and so assist our exports prospects,if an early decision were reached on the system to be adopted. Anysuch decision would be subject to revision in the light of the meetingof the International Radio Consultative Committee to be held inJune, but there were advantages in announcing a decision in advanceof that meeting in the hope that other countries would be influencedto favour the same system.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that conclusions on the financing of the BBC and on the White Papermust await the BBCs detailed views. In the meantime, thePostmaster-General should amend the draft in the light of the presentdiscussion and of the discussion with the BBC and circulate the revised draft for further consideration by the Cabinet.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement on had discussions with the BBC.(2) Invited the Postmaster-General, in the light of their discussion, to submit a revised White Paper forconsideration at a later meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,17th February, 1966.C 11(66)
