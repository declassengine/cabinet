Subject :The Economic Situation
Economicsituation(previous reference :CC(66) 17thConclusions,Minute 2).secret the Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C (66) 103), the First Secretary of State and secretary of State for Economic Affairs (C (66) 99), the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C (66) 100 and C (66) 101), and the Ministerof Technology (C (66) 102) describing the economic situation andthe measures being taken or in hand to improve it.There was general agreement that it was necessary to draw a distinction between the requirements of economic policy in the longer term and the exigencies which might affect policy in the short term.So far as longer term policy was concerned there was a substantial measure of agreement that the measures which the Government were taking were on the right lines. There could be no doubt that theessential longer term objective must be to improve productivity,exports and import substitution on the lines suggested in the memoranda before the Cabinet, although it would no doubt bepossible from time to time to intensify and supplement these measuresby others to the same end.The difficulty in the longer term, therefore, was not that the policybeing pursued was mistaken but that the improvement of the economy in the respects stated, and especially as regards productivity,must inevitably take more time to become fully effective than theGovernment had had at their command since assuming office. Forexample, a report on the machine tool industry showed that machine tool imports were rising not because the domestic industry wasuncompetitive in terms of price or delivery dates but because the types of machine tools which our user industries required were notbeing made in the United Kingdom. This was clearly not a situationwhich could be put right in a year or two; in the meantime the imported tools must be admitted for the sake of the efficiency ofthe user industries.Nor did the extensive and valuable work of the economic development Committees set out in the memoranda before theCabinet disclose any pattern of improvement, going beyond general principles, which could be applied indiscriminately throughout industry. Thus, as the memoranda showed, a list could be drawn upof the industries, and of the sectors within individual industries,where the Governments pressures for the improvement of productivity were already beginning to show results. But thetechniques of such improvements varied from industry to industry;and, while better management and techniques of decision-makingwere essential, they were not the sole factor in improving productivity.Another essential factor was to relate earnings and productivity in wage bargaining between the two sides of industry. Bothmanagement and labour had proved reluctant to link pay,productivity and consultation; and the last of these factors was anessential element in wage settlements.*Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET7545-1 a 2
It was therefore important to increase the emphasis on theimprovement of productivity. It was not true that the Government&apos;policy to date had concentrated too much on the restraint of prices and incomes and too little on the stimulation of productivity. Theformer had attracted much the more attention because it was morecontroversial than the latter. But it was essential that both publicopinion and industry at all levels should be more conscious of theimportance of increasing productivity. To that end it was essentialto make the best use both of the Productivity Conference planned forthe autumn, and of the educational opportunity provided by thespare television time which would be available until a University ofthe Air could be introduced.As regards exports, there was general agreement that theimprovement in performance over the past 18 months was very satisfactory. But Government pressure to increase exports must bemaintained in order both to sustain the improvement already achieved and to help to offset the undue increase in imported goods which, despite the temporary import charge, had taken place overthe same period. This increase was such as to make it necessary toplace more emphasis in future policy on the encouragement of import substitution. This could not be developed quickly in relationto capital goods, as was demonstrated by the example of machine tools referred to earlier in the discussion. But there had also been an undue increase in the import of consumer goods of a less essentialcharacter.While there was general agreement that the Governmenfslonger term policies for the improvement of productivity and thebalance of payments were on the right lines and, given time, were capable of further development, it would be wrong to take toocomplacent a view of long term prospects. Even if the immediateshort term difficulties were ignored, a considerable effort would berequired before the development of the Governmenfs long termpolicies would be such as fully to restore the viability and stability of the economy. This effort would need to comprise, in particular,measures to ensure a more flexible redeployment of labour; the encouragement of occupational, as distinct from geographical,mobility; and the fostering, perhaps as part of the furtherpresentational efforts that had been called for, of a conviction thatimprovement of productivity should be achieved not only by bettermachines and better methods but also by greater individual effortarising from a sense of social purpose. There was, however, generalrecognition that, whatever the prospects in the longer term, theimmediate economic situation was grave and might call for measuressome of which might not be easily reconciled with the Governmenfslonger term policies.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said, that when the Budgethad been prepared in April, it had been expected that, in accordancewith the pattern of preceding years, the increased level of consumerexpenditure in the first quarter of the year in anticipation ofadditional taxation would be succeeded by a fall in demand in the
succeeding quarter. The substantial increase in hire purchaserestrictions which had been imposed in February had also been expected to have substantial effect in this latter period. Theseexpectations had not been fulfilled; and the pressure on resourceshad persisted at an uncomfortably high level. The rate ofunemployment, which broadly measured this pressure, remained atunder 14- per cent; and the extreme shortage of labour was undoubtedly one of the main reasons for the continuance of a very rapid increase in wage and salary earnings during the previous year.This had resulted in a sharp increase of unit labour costs at a timewhen an improvement in the position of United Kingdom industryrelative to its competitors was urgently required. The prospect forthe domestic economy to the end of the following year was one of continued expansion in output at a moderate rate, with little easingof the inflationary pressure and a continuing rise in wages and prices at almost the rate in the preceding year. The deficit in our balance of payments was likely to be substantial not only in 1966but also in 1967. The 1964 drawing from the International monetary fund and the Swiss loans amounting to  385 million were due for repayment before the end of 1967; and a substantial debt to othercentral banks also fell due for repayment by then. As a result, theresources available to the United Kingdom would be heavily strained.The Governmenfs plans for an increase of 4  per cent in public expenditure had been based on the estimate in the National plan of a rise of 25 per cent by 1970 in the Gross National Product(GNP). Even at that level the growth of public expenditure wouldprobably require higher taxation; but it was now apparent that thegrowth in GNP would be substantially below 25 per cent, whilepresent proposals provided for an increase in public expenditure inthe following year of no less than 11 per cent. Total public expenditure was growing at a faster rate than was consistent withthe economic health of the country in present circumstances; andthere could be no assurance that current economic policies would suffice to deal with the situation.In further discussion differing views were expressed on themeasures which the Government should take in these circumstances.On the one hand, it was urged that the Government should notcompromise their political philosophy by adopting cuts in public expenditure, and especially in public expenditure on the social services, in the manner which had been adopted by the previous administration. It would be preferable that private consumptionshould be curtailed by higher taxation and particularly by higherdirect taxation which would entail a further redistribution of incomes.This could be justified on a comparison of the proportion of theUnited Kingdom national income taken in taxation relative to theproportion so taken in other highly industrialised countries. It mightwell be necessary also for the Government to adopt a sterner attitudetowards wage negotiations and to insist that there should be no increase in wages which was not specifically justified by higher productivity.  It might also be desirable to take further measures to
restrict our imports in total and to relate them more definitely to thecountry&apos;s social and industrial needs.On the other hand these measures could be argued to be not directly relevant to the current situation. The continued growth ofpublic expenditure (even in relation to the target of the national plan of a 25 per cent increase in GNP by 1970), the increase in wages, prices and consumer expenditure and the virtual elimination of unemployment all showed clearly a degree of overstrain of our economic resources which could not continue without grave consequences. The lack of international confidence in our economic position was only a reflection of these facts. In such circumstancescontinued expansion of public expenditure and an increase oftaxation, particularly of direct taxation, would not be calculated to improve the country&apos;s economic situation and would furtherimpair public confidence at home and abroad. Nor, for example,would the yield from a restoration of earlier surtax rate, at some 45 million, be significant in relation to a possible increase of govermental expenditure of  800 million. The principal need wasto check the pressure on demand and the rate of imports. In such circumstances it was suggested that it would be necessary to take such measures as a further substantial restriction on hire purchasewhich, it could be argued, was in any event at too high a level forthe social health of the country; a cut in demand by furtherlimitations in bank credit; and a reduction in tourist expenditure overseas, which alone was estimated to rise in the current year to anet adverse balance of over  100 million. This last item could not bejustified in relation to restraints on the export of capital, which in the longer term would effect a substantial improvement in our invisiblepayments.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it wasimperative that the strictest confidence should be observed regardingthis exchange of views and any other Ministerial discussions on theeconomic situation. While there was some difference of view on the analysis of the immediate situation and on the effectiveness of theGovernments longer term measures, there was broad agreement thatthe latter were rightly designed and should be continued and, where necessary, strengthened. There was also agreement on the seriousness of the current situation and a general acceptance that further action would be necessary to deal with it. There was,however, some divergence of view on the individual measures whichwould be most appropriate for this purpose. The balance ofpayments presented a most formidable problem, even if it were not further adversely affected by a lack of confidence at home oroverseas. Although our exports had increased substantially duringthe Governments tenure of office in relation to previous rates of growth, further efforts were needed. It was also essential tostrengthen substantially the measures which were being taken toproduce in the United Kingdom manufactured and semi-manufactured goods which were at present imported. In thisconnection there might be advantage in a public campaign to &quot; BuyBritish&quot;; and greater preference might be given by Government
Departments to the purchase of goods produced in the UnitedKingdom as distinct from imports. More specifically, the Ministryof Defence might be set a target for savings in expenditure both interms of the Budget and of foreign exchange.A sustained effort should be made by all Departments to increaseindustrial productivity; and to this end particular regard shouldbe paid to the award of Government contracts. Further consideration should be given to the desirability of maintaining a high level of social benefits in relation to the level of taxation involved, on thelines indicated in discussion. We should also consider what measures were open to the Government to encourage an improvement in thegeneral level of individual effort in industry. The possibility ofutilising television facilities, including the University of the Air when this was established, for a sustained campaign of education and publicity on improvements in management and productivity shouldalso be considered. There was a general readiness to acceptrestrictions on consumption in the private sector in the near future.It might also be necessary to prune severely programmes of public expenditure and to consider action designed to restrict these more closely to the planned rate of growth of A\ per cent in accordancewith the Governments agreed policy. In considering the actionto be taken to these ends it would be necessary to bear in mind theeffect on international confidence in sterling of any measures forincreased taxation or the restriction of imports. A number of proposals had also been put forward relating to the government&apos;s policy on prices and incomes; and these called for furtherconsideration and discussion by the Cabinet on another occasion.The economic Ministers should now consider further, in thelight of the Cabinets discussions, the measures which should betaken to deal with the situation and should bring proposals beforethe Cabinet in due course.The Cabinet-Took note of the Prime Minister^ summing up and of the points made in discussion.Cabinet Office, SWA,13th July, 1966.
