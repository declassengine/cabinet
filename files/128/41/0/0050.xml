CC 50 (66)secret parliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons in the following week.The First Secretary of State said that after discussion in the ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes it had been agreedthat it would be necessary to make Orders under Section 29 of thePrices and Incomes Act to enforce the withdrawal of increases ofwages in two cases. So far, however, such increases of prices ashad taken place were either justifiable, in that they reflectedincreased taxation or resulted from seasonal fluctuations, or were ofsuch a trivial nature as to make statutory action unsuitable. TheCommittee were, however, conscious of the importance ofdemonstrating the Governmenfs intention to enforce the standstill on prices no less than on wages by taking such action if a suitable occasion could be identified.In discussion there was general agreement on the importance ofthe latter aspect. It was also suggested that it would be important to consider action to penalise any dividends that were increaseddespite the continuous efforts that were made to maintain a voluntary standstill.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the First Secretary of State.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe First Secretary of State, to keep the rate of dividendsunder close examination.OverseaAffairsUnitedNations(previous reference:CC (66) 47thConclusions,Minute 2)Germany(previous reference:CC (66) 44thConclusions,Minute 1)secret. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mrs. White) saidthat the speech which the Foreign Secretary had just made in theUnited Nations General Assembly had been well received. Wewere however in an embarrassing position in the Assembly on thedispute over the mandate for South-West Africa and we might haveto abstain on a Motion in extreme terms which was likely to be putforward in the Assembly with a considerable measure of support.The Foreign Secretary had also seen the Soviet Foreign Minister,Mr. Gromyko. He had pressed him hard to join in an initiativeto seek negotiations in respect of the conflict in Vietnam, thoughso far with no result. The Soviet Government appeared, however,to be ready to be more forthcoming in respect of international agreements on the use of space and on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.Objection had been raised by some of our Allies in the north atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) to the tripartite talks betweenthe United States, the Federal German Government and ourselves on the problems arising from the foreign exchange costs of United
Gibraltar(previous reference :CC (66) 47thConclusions,Minute 2)Nigeria(previous reference :CC (66) 48thConclusions,Minute 1)States and United Kingdom Forces in Germany. In order to makeit clear that the importance of these talks to NATO was fully recognised, the Secretary-General of the Organisation had been invited to take part in the first of them. We hoped that they would come to a conclusion not later than the end of November.It appeared that the Spanish Government had been somewhatsurprised by our proposal that the issue of our sovereignty overGibraltar should be referred to the International Court of justice and we still did not know if they would accept it. Meanwhile, theyhad instituted a campaign of propaganda on a large scale on theneed to &quot; decolonise &quot; Gibraltar, in which they had made it apparent that even if the issue went to the International Court they would continue their pressure on this issue in the United nations committee of Twenty-four.The Commonwealth Secretary said that for the moment thewidespread shooting and murders in Nigeria had ceased and therewas an uneasy calm. Large numbers of Ibos had left the northern region or had been killed. Four out of the five battalions of the nigerian Army were in disorder, having lost most of their Iboofficers and it was feared that the Nigerian Army was now incapable of controlling the situation. The Nigerian police were howeverdoing their best to do so. There were some 17,000 United kingdom citizens at present in Nigeria, widely dispersed throughout thecountry. No attempt had been made by any section of the Nigerianpeople to interfere with them, but provisional arrangements had asa precaution been made for their evacuation in case law and orderbroke down completely. We had not been asked for military assistance in preserving order nor for additional technical assistancein the Northern Region, where it was now extremely difficult tomaintain public services. We were, however, considering what action we could take if a request for such technical assistance weremade to us.The Cabinet Took note of the statements made by the Minister of Statefor Foreign Affairs and the Commonwealth Secretary.Rhodesia(previous reference :CC (66) 48thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C (66) 139) to which was attached a draft statement on the British Governments terms for a settlement in rhodesia.The Prime Minister said that exceptionally Sir Morrice James,a Deputy Under-Secretary of State in the Commonwealth Office,would be present to listen to the Cabinets discussion of this itemsince, if they approved the proposals before them, he would becharged with the task of taking out to Salisbury the statement ofthe Governments terms for a settlement. It was therefore important
that he should be fully aware of the considerations which theCabinet had in mind in reaching their decision.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the draft statement hadbeen prepared in accordance with the Cabinefs conclusions at their previous discussion and took account of the suggestions made tothe Attorney-General and himself during their visit to Rhodesia.It was fully in accord with the Governments six principles and withthe Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; communique. The paragraphson the constitutional settlement provided for the special entrenchmentof the whole of Chapter III of the 1961 Constitution. the safeguards for the specially entrenched clauses would include thecreation of a Senate; this was acceptable in principle to the illegal regime but we must insist that it should include a higher proportionof elected African representatives than they had proposed. Therewas also provision for appeal against amendment of the specially entrenched clauses to a &quot; Constitutional Commission &quot; in Rhodesia,and subsequently to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.These provisions should effectively prevent the amendment ofSection 37 by the creation of additional &quot; A &quot; Roll seats designedto impede progress to majority rule. These would be very difficultpoints for the illegal regime in Salisbury to accept. As regards thereturn to legality the method and timetable proposed by that regimewere not acceptable. We must continue to insist that a return to constitutional government should be the first step but we could make certain concessions on method and, as suggested in his memorandum, these might be conveyed to Mr. Smith, the leader ofthe illegal regime, in a letter rather than in the statement. Weenvisaged that the interim government would contain a certainnumber of Rhodesia Front representatives, including Mr. Smith,together with representatives of other sections of opinion in Rhodesia,including Africans, selected in agreement with the United KingdomGovernment. If these proposals were accepted and there were a return to legality, detention and censorship would be ended andsanctions would be lifted. The constitutional settlement would be formally negotiated with the interim government and a RoyalCommission would ascertain its acceptability to the Rhodesianpeople as a whole. During this period, which might take about three months, there must be freedom to recommence political activity and to form new political parties. If the Royal Commission foundthat the proposed constitution was acceptable there would beelections followed by the grant of independence. The statementprovided for a British military presence in Rhodesia, possibly atKariba, during the interim period and this might be maintained,if we so wished, after the grant of independence. This too was likely to be a very difficult condition for the illegal regime to accept.The Prime Minister said that the method set out in thestatement for the return to legality was consistent with the principlewe had maintained in respect of the illegal regime; Mr. Smithwould be summoned by the Governor to form an interim government as a private citizen and not as a Prime Minister. While
we could accept that the interim government should contain somerepresentatives of the Rhodesia Front we must reserve the right to approve or to veto those whom Mr. Smith might nominate. Thestatement also showed that all the alternative proposals we had madehad been rejected out of hand. The suggestion relating to an &quot; act of Union &quot; between Rhodesia and the United Kingdom had not beenput forward as a proposal but as a possibility which we would beprepared to study in spite of the difficulties which it would undoubtedly involve for us. The special entrenchment of Section 37,dealing with the number of constituencies, would be particularly difficult for the illegal regime to accept. It would be most difficult for us to make any concession on this point but if it later appeared that this was the only outstanding point preventing agreement, theCommonwealth Secretary should have authority to refer back tothe Cabinet so that the possibility of some alternative arrangementcould be considered.In discussion of the draft statement the following main points were made:(a) Paragraphs 1 and 3. The word &quot; final &quot; in both paragraphsshould be omitted.(b) Paragraph 2. When the statement was published the sixprinciples should be set out in full, perhaps as an appendix.(c) Paragraph 4. An additional sentence should be includedreferring to our previous offer of assistance for a crash programmeof African secondary education and also to the importance of fullAfrican co-operation in working the Constitution.(d) Paragraph 6. The effect of this paragraph would be toprovide 24 elected African members out of a combined total of 89for the Senate and House of Representatives. This would give too small a margin to constitute a safe &quot; blocking quarter&quot;. the paragraph should therefore include a requirement for an increase from 15 to 17 in the number of &quot; B &quot; Roll seats in the House ofRepresentatives.(e) Paragraph 8. The following words should be added at theend of the first sentence: &quot; which would not come into force untilthe time for appeal had expired or the appeal had been finallydisposed of &quot;. In the last sentence the interests of the people of rhodesia as a whole was not a justiciable issue and the sentence should therefore be amended to read: &quot; The grounds of appeal should be that the amendment discriminated or had the effect ofdiscriminating unjustly between the races, or contravened any of theprovisions of the Declaration of Rights contained in theConstitution &quot;.(/) Paragraph 9. The last sentence might give the impression that we favoured a qualifying age of 30 for the African franchiserather than some lower age limit. The sentence should thereforebe amended to read: &quot;The &apos; B &apos; Roll franchise should be extendedto all Africans over 30 by appropriate amendment of the second schedule to the Constitution &quot;.(g) Paragraph 14. It was noted that the use of the term &quot; the widest possible range of public opinion of all races &quot; contemplated
CC SO (66)the inclusion in the interim administration of representatives of african nationalist opinion, though not necessarily of the presentleaders of the two main African nationalist parties.(h) Paragraph 15. It was suggested that the second sentenceimplied that the Governor would be bound to act on the advice ofRhodesian Ministers except in regard to the armed forces and police.This would give undue power to the interim Rhodesian Governmentand the relevant words should be amended to read: &quot; responsible tothe Governor who would normally act on their advice &quot;. A similarchange should be made in the second sentence of paragraph 16.(/) Paragraph 15 (a). It was agreed that it would be important for the Governor to control the Rhodesian radio and televisionservices. An additional paragraph should therefore be inserted atthis point to read: &quot; Free expression of opinion would be ensuredby the removal of censorship and the assumption by the governor of responsibility for the national broadcasting and televisionservices&quot;.(j) Paragraph 16. The reference to our forces being presentafter independence &quot; by agreement&quot; should be deleted and the last sentence should be amended to read: &quot; The British Governmentwould reserve the right to provide military assistance for thispurpose if this is required by the Governor in this period. Similarly,the British Government would reserve the right, under theindependence constitution, to provide such assistance if this isnecessary as a further guarantee of the agreed constitution.&quot;A number of other drafting amendments were also agreed.The Cabinet (1) Approved the statement of the British Governmenfs terms for a settlement in Rhodesia, as amended in their discussion.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to raise with them forfurther consideration the question of the specialentrenchment of Section 37 of the 1961 Constitution ifthis proved to be the only issue preventing a settlement.procedure Commonwealth Secretary said that Sir Morrice Jameswould leave for Rhodesia that afternoon with copies of the statement as approved by the Cabinet. He would discuss it with theGovernor: if it proved that the Governor took such strongexception to certain points in it as to threaten resignationSir Morrice James would refer back for instructions. If, as was tobe hoped, the Governor accepted the statement Sir Morrice Jameswould hand it to Mr. Smith and would be prepared to wait in salisbury for two or three days to give Mr. Smith time to considerthe statement and to consult his colleagues. During this period itwas important that the statement should remain confidential, unless it was at once rejected by the illegal regime and published in
Rhodesia. If there seemed to be a real chance of our terms being accepted he would himself be prepared to go to Salisbury for further discussions. If, however, the offer were rejected the Cabinet would wish to consider our future propaganda policy towards rhodesia and the methods by which we should seek to ensure the widest possible knowledge in Rhodesia of the terms we had offered.The Prime Minister said that we should avoid giving theimpression that our offer was an ultimatum and Mr. Smith shouldbe given enough time to study it. Sir Morrice James should therefore be prepared to stay in Salisbury until, say, 19th october and need not insist on receiving a final answer by then. It was however important that the offer should be published without undue delay so that steps could be taken to make its terms known in rhodesia. We should therefore reserve the right to publish theoffer by about the end of the following week if no answer fromMr. Smith had been received by then. The precise date of publication would need to be decided in consultation with theForeign Secretary in the light of the situation at the United nations in regard to Rhodesia. Our proposals for the return to legality,which it was suggested in the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;smemorandum should be conveyed by letter to Mr. Smith, should in the first instance be put to him orally by Sir Morrice James.The proposals could later be confirmed in writing if there were a prospect of settlement and the Commonwealth Secretary himselfwent to Rhodesia. When the terms of our offer were publishedwe should be prepared to make it clear that we would not excluderepresentatives of the Rhodesian Front, including Mr. Smith himself,from the interim government.The Cabinet (3) Took note, with approval, of the statements by the PrimeMinister and Commonwealth Secretary.The Cabinet then discussed the situation which might develop,and the measures which it might be realistic to adopt, if our offerwere rejected. It would be necessary to impress on the illegal regime in Salisbury that, if we were compelled to withdraw theprotection which we had hitherto afforded Rhodesia at the united nations and the Security Council then imposed mandatory sanctions,which might need to be enforced, the consequences in the longer term were unpredictable.The Cabinet (4) Took note of the points made in this part of their discussion.
Prices andIncomesPolicyPrice ofIndustrialCoal(previous reference :CC(66) 16thConclusions,Minute 5)CC 50 (66)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs(C (66) 140) on the price of industrial coal.The First Secretary of State said that the question for decision was whether the National Coal Board (NCB) should be asked to defer until 1st January next increases in the price of industrial coalunder certain privately negotiated contracts. These contractsprovided for six months&apos; notification of increases of prices, and,notice having been given last April (when the price of industrialcoal was increased for the majority of customers), the increase under these contracts was due to come into effect from 1st October., In discussion in the Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomesreference had been made to the Governmenfs advice to the confederation of British Industry that the standstill did not mean that there should be interference with existing contracts, and to theCabinet&apos;s earlier decision that, where some members of a group ofworkers had already begun to receive payment of a wage increasebefore 20th July, the increase should not be withheld from other workers covered by the same agreement, even though the increase was not actually in payment to them before that date. The decisions on both these matters, however, were related to incomes. It did not follow that similar doctrines should apply in the field of prices. Thetrade unions were known to be watching movements of prices withgreat vigilance, and were still suspicious that the Government wereenforcing the standstill more rigorously upon wages than uponprices. It was important not to give further encouragement to thesesuspicions, and it was for this reason that the NCB should beasked to defer the price increases in question.-The Minister of Power reminded the Cabinet that the increasein question had been approved by the National Board for prices and Incomes and subsequently by the Cabinet earlier in the year,and had been paid by most of the customers concerned since April.It had not hitherto come into effect under these contracts only because they required six months&apos; notification of price increases.No announcement would be required if the increase were allowedto go ahead in accordance with the contracts. It was doubtfulwhether the adverse effect upon the standstill of prices and incomes of accepting the increase would be as great as had been suggested,even if it were to receive publicity: the effect on industrial costs would be to increase them by only 0-01 per cent, and, since the lossof  2 million to  3 million to the NCB would have to be met bythe Exchequer, the increase could be deferred only at the cost ofwhat would amount to a subsidy to certain sections of private industry. Those customers who had for some time been paying theincrease would be bound to regard any such subsidy as inequitable.In discussion it was urged that the decision on groups of workers,to which reference had been made, did not provide any real analogyin this case.   The Government had interfered with forward7444
commitments on wages for some six million workers, and theco-operation which the Government had enjoyed from the greatmajority of the trade union movement could well be adversely affected, with serious risks for the development of the government&apos;s policy on prices and incomes in the first half of 1967, if theimpression gained wide currency that the Government had failed totake action on an increase in price when it was open to them to doso. The reasons for such a failure could not well be presented insimple and convincing terms. Nor was the fact that the cost would fall upon the taxpayer a decisive consideration, since increases in the rents of municipally owned houses had under the standstill been deferred at the cost of the ratepayer. It was also pointed out that,if this increase were accepted, a similar problem might arise inconnection with railway freight rates, where increases in rates which came into effect for the generality of customers on 30th Januaryhad not been extended to certain classes of contracts by 20th July.On the other hand it was argued that despite these considerations the analogy with the Cabinefs decision on increases of wages for groups of workers was valid. Admittedly there hadbeen no specific discussion of whether a similar doctrine should apply in the field of prices when the Cabinet had reached their original decision on its application in the field of wages; but therewas no logical distinction to be drawn, and if the same principlewere not adopted in respect of prices, its application in respect ofwages might be called in question. Attention was drawn to thefact that prices under privately negotiated contracts for washingservices and for television rentals were being increased during theperiod of the standstill as a result of increases in charges whichhad first been announced and brought into operation before20th July, and it was suggested that those cases presented in someways even closer parallels to the present case than that of a group of workers, some of whom had received an increase of wages while others had not done so. It was suggested that the trade unions were suspicious of cases where wages were held down and pricesincreased because of the possibility that profits and dividends mightmove up while wages and salaries were being held; but that issue didnot arise in this case, where the question was whether the increasein price should fall on the consumers of coal (and of the productswhose costs were affected by coal prices) or upon the taxpayer.As a means of reducing suspicion in the trade union movement thatthe Government were enforcing the standstill less rigorously on prices than on wages, a request to the NCB to defer this increase would have considerably less effect than statutory action underPart IV of the Prices and Incomes Act on prices which affectedconsumers more directly. Since a decision not to defer the increase would involve no Government action or announcement, it seemeddoubtful whether any presentational impact would be great enoughto warrant additional Exchequer expenditure of  2 million to 3 million.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet agreed that the increase in the price of industrial
EconomicSituation(previous reference:CC (66) 44thConclusions,Minute 1)Trade Figuresfor SeptemberCONFIDENTIAL5. The President of the Board of Trade informed the Cabinetthat the trade figures for September, which had just been published,showed exports at  429 million (compared with  440 million inAugust, when the figures still included some exports which had beenheld up by the seamen&apos;s strike) and imports of  493 million(compared with  524 million in August). The seasonally adjusteddeficit on the balance of visible trade for the month was  2 million,which was the best figure this year. While anticipation of the ending of the temporary import charge in November might have played a small part in the reduction of imports, the major elementwas thought to be the working through the economy of thedeflationary measures which the Government had taken.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that preliminaryforecasts suggested that unemployment in Scotland might rise toover 4 per cent at their seasonal peak next February. It might benecessary to review the impact of the deflationary measures on development areas.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thelatest trade figures, with their evidence that the Governmenfsmeasures were working through to the balance of payments, would help to promote revival of overseas confidence in sterling and inthe United Kingdom&apos;s ability to overcome her economic problems.The Government would need to take such measures as were possibleto prevent the incidence of the deflationary measures beingdisproportionately adverse in development areas. Ministers incharge of production Departments should take steps to see thatfirms were encouraged to maintain output in the development areas and, where possible, to transfer work into those areas in order tohelp maintain the level of activity.The Cabinet Took note of the trade figures for September and of thepoints made in discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th October, 1966.coal under privately negotiated contracts should take effect inaccordance with the notices already given. This decision shouldnot be regarded as setting a precedent for prices in the nationalised industries: any other cases, where the arguments advanced in this instance might not be so applicable, would need to be considered ontheir merits.The Cabinet Agreed that the National Coal Board should not be askedto defer the industrial coal price changes notified underprivately negotiated contracts to come into operation on1st October, 1966.
