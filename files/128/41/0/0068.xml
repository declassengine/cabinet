aircraft industry:P-1127(previous reference:CC (66) 9thConclusions)secret. The Cabinet considered a note by the Prime Minister(C (66) 185) covering a memorandum by officials on the P-1127.The Prime Minister said that we had to decide by the end of theyear whether or not we should continue with the P-1127. In discussion in the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee there had been a difference of view; the preponderant opinion was in favour ofcontinuation, particularly given the extent of the Governmenfscommitment to the P-1127; but the decision was one which theCabinet would wish to take themselves.The Minister of A aviation recalled that in February the cabinet had agreed that the P-1127 was important for United Kingdomindustrial reasons and that at that stage we should plan on theassumption that it would&quot;be developed. The Cabinet had howeverreserved the right to take a different decision should technicaldevelopments or the escalation of costs make it desirable to do so.The Defence and Oversea Policy Committee had agreed in March(OPD (66) 15th Meeting, Item 1) that an order should be placed for60 aircraft with an option for a further 40, and that the issue shouldbe further considered in the autumn in the light of feasibility studies,the cost of production and the prospect of export orders. Theprogramme was going well, two aircraft were flying and development should be completed within the cost estimates of March 1966. Bythe end of December we should have spent  45 million, more thanone-third of the estimated cost of the development and productionof the first 60 aircraft ( 120- 125 million). If the project were cancelled there would not be a total saving of the remainingexpenditure on the P-1127; there would almost certainly have to bean alternative purchase of Phantom or Jaguar aircraft. If our defence requirements proved in the light of further defence studiesto be such that a full replacement of the military capability providedby 1.10 P-1127 aircraft was necessary, this purchase would involve some  40 million in dollars and  25 million in foreign exchange onthe French element of the Jaguar. Although it was estimated thatthis alternative would save  130 million on budgetary costs over a10-year period, expenditure in 1967-68 would be  10 million higherowing to cancellation charges. Moreover, if our military requirements proved to be such that the total purchase could bereduced from 110 P- 1127s to 70, which would be acceptable from thepoint of view of the industry, the programme cost would be reduced from  336 million to  242 million.An aircraft with vertical or short take off and landing (V/STOL)capability was the best means of providing close support for our ground forces and was likely to become increasingly important as our forces became more mobile. In many parts of the world theP-1127 could operate while conventional aircraft such as thePhantom or Jaguar would be unable to do so. The P-1127 was the
only advanced military aircraft at present under development solelyin the United Kingdom and the only major national aircraft projectthe present Government had initiated. It had been cancelled bythe Conservative Government in favour of the P-1154 and when thelatter had been abandoned by the present Government the P-1127had become a symbol of our attempt to achieve stability in theaircraft industry. If it were to be cancelled now the effect on theaircraft industry could be disastrous; the loss of confidence wouldbe such that it would be doubtful if men of the right industrial,scientific and technological standing could be retained in the industry.It was the major project in the programme for Hawker Siddeley,around which firm the Governmenfs proposals for reorganising the airframe industry were built and consequently if it were cancelled itwas unlikely that these proposals could be carried through. Thedevelopment of the VTOL and STOL capability was the only partof aircraft technology in which at present the United Kingdom wasin advance of the rest of the world. To abandon the P-1127 wouldbe permanently to throw away that lead, with wider consequences for our technological capacity and for our ability to promotetechnological co-operation in Europe. The French Government mightwell withdraw from the Anglo-French variable geometry project orinsist on unacceptable conditions as the price of their continued co-operation. The export prospects must remain uncertain whilethe project was under threat of cancellation, but a number of countries had shown interest and the Head of Defence Sales considered theexport prospects to be good. Moreover, if the project were cancelledthe loss of confidence in the industry and abroad could well affect our present aircraft exports, which in the present year had reachedthe record total of  200 million. In view of the extent of the government&apos;s commitments and the effect which cancellation wouldhave on the aircraft industry and on the Governmenfs standing, the project should be continued.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there were threeaspects to be considered; defence requirements, the Governmenfscommitments and the effect of cancellation on the aircraft industry,and the defence budget. It was clear that the P-1127 was not essential on defence grounds. If it were cancelled it would benecessary, on the basis of the forces agreed in the Defence Review,to purchase additional Phantom and Jaguar aircraft. The new defence studies which were now being undertaken might show thata replacement could be provided which would not involve dollar expenditure; but the decision could not be deferred until these studies had been completed. If they showed that no alternative was required large savings would accrue; if there had to be an alternativethere would still be savings although some dollar expenditure mightbe necessary. As regards the second point, cancellation would admittedly be difficult in view of the Governmenfs previouscommitments and the substantial effect which cancellation was likelyto have on the aircraft industry. The question was the extent towhich the Government should be prepared to subsidise the industry.In the case of the P-1127 the export prospects did not appear to be
such as to justify the heavy additional cost of continuing the project.Under the Defence Review the defence budget in 1969-70 would be 2,060 million (including the necessary contingency allowance)against the target of  2,000 million, owing to the earlier decision tocontinue with the P-1127. It was clear that savings which resulted from the new current defence studies would be reduced by anamount which could not yet be precisely defined if the P-1127 were continued. We could not afford to add to defence spending in thisway: we should therefore cancel the P-1127 and agree thatthere should be no replacement involving dollar expenditure. Unlesseffective steps were taken to limit public expenditure we faced theprospect of lower savings, a slower growth of consumption and increased taxation.The Secretary of State for Defence said that the P-1127 was thefirst operational V/STOL aircraft in the world. Its vertical take offperformance was limited and proposals for improving the enginehad not so far been practicable. Its short take off capability was however excellent. It was also virtually the only recent aircraft forwhich the timetable had been maintained and costs had not increased. As he had argued during the Defence Review, the P-l 127would be a useful plane which the Services would like to have. Butit must have a lower priority than the other reductions which theymight otherwise have to make to achieve a specified level ofexpenditure. Cancellation would be more difficult now and wouldprobably be impossible by the summer of 1967, when the new defence studies were due to be completed. The maximum savingwhich would result from cancellation would be  130 million over10 years. This was on the basis of a purchase of 110 P-l 127s. one aspect of particular difficulty was that there was an especially heavyincidence of expenditure on the P-1127 in 1970-71, the year whichhad been fixed for the achievement of the reduced level of defence expenditure, though averaged over a period of years the difference was much less marked. If the purchase were limited to 70 and ifthe new studies showed that no more were required, the savingsmight be about  70 million over the 10-year period. If alternativeaircraft had to be provided to replace 110 P-l 127s the dollar expenditure would be about  40 million. If it proved possible tomake do with fewer P-l 127s, alternative aircraft might be providedwithout any dollar expenditure. Whatever the outcome of the newstudies it would be essential to provide our forces with aircraft forclose support but if the P-1127 were continued we should be buyingthis capability, for industrial and political reasons, at a higher costthan would be necessary for purely defence reasons. No firmjudgment was possible about export prospects. As a new andtechnologically advanced plane there might prove to be a goodmarket for it. Sales of the Lightning were proving to be substantialalthough its export prospects had initially appeared much less. If theP-1127 were continued it must be accepted that defence savings tobe achieved by 1970-71 would be less than they would otherwise
have been. Against this must be set the effect of cancellation onthe aircraft industry, including the possibility that the Governmentwould be unable to carry through their plans for the airframecompanies. He had just been informed that the French Governmenthad decided to continue with the Anglo-French V/G project; butif we cancelled the P-1127 they might well seek to impose conditionswhich it would be difficult to accept. The balance of all thearguments, looking at the issue as a whole and not solely from thepoint of view of defence, seemed to be in favour of continuation.In discussion there was a division of opinion. On the one hand it was argued that the overriding need was to reduce defence expenditure and that a failure to do so would cause more damage tothe standing of the Government than a decision to cancel the P-1127.There was no reason to suppose that the other decisions whichwould be required to achieve large reductions in defence expenditure would be any easier than the one which the Government now faced.It was accepted that the P-1127 would be more expensive than thealternative ways of providing the necessary military capability. Ifthe project were continued there would either be an increase in defence spending or other reductions would have to be acceptedwhich would be even more damaging to our interests. continuation of the project would amount to subsidising the aircraft industry;but the industrial subsidies which the Government had undertakenalready imposed a severe strain on our available resources. indeed it was arguable that such expenditure could be reduced more readily,and with greater advantage, than some fields of defence expenditure,so permitting an expansion of the social services. It was often argued that we must maintain a technological lead but it did not follow thatthis was true in all fields. There might indeed be industrialadvantage in reducing the spread and extent of our expenditure onadvanced technology. In particular, there was a good case for reducing the resources, both in skilled manpower and money, nowdeployed in the aircraft industry.As against this, there was much support for the view thatthere had been no change in the P-1127 programme which affected the decisions reached by the Cabinet in February and by the defence and Oversea Policy Committee in March. The reason why thematter was now being reconsidered was the need for further defenceeconomies. The project could not however be judged solely in defence terms. Many of the most promising developments in thecivil field had originated from defence projects. We had a clearlead in V/STOL technology and the cancellation of the P-1127would mean the abandonment of this field to other countries, suchas the United States and Germany, which were embarking onV/STOL development. We might in the upshot have to buy theaircraft so produced, thus subsidising expenditure by those countries on research and development, which would be assisted by the skilled men who might be expected to emigrate from the United kingdom in consequence of a decision to cancel the P-1127. In securingdefence economies the reduction of our oversea commitments was
CC 68 (66)likely to be more important than economies in equipment. Evenif cancellation of the project would produce savings in budgetaryterms it seemed likely that there would have to be substantialincreased expenditure in foreign exchange, which we could not afford. A further important consideration was the effect of cancellation on the aircraft industry and on the standing of theGovernment. A firm decision to continue the project had beentaken in 1965; if this were now changed it would be taken to mean that we should never be ready to carry any project to completionand the Government would appear to lack consistency of purpose.Cancellation of the P-1127 would in fact mean, that no major new aircraft project would be capable of being undertaken in the future;the position, both politically and for the industry, would be intolerable.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that in agreeing to continue the P-1127 in February the Cabinet had accepted that the defence budget in 1969-70 might have to exceed the target figure of  2,000 million at 1964 prices. The fact that further defencestudies were now being undertaken, with a view to achieving further substantial economies (for which no figure had been set) must betreated with the strictest secrecy since any publicity would lead toanxieties in many parts of the world and pressure from our allies,the effect of which would be sharply to reduce the prospect of achieving the savings required.The discussion showed that the Cabinet were on balance infavour of continuing the P-1127. Although there could be no certainty, there seemed a reasonable possibility of export sales andthe need for purchases at substantial cost in foreign exchange if the project were cancelled could not be discounted. There might wellbe a case for a switch of resources from defence to civilian researchbut many of the technicians now engaged in the aircraft industry might prefer to seek employment abroad, particularly as othercountries were continuing research and development in this veryspecialised field. A further consideration was the degree to whichthe Government were committed to the P-1127 and the effect ontheir standing if the project were cancelled. The outcome of thenew defence review would depend primarily on the degree to whichwe could reduce our oversea commitments; difficult decisions wouldbe required but there seemed to be a good possibility that we should succeed in achieving further savings. It would not however bepossible to say now that the decision to continue the P-1127 mustbe balanced by any particular cut elsewhere in the defence budget.It was agreed that the present decision would apply to a firm ordernow for the 60 aircraft for which contracts&apos; were being negotiatedand that there should be a further order for 10 dual aircraft whenthe necessary project studies and contracts had been worked out. Adecision on the balance of 40 aircraft should await the outcome ofthe new defence studies in mid-1967.
The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Agreed that the P-1127 should be continued and that a firmorder should be placed for 60 aircraft, to be followed byan order for 10 dual aircraft at a later stage.MotorIndustryRootesMotors, Ltd.(previous reference:CC (66) 67thConclusions,Minute 5)secret. *The Cabinet resumed their discussion of proposals for thefuture of Rootes Motors Limited (Rootes).The Minister of Technology said that, following the cabinet&apos;s previous discussion, he had explored further the possibility of an effective British alternative to the proposal that funds should beprovided by, and voting control of Rootes should pass to, the chrysler Corporation (Chrysler). After consultation with the PrimeMinister and other Ministers directly concerned he had indicated tothe Chairman of the British Motor Corporation (BMC) and LeylandMotors Limited (Leyland) that the Government would be preparedto put up one-third of the capital required to buy out the existingshareholders of Rootes (including Chrysler) and provide the necessarydevelopment capital, if BMC and Leyland were also each preparedto put up equal shares. The resulting holdings would have had tobe written down to a value of about one-third of the actualinvestment. It had become clear that neither BMC nor Leyland was prepared to co-operate in a joint takeover of Rootes on this basis:they would probably be prepared to find  20 million for the new development capital required, but would not be prepared to put upmore than  5 million for the written down value of their share ofthe Rootes capital. To have proceeded on this basis would have involved the Government in providing some  30 to  40 million ofcapital to buy out Chrysler and other holders at historic cost, andthe value of this capital investment would have had to be substantiallywritten off.He had also pursued with representatives of Chrysler thepossibility of their giving undertakings, on the development ofRootes (particularly at Linwood) and on exports, which would enablethe Government to accept their proposal for a further investment inRootes involving the passing of voting control of Rootes to Chrysler.The representatives of Chrysler were prepared to recommend totheir board undertakings on the following lines:(i) Chrysler would not initiate any action to impair either thehome or oversea operations or the management ariddirection under the Rootes Board of Rootes as a british company in its relations with the Government, labour,its British shareholders, and the public.(ii) Chrysler would undertake to maintain a majority of BritishDirectors on the Board of Rootes.
(iii) Chrysler would confirm the plans of expansion coveringdevelopment work at various factories, and especially atLinwood in Scotland where the major development wouldtake place and where it was planned to increaseemployment by several thousands; these plans were essential if Rootes were to remain competitive, achieve their proper share of exports and return to reasonable,profitability.(iv) Chrysler would plan to achieve a progressive increase in theexport of Rootes products without restriction to all practicable markets and to continue to make availableits full international organisation for this purpose. Theynoted that, in the view of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, the test of the fulfilment of this undertaking would be that theexport percentage of the products of the Rootes group should be at least as good as the average for the Britishmotor vehicle industry as a whole.(v) Chrysler would nominate a Rootes Director (British) to each of the Boards of Simca and Chrysler International;and it was understood that a Simca Director (French)would be nominated to the Board of Rootes.(vi) Chrysler would confirm its intention to leave at least 15 percent of the entire equity capital (Ord., &quot; A &quot; Ord. andPref. Ord.) in the hands of shareholders other thanChrysler; provided that in calculating this 15 per centChrysler might take into account any shares held by theIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation (1958-59) or put bythe 1958-59 to Chrysler (in accordance with (vii) below).(vii) Provided that Chrysler acquired Preferred Ordinary Stockin excess of its rights entitlement of about  6-2 millionnominal, it would make available to the 1958-59 at a cost upto  1-5 million nominal of such excess, i.e., up to 15 percent of the total Preferred Ordinary Stock, of  10 million,on condition that the 1958-59 participated to the same percentage in Chrysler&apos;s undertakings to subscribe up to 10 million Unsecured Loan Stock. The 1958-59 wouldhave the right on 1st January, 1972, to put these securitiesto Chrysler at par plus any accrued but unpaid dividendor interest.(viii) The 1958-59 would have the right to nominate one Director onRootes Board as long as it owned the securities mentionedabove.The last two of these undertakings would arise only if the Board ofthe 1958-59 endorsed them.The undertakings would be considered by the Board of Chrysleron 5th January; until that date it was essential to maintain thehighest degree of secrecy. Thereafter, if the undertakings were accepted by Chrysler and agreement were reached accordingly, theycould be made public.SECRET7703-2 b
He had also considered with the 1958-59, BMC and Leyland thepossibility of a statement on machinery for co-ordinating the exporteffort of BMC and Leyland, who would be the two remaining british firms in the industry after control of Rootes passed to Chrysler.It seemed likely that agreement would be reached upon a statement and subsequently upon suitable machinery; this would strengthen the competitive position of the two firms in oversea markets andmight well be the first step towards closer co-ordination, and perhap seven an eventual merger, between BMC and Leyland.In discussion there was general agreement that the only Britishalternative to the control of Rootes passing to Chrysler would be extremely costly to the Government and was not practicable,however regrettable this might be. The assurances given by Chryslerwould not only safeguard production at Linwood but lead to itsexpansion; Chrysler had been left in no doubt about the standards of export performance which Rootes would be expected to achieve;and it had been made clear to them that for any further expansionthey would, like any other firm, be subject to the granting&apos; ofindustrial development certificates. If eventually BMC andLeyland-Rover were to merge, the motor car industry in this country would consist of four firms; three of them would be United Statescontrolled, but the fourth, British controlled, firm would still beresponsible for 50 per cent of the industry&apos;s output.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) It was in some ways unfortunate that the first action of theIRC would be taken under its special powers, and care would haveto be taken that the Government did not rely too exclusively on theIRC for action in the event of further issues of this nature arising.Nonetheless the use of the 1958-59 in this case was not only inevitablebut completely justified.(b) There would be some political criticism of the Governmentfor not pursuing the alternative possibility of public ownership but itwas clear that this was wholly impracticable: the Minister of technology, in consultation with the Lord President of the Council,would need to consider how best this criticism might best be answered.(c) It was intended to preserve the secrecy of these proposalsuntil after the meeting of the Chrysler Board on 5th January. TheMinister of Technology should, however, be prepared to make astatement at short notice in case of any leak in the meantime.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposals for a further investment by Chryslerin Rootes, involving the passing of the voting control of Rootes toChrysler, subject to the undertakings described by the Minister of technology which the representatives of Chrysler would be puttingto their Board. The Cabinet welcomed the achievement of theMinister in securing such advantageous undertakings, which should ensure a continuing contribution by Rootes to the development of theBritish economy.
The Cabinet-Agreed that Government approval should be given to afurther investment in Rootes Motors Limited by the chrysler Corporation, involving the passing of votingcontrol of Rootes to Chrysler, subject to the Board of Chrysler confirming their willingness to give undertakings to Her Majesty&apos;s Government (which would be! for publication) in the terms described by the Minister of technology.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd December, 1966.
