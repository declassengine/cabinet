CONFIDENTIAL- 3  321CC 52 (66)confidential parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.SundayEntertainment(previous reference:CC (65) 35thConclusions,Minute 7)confidential. The Minister without Portfolio said that the Home AffairsCommittee had recently considered the issues of policy arising onthe Sunday Entertainment Bill which Lord Willis was about tointroduce in the House of Lords. He recalled that the Cabinet had considered the recommendations of the departmental committee onthe Law on Sunday Observance (the Crathorne Committee) on1st July, 1965, and had agreed that Parliament should be given anopportunity to pronounce on the recommendations but that this could best be achieved if a Bill were introduced in Private Members&apos;time, all decisions being left to a free vote. It had also been agreedthat the Governments should be ready to offer drafting facilities, butthat no undertaking could be given to provide Government time forthe Bill in Parliament. Although no Private Member had taken thematter up at the time, Lord Willis had subsequently announced his intention of introducing a Bill in the House of Lords and had beengiven assistance in drafting it. The proposals in his Bill, however,differed in some important respects from the recommendations ofthe Crathorne Committee. In particular, whereas the CrathorneCommittee recommended that no professional sporting events shouldbe allowed on Sundays, Lord Willis&apos;s Bill would permit on Sundaymornings events for which no charge was made for admission,provided that they were not primarily intended for spectators. TheCrathorne Committee recommended that amateur events should beallowed after 12.30 p.m. on Sundays, whereas Lord Willis&apos;s Bill would allow events after 2 p.m. whether professional or amateur and whetheror not they were primarily intended for spectators, so long as nocharge was made for admission. The Home Affairs committee considered that these proposals might be more contentious and moredifficult to apply than the corresponding recommendations of theCrathorne Committee. They had, therefore, concluded that, while a free vote should be allowed, the attitude of the government spokesman in the debate on Lord Willis&apos;s Bill in the House of lords should be one of strict neutrality and in particular that no assuranceshould be given that facilities would be accorded to the Bill in theHouse of Commons. They had also concluded that furtherconsideration should be given to the policy to be adopted in respectof Sunday entertainment in the light of the debate in the House ofLords on Lord Willis&apos;s Bill.In discussion there was general agreement with this view.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the lord privy Seal, to arrange for the Government spokesman
in the debate on Lord Willis&apos;s Bill to be guided by the considerations indicated by the Minister without Portfolio.(2) Invited the Minister without Portfolio to arrange for the government&apos;s policy on Sunday entertainment to befurther considered in the light of the debate in the Houseof Lords on Lord Willis&apos;s Bill.SECRETLegislativeProgrammeHomosexualLaw Reform(previous reference:CC (65) 28thConclusions,Minute 5)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C (66) 144) on homosexual law reform.The Home Secretary recalled that the Committee on HomosexualOffences and Prostitution (the Wolfenden Committee) had recommended that homosexual acts in private between consentingadults should cease to be unlawful. When the Cabinet had previouslydiscussed the matter in connection with a motion by Lord Arran inthe House of Lords, it had been decided that the Government should adopt a neutral attitude on the principles involved and in particularthat no undertaking should be given to provide Parliamentary timefor a Private Membefs Bill. Since then the House of Lords hadtwice passed Lord Arran&apos;s Bill to give effect to this recommendationof the Wolfenden Committee, while the House of Commons had given a Second Reading to a similar Bill and had subsequently givenMr. Abse leave under the Ten-Minute Rule to introduce a Bill whichhad now been published and was for all practical purposes identical with Lord Arran&apos;s Bill.While the Government should still adhere to its neutral attitude on principles, it would be under strong criticism, in view of the recentvotes in both Houses, if some time were not provided to enableMr. Abse&apos;s Bill to make progress. Further, if the matter were left in abeyance, there would be continuing difficulty in administering the criminal Law in this field. The arguments for providing Governmenttime to the Bill were similar to those which had obtained in the caseof Mr. Silverman&apos;s Bill to abolish capital punishment. In thesecircumstances the balance of advantage lay in making availablehalf a day of Government time for the Second Reading debate on mr. Abse&apos;s Bill.In discussion it was pointed out that, despite the shift ofopinion disclosed by the votes in both Houses, there were still strong feelings on the issues involved. It was suggested that to giveGovernment time for the Bill might be widely interpreted as indicating Government support and that it might prove difficult to resist pressure for further Government time for the Report and third Reading if the Bill ran into difficulties. The fact that noPrivate Member had chosen to take the matter up until Mr. Abse had raised it under the Ten-Minute Rule would make it difficult to justifyproviding Government time, and to give priority to this Bill would be criticised by the sponsors of other Private Members&apos; Bills who would seek similar preferential treatment.
3fJ oCC 52 (66)On the other hand, it was argued that Government time fordiscussion of the Bill could be justified without compromising theneutral attitude of the Government by the fact that a majority in both Houses had been shown to favour the implementation of theWolfenden Committee&apos;s recommendation in this respect. The risk that further Government time would have to be given might be avoided if it were made clear at the outset that thereafter the bill would have to follow the usual course without Government assistance.It was also suggested that, since there would otherwise be a continuingcampaign to give effect to this recommendation of the WolfendenCommittee, it would be preferable to provide the opportunity for anearly debate.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that on a balance of considerations a half dayof Government time should be made available for a Second reading debate on Mr. Abse&apos;s Bill. The Governments attitude should be oneof neutrality and a free vote allowed but it should be made clearthat the Government were in no way committed to giving furthertime for the Bill.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with the HomeSecretary and the Chief Whip, to arrange that half a dayof Government Parliamentary time should be madeavailable for a Second Reading debate on Mr. Abse&apos;s Bill.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the debate on mr. Abse&apos;s Bill to be conducted in the manner indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up of their discussion.SECRETOverseaAffairsSouth-WestAfrica(previous reference:CC(66) 36thConclusions,Minute 2)4. The Foreign Secretary said that a resolution on South-WestAfrica would shortly be put to the vote in the General Assembly ofthe United Nations. This would raise serious difficulties for us,since the resolution was far from satisfactory, despite our attempts to secure suitable amendment. The resolution not only declared that south Africa had forfeited her mandate over South-West Africa butalso that the United Nations should assume responsibility for it. Thiswas wholly impracticable, since the United Nations had not themachinery either to take over the mandate nor to administer theterritory thereafter. He had accordingly instructed the UnitedKingdom Representative at the United Nations to abstain from voting on the resolution but to explain that this action was takensolely because the resolution proposed the assumption of a responsibility by the United Nations which they could not discharge.It seemed probable that a number of other nations would similarlyabstain, including the United States, Australia and some european countries.
Nigeria(previous reference:CC(66) 51stConclusions,Minute 4)In discussion it was generally recognised that despite ourrepeatedly declared opposition to the policy of apartheid in SouthAfrica, the right course was to abstain from voting on either this orother resolutions which purported to commit the United nations organisation to action which it could not carry out. There was considerable support for the view that there might be advantage in giving further consideration to the general policy which theGovernment should adopt on resolutions of such a nature in theUnited Nations and to the assumption by United Nations bodiessuch as the Committee of Twenty-Four of rights which they did not possess under the Charter.The Commonwealth Secretary said that there had been no substantial change in the position in Nigeria since he had lastreported it to the Cabinet. The Constitutional Council had adjournedand though it was due to meet again that day there was littlepossibility that the Eastern Region would be represented. Therewas reason to hope that a general breakdown of the Federationduring the course of the next few weeks might be avoided and consideration was being given to the possibility of a mission of commonwealth representatives which might help to bridge thepresent gap between the Northern and Eastern Regions. This andother aspects of the situation would be considered the following day by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee. Meanwhile, it was satisfactory that United Kingdom nationals did not appear to be inany danger.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary andthe Commonwealth Secretary.SECRETTelecommuni-cationsIndustry and post OfficeProcurementPolicy5. The Cabinet considered a joint memorandum by theMinister of Technology and the Postmaster-General (C (66) 145) onthe future procurement policy of the Post Office in relation to the telecommunications industry.The Postmaster-General said that the supply of subscribers&apos;telephone apparatus was at present regulated by a Bulk SupplyAgreement (BSA) under which five major firms were guaranteedorders for 75 per cent of the apparatus required. This would expirein March 1968 and it had already been announced that it would notbe renewed. It was now necessary to make an announcement aboutthe arrangements which would apply following the termination of theAgreement in order that the industry might have adequate time tomake preparations. It was common ground between himself andthe Minister of Technology that as from March 1968 a system of open competitive tendering should be introduced: but there was a division of view about the longer-term arrangements. The Ministerof Technology proposed that there should be a joint production unit,comprising the Post Office and the five main firms, which would
&quot; 7 323CC 52 (66)become the sole supplier. If this proposal were adopted, it would be essential in any announcement of future arrangements to make itclear to the industry that competitive tendering was only an interimpolicy. Any such announcement would cause confusion in theindustry and the benefits of competitive tendering would not in factmaterialise. The industry was not basically inefficient and the declinein its share of world exports was primarily due to the monopolyconditions created by the BSA. The solution proposed by theMinister of Technology would enhance the present monopolistictendencies and fail to promote the industry&apos;s ability to compete in international markets.If the joint production unit proposed by the Minister of technology were to be merely a holding company, there would be nogain to industrial efficiency. If on the other hand it involved thecreation of a single large production unit, this would call for heavy capital investment, would remove competition, and would have unfortunate consequences for the development areas where existingfactories might be closed. The analogy between the solutionproposed by the Minister of Technology and the system in sweden and the United States was misleading since in both those countries there was effective competition between a number of organisations.A further objection was that it would separate the production ofsubscribers&apos; telephone apparatus from the rest of the tele-communications industry, which was technologically undesirable.If competitive tendering were introduced from March 1968 thiswould not be incompatible with the establishment in due course of a consortium for exports only. It would also be desirable to strengthenarrangements for joint facilities with the industry for research and development and to hold discussions with the industrial reorganisation Corporation (1958-59) on the future structure of theindustry.The Minister of Technology said that this was the first major issue of Government procurement policy which fell to be decidedsince it had been agreed to make increased use of procurement as an instrument for raising industrial efficiency. It would have been preferable to consider the matter against the background of thereport on public sector procurement policy which would shortly beavailable, but this was not possible since the prospective terminationof the BSA and the fact that the new Deputy Chairman of the PostOffice Board (whose previous firm was involved) would shortly betaking up duty made an immediate announcement necessary. Theproposal for a joint production unit for the supply of subscribers&apos;apparatus had been under study for some time: and the change inthe status of the Post Office about 1968 would facilitate theintroduction of a radical industrial change at the same time. Thefigures of exports for the first half of 1966 showed that we werelosing ground rapidly to the Swedes and Germans: a basic causewas the separation of the Post Office, as the major customer, from theindustry. A joint production unit would enable the industry to work
more effectively with the Post Office in defining requirements, would secure the maximum integration of the expertise of the Post office in marketing, design ani production and that of the manufacturers and would thus lead to a scale of production comparable with thatof major United States firms. The real element of competition arose from foreign firms generally rather than competitive tendering in theUnited Kingdom. If however we were to go no further than theintroduction of competitive tendering, the method proposed for thiswould not eliminate the smaller and less efficient manufacturers andwould thus weaken the competitive ability of the industry. Theannouncement on future policy should therefore be in terms whichwould permit the Government to establish a joint production unit indue course if further examination, in the first instance by officials,should substantiate its advantages.In discussion, it was questioned whether the structural changes that were desirable in the industry would be secured simply byending the BSA and introducing open tendering. There was no assurance that the latter would lead to more effective competition;indeed it might rather accelerate the emergence of a strong privatemonopoly. In these circumstances, it would accord with theGovernments general policy to introduce an element of public ownership into the industry by establishing a joint production unit.This would enable the Government to keep an effective check on costs, prices and industrial efficiency.On the other hand, it was argued that a decision ought not to betaken on the establishment of a joint production unit without much further examination of its implications and against the background of the forthcoming report on procurement policy in thepublic sector. If an announcement were made now foreshadowingthis solution, a considerable time would inevitably elapse before ajoint production unit could be established, and this would lead to a prolonged period of confusion and uncertainty in the industry.While a single consortium with Post Office participation might possibly be the solution in the long run, it was not immediatelypracticable and a change to competitive tendering, coupled with theuse of procurement policy to secure rationalisation of the industry,would in any event be the best initial step. It seemed improbablemoreover that competitive tendering would lead to the emergence ofa private monopoly in this field since it was only a small part of theactivities of the very large firms in question.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that anearly announcement was necessary and on balance the Cabinet took the view that it would be premature to decide now on theestablishment of a joint production unit. The Postmaster-general should therefore announce the introduction of competitive tenderingas from March 1968 on the lines proposed in paragraph 4 of thememorandum. There was general agreement, however, that such astep might of itself be inadequate to secure the necessaryimprovement in the industry&apos;s competitive ability. There should therefore be further study of the need for changes in the structure of
CONFIDENTIALAberfan 6.   The Secretary of State for Wales said that he had little toDisaster acjcj t0 the public statements which had been made earlier in theweek by the Prime Minister and himself. The latest figures forcasualties were that 145 bodies had been recovered (of which 114were children) and 141 identified. There was reason for concern atthe uncertainty about the number of those who might still be missing:a figure of 50 had been widely mentioned, but a more realistic figuremight be of the order of 10. It seemed unlikely that in such a smallcommunity the number both of children and of occupants of&apos;/ individual houses would not be well known: two or three passers-bymight also have been killed, but hardly more. It was possible thatsome bodies on the site might never be recovered.To sit under the chairmanship of Lord Justice Edmund Davieshe had appointed as additional members of the Tribunal Mr. HaroldHarding, an eminent consulting engineer, and Mr. Vernon Lawrence,a former Clerk of the Monmouth County Council. Lord JusticeDavies was pursuing the enquiry urgently and hoped to hold a preliminary hearing of evidence in about a fortnight. The fullenquiry would necessarily take some considerable time and an interim report would be made if the Tribunal considered that thiswould be of value. Under the legal aid procedure the bereavedfamilies did not qualify for legal aid for representation before theTribunal. It was clearly important that they should be properlyrepresented. In these circumstances means should be found ofproviding the cost, under the legal aid procedure, of a single team oflawyers to represent all those families who wish to take advantageof this course, though it would naturally be open to anyone who wished to arrange separate representation.CC 52 (66)the industry, leading to early discussions with the 1958-59. Furtherconsideration should also be given to the possibility of an industrialconsortium for exports.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Postmaster-General to make an immediate announcement, on the lines indicated in paragraph 4 ofC (66) 145, that a system of competitive tendering wouldbe introduced following the expiry in March 1968 of theBulk Supply Agreement for the supply of subscribers&apos;telephone apparatus.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theMinister of Technology and the Postmaster-General, toarrange for further study of the need for changes in the structure of the telecommunications industry, includingthe possibility of establishing a consortium for exports,and for early discussion of these questions with theIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation.
confidential the Aberfan colliery was not at present working and the miners were employed by the National Coal Board on stabilising the tip.Normal work would not start again in the colliery until after theBoard had consulted both the Minister of Power and himself.In discussion there was full agreement that provision for legal aid should be made on the lines proposed by the Secretary of State.Concern was, however, expressed at two aspects of the enquiry:(a) The timetable gave cause for anxiety. The delay in takingevidence from those immediately concerned would inevitably involvethe risk that the memory of precisely what had happened would by then be blurred. Equally important, there would be grave public concern that the causes of such a disaster, and therefore anyconsideration of action which should be taken to avoid a repetitionelsewhere, would be so long delayed. It was recognised that theprocedure which had been followed in earlier Tribunals necessarilyinvolved considerable delay, since it required the taking of evidenceby the Treasury Solicitor before a case could be presented to theTribunal. It was, however, urged that the issues of the present instance differed radically from those in earlier Tribunals, owing tothe wholly different nature of the event. There was general agreement that the procedure should be considered by the Ministers immediately concerned with a view to a much shorter timetable both for the initiation and for the completion of the enquiry.(b) Concern was also expressed at the extent to which interviewswere still being carried out on television with people at Aberfan who might be witnesses before the Tribunal. This was highly prejudicial to the conduct of the enquiry. There was agreement that thePostmaster-General should be invited to make representations to the television companies concerned and that the Attorney-General shouldmake a statement in the House of Commons deploring the practice.In further discussion concern was expressed about the actionwhich was being taken in respect of some other dangerous tips where,for example, children were being kept away from school because oftheir parents&apos; fears of a similar disaster. It was suggested that inthese particular instances there would be advantage if the engineersof the National Coal Board who were inspecting the tips were joined by a representative of the Chief Inspector of Mines and perhaps bysome outside engineers.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Wales, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Attorney-General, to make arrangements for the provision of legal aid to bereaved families who wished to be represented ona collective basis at the Tribunal.(2) Invited the Attorney-General, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Lord Chancellor andthe Secretary of State for Wales, to consider what steps could be taken to ensure that hearings by the Tribunalwere opened and its report completed at the earliestpossible date.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,27th October, 1966.(3) Invited the Postmaster-General, in consultation with the attorney-General, to bring to the notice of televisioncompanies concerned the undesirability of televisinginterviews with persons who might be witnesses beforethe Tribunal, since this was highly prejudicial to theenquiry.(4) Invited the Attorney-General, in the light of the action taken under Conclusion (3) and in consultation with the.Secretary of State for Wales, to make a statement in theHouse of Commons on the undesirability of suchinterviews.(5) Invited the Minister of Power, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Wales, to consider in the light ofthe discussion the arrangements for the inspection ofparticularly dangerous tips similar to that which had caused the disaster at Aberfan.
