CC 61 (66)secret. The Cabinet had before them a note by the commonwealth secretary (C (66) 173) on mandatory sanctions against Rhodesia.The Commonwealth Secretary said that on his arrival in salisbury the previous Friday he had made no attempt to arrange a meeting with Mr. Smith, the leader of the illegal regime, and hadconfined his initial discussions to those with the Governor. Mr. smith had, however, asked for a meeting and had come to government house on the Saturday morning accompanied by a colleague and by two Rhodesian officials. This meeting had revealed no dispositionon Mr. SmiuYs part to move towards our terms for a settlement, but when he for his part had suggested that there was no value in continuing the discussion, Mr. Smith had then proposed that he andthe Commonwealth Secretary should meet alone with the Governor.At the ensuing meeting, the Chief Justice, Sir Hugh Beadle, had joined them and they had discussed the three major questions whichwe had put to Mr. Smith and on which we had received unsatisfactoryreplies from him:(i) On the first, that of unimpeded progress towards Africanmajority rule, Mr. Smith had previously maintainedthroughout the need for the retention by the rhodesian government of a &quot; braking mechanism to prevent what he termed premature African rule. In his reply to ourquestion on this, however, Mr. Smith appeared to haveconceded this issue and had stood only on the point thatit was necessary under the constitution to have power tocreate additional seats in the Legislature to meet therequirements of a growing population. This howeverwould still give the Rhodesian Government the power inpractice to defer an African majority, perhapsindefinitely. In the present discussion, the Chief Justicehad suggested that power could be given to the delimitation Commission to prevent the creation of newseats being carried out in such a manner as to alter theracial balance in the Legislature. This would meet ourown objective. Mr. Smith had appeared to accept thisproposal, but maintained his view that in addition up toa further 15 European seats should be created seriatimat such time as Africans gained &quot; A &quot; Roll seats in orderto gain a limited deferment of an African majority.(ii) As regards the Senate, Mr. Smith had originally proposedthat there should be 12 Africans in the Senate, six ofwhom would be Chiefs, and that the Senate should votetogether with the Lower House on constitutionalamendments, thus giving the Africans a &quot; blockingquarter &quot; of the total votes to prevent the amendment ofthe entrenched clauses of the constitution contrary to* Previously recorded as a Confidential Annex.SECRET7700-1 a 2
African interests. This proposal was not acceptable tous, since it seemed probable that some, if not all, of theChiefs would be likely to vote with the Europeans onsuch issues. Mr. Smith had now offered to abandon theproposal for a Senate altogether and to accept theaddition of two &quot; B &quot; Roll seats, so giving the Africans a&quot; blocking quarter&quot; of the elected members of theLegislature by this means alone.(iii) On the issue of the return to legality, Mr. Smith was notprepared to accept the creation of a broad-based interim government on the lines contemplated in our statement,but he had said for the first time that he was prepared togive up independence at this stage, given agreement on constitutional proposals which would provide for subsequent recognised independence. Under pressure from the Chief Justice he had in the discussion gonefurther and said that he would consider returning to theposition obtaining before the illegal declaration of independence (i.d.i.), the test of the acceptability of theproposed new constitution being carried out subsequently.At the end of the discussion he himself had made it clear thathe had no authority from the Government to negotiate with Mr. Smithand apart from dictating a note of their discussion in the presence ofMr. Smith to ensure that there was no misunderstanding about it,he had not accepted proposals by Mr. Smith, either then orsubsequently, that there should be a further discussion between them before he returned to the United Kingdom. Broadly speaking, the upshot of his visit was to reveal that while Mr. Smith had made certain moves towards our requirements, these were still inadequate.It appeared however that there was some weakening of the cohesionof the Rhodesia Front Party and it was clear that Mr. Smith was anxious to continue the discussions. In a subsequent message hehad, for example, offered to reduce the phasing-in of the proposed15 additional European seats, so that each one was created not to match each African gain of an &quot; A &quot; Roll seat, but in response to each gain by Africans of two &quot; A &quot; Roll seats. It was difficult to assess how far in the last resort Mr. Smith would be prepared to goto meet our requirements. It would, however, be difficult to justifybreaking off the talks at this stage without any further attempt onour part to investigate whether the weakening in the regime would lead to their acceptance of our terms for a settlement.The Prime Minister said that at a meeting on the previous dayof the Ministers principally concerned it had been agreed that, since mr. Smith had made, or appeared ready to make, some concessions on the three key issues which we had put to him, it would no longer be appropriate to make a statement or issue the White Paper in theway previously envisaged. Mr. Smith&apos;s move might be purely tacticalbut it remained essential that if there were to be a break theresponsibility for it should be seen to rest fully on the illegal regime.This might be particularly important in regard to the policy of theSouth African Government.  It was perhaps rather more probable
that Mr. Smith was now seriously concerned about the imposition of mandatory sanctions, the effect of which he might indeed over-estimate. There were indications that South Africa, and perhapsalso Portugal, were exerting strong pressure on him in favour of asettlement. The concessions which Mr. Smith had made and hisapparent readiness to end the rebellion made it difficult to justify a break at this stage. Even if we could now do so it would be hard todefend such a decision some months hence if mandatory sanctionshad by then imposed further burdens on our economy and if therewere repercussions in Zambia affecting our copper supplies. It wasnot yet established that Mr. Smith had moved far enough to enable a settlement to be reached but we could not lightly reject thepossibility that he would do so. On the other hand we couldnot abandon our timetable or defer by more than a few days the action which would have to be taken in default of a settlement,both at the United Nations and in regard to a debate on Rhodesiain Parliament. The Ministers principally concerned had thereforetaken the view that there must be a final meeting to establish whetheror not Mr. Smith would now accept a settlement on our terms. If hewould not, we should proceed with action in the Security Counciland, provided there were Commonwealth support, would make thedeclaration that there would be no independence before majority rule. In order to establish Mr. Smith&apos;s position it was proposed thathe should be invited to a meeting with the Commonwealth secretary and himself to which the Governor would also be invited. Themeeting could be held on British territory outside the UnitedKingdom and Rhodesia. The purpose of the meeting would be todetermine whether Mr. Smith was prepared to accept our terms andit would be made clear to him that he must have full authority totake decisions at it. Such a meeting could take place later in thepresent week but must be concluded by 3rd December. As theCommonwealth Secretary had indicated, it now seemed possible that agreement might be reached on future constitutional arrangements in conformity with the six principles. The position was much lessclear in regard to the return to legality. Mr. Smith had previouslymaintained that the illegal regime must remain in power during the test of Rhodesian opinion in accordance with the fifth principle. Hewas now apparently prepared to agree that the return to legality andto the 1961 Constitution should take place before the test ofRhodesian opinion. There must, however, be safeguards to ensurethat if that test rejected the constitutional arrangements proposed for independence the Rhodesian Government would not declare asecond i.d.i. One such safeguard would be to have a Commonwealthforce stationed at Kariba. This would help President Kaunda andwould give us control over the important Zambesi crossing. Asecond safeguard would be to make it clear that our undertaking notto use force would not apply in the event of a second i.d.i. Thiswould not mean that we should be committed to use force but there might be a case for a limited use of force in support of sanctionswhich would not be open to the objections applying to a military
campaign to occupy Rhodesia. The withdrawal of the undertakingshould be a sufficient deterrent against a new i.d.i.In discussion it was on the one hand suggested that the proposed meeting with Mr. Smith would involve negotiations with the illegal regime a procedure which we had hitherto declared to be unacceptable. If the discussions at the meeting were based on the outcome of the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s visit to Salisbury other points of principle might be eroded. It would not be sufficient fora settlement to be formally in accordance with the six principlessince what mattered would be the way in which the principles wereinterpreted and applied. It had been suggested that the return tolegality might now be achieved by a return to the position existingbefore i.d.i. This implied that the present regime would continue in power with perhaps the addition of a few moderates and one or twoAfricans; this was quite a different conception from that of a broadly-based interim government, composed of members selected by us,which would mark a new start towards multi-racial rule. a continued British military presence in Rhodesia after independence would be an essential safeguard of the new constitution; but it wasnot clear that this would be one of the conditions on which we would insist. Quite apart therefore from the objection in principle to negotiation, it was difficult to form an opinion about the proposed meeting without a prior decision on the precise terms which wewould regard as essential for a settlement.On the other hand there was wide support in the Cabinet for theproposed meeting. It was the general view that we must establishwhether or not Mr. Smith was now genuinely anxious for a settlement and that this could not be done without definitive discussions withhim. The distinction between talks and negotiations was admittedlydifficult to draw: indeed it might be held to be somewhat unreal andthere could be no settlement or a return to legality withoutdiscussions which amounted to negotiation. However we should stillbe dealing with Mr. Smith as an individual and not as a Head ofGovernment. If, as some Ministers believed, Mr. Smith would not agree to meet our conditions and was only seeking to place theresponsibility for a break on the United Kingdom Government, itwas still essential that we should demonstrate this to be the case.Even on this view, the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s visit to Salisburywas amply justified since, if it had not taken place, Mr. Smith would,by declaring his willingness to make concessions, have been able torepresent the United Kingdom Government as responsible for the break and for failure to reach a negotiated settlement. Given ourtimetable, there was no practical alternative to a meeting betweenthe Prime Minister and Mr. Smith if this position were to be clarified. If, as was perhaps more probable, Mr. Smith was nowanxious for a settlement and might be prepared to make the necessaryconcessions the arguments for the proposed meeting were even morecompelling. A settlement which we could defend to public opinion in this country and elsewhere would be a far better outcome thanrecourse to the United Nations for mandatory sanctions and adeclaration that we would no longer be prepared to  grant
CC 61 (66)independence before majority rule. We should in that event face a long conflict with no possibility of reaching a settlement with anyconceivable European regime in Rhodesia. Grave damage could beinflicted on the United Kingdom economy and the United Nationsmight be discredited, while the outcome would be likely to be moreharmful to the interest of the Rhodesian Africans themselves. since mr. Smith now seemed prepared to move towards our point of view,we must seize the opportunity of exploring and exploiting thepossibility of a settlement.As regards the terms on which we should insist, it was thegeneral view of the Cabinet that it would be unwise to attempt to define these in detail before the meeting. The Prime Minister andthe Commonwealth Secretary should have authority to negotiatewithin the terms of the six principles and in the light of the UnitedKingdom Governments statement of 15th October, bearing in mind the need for a settlement to be defensible to public opinion in thiscountry, in the Commonwealth and in the United Nations. Theremust be some room for negotiation and the prospects of the meetingbeing successful would be prejudiced if Mr. Smith were faced withan ultimatum the precise terms of which had been laid down inadvance. We should have to insist that a conclusion must be reached by 3rd December and that he should come to the meeting with fullpower to negotiate. He could, however, be provided with cypherfacilities so that he could if necessary consult his colleagues withinthe limited period during which the meeting would last.There was general agreement that although the precise detailsshould not be defined in advance there were a number of points which would have to be covered in any settlement. We must insist on a more broadly based Rhodesian Government after the return tolegality including some Africans. There would be a number of ways in which this might be achieved and so long as the principle was observed the details would be less important. It would also be essential that the rebellion should be seen to have ended before thenew government was formed. There would have to be satisfactory arrangements in regard to the lifting of censorship, the release of atleast some detainees and the resumption of political activities. Itwould be desirable to ensure the control by the Governor of the rhodesian armed forces and police and some form of British or commonwealth military presence in Rhodesia. We should also make clear that our undertaking not to use force would not apply inthe event of a second i.d.i. It did not follow that we should use forceand, indeed, there would still be grave military and political difficulties about the use even of limited force in support of sanctions. Butthe removal of the undertaking and of the assurance which this gavemight have a considerable influence on Mr. Smith. The ultimatesafeguard which we should retain would be the fifth principle which meant that any independence constitution must be approved by thepeople of Rhodesia as a whole. It would be for the United KingdomGovernment to ensure that the test of Rhodesian opinion was
genuinely conducted but provided this were done it was illogical to argue that the Africans in Rhodesia could not be trusted to know what was in their best interests and at the same time to maintain that they were capable of assuming the government of the country.We must also bear in mind that the two African nationalist parties were deeply and bitterly divided and worked against each other. it seemed improbable that it would be possible for them tobe represented in the interim government. Moreover, onceconstitutional rule had been re-established we should be in a positionto resume the contacts with Rhodesia and the means of influencingEuropean opinion there which we had lost since i.d.i. and whichwould continue to be denied to us if we imposed mandatory sanctions and declared that independence would not be granted before majority rule. Mr. Smith would have to make major concessions if asettlement were to be achieved and once he had done so it shouldbe possible to ensure that he moved still further towards our pointof view. Alternatively he might be disowned by the Rhodesia Front;in this event the whole situation would change and we might find the rhodesian armed forces and police acting on the orders of theGovernor and Mr. Smith against the extremists.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet were agreed that we should propose a meeting with Mr. Smith on the lines he had suggested. Sir Morrice James,a Deputy Under-Secretary of State in the Commonwealth Office, wason his way to Salisbury and would, in consequence of the Cabinefsagreement, now be instructed to put this proposal to the governor and to Mr. Smith. If it were accepted he would announce theforthcoming meeting in Parliament on 30th November. meanwhile the strictest secrecy must be observed. A point which was likely tobe of great importance would be to give the Governor the assistancehe would need in order to exercise effective control over the rhodesian armed forces and police after a return to legality. Theappointment of suitable advisers to serve on his staff might be thebest way of ensuring this.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministefs summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Defence and the HomeSecretary, to consider the means by which the Governormight be assisted in exercising control over the rhodesian Armed Forces and police after the return tolegality.(3) Agreed to defer consideration of C (66) 173 until a later meeting.
Germany :TripartiteTalks(previous reference:CC (66) 50thConclusions,Minute 2)CC 61 (66)secret. The Prime Minister said that the President of the UnitedStates, President Johnson, had proposed that, in view of the delay(due to the change of Government in Germany) in the tripartite talks on the level and cost of British and American armed forces inGermany, the United States Government should place orders to thevalue of some  12-5 million in the United Kingdom in the nearfuture, provided that we agreed to make no change in our &quot; troopand supply dispositions in Germany &quot; until the tripartite talks hadbeen completed and that we then concerted with the United StatesGovernment on any changes in the light of these talks. This proposal had been considered by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committeewhich recommended that the offer be accepted.The United States offer appeared to be based on the calculationthat  12-5 million would amount to half the savings which they believed we could achieve in 1967-68 by logistic economies and thewithdrawal of troops. In fact the savings we could achieve byunilateral action in the first six months of 1967 would probably be substantially less and even on purely financial terms, therefore, therewas a strong case for accepting the Presidents offer. In addition there were of course strong political arguments against rejecting it.Acceptance must, however, be on certain clear conditions: the moneymust be received in 1967 and United States purchases in this country must be additional to what we would in any case sell to the UnitedStates, including sales under the offset arrangements in respect ofour purchase of F-111A aircraft. The President had assured us that both these conditions would be met. We would also need to ensurethat the United States purchases made a real contribution both toour balance of payments problem and to the reduction ofunemployment in this country. But the most important conditionwas that our acceptance of a moratorium on the withdrawal of troops and on our logistic savings should be for a strictly limited period.The United States payment, together with whatever payments we might hope to receive from Germany, would still fall far short of thetotal costs in foreign exchange of our forces in Germany and wemust be free to take such measures as we might consider necessary,not excluding the withdrawal of troops, in order to meet those costs in full in 1967-68. We should therefore make it clear in accepting the United States offer that, if by the end of June 1967 a satisfactory agreement had still not been reached in the tripartite talks, we shouldhave to regard ourselves as free to take whatever measures seemednecessary to us to cover the balance of those costs in full afterpayments by Germany and the United States payment of 12-5 million.In discussion there was general agreement that the offer of theUnited States Government should be accepted on the terms indicated by the Prime Minister.  The following points were also made:(a) At this stage it would be preferable to say as little as possibleto the Federal German Government about the offer and to seek to
get a substantial increase in the German offer of offset payments.Thereafter it would be necessary for us, in concert with the UnitedStates Government, to resume discussions in the North atlantic treaty Organisation on troop reductions and logistic savings.(b) There were strong arguments for initiating now the preparations necessary in the United Kingdom for providingaccommodation, both for troops and for their families, on theassumption that it would be necessary to make withdrawals of troopsin the second half of 1967, since otherwise our ability to make suchwithdrawals, if this proved necessary to meet our foreign exchangecosts, would be severely hampered. On the other hand, it would benecessary in taking any such action not to give the United StatesGovernment the impression that we were prejudging the outcome ofthe tripartite talks, or that we intended, in any event, to actunilaterally thereafter. This aspect should be further considered bythe Defence and Oversea Policy Committee at the same time as theCommittee considered the programme for the construction of married quarters for troops withdrawn from other areas.(c) The reply to President Johnson should make it clear that we expected the United States payment to be made in 1967, whether ornot it proved necessary for us to withdraw troops in the second halfof that year to achieve savings in foreign exchange on the conclusionof the moratorium which was envisaged.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the United States offer indicated by the PrimeMinister should be accepted on the conditions which hehad proposed and subject to the points made in discussion.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee to consider inthe light of the discussion the programme for theconstruction of barrack accommodation and married quarters for troops whom it might be necessary towithdraw from Germany in the second half of 1967, aswell as for troops withdrawn from other theatres inaccordance with the conclusions of the Defence Review.SECRETEconomicSituation(previous reference:CC (66) 53rdConclusions,Minute 1)3. *The Prime Minister said that the Ministerial steering committee on Economic Policy had been keeping developments inthe economy since July under regular and careful review, especially the trends in unemployment, which had risen faster than had been expected in July, and in investment in private industry. It was now clear that the totality of the July measures had administered a shock to industry which, though in many respects salutary, had caused a significant downturn in industrial investment, which had not been contemplated at the time.  The Steering Committee had considered* Previously recorded as a Confidential Annex.SECRET
the case for a limited general reflation of demand and, specifically,for reducing the hire purchase down payment for motor cars. Theywould be reconsidering this in the New Year; at the moment,however, there was general agreement that such a relaxation wouldbe premature: the motor industry needed to be given a little longer to complete the process of reducing its employment of surplus labourand to compete more vigorously for increased exports, and ^a relaxation of the hire purchase restrictions at present might be misinterpreted as a sign of uncertainty in the direction of policy. Asregards investment, some members of the Steering Committee had felt that a direct stimulus to investment at this time was unlikely to lead to an increase in the level of investment, and that industrial investment was unlikely to begin to revive until industry began to feel more optimistic about market prospects. The view of most members of the Committee, however, was that some incentive shouldbe given without delay: it was likely to have some direct effect, if only marginal, on the level of investment, and it would help to restore morale in industry by providing an indication of theGovernments determination to reflate selectively at the right timeand in the right way.The Committee had considered two possible stimuli toinvestment:(i) A suggestion by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI)that credit to the value of 80 per cent of investment grants for which the relevant expenditure had already been incurred should be made available against payments ofcorporation tax and income tax due on 1st January, 1967.(ii) A proposal that initial allowance should be reintroduced onthe net cost (cost less investment grant) of investmentqualifying for grant.The Committee had concluded that the first of these was preferable,if on further examination it proved to be administratively practicable;but that, if it were not practicable, the proposal for reintroducinginitial allowances should go forward.If the Cabinet agreed that some action should be taken to stimulate investment, it would be desirable to announce that actionin the forthcoming economic debate in the House of Commons. Ifan announcement were deferred until the following week, there wasa danger that the Government would be thought to be taking actionin response to pressure from outside rather than in pursuance of a considered policy. The announcement of a scheme to stimulateinvestment should be accompanied by an announcement of such measures as could be agreed in the time available for mitigating theeffects of the deflationary measures in the development areas.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, since the meeting ofthe Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Policy, he hadurgently re-examined the administrative practicability of a scheme of tax credits on the lines of the suggestion made by the CBI.  He was
satisfied as a result of that examination that it was not possible forthe Inland Revenue to prepare and issue the necessary instuctions in time for the scheme to come into operation at the beginning of1967. Strong objections would undoubtedly be raised byaccountants, who would be required to certify that investment expenditure appeared likely to qualify for grant; apart from anything else, it would be argued that the investment grant scheme was not sufficiently developed for accountants to be able to say with confidence whether particular expenditure would qualify for grant,and it would therefore be necessary to seek advice from the Boardof Trade. There was also a danger that the introduction of thisscheme could lead to a serious delay in the receipt of tax payments due in January 1967. It remained his view that the reintroduction of initial allowances would be entirely ineffective as a means of stimulating investment, as well as being inconsistent with the generalpolicy of relying on selective grants rather than upon tax allowances as a means of encouraging investment. If the Cabinet consideredthat some action should be taken to stimulate investment, in his view the least unsatisfactory action would be to increase the rates of investment grant by 5 per cent (to 25 per cent outside development areas and 45 per cent inside development areas) for a limited periodof time not exceeding two years. The cost of such a scheme wouldbe  55 million in 1968-69, though no expenditure would be incurred in 1967-68. It was essential that the increase should be temporary,in order to produce an immediate stimulus to investment; but theintroduction of a terminal date for the higher rates would presentconsiderable technical and administrative difficulties, and theGovernment would no doubt come under pressure to maintain thehigher rates indefinitely.The First Secretary of State said that the Ministerial Committeeon Environmental Planning had considered a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade on possible measures to mitigate theeffects of deflationary measures in the development areas. It shouldbe possible, with the co-operation of the Departments concerned, tomake more extensive use of the powers under the local employment Act of the Board of Trade to give assistance to basicservices in development areas, to make more use of the powers togive assistance on the clearance of derelict sites, and perhaps to makea further announcement on Government training centres. other proposals, for reinstating projects in the development areas that wereto have been deferred as a result of the measures taken on 20th July,for giving preference to the development areas in placing government contracts, and for slowing down the rate of colliery and railwayclosures, were being further considered. Enquiries were also beingmade to ascertain whether the guidance given to the banks on regional development was achieving the results intended.In discussion there was general agreement that in the forthcomingeconomic debate the Government should announce action to stimulateindustrial investment, and such measures in the development areas as could be settled in the time available. Other measures to maintainthe level of activity in the development areas, including the restoration
of cuts in the investment programmes of nationalised industries inthose areas, should be further considered by the ministerial committee on Environmental Planning.On the choice of the scheme for stimulating investment, it was argued that reintroduction of initial allowances on the net cost of investment qualifying for investment grant would present no practical difficulties and would have the psychological advantage ofbeing the measure most likely to commend itself to industry. Onthe other hand it was argued that, though small firms might prefer the reintroduction of initial allowances, many of the larger firmsfavoured the investment grant scheme, and an increase in the ratesof investment grants, as a means of stimulating investment, would bemore consistent with the general philosophy of the government&apos;s policy of replacing tax allowances by investment grants than would the reintroduction of initial allowances.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement in the Cabinet on the desirability of announcing in the forthcoming economic debate action to stimulateindustrial investment. The First Secretary of State, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Boardof Trade, should consider urgently whether it would be possible to announce in the debate the introduction of proposals to increase therates of investment grants to 25 per cent (and 45 per cent for development areas) for a period not exceeding two years. If it proved impossible to formulate proposals on these line, initialallowances should be reintroduced on the net cost of investmentqualifying for grant. The announcement of a scheme to stimulateinvestment should be supported by statements on measures to mitigate the effect of deflationary action in development areas, onthe lines indicated by the First Secretary of State.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that action to stimulate investment should beintroduced, and announced in the forthcoming economicdebate.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the President of theBoard of Trade, urgently to examine the feasibility ofincreasing the rates of investment grants to 25 per cent(and 45 per cent in development areas) for a period of18 months or two years, with a view to an announcement in the debate.(3) Agreed that, if an acceptable scheme for increasing the ratesof investment grants could not be devised, a decision toreintroduce initial allowances on the net cost of investment qualifying for investment grant should be announced in the debate.(4) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the
Board of Trade, to agree upon a statement to be madein the economic debate about measures to mitigate theeffects of deflationary action in development areas.(5) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Environmental Planning to giveconsideration to further measures to maintain the levelof activity in development areas, on the lines indicatedin discussion. yCabinet Office, S.W.1,29th November, 1966.
