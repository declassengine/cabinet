2. The Foreign Secretary said that the Minister of State forForeign Affairs (Lord Chalfont) had had discussions with the north vietnamese Charge d&apos;Affaires in Moscow in a further attempt tofind a means of negotiation on the conflict in Vietnam. It appearedso far that the North Vietnamese authorities had gone no further than a reaffirmation of their intransigent public announcements onthis subject and it would be necessary to await the return of thePrime Minister from Moscow before the outcome could be fullyassessed.President Sukarno had reorganised his Government by reducing,though not excluding, the participation of the Army. There hadbeen some sharp reactions and the outcome was as yet uncertain,but for the time being the President^ position had been strengthened.His determination to continue confrontation might well be greaterthan that of the army, but in any event the principal factor inweakening confrontation was the level of internal unrest in Indonesia.The Army had taken over control of the Government in a coup d&apos;etat. It appeared that this move was based primarily on internal dissensions and that it was unlikely that it would seriouslyalter Syria&apos;s external relations.The South African Government had adopted a neutral positionin relation to the embargo on trade with Rhodesia but recently aserious gap had developed in the oil embargo through the transit of oil over the Beit Bridge; and it was now clear that the South african government were not prepared to take specific measures to preventSouth African citizens breaking the embargo. The Prime minister had seen the South African Ambassador on the previous Saturdayand had made clear to him the serious international repercussionswhich might result.The Portuguese Government were seeking to maintain relationswith both sides in the Rhodesian situation. On the one hand theywere co-operating with the Zambian Government by facilitatingincreased railway traffic for the transit of goods and were willing toco-operate in an airlift to Zambia using Beira airport, provided onlycivil aircraft were used. At the same time there were reports, though these were as yet unconfirmed, that they were negotiating with the illegal regime in Rhodesia for certain Rhodesian exports, includingtobacco, to pass through Beira and that they had given permission1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
for the building there of crude oil storage tanks on behalf of the rhodesian Government.Venezuela(previous reference:CC (66) 2ndConclusions,Minute 1)An agreement had been signed as the result of a conference in geneva which he had attended earlier in the week between Venezuelaand British Guiana, which gave a highly satisfactory outcome of thedispute over the boundary between the two countries. It providedfor the establishment of a commission composed of representativesof the two countries which would have the task of examining all aspects of their relations and of seeking practical solutions to thecontroversies which had arisen over the Venezuelan contention thatthe arbitral award of 1899 about the frontier between British Guianaand Venezuela was null and void. The commission was enjoined toreport at six-monthly intervals and, if it had not led to an agreement in settlement of the dispute after four years, there would be recourse to the measures of conciliation provided under Article XXXIII ofthe United Nations Charter. It was agreed that the Secretary-General of the United Nations should determine which of thesemeans should be used in the first instance, but all would be tried in turn if necessary. All parties to the dispute had agreed not to advanceterritorial claims while the commission was sitting except in thecommission itself. All the Venezuelan political parties had been represented at the Geneva discussions and while this had involvedsome delay it was now extremely satisfactory that they were allcommitted to the agreement.The Cabinet-Rhodesia(previous reference:CC(66) 11thConclusions,Minute 2)UgandaGhana(1) Took note of this statement and congratulated the foreign secretary on the settlement which had been achieved ofthe dispute between Venezuela and British Guiana.The Commonwealth Secretary said that a meeting had beenheld earlier in the week of the Commonwealth Sanctions committee at which a full explanation had been given of the steps which theUnited Kingdom Government were taking in respect of the oil embargo. There had been general agreement among theCommonwealth representatives that we were doing all that waspossible in the circumstances.The Prime Minister of Uganda, Dr. Obote, had carried out a coup d&apos;etat with the aid of one section of the Army and of the Police.He had arrogated to himself some, if not all, of the powers previouslyexercised by the President and a number of other Ministers had been arrested. The outcome was, however, as yet uncertain.It had been reported earlier that morning that the Army and police had taken over the Government, during the absence of president Nkrumah on his visit to North Vietnam and communist china. The leaders of the coup had announced that the president and all the Ministers were dismissed and that the Convention People&apos;party was dissolved. It was at present too early to determine whether
Leisure in the 3. The Cabinet considered a note by the Minister of Land andCountryside Naturai Resources (C (66) 39), to which was attached the draft of aPaperWHlte    Wnite PaPer on Leisure in the Countryside: England and Wales.The Minister of Land and Natural Resources said that thedraft White Paper, which it was hoped to publish on 28th February,set out proposals which, with the approval of the Home AffairsCommittee, he had outlined in a speech to the Countryside 1970Conference in the previous November and had subsequentlydiscussed with the associations representing local authorities and withorganisations interested in the countryside, who were in generalagreement with the proposals. The principal features of the proposals were that the National Parks Commission should be reconstructedwith wider functions, including that of encouraging local initiative in the provision of facilities for public enjoyment of the countrysidegenerally; that county councils should be empowered to create&quot; country parks &quot; in open country within easy reach of large centres of population; and that local authorities should be empowered toprovide picnic places, camping sites and other facilities for the enjoyment of the country and should be given grants both for these purposes and to assist them in improving or preserving woodlands,removing eyesores, and purchasing land to provide access to open country. The White Paper undertook that the Government would seek, through consultation with the relevant authorities and interests,to increase facilities for the use for recreation of inland waterways,lakes and reservoirs and would discuss with coastal planning authorities measures necessary to preserve the coast. A questionremaining for consideration was whether the 75 per cent rate of grant, which already applied to work undertaken by local authorities within National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty,should be extended to the new work in the countryside generallywhich local authorities would, under the proposals in the white paper, be expected to undertake. He considered that a rate of 75 percent was appropriate and desirable on the grounds that the newfacilities would be used by visitors to the areas in question rather thanby local ratepayers, and that local authorities would be reluctant to spend the necessary money and to believe that the Government were serious in their support of the proposed policy if the rate of grant the coup had been completely successful, nor was any informationyet available about the position of members of the United kingdom military mission which was providing training for the Ghana armed forces.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statement by the Commonwealth Secretary.
were lower than that already obtaining in the National Parks. Inaddition, there would be a risk of embarrassing pressure to include in National Parks contiguous areas in which it was plainly desirable for work to be done.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, before agreeing tothe payment of grant at the rate of 75 per cent on the new work whichthe draft White Paper proposed should be undertaken, the cabinet should be aware of the risk of stimulating demands for a similar rateof grant for similar types of expenditure, such as that on city parks and village greens, and for the provision of sports facilities in urban areas. Demands of this kind would have to be resisted because theamount of money involved would be considerable. If it were accepted, however, that the 75 per cent grant proposed by theMinister of Land and Natural Resources should not be regarded asa precedent, except in relation to corresponding measures for thepreservation of the countryside in Scotland, he would be preparedto accept the proposal, but would prefer that the last sentence ofparagraph 14 of the draft White Paper should be amended to read:&quot; For the future, grant at the rate of 75 per cent on current expenditure and loan charges will be paid both for expenditure on national Parks and for what is proposed in this White Paper for the countryside generally.&quot;In discussion it was suggested that, if grant at 75 per cent were paid for the work proposed in the White Paper, the Governmentwould be under strong pressure from the Sports Council to pay asimilar grant for providing sports facilities, which were no lessnecessary to health and well-being in overcrowded urban areas than was access to the countryside. On the other hand, it was argued thatthe provision of facilities in the countryside could be distinguished \from provision in towns because expenditure on the former fell uponrelatively poor authorities and benefited persons other than theirown ratepayers and that, if effective measures for the preservation of the countryside were not taken quickly, the nation would lose anasset which was currently of increasing importance to the touristindustry and would in the future be essential to the health of an increasingly numerous population.The First Secretary of State, summing up this part of thediscussion, said that the Cabinet were on balance agreed that it wouldbe appropriate to pay grant at 75 per cent for the new work whichthe White Paper proposed that local authorities should undertake,but that this should not be treated as a precedent in relation to other forms of local expenditure.In discussion of the text of the draft White Paper the followingprincipal points were made:(a) The drafting of the first seven paragraphs of the white paper should be examined with a view to removing certain infelicitiesof style.(b) Paragraph 4 should be redrafted on the lines alreadyproposed to the Minister of Land by the First Secretary of State.
Commercial 4.   The Cabinet considered memoranda, by the Secretary ofPolicy State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries andMjtimum Price Food (c (66) 38) and by the chancellor of the Exchequer (C (66) 41)White Fish     on an Exchequer contribution to the cost of a statutory scheme of minimum prices for white fish.The Minister of Agriculture said that the White Fish authority had proposed a statutory scheme for fixing minimum prices for white fish designed to avoid the damage done to the fishing industry by very low prices in periods of glut. The Ministerial Committee onEconomic Development had agreed that the Government should(c) In paragraph 11 it should be made clear that the CountrysideCommission would have the function of advising local authorities,and not only the Government.(d) Paragraph 34 should be amended to forestall the possiblecriticism that the Governments policy of restraint on public spendingwas responsible for the fact that expenditure on sewage schemes wasnot always adequate.(e) It would be desirable to mention the importance of tourism,and possibly to refer to the British Travel Association and to the regional travel and tourist associations.The First Secretary of State, summing up this part of thediscussion, said that it would be convenient if Ministers who had anyfurther drafting amendments to suggest would send them to theMinister of Land and Natural Resources during the course of the afternoon. Subject to that and to consideration of the amendmentsalready proposed, the draft of the White Paper was approved.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that grant at the rate of 75 per cent should be paid on current expenditure and loan charges on the new workin the countryside which it was proposed that localauthorities should undertake, on the understanding thatthis would not be treated as a precedent in relation toother local authority expenditure.(2) Invited the Minister of Land and Natural Resources toconsider the amendments proposed in discussion and anyfurther drafting amendments which Ministers might suggest to him.(3) Subject to (2) above, approved the publication of a white paper on the Countryside in the form of the draft attached to C (66) 39.
accept the scheme in principle, but had asked for further study to bemade of its international implications. It had now been agreed by departments that the Danish and Norwegian Governments shouldbe consulted in advance of any public announcement. He was confident, however, that any international difficulties could be overcome. The principle of minimum price schemes for fish hadbeen accepted by the Fisheries Committee of the Organisation for economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Sweden alreadyoperated such a scheme, while Norway and Denmark imposed acomplete ban on landings of fish by foreign trawlers.The remaining point at issue was whether the Governmentshould contribute to the cost of the scheme. In his view it could notbe brought into force without an Exchequer contribution in the early years since the various sections of the industry could not judge inadvance how far they would individually benefit from it. If thescheme were not introduced, there would inevitably be demands for additional direct Government assistance to help those sections of theindustry which would suffer from the resultant instability in fishprices. Over  1^ million had been earmarked for special subsidies to help particular cases of hardship in the industry. Only a small part was at present used but in the absence of a statutory scheme thewhole of this money might well be required. Moreover, lack of stability would lead to a further decline in the United Kingdomfishing industry which would in turn lead to an increase in importsof fish. For these reasons a modest Exchequer contribution of halfthe cost, up to a limit of L\ million a year, would be fully justified.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that an exchequer contribution was essential. In the absence of a satisfactory minimum price scheme there would be chaos in the fishing industry whichwould hurt most those running the small inshore fishing fleet: thiswould undoubtedly lead to demands for additional direct Exchequersubsidies and in the interests of regional developments in Scotlandit was important to maintain the latter fleets.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that, although the ministerial committee on Economic Development had agreed to the introductionof a statutory minimum price scheme, there still remainedconsiderable doubts about its merits. Moreover, it would be premature to reach any decision while the existing voluntary schemewas still under consideration by the Restrictive Practices Court and before any international consultations had been undertaken. Evenif a statutory scheme were accepted, Exchequer assistance to its cost&apos;would not be justified. The case for introducing the scheme wasbasically that it would be of benefit to the fishing industry: if thiswas so the industry should be prepared to meet the cost. If theywere not prepared to do so, it was clear that they were not convincedthat the scheme was worth while and there would be no prospectof persuading them to meet the full cost at a later date; nor were there any grounds for believing that existing expenditure on directsubsidies to the fishing industry would be reduced by giving an exchequer contribution to this scheme.
Decimal 5.    The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChancellorCurrency        of the Exchequer (C (66) 60) on the decimalisation of the currency.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the previous administration had decided in principle that the currency should bedecimalised and had appointed the Halsbury Committee to advisehow and when this might be done. The Committee had reported inSeptember 1963 but no action had yet been taken. In the meantimevirtually the whole of the Commonwealth had adopted decimalcurrencies. Moreover the Government had decided in principle thatthe metric system of weights and measures should be adopted in theUnited Kingdom.   The Confederation of British Industries hadIn discussion the general view was that an exchequer contribution to the scheme was not, on balance, justified. some concern was expressed that the Restrictive Practices Court mightdeclare the present voluntary minimum price scheme to be contraryto the public interest at a time when the Government were agreeing to the introduction of a statutory scheme. It was suggested, however,that, if the Government decided to proceed with the statutory scheme,the Restrictive Practices Court should be so informed and they mightwell then not proceed with their consideration of the voluntaryscheme. It was also suggested that the assistance at present being given to the fishing industry was not necessarily designed in the best way to help it adapt itself to the size and structure which would be appropriate in the future. The Report of the Fleck Committee intothe future of the fishing industry had been unsatisfactory and there might be a case for a further enquiry. Concern was also expressed at the possible international repercussions, including those in theEuropean Free Trade Association.The First Secretary of State, summing up the discussion, saidthat while the Cabinet were not opposed to the promotion of a statutory scheme of minimum prices for white fish the general view was against making an Exchequer contribution to its cost. TheMinister of Agriculture and the Secretary of State for Scotland shouldmake it clear to the White Fish Authority and the fishing industry that the Government were prepared to introduce a statutory schemeput forward with the agreement of the industry with the aim ofincreasing stability of prices, provided that the scheme met anylegitimate objections raised by overseas suppliers, particularlyDenmark and Norway.The Cabinet Agreed that a statutory minimum price scheme for whitefish could be accepted, subject to the appropriate priorinternational discussions, but that no exchequer contribution to its cost should be made.
recently urged that an early decision should be taken on the date and form of the introduction of a decimal currency and stated that their members were almost unanimous in desiring this change to take effect in some three to five years.The main case for a change was that calculations, both mentaland mechanical, would be easier and cheaper under a decimal system.The teaching of arithmetic in schools would also be greatly simplified.On the other hand, a substantial cost was involved, though it mightbe less than the original estimate since many machines had since been introduced which could be changed to the decimal system without much cost. The cost would in any event be more than offset bysavings, even though these could not be precisely evaluated and thechange would assist the general modernisation of the economy: itwould therefore be right to make it soon.As regards the details, he proposed that the basic unit shouldbe the   rather than a new unit corresponding to 10s.; that the dateof change should be February 1971; that a Decimal Currency board should be set up to make arrangements for the change; and that theGovernment should not accept responsibility for meeting the costs of the change except in cases of hardship.In discussion there was general agreement that a change todecimal currency should be made and that an early announcement would be desirable. There was also general agreement that the dateof introduction should be February 1971 since this would give greater opportunity for the change to be made with a minimum ofdislocation and expense.As regards the choice of basic unit it was pointed out that thetransport undertakings had been strongly in favour of a new 10s.unit. It was also pointed out that there would be certain advantages in adopting  5 or  2 as the basic unit; but the Halsbury Committeehad reported in strong terms, after very full examination, that asystem involving three units which would be needed with so large a basic unit would be much less satisfactory than one with only twounits. Attention was called to the difficulties which would arise inthe case of telephone coin boxes, gas and electricity meters andparking meters if the new coins differed in size from the existingones. It would however be for the Decimal Currency Board toconsider practical problems of this kind.In further discussion it was pointed out that it would be necessaryto give consideration at a suitable stage to the position of Ireland.jThe First Secretary of State, summing up the discussion, said thatthe general view of the Cabinet was in favour of announcing at anearly date that the Government had decided that the currency shouldbe decimalised in February 1971 with the   as the basic unit. they also agreed that a Decimal Currency Board should be set up to makethe necessary practical arrangements. As regards compensation forthe costs of the change, the Government should not accept responsibility but it could be indicated that consideration would begiven to any cases of special hardship.
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that(i) the currency should be decimalised in February 1971with the   as the basic unit;(ii) an early announcement of this decision should bemade;(iii) a Decimal Currency Board should be set up to make arrangements for the change;(iv) the Government should not provide compensationfor the costs involved but should be prepared toconsider assistance in cases of hardship.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for anearly announcement of the Governmenfs decision.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th February, 1966. v.
