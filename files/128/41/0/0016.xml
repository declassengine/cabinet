OverseaAffairsGhana(previous reference:CC (66) 13thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Prime Minister referred to the allegation in the press that morning that Dr. Nkrumah, the recently deposed President of ghana, had been denied asylum in the United Kingdom. this statement was without any foundation and a denial should be issuedforthwith.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to issue an official denial of the allegation that Dr. Nkrumahhad been denied asylum in the United Kingdom.Social ServicesMinistry ofSocialSecurity:draft statement(previous reference:CC (66) 15thConclusions,Minute 3)3. The Cabinet considered a note by the Minister of Pensionsand National Insurance (C (66) 48), to which was appended a draft statement on the Ministry of Social Security.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance recalled thatthe Cabinet had invited her to recast her draft White Paper in theform of a statement to be made in the House of Commons. Her draftconcentrated on the procedural and organisational improvements and made only general reference to the changes in the rules for thetreatment of resources. These would be explained more fully at a subsequent Press Conference.In discussion it was suggested that the statement might be substantially shortened, while still preserving the main points. Itwould also be important, in referring at the Press Conference to thenew allowances, not to go beyond what was said in the present draft and in particular to avoid any implication of substantial increases which might raise the question of liability to income tax.The following points were also made:(a) It should be made clear in the draft that the new arrangements would not apply exclusively to old people.(b) The antepenultimate paragraph referred to an independentcorporate body which would administer the new benefits, and to aCommission which would guide the new scheme and make individualawards. It should be made clear that this was one and the same body.(c) Early legislation might not prove possible and the statement should be confined to saying that the Government would introduce legislation on the proposals.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theMinister of Pensions should make an early statement in the Houseof Commons on the lines of her draft, but this should be substantiallyshortened and should be amended to take account of the points madein discussion.Parliament \   j^q Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the period up to the Prorogation ofParliament on Thursday, 10th March.
The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance,in consultation with the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster, to revise the draft statement attached toC (66) 48 in accordance with the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1), agreed that the Minister ofPensions and National Insurance, in consultation withthe Lord President, should make an early statement on her proposals in the House of Commons.Farm price review(previous reference:CC (66) 6thConclusions,Minute 1)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster (C (66) 49) about the progress of discussions with the Farmers&apos; Unions on the Price Review.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster recalled that at their meeting on 8th February the Cabinet had decided that the increasein the guarantees should not exceed  20 million. It had been made clear at the time that there was very little prospect of reaching an agreed settlement with the Farmers&apos; Unions on this basis. This hadbeen fully confirmed in the discussions so far held with them althoughas yet they had not been given any indication of a settlement of morethan  17 million. Their attitude had, however, been more moderatethan might have been expected in present circumstances. TheAgricultural Ministers believed that there was a reasonable prospectof getting an agreed settlement at about  28 million and consideredthat the advantages of securing such a settlement were such that itwould be desirable to go to this figure in order to reach agreement.Otherwise no new factors had emerged since 8th February. Therehad always been some arguments of merit to justify a settlement as high as  28 million and there seemed no prospect of reaching anagreement at a significantly lower figure. In particular, raising theoffer on milk to an increase of lid a gallon, at a cost of  4  million,would not be sufficient to do so since the Farmers&apos; Unions neededa settlement in which all their members benefited: this impliedimproving the position on cereals as well as on livestock products.It was a matter of political judgment whether it was on balance worthraising the increase in the guarantees as high as  28 million in orderto reach an agreed settlement.The Minister of Agriculture said that it was essential to gainthe confidence of farmers in the selective expansion programme setout in the National Economic Plan. Farm incomes in 1965 had been severely depressed by the weather and confidence was therefore low.Another disagreed Review would endanger the farmers&apos; co-operation in the achievement of the expansion programme and theGovernments policy for the reform of farm structure.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that a settlement of  20million was more than adequate to provide an appropriate base for the achievement by the farming industry of the targets set outin the plan. A settlement of this order would be more generous to
farmers than the 1964 settlement, would leave them with more than half the return from their increased efficiency and would, indeed, be substantially better than the average of the last seven Reviews. Inthese circumstances there was no argument on merits for a settlementabove  20 million. There were many important schemes currentlyunder discussion with other Ministers on which it would be more valuable to spend the additional money now proposed for farm prices.The First Secretary of State said that a settlement of  20 million would be adequate to enable the farming industry to meet the objectives set out in the plan. The consequences of increases inprices, particularly of milk, to the ordinary consumer should also betaken into account.In discussion it was urged that it would be desirable to increasethe award to  28 million in order to maintain the confidence of the farming industry in the Governmenfs agricultural policy for thefollowing reasons:(a) The reduction in farm incomes in 1965 would lead farmers to avoid further commitment of their resources unless it was made clear that there would be an adequate return on additionalinvestment in the industry. This was particularly true in the case ofsmall farms and in Wales, where serious damage had been done tofarms by flooding.(b) The expansion programme in the plan would inevitably involve difficulties with overseas suppliers and should therefore notbe used as an argument against fixing farm prices at a level whichwould ensure the fulfilment of the plan.(c) An expansion of cereals production was essential for the livestock expansion programme if we were not to increase oue independence on imported feedingstuffs. The profitability of cerealshad fallen sharply in 1965 and there was a good case for making some improvement.(d) To increase the guaranteed price for milk by l^-d. a galloninstead of Id. would only involve raising the retail price to lOd. apint in August rather than October and the cost falling on theExchequer would be small.On the other hand it was argued that it would be wrong toincrease the award above  20 million for the following reasons:(e) Any further incentive to expand milk production would leadto a large increase in home butter production which would make itvirtually impossible to carry out the obligations we had assumed toour main overseas suppliers of butter. Moreover, any guarantee to compensate farmers for a fall in the price of milk arising from anincrease in the proportion sold for manufacturing at low prices wouldbe impossible to defend to our overseas suppliers, particularly NewZealand.(/) The proposal to increase the profitability of cereals wouldbe likely to upset the minimum price agreements with our overseas suppliers and to lead to difficulties in the Kennedy Round of tariff negotiations.
(g) The targets for agricultural expansion included in the plan had been carefully chosen to avoid conflict with our obligations to overseas suppliers. To raise the award to  28 million would, however,be likely to change the balance of the plan and to lead to international difficulties.(h) If returns to farmers were raised too high, it would make the achievement of the necessary reform of farm structure more difficult.(/) To press the arguments put forward by the agricultural ministers too far would create difficulties in relation to theGovernments policy in other fields, for example, fuel policy andwould also imply the need for succeeding Farm Price Reviews to beon the basis of agreement as a condition of fulfilling the plan.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thegeneral view of the Cabinet was that negotiations should be continued with the Farmers&apos; Unions on the basis of a settlement of  20 million.Within this figure the Agricultural Ministers had discretion to vary the schedule of individual commodity prices in the manner most likely to secure agreement. The Ministers concerned should also consider whether it was possible to do anything within the review which would assist farmers in Wales and elsewhere who had suffered from flooding, provided that the cost of any such assistance wasrelatively small. He proposed to tell the leader of the Farmers&apos;Unions, Sir Harold Woolley, who had asked to see him, that the review settlement would have to be decided on the merits of the argument, although the Agricultural Ministers would be free, in thelight of their further talks with the Farmers&apos; Unions, to ask theCabinet the following week to consider any new factor which mightemerge.The Cabinet Invited the Agricultural Ministers to continue discussions with the Farmers&apos; Unions on the basis that the increase inthe agricultural guarantee should not exceed  20 million.Coal IndustryPrices(previous reference:CC (65) 50thConclusions,Minute 2)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C (66) 46) by theFirst Secretary of State on coal prices.The First Secretary of State recalled that at their meeting on 7th October, 1965, the Cabinet had agreed that the proposals of theNational Coal Board (NCB) for increased prices should be submittedto the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) as well as tothe Consumers&apos; Councils, and that these procedures should becompleted in time for any increases of prices to be brought intoeffect from 1st April, 1966. The NBPI had now recommended thatcoal prices should be increased to yield additional revenue of  80million in 1966-67 and that the increase should be varied so as to reflect more closely the costs of production in individual regions.The NCB had proposed increases accordingly which would still leavethe Scottish, North Western and South Western (including Wales)
coalfields in the position of making losses overall. The regionaldifferential prices now proposed were consistent with the view whichhad been taken by the Ministerial Committee on economic development the previous summer when such prices were related to the need to raise additional revenue of  40 million instead of  80million. The high cost fields were in the development areas and itmight be argued that an increase in the price of coal there would be contrary to regional policy. But long term development in these regions would not be helped by keeping men in exhausted orunprofitable pits, while a uniform increase would mean that lowcost areas would be subsidising the high cost areas and would resultin a diminution of the market in just those areas where the prospects of the industry in the longer term were most favourable. Theproposals of the NBPI and the NCB should therefore be accepted.In view of the comments of the NBPI on the profit margins of coaldistributors a further enquiry should be made into this part of theindustry.The Minister of Power agreed with the views of the first secretary of State. He had received proposals from the IndustrialCoal Consumers&apos; Council for the provision of further assistance bythe Government to the coal industry to avoid increases which would otherwise have to be made in coal prices.  These proposals were:(i) That about  20 million out of the necessary  80 million should be met by the Government relieving the NCB of the costof redeployment resulting from closures, the burden of rates, certaincosts of training and the obligation to provide  10 million a year for the difference between depreciation and historic and replacementcosts.(ii) That the increases in industrial coal should be on a two-tier system one quarter to one half of the total being raised by a flatincrease on all coal produced and the remainder by selectiveincreases; the price increase to be related to the quality of the coal.(iii) That the Government should examine favourably asuggestion, mainly prompted by the British Iron and Steel Federation,that the ban on coal imports should be lifted.Neither the proposal for increased Government assistance northat for lifting the ban on imports of coal was acceptable.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, while he agreedthat coal prices should be increased, the regional differentiation whichwas now proposed was more unfavourable to Scotland than thatwhich had been contemplated by the Cabinet in their earlier discussions. His concern related to the effect of such an increasenot on the programme for the closure of the pits, but on the futuremarket for coal from those Scottish pits which were profitable, sinceat this level of prices the use of coal would be uneconomic in the nextseries of electricity generating stations. Furthermore, the distributionof assistance in the recent capital reconstruction of the industry hadbeen relatively unfavourable to the Scottish pits.
In discussion it was urged that an increase in prices at the levelnow proposed, and particularly the sharp regional differentiation insuch increases, would have a damaging effect on the industry andwould accelerate the closure of pits to such a rate that the effect on employment could not be counterbalanced by the provision of alternative industrial opportunities. Furthermore, voluntary wastageof labour was already at such a level that there might be difficultyin retaining an adequate labour force in the profitable pits. Theincrease in costs would also harm the Governments policy on incomes and prices. It v/as, however, the general view of the Cabinet thatcoal prices must keep in step with costs if a healthy coal industry were to be retained and that the increases now proposed were thenecessary counterpart of the substantial Governmental assistance which had already been provided for the NCB. Good progress hadbeen made in the provision of factories in the areas affected by pitclosures and there was no reason to expect more than marginaldifficulties in meeting the consequences of such closures on employment. It was also the general view that the level of regionaldifferential prices proposed by the NCB was on balance appropriate to the differing regional circumstances of the industry and should therefore be accepted.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet accepted the proposals put forward by the NCB.Publicity had already been given to the report of the NBPI and inthese circumstances no further announcement by the Governmentwas required. It would, however, be desirable to give suitablepublicity to the new industrial development which was taking placein the areas primarily concerned. The Cabinet agreed that thereshould be an enquiry into the costs of coal distribution on the lines proposed by the NBPI.The Cabinet (1) Approved C(66)46.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the First Secretary of State and the Minister of power, to arrange for suitable publicity to be givento the new industrial developments resulting from theGovernments policy in the areas primarily affected bypit closures.(3) Agreed that the Minister of Power should not accept theproposals put forward by the Industrial Coal Consumers&apos;Council.(4) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theMinister of Power, to arrange for the National Board for prices and Incomes to enquire into the cost of coaldistribution.(5) Invited the Minister of Power to circulate to other membersof the Cabinet the detailed schedule of price increases proposed by the National Coal Board.
BroadcastingandTelevisionBroadcastingPolicy(previous reference:CC (66) 15thConclusions,Minute 2)6. The Prime Minister said that an Opposition Motion on broadcasting policy was to be debated in the House of Commons that day. He had discussed with the Lord President of the Council andthe Postmaster-General what indication might be given of the government&apos;s policy on the basis of the views so far expressed bythe Cabinet. Subject to further discussion by the Cabinet, thePostmaster-General&apos;s reply to the debate might open with an accountof the financial problem facing the British Broadcasting Corporation(BBC). He might say that the Government had recently receivedproposals from the Corporation about their finances and would beentering into discussion with them, but the details of the proposals should not be disclosed. It could also be said that there seemed tobe every prospect, provided the problem of evasion could be tackled,of holding the licence fee at its present level for two years or more.On measures to reduce evasion, reference should be made to thepossibility of ensuring, through the retailers and rental companies,that new sets were licensed, though legislation would be needed. Ifthe question of advertising on the Light Programme were raised, theHouse should be reminded that any initiative lay with the BBC. ThePostmaster-General should invite the views of the House on themanner in which the BBCs financial problems might be met, but should not suggest that the Government were in any way moving towards acceptance of revenue from advertising on the LightProgramme as a solution. He could, however, say that theGovernment rejected the idea of an Exchequer subsidy.On local broadcasting, the Government were not prepared toaccept local commercial stations, but decisions on the nature of any local broadcasting which might be introduced must wait untilsatisfactory arrangements had been made for financing the BBC.On a National Broadcasting Commission, it could be said that theGovernment had an open mind and would wish to consult both the broadcasting authorities and the other political parties before reaching a decision.1 In connection with the University of the Air,reference could be made to the possibility of using BBC-2, and itcould be said that discussions were being conducted with the BBC:any reference to the fourth television channel should be avoided. TheCabinet would, however, wish particularly to consider what might besaid in regard to colour television and whether any conclusions could now be reached.In discussion there was general agreement with the statementoutlined by the Prime Minister. It was suggested that the studyinitiated by the First Secretary of State, in accordance with theconclusions of the previous meeting, on the technical, financial andeconomic considerations of colour television had yielded sufficientinformation on which to take a decision. It was pointed out that,although consumer expenditure might be increased by up to  100million over a period of three or four years, the demand on manpower resources for the manufacture of sets would not be significant; that there might be an increase in exports of some  10million a year if an early decision were taken and that this would be
prejudiced by delay; and that the cost to the BBC would be relatively small and would quickly be covered by the proposed supplementarylicence fee. It was also now clear that no radically different systemof reception was likely to be developed in the near future.The following points were also made (a) In referring to the use of BBC-2 for the University of the Airit would be important to avoid any implication that peak hours would be pre-empted for the University.(b) The case for the supplementary licence fee for colour television should be based on the argument that individuals who could not afford colour sets should not be required to subsidise thenew service.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that,subject to the points made in discussion, the Postmaster general should be guided by the statement of policy which he had outlined.The Cabinet also agreed that the Postmaster-General should announce that, in accordance with the advice received from his TelevisionAdvisory Committee, the Government proposed to introduce colour television using the PAL system, and that it was hoped to introduce a regular service by the end of 1967. This would be subject to the qualification that, if another system found general acceptance at theforthcoming Oslo Conference, the Government would take this intoaccount and, if necessary, reconsider their decision.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Postmaster-General to be guided by the PrimeMinister^ statement and summing up of their discussion in the forthcoming debate on broadcasting.(2) Agreed that the Postmaster-General should announce in the debate the Governments intention to adopt the PALsystem of colour television, subject to the qualificationindicated by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,3rd March, 1966.
