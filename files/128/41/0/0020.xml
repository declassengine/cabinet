legislative programme,1966-67CompaniesBill(previous reference:CC (66) 19thConclusions,Minute 5)2. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of a memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade (C (66) 61) on the CompaniesBill.The Lord President of the Council recalled that in previous discussion of the legislative programme for 1966-67 (CC (66) 18thConclusions, Minute 4) the Cabinet had decided to add to theprogramme Bills on Leasehold Reform and on Road Safety, and had asked him to consider the inclusion of the Overseas Aid and overseas territories Bills.   It had been agreed that the Consumer Protection(Trade  Descriptions)  Bill  and,  if  possible,  the  parliamentary commissioner Bill should be deferred, but the Companies Bill couldnot also be added to the programme without deferring yet anothersubstantial measure.   No assistance could be looked for from thedevice of carrying Bills over from one Session to the other, since this could hardly be introduced in relation to Government legislationalone, and it would be embarrassing to preserve Private Members&apos;Bills, including those introduced in pursuance of Resolutions underthe Ten-Minute Rule.In discussion it was suggested that a Labour Government wouldbe expected to legislate early in the life of the Parliament, not merely to implement the numerous recommendations of the Committee onCompany Law (the Jenkins Committee) not dealt with in the existing companies Bill, but also to deal with fundamental questions touchingthe function of companies in modern society which that Committeehad not considered.   In particular, the legal requirement thatdirectors must act solely in the interests of their shareholders wasincompatible with modern thinking about the responsibility of companies both to the community and to their own employees, and consideration should be given to amendments of the law whichwould ensure that these interests were taken into account.  In viewof the need for extensive consultation with professional bodies, itwould hardly be possible to prepare a major Bill on these lines intime for introduction in the second Session of the Parliament, and,in view of the volume of other legislation which it would be necessaryto introduce in later Sessions, it was arguable that a major Bill oncompanies should be deferred for some years. It would then be themore important to introduce in the first Session the Bill which was already available and would in itself make a valuable contributionto the modernisation of company law.  There were however otheruseful Bills in the Reserve List for the present Session whose claimsought also to be considered if Parliamentary time became available,including those on Consular Privileges, and the Miscellaneous health services and Dangerous Drugs Bills to which the Minister of Healthattached importance.CC 20 (66)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet discussed the arrangements for the Debate onthe Address.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that hewould consider whether it would be useful to set up a committee ofMinisters to examine the proposals for a comprehensive CompaniesBill. If it proved possible to have such a Bill ready for introductionearly in the 1967-68 Session, this solution was to be preferred, but,if not, consideration should be given to the introduction of a shorterBill later in the current Session. In the Debate on the Address hewould say that the Companies Bill introduced in the last parliament had necessarily been limited in scope, that work on the subject was continuing, and that, while the Government could not commit themselves at this stage to legislative proposals beyond those mentioned specifically in The Queen&apos;s Speech, consideration wouldbe given to the introduction of a Companies Bill among others whichmight be brought forward later in the Session if time should permit.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider thedesirability of appointing a committee of Ministers toexamine the wider proposals for legislation on companylaw and of the terms in which he proposed to deal withthe matter in the Debate on the Address.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to proceed as rapidly as possible with the preparation of proposals forcomprehensive legislation on company law.(3) Invited the Lord President of the Council to arrange for theFuture Legislation Committee to consider, in the light,of progress with legislative business and with work on a comprehensive measure, whether it would be possible and desirable for a shorter Companies Bill to be introducedlate in the current Session.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st April, 1966
