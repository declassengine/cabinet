SubjectRhodesia
Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (66) 62ndConclusions,Minute 3)CC 63 (66)secret the Prime Minister said that he had just returned with theCommonwealth Secretary and the Attorney-General from had discussions on HMS Tiger with Mr. Smith, the leader of the illegal regime in Rhodesia. Although it had been agreed before these discussions took place that he and Mr. Smith would act asplenipotentiaries, Mr. Smith had insisted on referring back to hiscolleagues the result of their discussions and had at the last minutewithheld his agreement to commend it to them. In thesecircumstances the Cabinet would also wish to have the opportunityto consider the outcome of the discussions before the Governmentwere committed to acceptance.The document (a copy of which is attached to these conclusions)which had been worked out between them was thus without commitment on either side. Both sides would decide by 12 noonSalisbury time (10 a.m. GMT) on Monday, 5th December, whetherit was accepted in its entirety. For his part the Prime Minister (withthe agreement of the Commonwealth Secretary and the Attorney-General who accompanied him) commended the document to theCabinet.The course which the discussions had followed was that onFriday, 2nd December, he and the Commonwealth Secretary had metprivately with Mr. Smith and one of his moderate colleagues,Mr. Howman, and had made clear to them what would happen if agreement could not be reached. They had then opened thediscussions, dealing first with the changes to be made in the 1961Constitution in order to meet the Governmenfs first, second, third and sixth principles. On these they had made substantial progress.But on the return to constitutional rule Mr. Smith had beenintransigent, refusing to agree that there must be an immediate returnto the 1961 Constitution or that a broadly-based government shouldbe formed: he regarded both these as breaking points. Mr. smith had also asked that the test of public opinion in Rhodesia in respectof the amendments to the 1961 Constitution should be conducted bya Royal Commission before a return to legality.The United Kingdom Ministers had insisted that an interim government must first be formed under the 1961 Constitution.Thereafter a R.oyal Commission would be appointed to test Rhodesianpublic opinion and report whether or not the revised constitution would be acceptable to the Rhodesian people as a whole. He had made it clear that, if subsequently independence were illegallydeclared for a second time, there could then be no question of legalindependence before the attainment of majority rule; mandatorysanctions against Rhodesia would be sought and imposed; and there could be no further guarantee that the United Kingdom Governmentwould not use force in applying such sanctions.Early on Saturday morning, 3rd December, there had been a discussion between himself and the Commonwealth Secretary on the
one hand and Mr. Smith and Mr. Howman on the other, in which theGovernor (Sir Humphrey Gibbs) and the Chief Justice (Sir HughBeadle) had joined. During the course of it Mr. Smith had indicated that on the whole he accepted the document, although he wanted tobe convinced about the need to return to constitutional rule beforeRhodesian public opinion was tested. Mr. Smith had freely discussed the composition of a broadly-based interim administration, if he were invited to form one in the period preceding independence. It was clear that Mr. Smith and his present colleagues were deeply dividedand that he would remove some six of them from office and invitefive other representatives of Rhodesian opinion to join his Cabinet.He appeared to welcome the prospect of a dissolution of theLegislature since it would enable him within four months of thereturn to legality to hold an election the result of which would be.in Mr. Smith&apos;s opinion, that the more extreme Rhodesia Frontsupporters would lose their seats in the Legislature.Later on the Saturday morning, however, Mr. Smith had saidthat he would have to consult his colleagues before he could acceptthe document and he had been offered facilities to telegraph to themto explain the stage reached in the discussions. He had been offered the chance of either accepting or rejecting the terms set out in the document. By 8 p.m. Mr. Smith had said that he would sign that the document was a correct record of the discussion but not to the effectthat he would commend it to his colleagues. There followed threehours of discussions in which the United Kingdom Ministers had warned Mr. Smith, in the strongest terms, what the consequences of rejection would be; after that he and his party returned to salisbury.In discussion the Cabinet first considered the text of the document, which fell into three parts: (i) a constitution which provided for independence; (ii) the establishment of a RoyalCommission to give effect to the Fourth Principle dealing with racial discrimination; and (iii) a return to legality and the Fifth Principle.The Attorney-General summarised the balance of gain and loss,from the point of view of the African Rhodesians, in the draftsettlement. On the credit side was the extension of the &quot; B &quot; Rollfranchise to all Africans, men and women, aged 30 and above whosatisfied conditions of citizenship and residence; this was particularlyadvantageous in view of the increased influence which the greater number of &quot; B &quot; Roll voters would have through cross-voting on&quot; A &quot; Roll elections. Mr. Smith had wished to abolish cross-votingfor this reason. Next, there were two additional &quot; B &quot; Roll seats.Thirdly, a Senate would be created with eight elected african members out of a total membership of 24. Finally, the entrenchmentof the whole of Chapter III of the 1961 Constitution had been secured,subject to a formula which excepted from entrenchment (subject tothe conditions set out in it) the work of the Delimitation Commission.His advisers assured him that the effect of the formula would be thatthe quinquennial review of constituencies carried out by theCommission would work to the benefit of the African Rhodesians.Offset against these advantages was the concession by which 17 of
the 50 &quot; A &quot; Roll seats in the 1961 Constitution were made reservedEuropean seats to balance the 17 &quot; B &quot; Roll seats. Although theseseats had the advantage that in the longer run they gave effect to the sixth Principle (on the preservation of the interests of the Europeanswhen these became a minority in the Government), the immediate effect would be, on whatever formula was adopted, somewhat to delayprogress towards African majority rule.In discussion the following main points were made:Governor-General(a) The provision in paragraph J that the Governor-general would be appointed on the advice of the Rhodesian Governmentrelated to the period after independence (until independence therewould be a Governor and not a Governor-General) and was commonform. The memorandum did not make this sufficiently clear to thepublic if it were published by itself; if it came to be published thepoint should be clarified in the accompanying commentary.Legislature(b) There was considerable uncertainty how soon Africanmajority rule might come, because of the many factors involved:they included the rate at which Africans would qualify for the &quot; A &quot;Roll, and their willingness to register both on the &quot; A &quot; Roll and onthe &quot; B &quot; Roll (which influenced &quot; A&quot; Roll voting through the cross-voting procedure). It was estimated that &quot; B &quot; Roll voters atpresent registered were sufficient to exercise the maximum possibleinfluence over &quot; A &quot; Roll voting in half the &quot; A &quot; Roll constituencies;the extension of the &quot; B &quot; Roll franchise proposed in the next sectionof the memorandum would enable- &quot; B &quot; Roll voters to exercisemaximum influence in all &quot; A &quot; Roll constituencies. The estimateof the Chief Justice of Rhodesia (Sir Hugh Beadle) was that underthe proposals in the memorandum, taken as a whole, Africanmajority rule might come in seven to nine years; this compared withthe estimates widely made of from 10 to 15 years under the 1961Constitution.(c) The effect of the two additional &quot; B &quot; Roll seats and theproposals for a Senate, taken together, was to give elected african representatives a &quot; blocking quarter &quot; of the total seats in the two houses of the Legislature together, and so to enable them to rejectamendments to the entrenched clauses in the Constitution. Theadded &quot; B &quot; Roll seats also gave the African a substantial advance towards the &quot; blocking third &quot; of Legislative Assembly seats needed to reject ordinary amendments of the Constitution, though theestimate given in the talks late the previous night, that they wouldhave this blocking third when they had won two &quot; A &quot; Roll seats,seemed on consideration to be an overestimate. It had, however,never been our view that it would be practicable to secure animmediate blocking third for African members of the LegislativeAssembly.(d) The Labour Party when in Opposition had opposed thecreation of European reserved seats in the Northern Rhodesian
Constitution. We had accepted the proposed European reserved seats in the talks with Mr. Smith in order to achieve the valuable gainsof extra &quot; B &quot; Roll seats and a widened &quot; B &quot; Roll franchise. Theinterest now shown by the Rhodesians in reserved European seats,compared with their earlier lack of interest in this proposal, was ofwide significance, since it indicated that they now took much more seriously the prospect of impending African majority rule, at whichstage the reserved seats would give them a justifiable protection.(e) The proposal that for the purpose of electing Senators boththe African and the European electorates should be divided into two, Mashonaland and Matabeleland, each electing half the Senatorsfor each group, had been put forward in the talks to meet misgivings,felt both by the British and the Rhodesian sides, about the original proposal for indirect election of Senators by an electoral college made up of African representatives in the Legislative Assembly. This wouldgive the latter an unacceptable degree of personal power in the early stages, when their number was so limited. The object of adopting thetwo main tribal areas for electoral purposes was simply to avoid the necessity for a further operation in delimitation to draw upconstituencies for Senate elections: it did not mean that the Chiefswould exercise an influence over the course of voting.Delimitation(/) The formula in paragraph 4 had been devised by UnitedKingdom officials, in consultation with Sir Hugh Beadle, and wouldhave the effect of protecting African interests and of preventing anyimproper interference by the majority party with the distribution of seats proportionate to the size of the electorate of each race. Theway in which the Delimitation Commission operated could not affectone way or the other the rate of progress to African majority rule.The rate at which Africans qualified for the registered on the &quot; A &quot;Roll would, however, be significant for the work of the Commission;at present it was estimated that between 7,000 and 9,000 were qualified for the &quot; A &quot; Roll (though few had registered).Chiefs and Senators(g) The provision mentioned in paragraph 5 that a Chief couldbe removed from office only on the recommendation of an impartialjudicial tribunal gave protection to an independent-minded Chief.Chiefs would be elected to the six seats in the Senate by the Councilof Chiefs. Although not appointed by the Government they weresubordinate to it to the extent that they received an official salary,which on their election to the Senate would be replaced by a Senatorssalary, giving somewhat greater independence. While in the short-term it would be realistic to regard the Chiefs as creatures ofthe Government of the day, the position could alter in the longer term as the political balance changed.Powers of Senate(h) In discussion with the Rhodesians on this point we hadattached importance to giving the Senate positive functions so thatit should not be merely a mechanism for blocking changes in the
constitution. As such it might well lack vitality; but its power to review (but not to delay or override) legislation other than thatrelating to the constitution might make it a useful training ground forRhodesian politicians.(/) The special legislative powers proposed for the Senate inrespect of tribal land, law and custom (paragraph 6 (b)) had not been examined in detail in the time available; the underlying thought wasthat the chiefs, as the representatives of rural Africans would have special knowledge of tribal land and similar questions. It would however be necessary to ensure when drafting the necessaryconstitutional provisions that these powers did not entrench theChiefs as a privileged minority in respect of land when there was an african majority in the Government.Executive powers(/) The proposition that the Governor-General would act on theadvice of Ministers related to the period after independence, and was common form.Amendment of the Constitution(k) The blocking mechanism here proposed, by which the wholeof Chapter III of the Constitution was entrenched, gave us our requirements in full and removed what had for long been a majorobstacle in discussions about a Rhodesian constitution. It was very satisfactory that provision had been secured for appeals to the privy council. In that connection the possibility of increasing the numberof Rhodesian Privy Counsellors drawn from the judiciary had been offered in the talks. We had also agreed to setting a time limit forappealing to the Constitutional Commission and Privy Councilagainst amending the Constitution, though this did not feature in the document itself.Fourth principle relating to racial discrimination(I) We had obtained under this heading as much as we could resonably expect, in particular the inclusion within the scope of theRoyal Commission of the land apportionment legislation and thecompetence of the Constitutional Council to consider pre-1961legislation. The Royal Commission to study the question of racial discrimination and make recommendations would be set up before independence, the composition being discussed with the lawfulRhodesian Government, but we could not expect that it would report before independence, even though this might mean that independencewas achieved while, for example, police powers were still in operation which the Royal Commission might subsequently condemn.The Cabinet then turned to the discussion of Section III of the document regarding the return to legality and the Fifth Principle.The Prime Minister said that this section as a whole must beconsidered in the light of certain major difficulties which hadconfronted us throughout. Before he and his colleagues left it hadbeen agreed that they should seek the agreement of Mr. Smith to
some form of Commonwealth military presence in Rhodesia, perhapspreferably to be stationed at Kariba with Commonwealth militarystaff in Salisbury to deal with their logistic support. It had not in discussion proved possible to get acceptance of this proposal. Ke had however, in the terms which had been agreed before he left London,made it clear to Mr. Smith that if after the return to legality there were a second illegal declaration of independence (i.d.i.) or if after independence the constitution were overthrown by a coup d&apos;etat byEuropeans, the United Kingdom Government would forthwith seekUnited Nations approval for the full range of mandatory sanctionswhich were at present in prospect and also would withdraw the commitment which they had previously made that they would not use force to seek a solution of the problem. Such action on our partafter independence would be based on the fact that the treaty of independence would, like all international treaties, be registered atthe United Nations, that we were a party to it, that Rhodesiapresented an issue which was particularly sensitive to world opinion and therefore represented a threat to peace and that the UnitedKingdom in consequence reserved the right to intervene. While asubstantial United Kingdom military presence in Rhodesia wouldhave been the best possible guarantee against a second i.d.i., it mustbe recognised that it was neither acceptable to Mr. Smith nor could we ourselves contemplate the cost involved. The maintenance of a commonwealth force at Kariba would have had a certain value, butagain it had been recognised before he left that it would not havebeen able to offer any effective military opposition to Rhodesian forcesif hostilities broke out. The deterrent to a second i.d.i. posed by thestatement which he had made to Mr. Smith might well therefore proveat least as effective in practice as a military presence. He had also informed Mr. Smith that if we signed a Defence Agreement withRhodesia, as was contemplated, we must reserve the right to offer a defence Agreement to Zambia.In discussion it was urged that, despite the difficulties, it wasonly the presence of a substantial United Kingdom military force in rhodesia which could ensure the carrying out of a new Constitution.Furthermore, in considering the effect of the threats which had beenmade to Mr. Smith on the action which we should take if there were a second i.d.i., it must be recognised that the restraints imposed by our economic situation on the carrying through of mandatory sanctions would be no less constricting at that time than at present. Nor would the withdrawal of our commitment about not using force affect the realities of the situation, which made either invasion or any substantialuse of force impracticable.On the other hand, there was wide support for the view thatin any event the difficulties which would be posed for Mr. Smith, orfor any European rebel regime in Rhodesia, in seeking to declare asecond i.d.i. would be substantially greater than in 1965, or than thefurther difficulties which would then be posed for the United Kingdom.Having once declared i.d.i. and having failed to make this effective,there would be a very strong political and psychological opposition in rhodesia to any second attempt. The new Defence Council offered
a useful means of influencing opinion in the armed forces and presented a further obstacle to a renewed i.d.i. Furthermore, sinceexisting and prospective economic sanctions had undoubtedly played a substantial part in achieving the prospect of a settlement, the threat of their renewal would be no less potent in influencing RhodesianEuropean opinion. On this view, the withdrawal of the UnitedKingdom commitment not to use force would have substantialvalue as posing a yet further deterrent. In any event, theUnited Kingdom could not afford the cost of providing the very substantial military forces which would be required to garrisonRhodesia, nor was this politically a practicable proposition. In thesecircumstances, there was general agreement that the position as ithad emerged from the discussions with Mr. Smith should be accepted.In further discussion the following points were made:Dissolution of the Legislature (paragraph 11)(m) The dissolution of the Legislature would admittedly have certain disadvantages. It would, for example, involve two electionswithin the course of a few months, since the paragraph contemplateda new election under the 1961 Constitution to be followed by an election under the new Constitution, with its wider franchise, eithershortly before or immediately after independence. Furthermore, the acceptability to a new Constitution would undoubtedly be the major issue in the first election under the 1961 Constitution. On the otherhand the continuance of the present Legislature, with its RhodesiaFront majority, would enable it at least to hinder, and perhaps to frustrate, the new broadly-based Government. It appeared also thatthere was a deep rift of political opinion among European Rhodesians.Mr. Smith had stated that he wished to get rid of some of his existingcolleagues and also to seek different representatives of his party inthe Legislature and an early election under the new constitution would give a better prospect of more liberal opinion emerging.Although it might have been preferable to have a nominated broad-based Government in office until the new Constitution came intoeffect, this had not proved acceptable to Mr. Smith and the balanceof advantage lay in dissolving the existing Legislature in the reasonable hope that this would facilitate the changed grouping ofpolitical opinion in Rhodesia which would be necessary if political life were to develop on the right lines. The holding of an electionbefore the new Constitution would itself encourage the emergence ofnew political parties, a fact which was also relevant to the thoroughtesting of the acceptability of the new Constitution to the people of rhodesia as a whole.A broad-based Government (paragraph 12)(n) Mr. Smith had indicated that he would be ready to accept inthe new Government five Ministers, including two prominent Africans,who were not members of the Rhodesia Front. He envisagedreducing the Government from 13 to 12 which would mean that six of the present members would be dropped.
Censorship and detainees (paragraph 15)(o) There was some justification for the regime&apos;s argument thatcertain of the detainees had committed acts of violence orintimidation but could not be brought to trial because witnesseswould not testify against them. The situation therefore had certainresemblances to the position in Aden and it had been difficult to finda satisfactory formula. The appointment of a United kingdom representative to the Judicial Tribunal would help to ensure that theTribunal worked effectively and expeditiously. There might be advantage if the United Kingdom representative were also a memberof the Royal Commission appointed to test the acceptability of thenew Constitution under the Fifth Principle.Acceptability of the new Constitution (paragraph 17)(p) It was accepted that the composition and terms of reference of the Royal Commission would be decided by the United KingdomGovernment. The provision that this would be agreed with the interim administration would not in fact commit us to do more thanconsult them. The procedure which should be followed by the RoyalCommission would be a matter for the Commission itself to determine.A full referendum would be impossible in less than 12 to 18 months, if only because there was no register of all Africans living in Rhodesia,many of whom indeed were citizens of Zambia and Malawi.Furthermore, it must be recognised that the widespread illiteracywould make such a referendum valueless. It should, however, in theperiod of four months which was envisaged, be possible for the RoyalCommission thoroughly to test by other means the extent by whichthe proposed Constitution was generally acceptable.The Treaty guaranteeing the Constitution (paragraph 19)(q) The Treaty would automatically be registered with the united nations in accordance with Article 102 of the Charter. If there were a serious breach of the Treaty we should be entitled to go at once tothe United Nations and call for mandatory action under Chapter VII.Discontinuance of sanctions (paragraph 21)(r) Some of the sanctions would take a considerable time fully to dismantle. This should act as a deterrent against an attempt in rhodesia to evade the terms of the agreement.(s) It was noted that the document did not refer to the UnitedKingdom Governmenfs previous offer of assistance for an improvedprogramme of African education. This had been mentioned, butgiven the present restriction of our aid programme because of our economic position it had been thought imprudent to enter into any commitment about granting aid to Rhodesia.In a final general discussion of the document as a whole the view was expressed that, although the independence Constitution described in the document might be held to satisfy the six principles, there wasno guarantee, such as would have been provided by the stationing ofUnited Kingdom forces in Rhodesia, that the Constitution would be fairly operated. We admittedly faced a choice of evils but, on this
view, acceptance of the document would be more damaging than theconsequences which might flow from recourse to the United nations for mandatory sanctions.The general view of the Cabinet was, however, that the documentprovided a realistic framework for an honourable settlement. If the africans were prepared to co-operate in working the new Constitutionmajority rule should be achieved within a reasonable time, after twoor three general elections. This assumption could not of course&apos; be guaranteed but was the responsibility of the Africans themselves.The parallel with the history of South Africa after the Union becameindependent must give cause for anxiety but the position was very different now from what it had been then. The influence of african and of world opinion had greatly increased and it seemed unlikelythat a small group of Europeans in Rhodesia, even if South Africawere prepared to support them, would be able to stand out for longagainst the pressure of world opinion. The document itselfsuggested that Mr. Smith must now know that he could not preventthe achievement of an African majority within a reasonable time.If the document were accepted by the regime they might admittedlystill attempt subsequently to go back on it by declaring a new i.d.i.But once they had given up their illegal independence they would find it much more difficult psychologically to attempt to seize it again.Even if they did so we should certainly be no worse off and might indeed be in a rather better position than we were now. The general view of the Cabinet was therefore that the document was acceptableand represented more than might reasonably have been expected ascapable of achievement when the Cabinet gave the Prime Ministerand his colleagues full authority for the discussions with Mr. Smith.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thegeneral view of the Cabinet was that the document should be accepted.We had undertaken to inform Mr. Smith of our decision by 10 a.m.GMT on 5th December and there might be advantage in doing so atonce, before the illegal regime considered their own decision. a message signifying our acceptance should therefore be telegraphedimmediately to the Governor for transmission to Mr. Smith. Therewould also be advantage in informing the South African Governmentimmediately and urging them to put pressure on Mr. Smith to agree.It had been made clear to Mr. Smith that the document must beaccepted or rejected as a whole; if amendments were proposed or if no answer was received by the agreed time this would count as arejection. It had been agreed that if the document were acceptedwe would concert with the regime about the time of publication; if itwere rejected either side would be free to publish when it wished. Anumber of further points had still to be decided, particularly what,if anything, should be said about enforcing sanctions against SouthAfrica if relations with the regime were finally broken off andmandatory sanctions against Rhodesia were authorised by the united nations.
The Cabinet-CD Agreed that the document which had been under discussion should be accepted and congratulated the Prime Minister,the Commonwealth Secretary and the Attorney-general on the outcome of their discussions with Mr. Smith.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to inform the governor of  Rhodesia  forthwith   that   the  United   KingdomGovernment accepted the document in its entirety; andto ask him to arrange for the regime in Salisbury to be similarly informed.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the SouthAfrican Government to be similarly informed.(4) Agreed that it should be made known publicly that theCabinet had received a report from the Prime Ministerabout his discussions with Mr. Smith and fully supported the line he had taken.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,4th December, 1966.The attached document was worked out by the British PrimeMinister and Mr. Smith on HMS Tiger off Gibraltar on 2nd/3rd December, 1966.It is without commitment on either side and both sides will decideby 12 noon (Salisbury time) on Monday, 5th December, 1966, whetherit is accepted in its entirety.(Signed)     HAROLD WILSON.(Signed)     I. DOUGLAS SMITH.Signed in my presenceHUMPHREY GIBBS,Governor.On board HMS Tiger4th December, 1966RHODESIA-INDEPENDENCE CONSTITUTIONIThe following are the principal changes which are to be made inthe 1961 Constitution to meet the First, Second, Third and SixthPrinciples. . i-1.  The GovernorGovernor General to be appointed on the advice of the rhodesian Government.  (2.  The LegislatureThe composition to be:Legislative Assembly33 &quot; A &quot; Roll seats17 &quot;B&quot; Roll seats17 Reserved EuropeanEach block  of seats to cover the wholeseats   j    country.
SenateThe composition to be:12 European seats (elected by Europeans on the&quot; A&quot; Roll. Six members to representMashonaland and six members to representMatabeleland).8 African (elected by Africans on the &quot; A &quot; and&quot; B &quot; Rolls voting together. Four members to represent Mashonaland and four members to represent Matabeleland.)6 Chiefs (elected by Chiefs Council).3.  FranchiseThe &quot; B &quot; Roll franchise to be extended to include all Africansover 30 who satisfy the citizenship and residencequalifications.Reserved European seats to be elected by the Europeanelectorate.Cross voting to be retained and applied to all seats.4.   DelimitationAlteration in the composition of both Houses and in number of seats to be effected by special entrenchment procedure. But theterms of reference of the Delimitation Commission are to incorporate the agreed formula as follows:The overriding objective of the Commission is so to divide the constituencies that the proportion of those with amajority of African voters on the &quot; A&quot; Roll at the time ofdelimitation is the same as the proportion of African voters thenon the &quot; A &quot; Roll for the country as a whole.Subject to this, the Commission is to take into account the factors specified in Section 38.5.  Terms of Office of Senators20 Elected members as for Legislative Assembly.6 Chiefs as for Legislative Assembly although a chief will vacate his office as a Senator ifhe ceases to be a Chief.Chiefs are only to be removed fromoffice on the recommendation of an impartial judicial tribunal.6.  Powers of SenateThe powers of the Senate will be:(a) Review of legislation.(b) Special legislative powers in respect of Tribal Land,Law and Custom.(c) Amendment of Constitution see below.Members of the Senate may be appointed as Ministers.
7.  Executive powers the Governor-General will act on Ministers&apos; advice in all matters.8.   Amendment of the ConstitutionOrdinary amendments of the Constitution will require, as now,a vote of two-thirds of the total membership of the LegislativeAssembly.The amendment of the Specially Entrenched provisions of theConstitution will require a vote of at least three-quarters of the total membership of both Houses voting together. In addition there willbe a system of appeal against such an amendment. The amendmentwill not come into force until the time for appeal has expired orthe appeal has been finally disposed of. The appeal will lie in thefirst instance to a Constitutional Commission in Rhodesia, consistingof the Chief Justice and other judges; with further appeal as of rightto the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The permittedgrounds of appeal will be that the amendment discriminates unjustlyor has the effect of discriminating unjustly between the races orcontravenes any of the provisions of the Declaration of Rightscontained in the Constitution.II9.   Fourth princeple as a minimum requirement to give effect to the fourth principle,a Royal Commission will be set up without delay to study and make recommendations on the problems of racial discrimination, inparticular Land Apportionment in Rhodesia, and the possibility of extending the competence of the Constitutional Council to embracepre-1961 legislation: and a Standing Commission will keep theproblems of racial discrimination under regular review.Ill10.  Return to Legality and the Fifth PrincipleAn Order in Council will be made as soon as possible permittingthe appointment by the Governor of a Prime Minister and other ministers in Rhodesia.11. The existing Legislature will be dissolved. The Governorwill be invested with legislative powers, to be used on the advice ofMinisters except in those cases where he is empowered to act in hisown discretion. No later than four months from the date ofdissolution of the Legislature, and on the assumption that the test of acceptability referred to in paragraph 17 below will have beencompleted in that interval, new elections will be held. If that testhas shown that the new Constitution is acceptable to the people of rhodesia as a whole, a further election, on the basis of thatConstitution, will be held as soon as possible either immediately before or immediately after independence.
12. As soon as the Order in Council mentioned in paragraph10 above is made, the Governor, in the full exercise of hisconstitutional powers, will invite Mr. Smith to head a broad-basedinterim Government which will include, in addition to representativesof existing political parties, independent members and Africans.13. This Government will be appointed by the Governor inhis discretion.14. The restored constitutional Government will be based uponthe 1961 Constitution, modified (by Order in Council which will bemade as soon as possible) to provide that during the interim period before the first election is held Rhodesian Ministers will be appointedby and responsible to the Governor, who will normally act on their advice in all internal matters of administration but, as regards hisultimate responsibility for the maintenance of law and order and theprotection of human right, will be advised, in his capacity as commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces, by a Defence and security Council, comprising the responsible Ministers, together withthe heads of the Defence Forces, the Chief of Police, and arepresentative of the British Government.15. During the interim period, and before any testing of opinionunder the Fifth Principle is carried out, censorship will be removed;and normal political activities will be permitted, provided they areconducted peacefully and democratically and without intimidationfrom any quarter. In this connection an impartial judicial tribunal,appointed by the Rhodesian Government, but including one british representative nominated by the Lord Chancellor, will be set up toconsider the detention and restriction of persons on security grounds.Such detention and restriction will not be authorised unless thetribunal are affirmatively satisfied that the persons concerned have committed, or incited the commission of, acts of violence orintimidation.16. As soon as possible after the return to legality, theBritish Government will negotiate with the legal Government thedetails of the constitutional settlement for an independent Rhodesiain accordance with the arrangements already agreed informally anddescribed in Part I of this document.17. The agreed settlement will be submitted to the test ofacceptability to the people of Rhodesia as a whole by a RoyalCommission whose composition and terms of reference will be agreed by the British Government with the legal interim Administration.18. If the settlement is shown to be acceptable to the people of rhodesia as a whole, the British Government will at the earliestpossible date introduce the necessary legislation to grant independence to Rhodesia on this basis and will commend this legislation toParliament.19. The two Governments will also negotiate the terms of aTreaty guaranteeing the independence Constitution. They will also
enter into discussions on the desirability of negotiating an appropriateDefence Agreement for the purpose of regulating future defencerelations between the two Governments.20. If however the settlement is shown to be unacceptable tothe people of Rhodesia as a whole, the two Governments will immediately confer together to consider what steps should be takento devise alternative proposals for an independence Constitution.21. On the restoration of legal government, the BritishGovernment will take all action in their power to bring about theimmediate discontinuance of the economic and other sanctions atpresent in force.
