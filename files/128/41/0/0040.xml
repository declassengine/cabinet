Oversea AffairsTheGovernmentsEconomicMeasures(previous reference:CC(66) 38thConclusions)Indonesia(previous reference:CC(66) 36thConclusions,Minute 2)CC 40 (66)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that there had been a generalrecognition overseas of the severity of and the sacrifices entailed by,the Government^ economic measures. The first reaction inGovernmental circles had been cordial, but the measures had been less warmly received in financial and industrial circles and the subsequent reaction of Governments had in consequence been morehesitant. The main concern overseas was in respect of the effectiveness of the proposed standstill of prices and wages: therewas also concern at what the trade figures for the next few monthsmight prove to be. In general, there was some scepticism aboutwhether the measures had been taken in time and, in some quarters,concern that severe though they were, they might still not be severeenough to meet the present need. Nevertheless, the general feeling was that the measures would give us a breathing space and anopportunity to solve our longer-term economic problems: in thesecircumstances, it would be regarded as reasonable that we should draw upon the Basle credits for the next few months to tide us overimmediate difficulties. In the constituent countries of the european free Trade Association there was widespread relief that we had not,as it were, exported our economic difficulties by placing further restrictions upon our trade.The new Indonesian Cabinet had now been formed. It wasconsiderably smaller than its predecessor and all but one of the mainsupporters of President Sukarno had been dropped from it. Thenew Minister of Finance was expected to be more effective than his predecessor in dealing with the country&apos;s economic problems andwas also known to be sympathetic to the view that compensation should be paid for the assets of United Kingdom firms in Indonesiawhich had been nationalised. In sum, the new appointmentsrepresented a further setback to President Sukarno, but the outcomewas still uncertain.The Cabinet-   ^Took note of these statements.Prices and incomes PolicyPrices andIncomesStandstill(previous reference:CC(66) 38thConclusions)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs(C (66) 122), to which was attached a draft White Paper on the standstill for prices and incomes and a note on the new clauses whichit was proposed to add to the Prices and Incomes Bill. The cabinet also had before them the text of proposed additions to the prices and Incomes Bill.The First Secretary of State said that the representatives of the confederation of British Industries (CBI) had indicated to him thatthey would advise their Grand Council to support the standstill for prices and incomes and to be ready to give advice to members on7160-2A 2
its working. They were, however, insisting as a condition of their support that there should be no exceptions from the standstill on incomes, except for scale and age pay increments. He had taken note of their views. The General Council of the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) had decided to acquiesce in the standstill, but were pressing for provisions which would allow at least increases of incomes for lower-paid workers and increases related to productivity agreements even during the period of the standstill.The Cabinet might wish to direct their attention mainly to thenature of the new powers which it was proposed to add to the prices and Incomes Bill, to the arrangements for bringing those powers intoeffect, and to the manner in which existing commitments should betreated under the incomes standstill. They might wish then toconsider the draft White Paper in detail. It was proposed to publish the White Paper during the course of the morning of 29th July, andto table amendments to the Prices and Incomes Bill shortly beforethe House of Commons rose on that same day.In discussion the view was expressed that the proposed additions to the Prices and Incomes Bill were considerably more drastic than might have been expected from the references to &quot; strengthening thePrices and Incomes Bill&quot; in previous Cabinet discussion and in thePrime Ministers statement of 20th July, and it was suggested thatin the form proposed they had alarming implications. employers were to be placed under legal obligations not to pay increased wages,and a trade unionist who sought to bring pressure to bear uponemployers to pay increased wages despite these obligations would render himself liable to the payment of a fine; if he refused to payable fine he could be committed to prison. The Cabinet had acceptedarrangements of this kind in relation to Part II of the Bill, but itwas another matter to contemplate the extension of these arrangements in the much wider context covered by Part IV of theBill. It was argued that the provision would in practice beunenforceable: if a union leader were determined to force a challenge to the standstill and laid himself open to the penalties, theGovernment could hardly do otherwise than prosecute him, andthere was a danger that a successful prosecution in thesecircumstances would lead to widespread official or unofficialindustrial action. It could be argued that the Government shouldnot take powers which it was hardly conceivable that they should wish to exercise. In addition, the introduction of these powers couldjeopardise the acquiescence of the TUC General Council in the standstill; even if the General Councils acquiescence were confirmed,there would be a danger of adverse votes at the TUC AnnualCongress and at the Annual Conference of the Labour Party, whichwould seriously undermine not only the credibility of the standstillpolicy but also confidence in sterling and even the authority of theGovernment.A number of suggestions for avoiding or minimising thesedangers were considered. It was suggested, for example, that theGovernment should take powers to enforce only a standstill on prices, relying upon the psychological impact and upon the pressure
CC 40 (66)which such a standstill would put upon employers to ensure thatthis led to an effective standstill on wages and salaries. In this event the Government would have to be prepared to stand out againststrike action in pursuance of wage claims, and would be unable toexercise any conciliation functions. The objection to this was that over a wide range of goods a rigid standstill on prices could not inpractice be enforced, though it could be applied in relation to certainbasic commodities such as bread and coal. It was likely that employers would not stand up to demands for wage increases, andthe standstill would break down. It was also suggested that theGovernment might take powers to enforce a standstill on prices and also to require employers not to pay increases, but refrain from taking powers to prosecute union leaders for bringing pressure onemployers to pay in spite of their legal obligations to do so. To this it was objected that Part IV of the Bill so amended would seem toopinion both at home and overseas to be one-sided in its impact;this would both be grossly unfair and would reduce its credibility.It would put employers in an intolerably difficult position, wheremany of them would prefer to concede wage increases and risk a fine. In the circumstances fines imposed by the courts might wellbe derisory. Moreover, it was pointed out that, if the clauseproviding for a specific sanction on trade unionists were removed,trade unionists who sought by pressure upon or collusion with employers to secure wage increases would render themselves liableto prosecution for criminal conspiracy: this would frustrate theobject of the change and could lead to industrial chaos. Theprovision included in Part II of the Bill (Clause 16 (4)), which it was now proposed to extend to Part IV, had been designed specifically to avoid this difficulty, and it was hardly possible to withdraw that provision at this stage.If it were accepted that none of these suggestions should beadopted, the choice would lie between introducing amendments tothe Bill on the lines of the draft before the Cabinet or dropping theproposal to strengthen the Bill and relying on voluntary co-operation.While the second alternative would avoid many difficulties, it would seriously diminish the credibility of the standstill, and it wouldmanifestly fail to fulfil the Prime Ministers pledge to prevent theselfish from taking advantage of the co-operation of the rest.It was further suggested that, if it were decided to proceed withthe additions to the Bill on the lines proposed, some of the potentialembarrassment might be avoided by making the operation of the sanctions upon trade unionists, or the operation of the whole ofPart IV, subject to affirmative resolution in both Houses ofParliament. As drafted, Part IV of the Bill enabled the first secretary of State to introduce Orders applying the section to particular prices or incomes; these Orders were to be subject tonegative resolution, in order that there should be no delay inbecoming effective. It would not be desirable to make only the sanctions on trade unionists applicable by Order subject to affirmative resolution, leaving the remaining sections of Part IV applicable by
Order subject to negative resolution. But if the Bill were altered sothat Part IV came into effect only upon introduction of an Ordersubject to affirmative resolution, this would give point to theGovernments declared intention of proceeding in the first instance by voluntary means. It was to be expected that the Governmentwould in due course need to have recourse to statutory powers, butit might be possible to defer the making of an Order bringing Part IVinto effect until later in the year, relying upon voluntary co-operation in the meantime. One major difficulty about this was that Part IVincluded provisions enabling employers to withhold increases of remuneration which had been conceded but not paid, withoutrendering themselves liable to be sued for breach of contract. Thiswould be likely to mean that deferment of existing commitmentscould not be operated in the private sector, even though it was beingoperated in the public sector, until such time as Part IV becameoperative.It was for consideration, if it were decided that Part IV of theBill should become operative only upon laying an Order subject to affirmative resolution, whether those resolutions should be requiredto be passed within 28 sitting days or 28 calendar days. if theresolutions had to be passed within 28 sitting days, the Governmentwould be able to introduce an Order at any time during the Recesswithout recalling Parliament. On the other hand it was suggestedthat it would be preferable for the resolutions to be required within28 calendar days. This would make it clear that the government regarded the introduction of Part IV of the Bill as being a matter ofsuch moment that, if it were required in the middle of the Recess,Parliament should be recalled. This might help to allay misgivingsabout the nature of the powers to be taken.In discussion of the treatment of existing commitments it was strongly urged that firm settlements concluded before 20th July for increases with an operative date on or before 20th July should beallowed to stand. On this basis less than 10 per cent of those coveredby existing commitments would escape the standstill. If on theother hand cases of this kind were to be caught by the standstill, theeffect would be particularly severe in the public sector: the increases for doctors would be deferred (though not those for dentists, since they were already in payment); and so would increases for a numberof National Health Service classes, including nursing tutors anddispensing assistants, and increases for manual workers in the gassupply industry and municipal busmen. The increases for multiplebakers would also be caught; but there was a real danger that thebaking employers would pay these increases before the Bill becamelaw in any event.The Minister of Health pointed out that he, and indeed theGovernment, were committed by firm pledges to the payment of thefirst instalment of the increases to the doctors. Deferment would affect not only the general practitioners but also the hospital doctors,including the house officers (whose increases had been generally approved) and the middle grade hospital doctors. There would bea serious danger that many of the younger hospital doctors would
emigrate, and that a large number of general practitioners wouldresign from the National Health Service and seek their fortunes in private practice through Independent Medical Services Limited, aprivate insurance scheme sponsored by the British medical association. In the case not only of the doctors but also of theother National Health Service grades, the reason why the increases were not already in payment was the delay in the issue of instructionsto paying offices, for which the Government was responsible. Itwould be hard to justify enforcing a deferment of implementation inthese circumstances.It was also pointed out that there were some groups of workerswhere increases were already being paid to some members of thegroup but not to others. In these cases it would be indefensible to withhold the increase from those members of the group who had notyet received it.It was further suggested that in view of the difficulty of deferringexisting commitments the best solution might be to authorisepayment of all the increases agreed before 20th July with effectivedates before 20th July. It was pointed out, however, that an exception as large as this from the standstill would make it difficult for the Government to resist pressure for other exemptions (suchas increases for lower-paid workers and increases related toproductivity agreements), and might jeopardise readiness to acquiesce in the standstill, particularly among those groups with existing commitments for increases to come into effect after 20th July. If itwas desirable to have no exceptions to the policy, then theGovernment should stand fast on the deferment of existing commitments. It might be that a particular difficulty arose in thecase of the doctors, but it also had to be recognised that the increasesagreed for doctors had been particularly contentious. It was accepted that, if as a result of the decision to defer existing commitments the first instalment of the increases for doctors weredeferred, it should be made clear that the second instalment, due on1st April, 1967, would be paid on the due date.In discussion of the draft White Paper the following points weremade:Section II(a) The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food would agree with the First Secretary of State upon the treatment of theearly warning and constant watch arrangements applicable tocommodities in the food sector.(b) The limit in paragraph 8 (b) should be 100 workers.(c) It might be desirable to strengthen paragraph 9 in the lightof the powers which the Government were proposing to take.(d) Paragraph 10 should include the proposed additionalsentences, save for that in which it was stated that the imposition ofa general standstill would be inappropriate. It should be made clearthat the paragraph applied to rent increases already announced, but
not yet put into effect. The final decision on increases of public sector rents should remain with local authorities, but words shouldbe inserted to make it clear that local authorities would be expectedto consult, and make a case to, the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment or the Secretary of State for Scotland.(e) Paragraph 12 should be included as drafted, with the words&quot; and other &quot; inserted after &quot; agriculture &quot;.(/) The proposed paragraphs 13 and 14 on prices of houses andloan charges were so inconclusive that they would be better omitted.Section 111(g) Paragraphs 5-7 would need to be recast in the light of the cabinet&apos;s decision on the treatment of existing commitments.(h) It would be desirable to include in paragraph 11, or at someother appropriate point, a reference to the strengthening of theNational Board for Prices and Incomes.(/) It should be made clear in paragraph 15 that the standstillapplied in principle not only to salaries of company directors and senior executives but to all executives in industry and commerce.(/) The section on profits and dividends should be redrafted soas to make it clear that as a result of fiscal measures already takenit was expected that there would not be an increase in averagedividends in the succeeding 12 months. It would be necessary toretain the footnote making it clear that distributions by &quot; closelycontrolled companies &quot; might have to be excluded from the standstill.The White Paper should not recognise in terms that there might be other cases in which it would be in accordance with the national interest to permit an increased distribution, but it should be made clear that any company which contemplated an increased distributionshould inform the Government.(k) Paragraph 17 should refer to &quot; the scales of charges and fees &quot;rather than to &quot; the incomes &quot; of self-employed persons.(/) It was agreed that it would not be appropriate to include inthis White Paper a reference to the economic case for profitability,though occasion might arise in speeches for such a reference.Section IV(m) An amendment to paragraph 3 proposed by the Minister ofTransport was accepted.Section VI(n) This section of the White Paper would need to be redraftedin the light of the Cabinefs decision on the arrangements for bringingPart IV of the Prices and Incomes Bill into operation.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of view in the Cabinet was in favour of introducing into thePrices and Incomes Bill the additional Part IV as proposed in thedraft amendments before them. It was, however, the Cabinefs view
7160-2bthat Part IV of the Bill should come into operation only on theintroduction of an Order, which would come into effect immediatelyit was laid but would lapse unless it was confirmed by resolution ofboth Houses of Parliament within 28 calendar days. No course opento the Government was free from difficulty or risk of embarrassment,but this would enable the additional provisions to be presented as a balanced combination of powers bearing upon both employers and employees, and as a demonstration of the Governmenfs preference for proceeding by voluntary means and of their determination toenforce the standstill by statutory powers if voluntary means broke down. On existing commitments in the incomes field, the general principle in the Cabinet view should be that payment should be deferred for six months from 20th July or from the operative date,whichever was the later, and that no restrospection should be paidin respect of the six months&apos; delay due to the standstill. This meant that:(a) In the case of firm commitments entered into on or before20th July for increases to become operative on or before 20th July:(i) where increases were already in payment to some membersof a group of workers they should not be withheld fromothers;(ii) where increases were not yet in payment for any membersof a group of workers, the operative date of the increases should be deferred for six months and no payments should be made until the end of the first six months ofthe standstill period.(b) In the case of firm commitments entered into on or before20th July for increases to become operative from a date after20th July, the increases should become operative and could be paid from a date six months after the agreed operative date. Increasesdue under contractual commitments entered into before 20th July tobecome operative after the end of the six months period of standstillshould be operative and payable from the agreed date.The draft White Paper should be revised in accordance withthese decisions and in the light of other points made in discussion,and should be published as soon as possible on 29th July. The draftamendments to the Prices and Incomes Bill should be revised to take account of the Cabinefs decision on the arrangements for bringing them into operation, and tabled in the House of Commons on29th July.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the proposed Part IV of the Prices and incomes bill should be on the lines of the draft amendmentsbefore them, save that provision should be includedwhereby Part IV of the Bill would be brought intooperation by an Order which would come into effect upon its being laid but would lapse unless confirmed by affirmative resolutions of both Houses of Parliamentwithin 28 calendar days of being laid.
(2) Agreed that, in the case of firm commitments entered into on or before 20th July, 1966, for pay increases to be operative from a date on or before 20th July, 1966:(a) where an increase was already in payment to some members of a group concerned, it should not be withheld from the remainder;(b) where an increase was not yet in payment for any ofthose concerned, the operative date should be deferred for six months and no payments shouldbe made until the end of the six months&apos; period ofstandstill.(3) Agreed that, in the case of firm commitments entered into on or before 20th July, 1966, for pay increases to be operative from a date during the standstill period of six months from 20th July, 1966, the operative date should be deferred for six months.Agreed that, in the case of firm commitments entered into on or before 20th July, 1966, for pay increases to be operative from a date after the end of the standstill periodof six months from 20th July, 1966, the increases shouldbe operative and payable from the agreed operative date.Invited the First Secretary of State to revise the draft white paper attached to his memorandum (C (66) 122) to accord with these decisions and with other points made in discussion, and to arrange for publication as indicated inthe Prime Ministers summing up.Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the draftamendments to the Prices and Incomes Bill to be revised to accord with the decision at (1), and to table the amendments so revised in the House of Commons on29th July.secret. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.In discussion it was agreed that the amendments to the prices and Incomes Bill which had been approved by the Cabinet under theprevious item of their agenda might now be handed to the Opposition.Unless agreement could then be reached with the latter on an acceptable time-table for dealing with all the further stages of theBill a guillotine motion in respect of it should be tabled for debate on the following Monday.In further discussion the Cabinet were informed that while itwas still uncertain when Parliament would rise for the summer recess, this would probably be on Friday, 12th August. parliament would resume after the Summer Recess on Tuesday, 18th October.
CONFIDENTIAL11248AircraftIndustry(previous reference:CC (66) 39thConclusions,Minute 4)Re-equipment of BritishEuropeanAirwaysThe Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Aviation to inform BEA of their decision that their fleet should be re-equipped with united Kingdom aircraft, and in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to assure them that theGovernment were willing in principle to assist them todeal with the problems with which this decision would present them.(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation to make an announcement to that effect in Parliament in the early part of thefollowing week, and to concert the terms of theannouncement with the First Secretary of State, theChancellor of the Exchequer, the President of the Boardof Trade and the Minister of Technology.(3) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theMinister of Aviation, to arrange for a further study to beCONFIDENTIAL4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the first secretary of State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs(C (66) 119) on the aircraft industry.The First Secretary said that Cabinet might wish to consider thelast two issues set out in the memorandum, namely the proposedmerger of the aero-engine interests of Rolls-Royce and BristolSiddeley, and the reorganisation of the airframe industry at a later meeting. The Minister of Aviation, however, had to make anannouncement about the future equipment of British overseas airways Corporation (BOAC) (which had already been decided) andof British European Airways (BEA) in the early part of the following week. It would, therefore be desirable to come to a decision on thelatter question at their present meeting. After a full discussion ofthis question the Ministerial Committee on Economic Developmenthad unanimously come to the conclusions set out in his memorandum,namely that despite the economic and financial disadvantages, itwould be right to require BEA to buy United Kingdom aircraft In response-equipping their fleet. Coming on top of the purchase of long-haulUnited States aircraft already authorised by BOAC, a similarpurchase by BEA would not only involve a substantial cost in foreign exchange, but would also seriously, and perhaps irreparably, damage the prospects of the United Kingdom aircraft industry in the medium-haul civil airline field. The Committee accepted that ifBEA were required to buy United Kingdom aircraft, they wouldhave to be given an assurance that the Government would be willingin principle to assist them to deal with the problems with which thisdecision would present them; and had recommended that thereshould be further study of the problems which would be raised andthe means by which assistance would be given.
confidentialmade of the means by which assistance should be givento BEA, of the size, constitution and timing of BEAorders and of the implications of postponing re-equipment for domestic routes.(4) Agreed to resume their discussion of C (66) 119 at a subsequent meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th July, 1966
