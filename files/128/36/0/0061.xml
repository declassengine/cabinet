The Prime Minister said that it would be some little time before the negotiations for our entry into the European economic community could be brought to a conclusion. For the time beingMinisters should, in their public speeches, avoid accepting specificcommitments, or giving explanations of the Governments generalcommitments, which might prove embarrassing when the final termsbecame known in detail. It would be desirable to maintain thegeneralised tone of the speech which he had himself made at therecent conference in Llandudno. More detailed arguments might with advantage be left to the various organisations, such as theFederation of British Industries, who were likely to support theGovernments general policy but whose statements could not be held to commit the Government. The object should be to maintain the sense of confidence and advance which had been engendered but toavoid bringing the campaign prematurely to a climax.In discussion it was noted that one point which could usefully be stressed was that many of the younger economists were in favourof our entry into the Community; they did not accept the static view taken by some of their older colleagues and were persuaded that, ona more dynamic view, the economic advantages would heavilyoutweigh the disadvantages.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.Cuba(previous reference:CC. (62) 59thConclusions,Minute 1)*3. The Prime Minister said that on the evening of Sunday,20th October, he had been warned by the United States ambassador in London to expect a personal message from President Kennedy.This was the first intimation to him of the chain of events which had led to the imposition of the United States blockade of Cuba.In his first message President Kennedy had reported evidenceof the build-up of a Soviet missile capability in Cuba, and had saidthat on his own responsibility he had decided to prevent any furtherbuild-up by sea and to demand the removal of this threat to theWestern hemisphere. He recognised the seriousness of this step andthe danger that action taken to contain the Cuban situation mighthave repercussions in Berlin. He had, however, felt it essential to demonstrate to the Soviet Government that if they had counted onweakness or irresolution, they bad miscalculated. President Kennedyhad added that he regretted the lack of consultation, which hadbeen due to the fact that firm evidence of the Soviet capability had only come to light in the course of the preceding week, and that hehad judged speed of decision to be essential. He hoped, however,that in the further development of the crisis the United States and united Kingdom Governments would act closely together.A further and more detailed letter from President Kennedy hadbeen received on 21st October and the United States ambassador had provided information, although not in great detail, about theextent of the Soviet build-up. The most disturbing feature of this had been the identification of 21 medium-range ballistic missile sites and eight intermediate-range ballistic missile sites capable betweenSecretary ot 1.   The Cabinet  were  informed  of Sir  Norman  Brook&apos;sthe Cabinet      indisposition and asked that an expression of their sympathy andgood wishes for a speedy recovery should be conveyed to him.
them of covering the whole of the United States. The presence of nuclear warheads in Cuba had not been definitely established.President Kennedy&apos;s second letter had referred again, to theevidence of the Soviet build-up, had recalled his previous public statement that the presence of ground-to-ground missiles in Cubawould be considered as an offensive threat and the repeatedstatements of the Soviet authorities that such armaments and military equipment as had been sent to Cuba were exclusively defensive. Inthe light of this development he had decided to impose a blockade ofCuba with the object of preventing the Soviet Union from introducing additional missiles into Cuba and of securing thewithdrawal of the missiles already in place. This decision would be conveyed in a public statement to be made that evening in washington, of which an advance text would be sent to London inthe course of the day.President Kennedy had concluded his letter by saying that hehad called an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security council at which the United States would present a resolution calling for thewithdrawal of offensive weapons from Cuba under United Nationssupervision. In this event the United States would lift its blockade.He hoped that the United Kingdom would give him full support inthe Security Council debate.The Prime Minister said that there had been a considerable delay in the transmission of the text of President Kennedy&apos;s speech.This had, he believed, been caused by argument about the limitation to be imposed on the United States blockade. In the passagedescribing the nature of the blockade President Kennedy, while making clear that it would for the time being be confined to shipsfound to be containing cargoes of offensive weapons, had said thatit would be extended, if needed, to other types of cargoes andcarriers. The Prime Minister said that he felt that this possibleextension of the blockade was the point which had caused mostdifficulty as it was clearly the most dangerous, since it envisaged the interception of aircraft and the reduction of Cuba by siege.The Prime Minister said that in the course of 21st October hehad considered various possible messages to President Kennedy, but had decided to wait for the text of his speech. When this had beenreceived he had replied at once. He had started by expressing hisunderstanding of the fierce reaction of American public opinion withwhich President Kennedy had to reckon. He had promised full support in the Security Council, but had asked for help in preparing a legal case to support the broad moral position; the internationallawyers would be bound to make the point that a blockade involving the search of ships of all countries was difficult to defend in peacetimeand had indeed been the subject of controversy in war. He had,however, accepted that precedents were little guide to conditions inthe nuclear age.His letter had then dealt with Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s likely reactionif the Security Council resolution were vetoed and if the general assembly, as was to be expected, failed to recommend any conclusiveaction. Mr. Khrushchev might content himself with demanding theremoval of American bases in Europe. Alternatively, he might act either in the Caribbean or elsewhere. In the Caribbean his obviouscourse v/ould be to escort Russian ships and to force the americans to fire first: this was a dilemma with which we had always hoped toconfront the Russians and might now find it turned upon ourselves.If Mr. Khrushchev decided to act elsewhere it might be in South-east asia, in Iran, possibly in Turkey, but more likely in Berlin. the obvious way to answer a blockade in Cuba would be by imposing a blockade elsewhere. Soviet retaliation in Berlin would lead eitherto an escalation to world war or to the holding of a conference.  He
and President Kennedy should concert their policy as soon as theRussian reaction was known and decide in what direction it shouldbe their object to steer the course of events both within the north atlantic Alliance and elsewhere.His letter to President Kennedy had ended by mentioning twoaspects of his decision which would be bound to cause concern. Inthe first place, European countries had lived for so long withinrange of Russian missiles of the most devastating kind that they had got used to it and might not fully understand the strength of theUnited States reaction. Secondly, Mr. Khrushchev would be likely,at any conference, to try to trade Cuba for Berlin. This must be avoided at all costs since it would endanger the unity of the Alliance.President Kennedy had replied to this letter late on 21st October.He had promised immediate consultation on the legal issues, based in the first instance on the Rio Treaty of 1947. In defence of his general action he had explained that he did not regard this asconditioned by American public opinion or by the existence of amissile threat. The United States had been under threat frominter-Continental ballistic missiles for some time. He did, however,consider that the Soviet action in Cuba constituted so deep a breachin the conventions of the international stalemate, that if unchallengedit would deeply shake confidence in the United States and would encourage Mr. Khrushchev to further and more dangerous moves.Action was admittedly dangerous. But inaction would be still more so. His action had not been influenced by feelings against Cuba. Itwas rather the first step in a major showdown with Mr. Khrushchev,whose action in Cuba had been so much at variance with allprediction that it was necessary to revise previous estimates of hislevel of desperation or ambition. He had agreed on the importanceof taking account of European public opinion and of keeping in the closest touch about Berlin. He had admitted that he knew of noescape from the problem of the first shot, although his navalcommanders had been instructed to use the minimum of force.The Prime Minister said that in the early hours of the morninghe had spoken to President Kennedy. The President had reiteratedhis view that firmness offered the best chance of avoiding theoutbreak of a third world war and had recalled the lesson of Hitler.He had clearly not formed a definite view about the nature of thenext step; whether to work for a conference at Head of Governmentlevel or to persist in the attempt to secure by force, or threat of force,the removal of offensive weapons from Cuba.The Prime Minister said that he had also been in touch withGeneral de Gaulle. General de Gaulle had said that he had himselfreceived a message from President Kennedy and had discussed thesituation with Mr. Acheson, who had produced photographs of soviet installations in Cuba. General de Gaulle said that he had instructed the French representative at the Security Council tosupport the United States representative, though he attached little importance to the Security Council debate. He had, however,emphasised that if Mr. Khrushchev reacted to the blockade of Cubaby a blockade or some other measure directed at Berlin, the questionimmediately affected France and the United Kingdom as well as theUnited States, and he would expect immediate and continuousconsultation between the three Powers. He was sceptical about the effectiveness of the Cuban blockade and considered that the Sovietbuild-up in Cuba might be designed to secure the withdrawal ofUnited States bases in Europe. He had, however, agreed that theUnited States Government could not have been expected to ignore the Soviet threat.
The Prime Minister said that he would welcome the views of hiscolleagues.The Foreign Secretary said that it was at present difficult to assess the policy behind Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s action in Cuba. president kennedy had suggested that it might be either desperation orambition and both were possible. Soviet setbacks in agriculture andthe failure of their economy to meet earlier hopes of overtaking theWest might be leading Mr. Khrushchev into a military gamble; andit would be consistent with such an intention to have covered the initial moves with professions of peaceful intent. But he himselfthought it unlikely that Mr. Khrushchev wanted to start a war. Itwas more probable that he was seeking to improve his bargaining position, particularly in relation to Berlin, and that he wanted theUnited States Government to appreciate from their own experiencethe Soviet reaction to the presence of United States&apos; missile bases inEurope close to Russia and their determination to secure their removal.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It was possible that substance could be given to the legal case for the United States blockade of Cuba in the context of regionaldefence arrangements of a type specifically allowed for under the charter of the United Nations. The Lord Chancellor undertook toexamine this point with a view to preparing a brief for the UnitedKingdom representative at the United Nations.(b) The British shipping industry had already declared its willingness to co-operate with the United States authorities, e.g., byrouting ships to prearranged rendezvous for search. It was, however,doubtful whether such a course of action would be acceptable toParliament. There were objections in principle to allowing british ships in peacetime to be searched on the high seas. Since theGovernment had already asked shipowners to refrain from carryingmilitary cargoes to Cuba and since there was no reason to think thatthis request had not been complied with, it was possible that theUnited States authorities might be prepared to let British shipsthrough without search. It should not, however, be forgotten that president Kennedy&apos;s speech had intimated that the blockade mightbe extended to cover cargoes other than military equipment. TheForeign Secretary and the Minister of Transport undertook toexamine this question further and to determine a course of actionwhich would meet the needs of the United States Government andwould be most likely to be acceptable to Parliament.(c) The country would expect to be informed at once of theGovernments reaction to President Kennedy&apos;s speech. It was agreedthat in any immediate comment on the situation Ministers shouldtake the line that the Government were deeply concerned at theprovocation presented by Soviet action in Cuba, that they had been kept fully informed by the United States authorities, that they wouldgive full support to the United States in the forthcoming debate inthe Security Council and that the United Kingdom representativewas being instructed accordingly; and that they had no objection tothe imposition of the blockade since British ships had already been instructed not to carry arms to Cuba.(d) There would be serious repercussions in Parliament. the leader of the Opposition, who had been informed of the situation on21st October, had given no undertaking to refrain from condemningthe United States action and some of his supporters would almost inevitably do so. Consideration should be given to the advisability of a statement in Parliament on 25th October before the Prorogation.A fuller debate might be expected at the beginning of the Debate onthe Address on 30th October. It would also be necessary to include
references to the Cuban situation in The Queen&apos;s speeches both onthe Prorogation and on the Opening of Parliament. The foreign secretary undertook to prepare suitable drafts.(e) Reports had appeared in the Press that a large Russianconvoy was on its way to Cuba although this had not been confirmedfrom intelligence sources. Whatever the truth of the report,Mr. Khrushchev would sooner or later be faced with a decisionbetween attempting to force the United States blockade or ofdiverting Soviet ships. It appeared that up to the present no publicityhad been given in Moscow to the United States blockade; and to this extent Mr. Khrushchev had left himself room for manoeuvre. to divert Russian ships would represent an immediate loss of prestige and seemed inconsistent with the deliberate provocation of the soviet military build-up in Cuba itself. As against this, it could be argued that by avoiding a resort to force at this stage Mr. Khrushchev would greatly strengthen his position at the United Nations, particularly with the Afro-Asian group.(/) Among the many dangers in the present situation the risk ofa serious division between the United States and Europe, or betweenthe United States, the United Kingdom and the other countries ofthe North Atlantic Alliance was potentially the most serious, andwould give the greatest advantage to the Soviet cause.Summing up the Prime Minister said that it was clear that no decision on policy could be taken until some firmer indication hadbeen obtained of the probable nature of Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s reaction to the United States blockade of Cuba. It would be necessary tokeep the situation under close and continuous review. He would bein touch with President Kennedy as also with the other european governments concerned. It had been useful for the Cabinet to review the facts as now known and to discuss their possibleimplications, and the Cabinet would resume their discussion as soonas the development of the situation warranted it.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that in any immediate comment on the situationMinisters should take the line that the Government weredeeply concerned at the provocation presented by Sovietaction in Cuba, that they had been kept fully informed of developments by the United States authorities, that theywould give full support to the United States in theforthcoming debate in the Security Council and that theUnited Kingdom representative was being instructedaccordingly; and that they had no objection to theimposition of the blockade since British ships had alreadybeen instructed not to carry arms to Cuba.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the drafting ofsuitable passages on the situation in Cuba for inclusion inThe Queen&apos;s speeches on the Prorogation and Openingof Parliament.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider the advisability of making a statement in Parliament on25th October before the Prorogation.(4) Invited the Lord Chancellor to consider the legal justification for the imposition by the United States of a blockade ofCuba with a view to briefing the United kingdom permanent Representative at the United Nations for theforthcoming debate in the Security Council.
(5) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of transport to consider in the light of their discussion the actionwhich should be taken in regard to British ships tradingto Cuba, bearing in mind the objections which would beraised in Parliament to the stopping and search of british ships on the high seas in peacetime.Yemen 4.   The Foreign Secretary said that the latest information from(Previous the Yemen showed that the republican regime, with the help ofReference: Egyptian troops, were driving back the royalists both in the northC.C. (62) 60th and south of the country and were establishing their control. It was conclusions, necessary to consider whether and when the United KingdomMinute l) Government should recognise the new regime. Italy was believed to be anxious to grant recognition quickly. So also was west germany, lest East Germany should do so first. But other countries,including the United States, were still holding back. If we were togrant recognition, there would be repercussions in the aden protectorate and in the Persian Gulf. On the other hand, ifrecognition were withheld we might fall foul of the new YemeniGovernment, who had claimed to be well disposed towards us. Thegeneral situation was disturbing; defections had occurred amongSaudi Arabian forces despatched to help the royalists, and theinfluence of Egypt was increasing. The Governor of Aden had accepted that recognition would have to be granted, but he wishedto be given time to explain to the Protectorate Rulers and to theSheikhs of the Persian Gulf that the grant of recognition to the new regime would be largely a technical matter implying no change inUnited Kingdom policy. This might mitigate but would noteliminate their anxiety. It would be necessary to watch the situation as it developed from day to day so that recognition would be timedto take place after the ground had been sufficiently prepared by talks with the Rulers, but would not be so delayed that our relations withthe republican Government in the Yemen would be damaged.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the recognition of the new regime inthe Yemen.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary, to arrange for consultationwith the rulers of pro-British territories in the persian gulf and of the Aden Protectorate in order to prepare theway for early recognition.public investment(previous reference:C.C. (62) 52ndConclusions,Minute 5)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (C. (62) 159), covering a draft White Paper on public investment for the period to March 1964.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that it had become the customto lay a White Paper on public investment at the beginning of eachsession of Parliament. The White Paper would be debated towardsthe end of November or early in December. The draft was largelyfactual and set out information on investment under two broadheads; first, the nationalised industries and public corporations and,second, public service investment on schools, housing, roads and other services of central and local government. The figures in the draftshowed substantial increases under both heads. These followedlargely from decisions which the Cabinet had taken on 1st August,1962. Since private investment was now showing some tendency to decline, this was an appropriate time for the announcement of increases in the public sector.   Two important figures remained to
be determined, namely, the increases in investment of the central electricity Generating Board and of the Post Office. In both thesecases, as in all nationalised industries to a greater or lesser extent,present policy was that investment should be determined largely by commercial criteria, including the return to be expected on capital invested. He hoped that the debate on the White Paper wouldprovide a suitable opportunity to explain in greater detail how theproposed investment would be distributed across the country to take account of variations in the load on the building and civil engineering industries.In discussion it was generally agreed that it would be unwise to try to make points of presentation in the text of a White Paper whichwas essentially factual. But there would be some danger ofmisconception in the public mind unless, when the White Paper was published, guidance was also given to the Press on the main featuresand implications of the investment figures. This should draw attention, for instance, to the significance of increased investment in housing; to the doubling of investment in roads in the North-East,and to the difficulty of giving figures of investment in the railwaysbefore the programme of closures had been finally settled.Various drafting amendments were suggested and approved.The Cabinet (1) Approved the White Paper for publication, subject to the drafting amendments suggested in discussion.(2) Invited the Minister without Portfolio, in consultation withthe Chief Secretary, Treasury, and other ministers concerned, to prepare information for the guidance ofthe Press, for issue when the White Paper was published,on the main features of the investment figures.UnitedNationsBond Issue(previous reference:C.C. (62) 9thConclusions,Minute 2)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (62) 160) about the purchase of United Nations bonds.The Foreign Secretary recalled that on 29th January parliament had been informed that we would buy United Nations bonds withina maximum of $12 million subject to the cash requirementsof the Organisation and the extent to which other countriessubscribed. The purpose of the bond issue had been to pay off a united Nations deficit amounting at the end of 1961 to about$100 million; and it now seemed likely that by the end of the current year the deficit would approach $200 million. Forty-nine member nations, including the United States, had made or pledged purchasestotalling about $150 million. In these circumstances we had littleground on which to refuse to honour our announced undertaking.We had not yet done so because most of the money so far subscribedhad been used for current expenses, including those of the united nations operations in the Congo. It was still possible that united nations policy in the Congo might not accord with our views. Butthe situation had changed in that, whereas until recently the dangerhad been that the United Nations would exert undue pressure onKatanga, their attention had now been turned to exerting pressure on the Central Congolese Government. Canada had alreadypurchased bonds, and it was believed that Australia was on the pointof doing so. It was unlikely that there would be a more suitablemoment than the present for our purchase, and if action by theUnited Nations caused further criticism in Parliament, the purchasemight be defended on the ground that its object was to defray oldbills, rather than to meet the cost of current operations. Given thepresent favourable circumstances, he suggested that the full quota of$12 million should be purchased now.
asIn discussion the following points were made:(a) It would be difficult to justify contributing a larger sumthan had at the time been contributed by the United States. So far$34 million had been subscribed by various member States; withina few days it was expected that the United States would match this with an equal amount. Whatever our subscription was, it wouldlikewise fall to be matched by a contribution from the United Stateswithin a total of $100 million.(b) While there might be a case for purchasing only half ourquota of $12 million at this stage, on the ground that other member states had so far contributed only $34 million, there would be advantage in making a single purchase. Two separate purchasesmight provide a double opportunity for criticism of United Kingdomco-operation with the United Nations in the Congo.The Cabinet Approved the immediate purchase of United Nations bondsto the value of $12 million.Pensions(previous reference:CC. (62) 45thConclusions,Minute 3)The HigherJudiciary7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C. (62) 154) suggesting the inclusion of the higher judiciary within the Pensions Increase Bill.The Lord Chancellor said that, in accordance with past practice,the current Pensions Increase Bill had been drafted to provideincreases in the pensions of retired members of the lower judiciaryand in the pensions of widows of former members of both the lowerand the higher judiciary, but the Cabinet had not so far been askedfor authority for the inclusion in the Bill of provision for increases in the pensions of former members of the higher judiciary. Therehad been no need to include the pensions of the higher judiciary in previous pensions increase measures because it was not until theJudicial Pensions Act of 1959 that the pensions of such judges already in retirement fell to a lower level than those of judges currentlyretiring. The Judicial Pensions Act, 1959, had granted increases inthe pensions of members of the higher judiciary who had alreadyretired, so that to include these pensions in the new Pensions IncreaseBill would not be a new departure in principle. Moreover, to theextent that the Bill restored in some measure the purchasing powerof older pensions, it was difficult to see why it should not be extendedto pensions of members of the higher judiciary which had declinedin purchasing power in the same way as other public service pensions.The difficulty was simply that the increases granted under the Billto members of the higher judiciary would be the largest under theBill; in one case as much as  504. But the total cost of these increases would be only  2,422 for the whole of Great Britain, and noNorthern Ireland judge would qualify.In discussion the view was expressed that, since the Bill would,for the most part, deal only with pensions of moderate size and provide increases of much smaller amounts than members of thehigher judiciary would receive, the addition of the higher judiciarymight be embarrassing. On the other hand, the necessary provisionfor the judges would be made by adding a further item to a list of provisions in a schedule to the Bill, and contrasts would be drawn inany case between the increases granted for relatively high pensionsand the position of those, whether covered by the Bill or not, whowere living on small pensions.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the pensions of the higher judiciary who retiredbefore 1959 should be included among those to beincreased under the forthcoming Pensions Increase Bill.
433e o tPublic Order 8.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (62) 156) about Fascist activities and public order.The Home Secretary said that the Government would beexpected to bring forward proposals to strengthen the law for dealingwith the activities of bodies such as the Union Movement and theNational Socialist Movement. Although there were difficulties about any action which might upset the delicate balance between the rightsof free speech and the need to preserve law and order, theGovernment would be criticised if they appeared to be doing nothing to restrain both those who offered provocation and those whoresponded with violence. If the law were strengthened against the fascist bodies, those who broke up their meetings would have noexcuse for doing so and would forfeit public sympathy if theypersisted.There would be no difficulty in, and there would be general support for, increasing the penalties for offences under sect;on 5 ofthe Public Order Act, 1936. But the Government would be expectedto go further. The idea which had been most freely canvassed (andwould be revived in a Private Member&apos;s Bill which Mr. Iremonger,M.P., intended to introduce in the coming session of Parliament)was that there should be added to section 5 an explicit reference toincitement to &quot; hatred of any racial group &quot;. This might not addanything material to the law as it stood, and a decision on whether to support the proposed change could not be taken until the courtshad settled one of the two cases which were pending. Theamendment suggested would certainly be ineffectual against theUnion Movement, whose speakers were now at pains to avoid usingwords which could be held to incite racial hatred; and it would notdeal with offensive written matter. Suggestions had also been madefor legislation in general terms to make incitement of racial hatred in public speech or in writing a criminal offence, regardless of its effecton public order. The weaknesses of legislation of this kind werethe difficulties of definition and enforcement which would arise andthe fact that it would again make no impact on the problem presented by the Union Movement; but these weaknesses were not necessarilyconclusive. A third possibility would be to take powers to enablethe police to ban meetings in advance on general grounds. This,however, would take the Government into very deep waters.In the forthcoming Debate on the Address, when theGovernment would be asked about their legislative intentions, itCC. 61 (62)Oversea The  Chief  Secretary,  Treasury,  said  that  the  LegislationPensions Committee had invited him to report to the Cabinet that provisionhad been included in the draft of the Pensions Increase Bill for theSecretary of Technical Co-operation to supplement the pensions ofcertain oversea pensioners where the Government by whom they hadbeen employed had not granted increases equivalent to those provided under domestic legislation for pensions of the British public services. This provision, which would cost about  1^ million a yearinitially, had been recommended by a working party under theSecretary for Technical Co-operation, and he, for his part, was prepared to accept it.The Cabinet (2) Agreed to the inclusion in the forthcoming Pensions IncreaseBill of provision for the pensions of British servants of oversea Governments to be increased to provide benefitequivalent to that of United Kingdom Pensions IncreaseActs.
would be appropriate to say (as he had suggested in paragraph 14 ofC. (62) 156) that until the cases now sub judice were decided it wouldbe impossible to hold that the present law was inadequate; thesituation would be reviewed in the light of decisions on those cases and if the law were shown to be inadequate immediate attentionwould be given to amendment. A promise could be given that steps would be taken to bring about an increase in penalties under theexisting law as soon as a suitable opportunity arose.In discussion the following points were raised:(a) There was no doubt about the need to increase the penalties for offences under section 5 of the Public Order Act. It would befor later consideration whether this should be done in general legislation to bring penalties up to date or in a measure dealingspecifically with public order.(b) Although the words suggested for inclusion in section 5 ofthe Public Order Act might be unnecessary and could not in any casedeal with some aspects of the problem, there might be some advantage in accepting them. Acceptance of words which implieddetermination to suppress incitement of racial hatred might make it easier to resist less sensible proposals for the prohibition of racial discrimination.(c) General legislation to make incitement to racial hatred an offence regardless of its effect on public order would raise problemsabout the criteria to be adopted in judging incitement and theintroduction of such legislation might lay the Government open tothe charge that they were embarking on a course which would leadeventually to censorship of the expression of religious and evenpolitical views.(d) As the law stood at present, the only way of dealing withoffensive leaflets was to take proceedings for seditious libel. the chance of success in such proceedings depended on showing that the leaflets had been given widespread distribution for the purpose of promoting disorder, and it was not easy to prove this. The law ofseditious libel was in any case difficult and obscure and might with advantage be brought up to date. But amendments of the kindrequired seemed likely to prove politically unattractive and it wouldbe useful to examine whether the distribution of offensive leafletscould be prevented without amending the law of seditious libel.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that it wouldbe right to speak in the Debate on the Address on the lines whichhad been suggested by the Home Secretary. There were difficulties about the various suggestions which had been made for amendmentof the law but the subject was of much political importance. TheMinisters particularly concerned should examine the possibilitiesfurther and the Cabinet should consider them again at a later meeting.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Home Secretary would submit to thePrime Minister for use in the forthcoming Debate on the address the draft of a passage on the lines indicated inparagraph 14 of C. (62) 156.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the first secretary of State, the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General, to consider further, in the light of the cabinets discussion, ways in which the law might be amended todeal with incitement to racial hatred; and to bring thequestion before them again at a later meeting.
