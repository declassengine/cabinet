Laos(previous reference:C.C. (62) 45thConclusions,Minute 1)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the Geneva discussions onthe future of Laos had now been satisfactorily concluded, and theInternational Agreement was due to be signed on 23rd July. Itwas to be hoped that this experiment of a neutral Government wouldbe successful.The Soviet Government might now suggest that the same methodshould be applied in South Vietnam. Such a suggestion, if made,would have to be resisted.Berlin(previous reference:C.C. (62) 38thConclusions,Minute 1)3. The Foreign Secretary said that it was difficult to see howany progress could be made at present in the discussions betweenthe United States and Soviet Governments on Berlin. TheGovernments of France and Western Germany were unwilling to contemplate any concession; and it would be inexpedient to pressthem further on this while the negotiations with the european economic Community remained in a critical stage. This meant,however, that we must accept the risk that the Soviet government might conclude a separate treaty with East Germany.In discussion it was noted that the one change in the situation had been the economic deterioration in East Germany. The financialassistance which the West Germans were proposing to give might eventually have the effect of increasing their influence over east germany.congo republic(previous reference:C.C. (62) 45thConclusions,Minute 1)4. The Foreign Secretary said that there had been little changein the situation in the Congo since his last report to the Cabinet.Following the breakdown of the discussions between the PrimeMinisters of the Central Government and of Katanga, Mr. Adoulaand Mr. Tshombe, there had been no move from either side. Mr.Adoula believed that with the support of the United Nations and united States he could impose his own terms and had therefore no need to look for a compromise. Mr. Tshombe was equallyconvinced that with the revenues of the Union Miniere at his disposalhe could continue to maintain the de facto autonomy of Katanga;and, if force were used against him, he would be likely to resort toguerilla tactics. On the United Nations side the Acting Secretary-General was still determined to reach a solution in the next fewmonths and would be prepared in search of such a solution to contemplate the use of force by United Nations troops.C.C. 47 (62)The Cabinet 1.   The Prime Minister said that, at this first meeting of theCabinet since the reconstruction of the Government, he wished to record his gratitude for the assistance of his old Cabinet colleagues and to welcome those who were now joining the Cabinet for the first time.The First Secretary of State said that, despite the misrepresen-tations in the Press, the new Cabinet fully understood the purposes for which the Prime Minister had reconstructed the Government; andhe could be assured of their full support in the difficulties which layahead.
The Foreign Secretary said that the economic situation wascritical. The Congo was on the verge of bankruptcy already andthe United Nations itself would be in very serious financial difficultiesby early in 1963. The use of force by the United Nations wouldprobably have the result of destroying the assets in Katanga which represented a proportion of the Congo&apos;s resources. A reasonable prospect of settlement would be opened up if Mr. Adoula couldbe induced to accept an effective Federal structure and if Mr.Tshombe could simultaneously be brought to offer the diversion ofan agreed proportion of Katanga&apos;s revenue to the CentralGovernment. The problem was to bring enough pressure on bothsides to induce them to accept a settlement on these lines. It wasunrealistic to envisage the forcible diversion of the Union Miniererevenues or the military occupation of Union Miniere installations;for force would be resisted by force and the United Nations wouldnot be capable of sustaining the extensive military operations thatwould be involved. Moreover, such a plan would require a freshresolution by the Security Council, and this would pose difficultpolitical problems for the United Kingdom Government. If weexercised the veto against such a resolution, the debate would betransferred to the General Assembly, where we should find ourselves in a minority with countries such as Portugal and South Africa. Weshould be faced with two difficulties the political feeling in theUnited Kingdom, that it was absurd to pay for an operation of whichwe disapproved; and the embarrassment in the United Nations,arising from the fact that we had always pressed the Russians andother defaulters to pay in exactly such cases. The Soviet Governmentwere already pressing for a meeting of the Security Council early inAugust. In the meantime we were urging Mr. Tshombe to returnto Leopoldville with a view to resuming negotiations with Mr. Adoula.In discussion the following points were made:(a) There was at present no practicable alternative to the policyof pressing both sides to reach a settlement by negotiation and seeking to enlist the support of the interested Governments,particularly the United States, Belgium and France. It might be helpful in this context to offer a United Nations plan for long-term economic development and technical support. Such a plan might also help to allay Mr. Tshombe&apos;s fears that any revenue diverted to the central Government would be misspent.(b) The attitude of the Government of the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland should be kept in mind. Most of their military forces were already concentrated on the Katanga borderand, if the situation deteriorated, they might feel compelled to intervene.(c) Discussion in the Security Council would do nothing to help towards a negotiated settlement and should be avoided so0long asthe possibility of continued negotiation remained open.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary and invited him to be guided by the views expressed in their discussion.5. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the two following weeks.
CC. 47 (62)6. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that ministers would continue to be pressed to say whether Parliament would begiven an early opportunity to debate the progress of the negotiationswith the European Economic Community.The Prime Minister said that he was proposing to say, in replyto a Parliamentary Question, that the Lord Privy Seal would makea further progress report before Parliament rose for the summer recess. Thereafter, any report of further progress would have to bemade in a public statement after Parliament had risen. If he were pressed to say whether Parliament would meet during the recess to discuss this question he would say that this must dependon the situation reached. Parliament could be recalled for thispurpose at any time if this became necessary.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the PrimeMinister.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,17th July, 1962.EuropeCommonMarketNegotiations(previous reference:CC.
