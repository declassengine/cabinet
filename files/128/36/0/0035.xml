ForeignAffairsCongoRepublic(previous reference:C.C. (62) 32ndConclusions,Minute 2)Kashmir(previous reference:C.C. (57) 1stConclusions,Minute 7)2. The Foreign Secretary said that a difficult situation was again developing in the Congo. The Prime Minister of Katanga,Mr. Tshombe, while still in contact with the Prime Minister of theCentral Congo Government, Mr. Adoula, and more particularly with the United Nations Representative in the Congo, Mr. Gardiner,was under virtual house arrest in Leopoldville. Mr. Tshombe had agreed to take as the basis for further discussion with Mr. Adoulaa memorandum proposing that the outstanding differences betweenthe Government of Katanga and the Central Government might bereferred to independent commissions for consideration and settlement.If Mr. Adoula accepted this proposal, or if in any other way areasonable settlement could be seen to be in sight, the United StatesGovernment would do what they could to persuade Mr. Adoula toreach agreement. But they had made it clear that if a reasonable were refused by Mr. Tshombe and if it proved impossibleto persuade the Union Miniere to bring effective financial pressure tobear, they would advise Mr. Adoula to adopt more forcible measures and would encourage him to believe that United Nations troops would again be used in support of the Central Government. the acting Secretary-General of the United Nations was known to be reluctant to envisage the further use of United Nations troops, but would be under very heavy pressure to do so if the failure to reach agreement could be attributed to intransigence on the part ofMr. Tshombe. A proposal to use United Nations troops would in thefirst instance have to be referred to the Security Council: the use bythe United Kingdom Government of its veto in the Security council would lead to the immediate transfer of the issue to the general assembly, where a resolution in favour of the use of troops wouldbe bound to command a large majority. The effect of proceeding inthis way would not therefore be to prevent a further outbreak of fighting in which United Nations troops would be involved, but would lose the United Kingdom Indian and Nigerian support in the united nations and would also involve an open breach with the United States,whose support we were likely to need in the forthcoming debate onSouthern Rhodesia. Present plans for the use of United Nationstroops involved no more than the occupation of three key points whichwere of importance to the Union Miniere and whose occupationwould, it was thought, make it easier for the Union Miniere to withhold the payment of revenue to Mr. Tshombe; but, once military action had been taken, it was impossible to predict the future courseof developments.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.The Foreign Secretary said that, in the light of Pakistani recentappeal to the Security Council, the Indian Government were likely toadopt an increasingly intransigent policy in their long-standing dispute with the Pakistan Government about Kashmir. They would reaffirmtheir rejection of the concept of mediation by any third party andrepeat their demand that Pakistan should give up the territory inKashmir which the Indian Government alleged to have been obtained by aggression. One reason for this hardening of the attitude of theIndian Government was the agreement which the pakistan government had recently reached with Communist China about the regulation of her northern boundary. The situation could quicklybecome critical.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.C.C. 35 (62)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
Aid toCountriesOverseasEgypt(previous reference:C.C. (62) 33rdConclusions,Minute 2)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (62) 81) on the grant of economic aid to Egypt.The Foreign Secretary reminded the Cabinet that at their earlier discussion he had been invited to consider the form of instructionsto be sent to Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo about the Egyptianrequest for a loan to help them with their balance of payments. Afterconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and also with her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo, he had set out in his paperthree possibilities with the advantages and disadvantages of each.The first possibility would be to offer a loan of $8 million, all ofwhich would in practice be used to settle outstanding claims under the Financial Agreement. The secondto make a loan of $12 million, of which $.&apos;used to settle claims and $4 million would beof the Egyptian Government to finance imports fromKingdom.   The third would be to make a loan ofwould be to offermillion would beat the free disposalthe Unitedup to $12million, none of which would be specifically earmarked to settleclaims, but which would be conditional on the acceptance by theEgyptian Government of the proposals we have already put forward for settling outstanding questions under the Financial Agreement.This third course would be likely to do most to improve Anglo-Egyptian relations, but it also involved the greatest risk; it containedno firm guarantee that the Egyptians would meet outstanding claims and if, after the loan had been made, they failed to do so theGovernment would be severely criticised. It was, however, important to realise that under any of the three proposals the Government wouldbe open to the charge of favouring their enemies at the expense of their friends unless they were prepared to extend at least as generousNational 3.   The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the report of theGallery enquiry conducted by Lord Bridges explained how Goya&apos;s portraitTheft of Goya&apos;s of the Duke of Wellington had been stolen and suggested a number ofPortrait of the costly measures to improve the security of the National Gallery. the duke of report also made it plain that the risk of loss by theft was less thanWellington ^ v^ Qf ^re or otiier natUral hazards. Nevertheless, steps had beentaken, including increases in staff, to improve security.The report would be published and the Trustees of the national gallery had asked that their comments on it should be published atthe same time. A draft White Paper had been prepared which included a statement of the Governments views on the questions a tissue.In discussion, certain criticisms of the drafting of the White paper were put forward and it was suggested that it need not contain morethan the texts of the essential documents with a brief indication ofthe action to be taken. On the other hand it was pointed out thatthe White Paper must be framed with due regard to its possible effecton the appeal for funds to purchase the Leonardo Cartoon, which itwas intended to exhibit in the National Gallery if the appealsucceeded.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the report of Lord Bridges&apos; enquiry and the comments of the Trustees thereon should be published in a White Paper, which should include an indication ofthe Governments intentions.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to revise the draft ofthe White Paper in the light of their discussion.
CC. 35 (62)treatment to Turkey and Iran. The Governments of those countries would have to be informed of our intentions in advance of or at thesame time as the announcement of any loan to Egypt.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the granting of anyaid to Egypt in present circumstances involved certain risks. If, forexample, a loan failed to produce any real improvement in Anglo-Egyptian relations, if it led to the revival of political controversy athome about the treatment of outstanding claims, and if it stimulateddemands from other countries, particularly Turkey and Iran, it mightbe better to refuse to make a loan at all. As against this a loan offered a convenient way of settling outstanding claims, and there was areasonable chance that it would improve Anglo-Egyptian relations.Whatever might be decided about a loan to Egypt, he considered thatthe grant of some economic aid to Turkey and Iran was inevitable,though it was to be hoped that the amounts could be kept small and could be spread over a long period. There was still concern aboutcompensation for the officials who had lost their employment inEgypt in 1951 and the grant of a loan to Egypt should make it easier to settle this question as well.In discussion the following points were made:(a) There would probably be little advantage in a loan of$8 million only, the whole of which would be tied to the repayment of outstanding claims. A decision between a loan of $10 million in alland of $12 million would turn largely on an assessment of the relativeeffect in the improvement of Anglo-Egyptian relations and of theway in which such loans would be presented both to public opinion in this country and to Egypt. It would be advisable to ask her majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo for his further views on this point.(b) It was arguable that in all the circumstances it would be preferable for the Government to settle outstanding claims under theFinancial Agreement directly and to make no loan to Egypt at all; a loan would provide no incentive for Egypt to put her economy on asounder footing; it would not carry with it any guarantee of animprovement in Anglo-Egyptian relations, e.g., by the cessation of hostile propaganda; it would almost certainly not be repaid, and itwould stimulate demands for further loans in due course. As against this, the refusal of a loan might incite the Egyptian Government to seize again the British property in Egypt which had been returned toits owners, in which case the Government would be faced with freshand substantial claims for compensation. Refusal would alsostimulate the Egyptian Government to increase their opposition toour interests in the Middle East.(c) The claims of the officials should not be overlooked. Theyhad already received  100,000 and had been advanced another 100,000 against total claims amounting to over  600,000. these claims, however, were inflated. It would not be unfair to regard theretention by the officials of the further  100,000 which had been advanced to them as constituting a reasonable final settlement. It was unlikely that it would be possible to persuade the egyptian government to agree to find more than  60,000 or  70,000 towards this sum and the difference would have to be written off; the  60,000or  70,000 would form part of the payments to be made to us out ofa loan on the same basis as the outstanding claims under the financial agreement.(d) It would be important to ensure that the arrangements underwhich the first $8 million of the loan would be used to settleoutstanding claims were water-tight and that it would not be opento the Egyptian Government, once the loan had been made, to spend the money for other purposes.(e) It would be necessary to inform the Governments of turkey and of Iran that we intended in principle to extend economic aid to
South-east asia treaty organisation laos(previous reference:C.C. (62) 34thConclusions,Minute 2)5. The Cabinet were informed that the Prime Minister would announce in Parliament that afternoon that the Government ofThailand had requested the despatch of token British forces in fulfilment of undertakings to the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation.It would be necessary to make detailed arrangements with Thailandabout the timing and precise destination of the Hunter squadron tobe sent from Singapore.As the British aircraft would fly direct from Singapore, thereshould be no difficulties with Malaya in connexion with their move.It seemed, however, that the Australian contingent would under present arrangements leave for Thailand from Butterworth, whichwas in Federal territory. Arrangements could however be made forthe Australians to stage through Singapore if necessary, and theAustralian authorities would be so informed.The Foreign Secretary said that the French Government had decided not to offer any forces to Thailand, and the Government of pakistan were expected to find insuperable difficulties in the way of doing so at the present time. Prince Souvanna Phouma, who had returned to Laos, considered that circumstances were now morepropitious for the formation of a neutral coalition government thanthey had ever been. It was thought likely that General Phoumi would accept the Ministry of Technical Reconstruction instead of the ministries of Defence and the Interior which he had previouslyclaimed for himself and his supporters. While the Russian reaction to the movement of forces into Thailand continued to be muted, it was probable that they would make difficulties, at least for a period, overratifying any arrangements that might be made for the setting upof a neutral government, on the pretext that these movements had created a new and dangerous situation.The Cabinet -(1) Took note of the statement by the Foreign Secretary.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for the Australianmilitary authorities to be offered facilities in Singapore forrouting their aircraft to Thailand.them; it would not, however, be possible to give any undertaking atthe present stage about the amount or duration of such loans; thiswould have to be considered after examination of the development plans for those countries which were now understood to be in courseof preparation.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the foreign secretary to arrange for an examination by officials, withwhich representatives of the Bank of England should be associated, of the measures to be taken to ensure that,any money which might be lent to the egyptian government on the understanding that it would be usedto settle outstanding claims would in fact be so spent.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the foreign secretary, on the assumption that the first $8 million of any loan to the Egyptian Government would be earmarked for the settlement of outstanding claims, toconsider in consultation with Her Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Cairo the relative advantages of total loans of$10 million and $12 million respectively, and the way inwhich such loans could best be presented to public opinion in Egypt and in this country, and to make a further reportto the Cabinet.
Hong Kong(previous reference:CM. (56) 71stConclusions,Minute 5)immigration from ChinaNationalSocialistMovementRally inTrafalgarSquare7. The Cabinet were informed that, after consultation with theCommissioner of Metropolitan Police, the Minister of Works had told the Nationalist Socialist Movement, which was understood tobe a splinter group of the British National Party, that they could have the use of Trafalgar Square for a rally on the afternoon of sunday, 1st July. The Movement had subsequently made it known that the theme of the meeting would be &quot; Free Britain from JewishControl&quot;; and representations had been made to the Governmentthat the meeting should not be permitted. In a debate in the Houseof Lords on 14th May, the Lord Chancellor had said that there wasno power to prevent the meeting unless it contravened the law ofsedition or slander or the requirements of the Public Order Act, 1936.He had pointed out that in proceedings on the Bill for that ActParliament had deliberately rejected an amendment which wouldhave prohibited the making of speeches calculated to excite religious or racial prejudice.The Minister of Works said that, in accordance with the normal practice of his Department, no enquiries had been made at the outsetabout the purpose of the meeting. The view taken by theCommissioner of Metropolitan Police was that attendance at themeeting was likely to be small and that, although a breach of thepeace was possible, there was no doubt that the situation could bekept fully under control. His own conclusion, in the light of theinformation now available, was that in spite of the risk of disturbanceand of criticism against the Government for condoning the activitiesof the Movement, there were insufficient grounds for withdrawingpermission. Discrimination among applicants for use of the Squarebased on the possibility that there would be a breach of the peacewould lead to a form of censorship on freedom of speech. Withdrawalof permission would, moveover, be to the advantage of the Movement,in view of the publicity which would result.In discussion it was pointed out that demonstrations on behalfof those offended by the speakers would almost, certainly cause a breach of the peace and that an offence would almost certainly be committed under the Public Order Act, 1936. The mere fact that thepolice were confident of their ability to control the situation did notabsolve the Government from responsibility for preventing an outbreak of disorder. Bearing in mind the history of anti-Semitism inLondon, the Government would be open to damaging criticism if they took no action to prevent the meeting. It was argued, on the otherhand, that it would be a mistake to take too much notice of a smalland uninfluential body, and that withdrawal of permission for themeeting would be widely regarded as putting at risk freedom of speech in public places on matters of all kinds.  The police would know in . The Colonial Secretary said that the Hong Kong Governmenthad shown commendable efficiency in dealing with the difficult situation created by the upsurge of illegal immigration from Chinainto the Colony. The situation had not been allowed to get out of hand and there were indications that the Chinese Government were beginning to reimpose their own checks on the flow of refugees. the offers that were now being made by the Chinese Nationalists andothers to accept refugees from Hong Kong into their own territories were, for the most part, too vague to justify any change of immigration policy in the Colony. If, however, practicable schemes withsatisfactory guarantees of fulfilment were put forward, we should consist-operate in these.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Colonial Secretary.
incomes policy(previous reference:C.C. (62) 34thConclusions,Minute 5)8. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Cabinetsconsideration of incomes policy would be affected by an arbitration award which was expected from the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunalin about a fortnight and by settlements shortly to be reached on payin various branches of the Health Service. Later that day the Ministerof Labour would be meeting representatives of the British Employers&apos;Confederation, and he would take the opportunity of stressing theimportance of avoiding settlements in the private sector which were out of line with the advice given in the White Paper on Incomes Policy.In pursuance of the Cabinets conclusions at their previous meeting,the Official Committee on Emergencies were examining what steps might be taken to enable the country to withstand the effects of a major strike.On the previous day the Economic Policy Committee had discussed the proposals made for revaluing the pay of particular groups of work-people by the establishment of an independent body,such as a standing Royal Commission, and for the issue of a general direction or directions requiring the Chairmen of nationalised industries to submit proposals for wage increases to the appropriate minister for approval. The general view of the Committee aboutrevaluation had been that, although a body of the kind suggestedmight reduce the risk of concessions being made on the ground of comparability, there could be little scope for it in the private sector;and in the public sector it would be better for the Government to take their own decisions on revaluation and openly defend them. officials were, however, continuing work on the criteria against which claims for revaluation might be judged. A decision for or against general directions to the nationalised industries was urgent because such a direction to the British Transport Commission might not be Ultravires once the talks on railway pay were resumed on 14th June.The Cabinet first considered the arguments for and against ageneral direction or directions for the nationalised industries.The Minister of Aviation said that the incomes policy would befortified if the Government could demonstrate, by the issue of directions, their determination to take action on the widest possiblefront and to adopt measures for the expansion of the economy ratherthan deflationary measures. Directions might enable the Governmentto avoid acquiescing in settlements, e.g., on railwaymen&apos;s pay, whichadvance whether counter-demonstrations were likely to be made on alarge scale and could make effective dispositions. If in the event therewere early signs of disturbance, they could exercise their power undercommon law to close the meeting in order to prevent a breach of thepeace.The Cabinet were agreed on the importance of establishing howfar preventive action could properly be taken in anticipation of a breach of the peace. This point should be further considered and enquiries should be made about the past activities and speeches ofthe leader of the Movement. If his activities had given rise to violence,the Government might have reasonable ground for withdrawingpermission. It might also be appropriate to consider exercising thepower to require speakers to give assurances of good behaviour.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the HomeSecretary and the Minister of Works, to give furtherconsideration to the points raised in their discussion aboutthe use of Trafalgar Square on 1st July by the national socialist Movement; and to bring the matter before themagain at a later meeting.
CC. 35 (62)could not be reconciled with their declared policy. Any suchacquiescence would make the present policy valueless, and no alternative policy had been devised. The key question was whetherthose in charge of the nationalised industries would feel able to carryon if they were seen to be no longer responsible for pay within their industries.The Minister of Power said that the main objection to givingsuch directions was that they would undermine the financial obligations imposed on the nationalised industries in the White Paperissued in April 1961 (Cmnd. 1337). That and other objections mightbe outweighed if the Government could be certain of their ability todeal with a major strike in one of the industries. The worst coursewould be to issue directions and then find that substantial increaseshad to be conceded under the threat of a strike or after it.In discussion support was expressed for the view put forward bythe Minister of Aviation, but it was suggested by some Ministers thatthe area which would be brought under Government control bydirections would still not be wide enough to influence the private sector effectively. It would also be inexpedient to give directions ifthe result were to cause the Trades Union Congress to withdraw their co-operation in the work of the National Economic development council. A number of Ministers felt that the risks involved in givingdirections would be worth taking, provided that they could be presented as part of a general plan involving other effective measuresto control the actions of employers and trade unions in the private sector. The view was also expressed, however, that even if directionswere presented as part of a comprehensive plan they would so damage the relations between managements and work-people that it wouldbe better to continue to rely on persuasion to secure restraint. Butreliance on persuasion need not exclude measures for influencingprofits and prices which would bring home to private employers theimportance of keeping down costs.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of incomes policy at ameeting later in the day.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th May, 1962.
