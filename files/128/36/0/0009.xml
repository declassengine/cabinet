V71C.C. (9) 62Angola 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that he had been considering(Previous what attitude should be taken by the United Kingdom RepresentativeReference: at the United Nations towards a resolution on Angola which wasC.C. (61) 30th being brought forward by the Afro-Asian countries. The text of conclusions, the resolution was contained in New York telegram No. 165 of minute 8) 23rd January. It was framed in language offensive to Portugal and included some specific recommendations which we could not endorse for example, that all political prisoners in Angola should be released immediately and that the United Nations Committee should work for the &quot; speedy &quot; achievement of independence by the peopleof Angola.- On the other hand it did not contain any new proposalsfor action nor did it seek to impose any sanctions against Portugal.In the United Nations it would be regarded as no more than afurther expression of disapproval of PortugaPs colonial policy. Assuch it already commanded the support of forty countries; and, ifwe refrained from voting in favour of it, we should probably find ourselves in a minority of three, with South Africa and Portugal.We could draw no comfort from the fact that France would notvote on this resolution, for this would merely reflect the currentFrench policy of withdrawing from participation in United Nationsbusiness. For other countries abstention was now regarded in theUnited Nations as equivalent to an adverse vote; and&quot;, if we failedto vote for this resolution, we should be thought to be supportingPortugaPs colonial policy. This would discourage our friends, whowere disposed to support us when our own colonial policy came under criticism in the United Nations. Even among the Afro-asian countries, there were signs of a readiness to distinguish between our colonial administration and that of some other colonial Powers.In all the circumstances he believed that the balance of advantage layon the side of voting in favour of this resolution.In discussion serious doubts were expressed about the expediency of supporting a resolution in these terms. Paragraph 2, whichreaffirmed the &quot; inalienable right of the Angolan people to self-determination and independence &quot; seemed to be inconsistent withthe Portuguese claim that Angola was an integral part of metropolitanPortugal. Paragraph 5, which urged the Portuguese to establishfreely elected and representative political institutions in Angola, wasasking for the Angolans a greater degree of political freedom than was available in Portugal itself under the present regime. Theresolution as a whole was offensive to the Portuguese, who were ouroldest allies and had recently, at Goa, been the victims of aggression by one of the leading sponsors of this resolution. Apart from these general considerations, we should also weigh the consequences whichsupport of this resolution might have in relation to our own colonial administration. We had certainly found it necessary in some colonies to hold political leaders in detention, and might find ourselves underthis necessity again. Nor could we afford to subscribe to the view-that all dependent peoples could be brought &quot; speedily&quot; to independence. If a resolution in these terms were brought forward in respect of our dependent territories, we should be unable to accept it. Was it wise, therefore, for us to support this resolution on Angola ?On the other side it was pointed out that, whatever the languageused in particular paragraphs, the vote on this resolution would beregarded in the United Nations and by world opinion as an expression of approval or disapproval of PortugaPs colonial policy. The foreign secretary had already made it clear that, in our future voting in theUnited Nations on resolutions of this kind, we should concernourselves with the substance and purpose of the resolution as awhole; and an affirmative vote on this occasion need not implyagreement with all the specific proposals in the resolution. our representative could make this plain in speaking on the resolution,and he could explain our reservations on particular paragraphs.  By
present standards in the United Nations this was a relatively moderateresolution; and account should be taken of the successful efforts made by moderate members of the Afro-Asian group to prevent amore extreme form of resolution being put forward. It would bea tactical mistake to disappoint those countries who were ready to distinguish, in United Nations debates, between our colonial policyand that of Portugal. It was at least probable that, when our owncolonial policy came under criticism in the United Nations, we shouldhave more sympathy and support if we had voted for this resolution.The Cabinet were informed that present indications were thatthe United States Government would vote in favour of this resolution. If, however, they should decide to abstain or to putforward a separate resolution of their own, a new situation would arise and our own position could be reconsidered.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the balance of advantage lay on the side of voting in the United Nations in favour of the Afro-Asianresolution on Angola, on the assumption that the UnitedStates Government decided to support it.(2) On this assumption invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct the United Kingdom Representative at the United nations to vote in favour of this resolution but to explain in the debate on the resolution that, while we supported its general substance, we could not endorse all its specificrecommend at ions.UnitedNationsBond Issue(previous reference :C.C. (62) 7thConclusions,Minute 4)2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the question whetherthe Government should subscribe to the United Nations bond issue.They had before them a further memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (62) 18) suggesting the terms in which such a decision might be announced.The Foreign Secretary said that on 5th February there wouldbe a debate in the House of Commons on the Governments policy towards the United Nations. If the Cabinet approved the statementsuggested in his paper it would be desirable that the announcement should be deferred until the day of the debate. There was, however,a danger that the President of the United States might meanwhileappeal to us to subscribe and that the fact that he had done so might become known. It would therefore be desirable that the PrimeMinister should inform the President in confidence that a decisionto subscribe to the United Nations bond issue had been taken butthat for reasons connected with the Parliamentary timetable it wouldnot be announced until 5th February.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The first sentence of the proposed announcement implied that the Government had decided to purchase bonds to the valueof $12 million. The third sentence, however, could be held to mean that the precise amount would be decided later. It would be better to say that the Government intended, before the end of 1963, to buybonds within a maximum total of $12 million but that in deciding the amounts and timing of their purchases they would take intoaccount the cash requirements of the United Nations and the extentto which other countries had contributed.(b) The figure of $12 million was to some extent arbitrary sincethe logical basis of calculating a fair contribution would have been to relate it to the United Kingdom share of the regular budget of theUnited Nations. This would have produced a figure of $15 million.The lower figure could be defended by reference to the serious
C.C. (9) 62shortage of foreign exchange with which the Government were facedat present. Tt had the advantage over the lower figure of $10 million which had at one time been suggested that it would be less likely to lead to demands for a second subscription later.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Government should subscribe to the united nations bond issue on the basis indicated in C. (62) 18subject to the amendments noted in paragraph (a) above.(2) Authorised the Lord Privy Seal to make an announcement to this effect on 5th February, in answer to a parliamentary question.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider thedesirability of sending a message to the President of theUnited States in advance of the announcement inParliament.and 3.   The Minister of Education reported to the Cabinet hisan impressions of his recent visit to India and PakistanIn India the outcome of the forthcoming elections was not in doubt and aroused comparatively little interest. The Congress party would certainly win. But a struggle for power was now going onwithin the Government itself. The Kashmir issue was in dangerof being handled in terms of this internal political struggle.In Pakistan the position had seemed to him to be quite different.President Ayub was fully in control of his Government but felt thathe was being given insufficient support by the West in the dispute with India about Kashmir.In discussion it was recognised that there was little prospect that the Indian Government would accept a transfer of sovereignty over Kashmir to Pakistan without war: a war would be disastrousand Pakistan could not hope to win it. The problem, for the timebeing at any rate, must be regarded as insoluble unless PresidentAyub and the Prime Minister of India could agree to partition. a debate on Kashmir in the Security Council at the present time wouldbe specially unfortunate. The Soviet Government would supportIndia; and this, apart from the embarrassment in which it would place both the United States and the United Kingdom, might havean effect on the United States aid programme to India, which wasnot popular in Congress.The Cabinet Took note of the report by the Minister of Education andof the points made in discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,26th January, 1962.
