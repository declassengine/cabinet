SubjectDefence Programme
*The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the substance ofthe message which in the light of their discussion earlier in the day he now proposed to send to President Kennedy. The object wouldbe to inform the President of the lines on which our strategic thinkingwas developing, to explain the considerations which had led theGovernment to cancel the development of BLUE WATER and toask for his views.The Cabinet then considered the text of a possible public announcement of the decision to cancel BLUE WATER. It wasagreed in discussion that the statement should not openly question at this stage the validity of the present strategy of the North atlantic alliance, but should indicate that a review of strategy was in progress;that increasing doubts were being expressed about the large-scaleuse of tactical nuclear weapons in a continuing land battle; that asBLUE WATER would not add significantly to the total nuclearcapacity of the alliance, which was already large and increasing, theGovernment had decided not to proceed further with its development;but that the Government would ensure in the event that whatever decision might be reached about the command, control and deployment of tactical nuclear weapons in the alliance, the british army of the Rhine would have nuclear support of equivalent strength to that available to other national contingents. It was also the general feeling of the Cabinet that any public statement on these lines shouldbe deferred until some reply from President Kennedy to the PrimeMinisters message had been received. It would also be desirable,before any public statement was made, that the Minister of defence should discuss the implications of the decision and the Governmentsreasons for it with the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, GeneralNorstad, and that the Minister of Aviation should arrange forconfidential notification to the aircraft industry at a suitable time.In further discussion the following points were made (a) It would be necessary to inform the Australian Governmentin suitable terms about the decision to cancel BLUE WATER in viewof the effect which this decision would have on the programme ofwork at the guided weapons range at Woomera.(b) The proposed withdrawal of OR-351 the joint Royal AirForce and Army requirement for a replacement for the Beverley andthe Hastings should be left in abeyance until the Minister of defence had had an opportunity to discuss with the United States Secretary ofDefense the possibility of Anglo-United States co-operation in this field.(c) The situation in Northern Ireland was giving rise to increasingconcern and, if no further work were found for Short and Harlands,there would be serious political and economic effects. It would,therefore, be necessary to take an early decision about orders forthe VC-10 aircraft, some of the work on which could be sub-contractedto Shorts.(d) Present plans should be based on the assumption that theRoyal Air Force would have only 10 Lightning squadrons.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that BLUE WATER should be cancelled.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would communicate with president Kennedy on the lines agreed in their discussion.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for the PrimeMinister of Australia to be informed of the government&apos;s decision and of the reasons for it.
(4) Invited the Minister of Defence to inform General Norstadof the Governments decision and to discuss its implications with him.(5) Invited the Minister of Aviation to arrange at a suitable time for the aircraft industry to be informed in confidence of the Governments decision.(6) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for the drafting of a public announcement of the government&apos;s decision on the lines approved in their discussion, butagreed that the announcement should not be made untilPresident Kennedy had had an opportunity to reply tothe Prime Ministers message.(7) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the other ministers concerned, to reach an early decision on orders for VC-10aircraft with a view to sub-contracting some of the work involved to Short and Harlands in Belfast. If possiblethis decision should be taken before the public announce-ment of the decision to cancel BLUE WATER.(8) Agreed that the withdrawal of OR-351 the requirement for a freight aircraft to replace the Beverley and theHastings should be held in abeyance.(9) Agreed that development and production of the TSR-should proceed.(10) Agreed that in other respects the defence programme should go forward on the basis agreed between the Minister ofDefence and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,7th August, 1962.
