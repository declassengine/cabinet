Germany(previous reference:C.C. (62) 38thConclusions,Minute 1)British army of the Rhine1. The Cabinet were informed that the Members of Parliamentwho had recently visited units of the British Army of the Rhine had formed the impression that there had been much exaggeration in thePress about the difficulties which had arisen between British soldiersand German civilians. There was however general agreement in theCabinet and there would be little to be gained by arranging for aGovernment statement to be made in Parliament and that the prudentcourse would be to allow discussion of the subject to lapse.Foreign AffairsFar East(previous reference:C.C. (58) 73rdConclusions,Minute 1)Laos(previous reference:C.C. (62) 40thConclusions,Minute 5)2. The Foreign Secretary said that in the past few days largeconcentrations of Chinese troops and aircraft had been reported onthe mainland of China opposite Quemoy and Matsu. The purposeof these movements was not year clear. They might result from a desire on the part of the authorities of the Chinese Peopled Republicto divert attention from the internal difficulties of the regime or to test the reaction of the Nationalist Government and the United states administration, or they might simply be precautions taken in casethe Nationalist Government should seek to take advantage ofunsettled conditions on the mainland. On present information it seemed unlikely that the purpose of the movements was offensive, butfurther information might become available when the United states secretary of State visited this country on 24th June.The Foreign Secretary said that, although the three LaotianPrinces had signed an agreement for the formation of a national government, difficulties were still being raised by General Phoumiabout the status of the Royal Laotian Parliament. Prince SouvannaPhouma was again threatening to return to Paris, but it seemed probable that he could be dissuaded from doing so and that thedifficulties would in practice be resolved in time for the geneva conference to resume early in July.The two British doctors who had fallen into the hands of PathetLao troops had not yet been released. The British Minister atVientiane who had gone to negotiate their return had himself beentaken into custody. Prince Souphannouvong had given assurances that all three were safe and would be released. Every effort was still being made to secure their early release, but in the circumstancesgrowing anxiety must be felt about their safety.Canada(previous reference:C.C. (60) 52ndConclusions,Minute 4)EconomicSituation3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer reported that the state ofthe Canadian dollar was causing general concern, and the canadian authorities had approached the International Monetary Fund in orderto obtain a large standby credit to restore confidence. $700 million was thought to be the minimum requirement for this purpose. TheFund authorities were unable, as a matter of principle, to consideradvancing more than the first instalment, which would be about$300 million, until the Canadian Government had given satisfactory-undertakings about their future policy as security for the loan. Ithad been proposed that, as an interim arrangement and for a period not exceeding three months, the remaining $400 million should befound jointly by the United Kingdom, France, Germany and theUnited States.   The United Kingdom share would be $100 million.
Aid to Countries 4. The Foreign Secretary recalled that, at the Cabinet&apos;s previousOverseas discussion about economic aid for Egypt, he and the Chancellor ofEgypt the Exchequer had been invited to consider, with the help of H.M.(Previous        Ambassador in Cairo, the advantages of loans from the united reference:       Kingdom Government which might total $10 million or $12 million,CC (62) 35th    and the way in which any such loan could be presented to publicConclusions,    opinion in Egypt and in this country.   The Cabinet had shown someMinute 4)       disposition to accept the proposal that an amount of $8 million shouldbe held in sterling in London for the specific purpose of meetingEgyptian   exchange  needs   for  settling   transfers   arising  fromde-sequestration of British property; and that up to $4 million shouldbe used for current purchases from the United Kingdom.   Under anarrangement of this kind the main part of the loan would be conditional on the fulfilment of transfer obligations; it would at thesame time provide some financial support for current imports fromthe United Kingdom.This would be lent in sterling; and it would be for Canada to convertthe loan to United States dollars by purchasing them from the UnitedKingdom. He sought the authority of the Cabinet for action on theselines, with sufficient latitude to deal with the rapidly developingsituation; emergency action might be needed to assist the Canadiandollar before the resources of the International Monetary Fundcould be made available.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The proportion of the United Kingdom reserves which washeld in dollars was excessive, and the proposed interim loan presentedan opportunity for reducing it by the conversion of the sterling loaninto United States dollars. This was particularly welcome becausethe alternative method of reducing the dollar reserves by purchases of gold might be regarded in the United States as a blow to the dollar.(b) It was desirable that France and Germany should be associated with the proposed interim loan, since this might tend tocreate a more sympathetic atmosphere in Canada towards the UnitedKingdom&apos;s attempt to secure entry into the Common Market. Thealternative of a joint United Kingdom-United States arrangement would not have this advantage.(c) Repayment of the interim loan would be made from the crediteventually granted by the International Monetary Fund.(d) It would be important to ensure that the interim arrangements were made in close consultation with the authorities of the Fund lestit should appear that the United Kingdom and the other countriesassociated in the arrangement were attempting to by-pass the Fund.(e) It was also desirable that it should be made clear that theproposed joint loan from the four countries should be a short-termbridging operation, since otherwise the Canadian authorities mightbe tempted by their present political difficulties not to make a seriousattempt to meet the requirements laid down by the international monetary Fund for advancing the remaining instalments of the loan.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.(2) Agreed that the United Kingdom should participate with france, Germany and the United States, in the interim arrangements for supporting the Canadian dollar on thelines indicated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
a 3Dr. Kaissouni, the Minister of Economy and the Treasury, had pointed out to H.M. Ambassador that the main requirement was a stand-by credit to help with his country&apos;s short-term balance ofpayments problem and to finance current purchases from this country.It had also been ascertained that the United States administration would not allow the $8 million element in the loan to count towardsthe further matching contribution which they had offered.Dr. Kaissouni had therefore suggested that his Government shouldbe given immediately a credit of the full $12 million and should undertake in return to provide exchange for transfers as they becamedue at a rate of up to $300,000 a month. This proposal had seemedtoo vague and would offer insufficient guarantee that exchange wouldin practice be available at the requisite times. A compromisesuggestion had now been made by H.M. Ambassador for a bilateralassistance loan under International Monetary Fund auspices for a totalof $12 million, divided so that $3 million would be withheld for thepayment of transfers at present outstanding or likely to be due before october 1963, and $9 million would be immediately available for imports from the United Kingdom. The total $12 million would bere-payable in 10 years with a three-year grace period. The egyptian government would also undertake to pay the equivalent of $5 million in stages : $2 million in October 1963; $2 million in October 1964, and$1 million in October 1965. These arrangements would have theeffect of making available in good time the full $8 million which, underthe original proposal, was to be held for transfer purposes. H.M.Ambassador had further suggested that Embassy expenditure(running at about  30,000 a month) should be set off against transfers of up to  E. 1,000; this would guarantee a reasonable rate of transfersproviding applications came forward fast enough.The compromise arrangement would be less favourable to usthan the proposal which had previously been discussed by the Cabinet.There could be no guarantee that the loan would be re-paid, and if thearrangement were to be pursued it would be necessary to establish a joint system to ensure the speedy handling of claims and transfers of money. In some quarters in this country there would be firmopposition to any form of assistance to Egypt. But there was little doubt that relations with the Egyptian Government, which could havea significant effect on our position elsewhere in the Middle East, wouldbe much improved if a loan could be offered on the lines now suggested.In discussion it was pointed out that the $9 million element inthe proposed arrangement could be effectively criticised as offeringadvantages to Egypt before claimants in this country had receivedfull satisfaction. Before reaching a decision it would be desirablethat the Cabinet should have a statement indicating what claims, ifany, oould be said to be outstanding apart from those which would bemet by the re-payments proposed by the Egyptian Government in1963 and the two following years. The Cabinet should also be more fully informed of the terms of the commercial line of credit which had recently been opened in London and of the use which had been madeof it.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Lord President, theMinister of Aviation and the President of the Board ofTrade, to arrange for a statement to be put before them atan early meeting on the amount of the claims still outstandingby British subjects against the Egyptian Government, andon the terms and use made of the commercial credit already available to that Government in this country.
incomes policy(previous reference:C.C. (62) 37thConclusions,Minute 2)*5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (C. (62) 99) on the Governments incomes policy.The Prime Minister said that he would welcome the views of theCabinet on the ideas put forward in his paper for the next step in thedevelopment of the Governments incomes policy, which should be viewed, not as a method of deflating the economy, but as an instrument of economic growth. In the absence of an incomes policyany move towards reflation would be likely to lead as in the past to around of wage and prices increases which would damage our exportposition and encourage imports. Only a successful incomes policy could avoid this and lead on to a real forward movement in the economy. He considered that too much had been made of the dangers of inflation; the real danger not merely to the UnitedKingdom, but to the Western position as a whole, lay in the opposite direction. If the current recession in the United States becamewidespread, and if the leading industrial countries of the West deflatedtheir economies, the effects would fall hardest on the under-developed countries of the world. This would be a great and possibly decisivegain for Communism. He reminded the Cabinet that he had written to President Kennedy shortly after the latter had assumed officesuggesting that the most important task facing the West was to ensurethe availability of international credit on a wider and more flexiblebasis and thus to secure the continued expansion of the Westerneconomy as a whole.It was important that in discussing the Governments incomes policy the Cabinet should bear these wider and more fundamentalissues in mind.In discussion of the Prime Ministers memorandum the followingpoints were made:(a) The need to relate incomes policy to a sound expansion ofthe economy was generally accepted. In the particular field ofGovernment expenditure it would be necessary to make a virtue of necessity by claiming credit for increases which could not be avoidedand were in themselves the instruments of short or long-term growth.There were various other measures which it might be necessary toconsider to this end, e.g., encouraging savings and stimulating themovement of labour into more productive sectors of industry by widerschemes of re-training. The keynote should not be the affluentsociety but the efficient society. More might be done to stimulateexports if the Government were to undertake market research on amore ambitious and imaginative basis. The problem of providingadequate international credit was critical; if, as now seemed likely,the United States Administration were failing to meet the challengeof the present situation it might be necessary for the United KingdomGovernment to take the lead in proposing broader and more flexiblearrangements.(b) The view was expressed that the specific measures outlined in the Prime Ministers paper would be unlikely to command thenecessary support from both sides of industry and that it might forthis reason be better to confine action to obtaining, by suitablepublicity, the widest possible degree of support for the idea of continued restraint in wage and salary demands without seeking to support that policy with machinery for which public opinion wasnot yet ready and with measures, e.g., those related to conditions ofemployment, which needed much further study. A majority of theCabinet, however, considered that specific measures would berequired at this stage of the development of Government policy andthat a reliance on general exhortation to restraint would be inadequate to the political and economic needs of the situation.
(c) The purpose of the:&apos; guiding light &quot; would need to be re-statedin more flexible terms. It would be important to avoid a formulaso rigid that any departure from it would be regarded as a defeatfor the Government. Even though the White Paper (Cmnd. 1629) hadnot laid down 2\ per cent, as a definite limit to acceptable wage settlements, it had been widely interpreted in that sense. It wouldalso be necessary to introduce the idea that in any given case the time that had elapsed since the last wage or salary award would be accepted as a relevant factor in any fresh negotiation; for if this were not done the pressure for annual awards in all industries and professions wouldbecome difficult if not impossible to resist. Nevertheless, howeverbroadly stated, the &quot; guiding light &quot; would still have to be based on some figure related to the growth in national productivity. Therewould be advantage in looking to an independent body, possibly theNational Economic Development Council (N.E.D.C.), for advice onthis figure. The fact that the N.E.D.C. had already committed itselfto the view that an increase of 4 per cent, overall (3-3 per cent, interms of the individual worker) was as much as it might be possibleto attain, was a helpful development. On the other hand, it wouldbe difficult and might be politically unwise for the Government to evade the responsibility of taking the final decision; the N.E.D.C.might perhaps be looked to for advice and support rather than beinvited to take the decision itself. There was a reasonable chance that the N.E.D.C. would be more and not less co-operative as time went on, particularly after the meeting of the Trades Union congress in September. One suggestion was that the &quot; guiding light &quot; shouldbe related, not to an estimate of future productivity, but to the actualachievements of the past year; this would have the advantage of leaving no room for argument.(d) On the proposal for the establishment of some standingbody, possibly a Royal Commission, to deal with wage and salarysettlements, it was the general view of the Cabinet that an appeal to employers and to the trade unions to refer to it voluntarily would be unlikely to succeed. The suggestion that as an alternative theCommission should be invited to review after the event settlements in the private sector which had either exceeded the &quot; guiding light&quot;or for other reasons seemed to the Government to be objectionablewas supported by several Ministers. On this view it should bepossible for the Commission to deal with reviews of this kind fairlyrapidly and the resulting exposure would not only discourageextravagant settlements but would, over a period, encourageemployers and unions to co-operate by referring claims to theCommission before the event. A majority of Ministers, however,inclined to the view that this alternative proposal would be unlikely to be effective; by the time the results of- any particular review came tobe announced the case in question would have been forgotten and the damage would have been done. Control over the private sector wasthe critical point; without that it would be impossible to hold the line in the public sector and the Governments incomes policy would continue to be eroded. Difficult as it would be to introduce measuresof compulsion, further consideration should be given to the possibilityof bringing important claims in the private sector to the Commissionbefore and not after agreement had been reached between the parties concerned. The findings of the Commission could probably not bemade binding, at least to begin with, on the private sector althoughit might be necessary to make them binding on the public sector.(e) One great advantage of a Commission on the lines proposed would be the fact that it would replace or bring under its generaloversight the various ad hoc Commissions which had been established in the past and whose outlook was necessarily limited to the particularemployment sector with which they were concerned. It would,however, be necessary to consider further the relationship between the
Commission and existing arrangements for arbitration, particularlyin the public sector. It could be argued that it would be wrong to upset the existing arbitration machinery and that the duties of theCommission should be restricted to seeing that their advice was available to the appropriate arbitration tribunal before a case washeard. This would, however, have serious disadvantages. If thearbitral award followed the lines of the Commission^ advice it mightbe held that the arbitrators had been deprived of the right to anindependent view. If on the other hand the arbitral awards departedfrom the Commission^ advice it would be interpreted as a defeat forthe Commission and by implication for the Government. For these reasons many Ministers argued that it would be necessary to absorbexisting arbitration machinery into the Commission and in some wayto bring arbitral awards under central control. This would causegreat resentment, but might be inescapable; the effects in Australiaof allowing a free rein to independent arbitration had been disastrous.Thought should be given to the need for consultation, both with employers, with trade unions, and with staff associations, before any-final decisions were taken.(/) In so far as the Commission were called upon to deal with claims involving a re-valuation of wage or salary scales, its relationship with the N.E.D.C. as well as with the arbitration machinery would need to be considered. Re-valuation would in many cases be affectedby estimates of the relative efficiency or inefficiency of the industries concerned and this was a subject which the N.E.D.C. would beexamining.(g) In general, while the appointment of a Commission would belikely to form an essential part of the further development of theGovernments incomes policy, it should not be overlooked that insetting it up the Government would be placing upon it, and removingfrom itself, a very great responsibility. It would be necessary to set the Commission to work within a frame of reference which would need to be carefully and closely defined; such a frame of reference might be best provided by the re-statement of the policy of the&quot; guiding light&quot;, to which the Government would be committed inany event.(h) There was a division of opinion in the Cabinet about theproposal that resale price maintenance should either be prohibitedor made unenforceable. Some Ministers considered that the disadvantages of abolishing resale price maintenance not only in political but in practical terms would greatly outweigh the advantages.Other Ministers considered that the support for the existing systemcame largely from the vested interests of the small shopkeeper andthat its abolition would have a strong political appeal to the youngergeneration. Moreover, if the estimate that the abolition of resale price maintenance would lead over a period to an average drop of5 per cent, in retail prices was valid, its economic advantages as wellas its effect on incomes policy would be substantial. The question would need to be further studied. In considering the relation betweenprice levels and the incomes policy generally it was important not to overlook the effect of the Common Market both directly in terms offood prices, and indirectly in its effect on our competitive position.(i) There was general support in the Cabinet for the proposals set out in the Prime Minister^ memorandum for measures to improvestatus and security at work and for consumer protection. The shops and Offices Bill would be a major measure for the salaried workers.More thought would however need to be given to proposals forapprenticeship and industrial training; if the Government wereprepared to spend large sums of money on official training schemesit would be important to avoid penalising firms who already ranextensive and efficient training schemes of their own, while undulyfavouring firms who had done little if anything to help themselves
(/&apos;) The effect of these measures on the legislative programme would need more detailed study. Under the existing programme,when allowance had been made for London Government, for theCommon Market and for other essential measures, there would be room for only one other major Bill. There were, broadly speaking,three alternatives : to drop one of the existing major Bills, e.g., LondonGovernment; to announce an intention to legislate on measuresconnected with the incomes policy but to defer the actual legislationuntil a later session; or to make wider and more drastic use of theguillotine. It would not be possible to take a decision until work onthe incomes policy itself had reached a more advanced stage. Itwould, however, be undesirable to delay a decision beyond mid-July.Although the Governments present policy had been more successful in its effects than it had been given credit for, it could not continue inits present form for much longer; it would be necessary to make a full statement of the Governments intentions before the summer recess and to have formed at least a provisional view on its legislativeimplications by then.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that he was grateful for the views of his colleagues, to which he would wish togive further thought. It was clear that the Cabinet accepted theneed for a continuance of the incomes policy in a more logical and effective form; it was also clear that the policy must continue to bebased on the underlying relationship between wages and productivity.There had also been general support for the idea of a nationalCommission on wages and salaries although he had taken note ofthe different views expressed on the precise scope of its powers andits responsibilities. In terms of presentation it would be important to get away from the concept of a struggle between the workers onthe one hand and the employers on the other, which still determinedso much of the existing negotiating or arbitration machinery. Thefacts to-day were quite different; it was not so much a question of theemployers against the workers as of a combination of the employersand the workers in a particular industry jeopardising the prospectsand ultimately the prosperity of the country as a whole. Anotherfactor which had come out strongly in the CabinetS discussion hadbeen the need to place more emphasis on efficiency. This might indeed be an important factor in future wage settlements. Thecreation of new wealth by improved methods of working or by the elimination of restrictive practices might be held to justify the award of special increases in wages. He would now arrange for a more detailed study of the measures proposed in his memorandum by asmall group of senior Ministers, and also for the preparation by officials of papers dealing with the re-statement of the &quot; guiding light &quot;and of the powers and responsibilities of the proposed Commissionon wages and salaries.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange, in thelight of their discussion, for further study of the next stage of the Governments incomes policy by a small group of senior Ministers.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for thepreparation by officials of papers dealing with there-statement of the &quot;guiding light&quot; and a further examination of the powers and responsibilities of aCommission on wages and salaries.
