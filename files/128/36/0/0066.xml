The Foreign Secretary said that the dismantling andwithdrawal of Soviet missiles from Cuba appeared to be proceedingsmoothly. It had been accepted that the International Red Crossshould exercise some kind of general supervision over this process.It is not yet clear what form the next developments might take,but it was unlikely that the Soviet Government would be preparedto contemplate any further concessions or compromises at the present stage. It was possible that at a later stage, for example, in the courseof a meeting of Heads of Governments, Mr. Khrushchev might beprepared to identify himself personally with some reorientation of soviet policy, e.g,, on Berlin, but there was as yet no evidence onwhich to base a judgment. The position would continue to be kept under close review.The Foreign Secretary said that there appeared to be a lull in thefighting on the Indo-Chinese border. The Chinese were now thought to have something of the order of two divisions in the forwardareas with another five divisions in reserve; it was clear from this that more was at stake than a realignment of the border; there couldbe little doubt that the Chinese object was to secure by militarymeans a major improvement in their strategic position.Mr. Malcolm MacDonald, formerly the United Kingdom HighCommissioner in New Delhi, had reported that in the course of a recent private visit to Peking the Chinese Foreign Minister had mentioned to him as a possible basis for a settlement the acceptance by the Chinese Government of a new border some three miles tothe south of the present MacMahon Line in the North-East Frontierdistrict, in exchange for concessions by the Indian Government inLadakh. Mr. MacDonald would report this suggestion factuallyto the Indian Government during his forthcoming visit to Delhibut would avoid being put in the position of appearing to offerhimself as a mediator or of being invited to do so.The Foreign Secretary said that the military situation in the yemen was still obscure. The republican authorities seemed to bein effective control of the more settled and populated parts of thecountry, and a recent attack from the Saudi Arabian frontier inthe north appeared to have been broken up. The United StatesGovernment were understood to favour early recognition of the republican regime in exchange for concessions or assurances fromthe Egyptian Government about the maintenance of stable conditionsin Saudi Arabia. If recent reports about the intention of the republican regime in the Yemen to declare war on Saudi Arabiawere confirmed, concessions of this kind would not be easy to obtain.We were in the difficulty that, while it was distasteful to appear tobe supporting the tyrannical dynasties which were common in thispart of the world, any early recognition of the republican regime was likely to have serious repercussions on our position in Aden whichwas to a large extent dependent on the continued loyalty and supportof the Rulers of the Aden Protectorate and the neighbouring Sheikhs.The Prime Minister said that the situation was delicate and difficult. In the considered view of the Governor of Aden the earlyrecognition of the republican regime in the Yemen would seriouslydishearten our supporters in the Aden Protectorate, would exacerbatepolitical agitation in Aden Colony itself and might undermine our whole position in the area. But if we continued to withholdrecognition, in which we were still supported by the Arab countriesfriendly to us* Jordan and Libya in particular-there was a danger that the United Kingdom representative in Taiz would be expelledand that we should lose any prospect of being able to influence thepolicy of the new regime in the Yemen in a sense favourable to us.The republican Government could be expected to intensify the traditional Yemeni policy of subversion and of hostility to our
AircraftIndustrySupersonicAirliner(previous reference:C.C. (62) 38thConclusions,Minute 6)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the first secretary of State (C. (62) 174) reporting the views of the Committeeon Civil Scientific Research and Development on a proposal for ajoint enterprise by British and French industry to develop an airlinerwith twice the speed of sound to come into service about 1970.The First Secretary of State said that the Committee had fully considered the proposal itself, but had not had adequate opportunityto compare it with possible competitors in the scientific field. Ithad, however, been necessary to bring the matter before cabinet at this stage because the Minister of Aviation was due to meet theFrench Minister of Public Works, M. Dusseaulx, on 7th november and would need to indicate the attitude of the United KingdomGovernment to the proposal. Generally, the Committee had feltthat the proposal was a natural manifestation of technologicalprogress and that supersonic passenger travel was sure to come. Onthe other hand, they had felt that the proposal could not stand onnormal economic grounds. He had discussed the proposal with theChairman of the British Overseas Airways Corporation. TheCorporation already had or were acquiring a fleet of subsonic jetairliners and would be reluctant to introduce a supersonic airlinerbefore they had had time to amortise their cost; but, as a nationalisedundertaking, they would, if necessary, accept direction from theGovernment.The proposal was for joint participation by British and Frenchindustry in the construction of two versions of the design, one forlong range and the other for medium range. Both countries would participate in the manufacture of both aircraft and would havebroadly equal shares in the cost and proceeds of sales of the twoversions taken together. He drew attention particularly, however,to the fact that the United States industry had overtaken us withtheir Boeing 707, though its development had started after that ofour Comets and Britannias. As soon as the United States aircraft industry saw that we were seriously engaged in this project theywould press ahead either with an airliner of similar performanceor, as they apparently preferred, with an airliner with three times the speed of sound. In this way they might enter the market at thesame time as we did or within a relatively short time afterwards. Itmight well be that the Cabinet of 10 years hence would find thatthe outlay of some  85 million required from public funds to meetpre-production costs had not in the event been justified, because ofintense competition and the small size of the market. On the otherhand, to decide not to venture in this field while the United States,and Russia and perhaps France, went ahead, could well meancontracting out of the manufacture of large civil aircraft.The Minister of A aviation said that he regarded the developmentof a supersonic airliner as inevitable somewhere in the world.Market research showed that it was primarily speed that attractedpassengers, and in this case speed and operating costs were not in conflict, as they were in other transport media. The operating costs of an airliner with about twice the speed of sound seemed likely to compare reasonably well with those of existing subsonic jets, providedinterests, and might do so more effectively than their predecessors.Our position in Aden would then be progressively eroded. It was probable that on balance it would be necessary to recognise the new regime before very long, but there was a strong case for deferringrecognition, at least until after the Parliamentary debate on the merger between Aden Colony and the Aden Protectorate which was due to take place on 13th November.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.
that operating costs were not loaded with amortisation of pre-production costs. If we went forward with this project, we should enjoy a clear lead for perhaps three to five years. Although theUnited States had large resources with which to build a competitor,a combination of the British Aircraft Company and Sud-Aviationwould command resources as large as any single United Statescombine. While it was true that the Boeing 707 had largely taken the market from the Comet, the Comet had come within an ace ofsecuring a five-year lead over the Boeing and would have done sobut for a minor defect in design. The airliner with three times the speed of sound, which the United States preferred, would have tobe built of steel and would use different components. While it mightbe superior to the proposed Anglo-French aircraft in the end, thelatter might have the market to itself from early in the 1970s until about 1975. If European airlines were equipped with it, it mightbe difficult for United States airlines to content themselves withsubsonic aircraft until the United States supersonic airliner could come into service. There would also be political advantage in alarge project carried out in co-operation with the French. If, on theother hand, the proposal were rejected, the Bristol design teamwould have to be disbanded; there would be less work which couldbe sub-contracted to Shorts of Belfast and other concerns; and theUnited Kingdom would go out of the manufacture of large long-rangeaircraft for passengers or freight. To contract out in this way wouldbe difficult to reconcile with the Governments declared policy of supporting the civil aircraft industry.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that he agreed that supersonictravel would come sooner or later. But he hesitated to commendthe particular proposal before the Cabinet because of its poorshowing in commercial and financial terms. He was particularly concerned that neither the manufacturers nor the Corporation wereprepared to put money of their own into the project. Although itmight be said that the manufacturers would be tying up their resources for several years if the project went ahead, this would meaneither that they would be devoting to this project resources thatmight otherwise have been devoted to others, or that they wouldbe using plant that would otherwise have been idle; and in either case they would, on present plans, be paid from public funds in fullon a cost plus basis. Moreover, if a supersonic airliner had to beintroduced by the Corporation before their fleet of subsonic jets,which would include 42 VC-lOs due for delivery up to the mid-1960s,had reached the end of their useful lives, massive aid from public funds might be required for the Corporation. There were attractionsin a joint enterprise with French industry, but it would be the moredifficult to stop if it appeared to be losing its promise; and the prestige derived from building the airliner might be much impairedif the aircraft were generally regarded as basically French but with united Kingdom engines a risk which was illustrated by that factthat the airliner was already known in France as the &quot; Super-Caravelle &quot;. The project was difficult to judge from the standpointof technological advance without looking at the other scientificprojects which the Government might wish to back. He hoped,therefore, that a final commitment might be avoided for the timebeing so that the Government could consider the proposal further in the light both of further discussion with M. Dusseaulx and of an examination of other scientific projects which might be in competition with it.The Minister of Defence said that he believed that, not onlywas supersonic air travel sure to come, but that wherever a supersonicairliner was developed it would be with State money. The question was whether we should seek to be the first in the field. He wasattracted to the present proposal because it was feasible; it also
offered a chance of exploiting a clear lead. A decision not to go ahead would be a major setback for the United Kingdom aircraft industry and would leave the market to other countries.In discussion the following points were made:(a) There were dangers in under-rating the judgment of theUnited States, who had preferred the more difficult task of developingan airliner with three times the speed of sound. It was puzzlingthat, although neither the United States nor the Corporation wantedan aircraft with twice the speed of sound, the French were apparentlydetermined to go ahead with such an aircraft even if the UnitedKingdom did not co-operate with them. Further information onthe chances of capturing the European market was required. this had been estimated at something in the region of 150 and 170aircraft. It was known that the French were working towardsunification of European airlines, even at some cost to the traffic atpresent carried by Air France. If the French could sway the european market, the prospects for sales would be that much better. the airlines of France and the United Kingdom alone would not providea sufficiently large market.(b) Major projects in the aircraft industry were now on a scalebeyond the reach of private finance. There was a risk of embarrassment, however, if the whole of the pre-production costs were borne by public funds. A proposal was under consideration at present for a joint Anglo-Belgian venture for the construction ofa nuclear ship, and for a ship with a fully automatic engine-room.But it was envisaged that private capital would play its part in these developments, and the shipping industry might accuse theGovernment of discrimination in favour of the aircraft industryunless some private money were also involved in launching thesupersonic airliner project.(c) While there were technological advantages in the proposal,it was difficult to measure these against other major scientific projectssuch as the fast reactor, the nuclear ship or satellite capability. these projects were not individually so large as the supersonic airliner,but they might be more important. Machinery was required forarranging such projects in an order of priority, and this had not yetbeen achieved. A decision on priority should not turn solely on theneed to give a decision upon the supersonic airliner in time for themeeting with M. Dusseaulx. On the other hand, it would be wrong to let a major opportunity slip because it was not possible to considerother projects at the same time.(d) The proposal could be regarded as a purely commercial oneconcerning civil passenger transport. It was likely that at this stage the cost had been under-estimated and the market over-estimated,but even on this basis it was commercially unpromising. There wasno prestige in a commercial failure, and there was much to be said for enabling United Kingdom airlines to buy what was best for themin their commercial judgment without imposing on them the risks of pioneering. On the other hand, it was difficult for any airlineto form a commercial judgment about an airliner that would not come into service until after 1970, and the fact that they were notprepared to put their own money into the project did not necessarilyreflect an adverse judgment.(e) The Royal Air Force had no immediate interest in theproposed supersonic airliner. But if the project were not adopted,this would be a blow to the industry and thus indirectly to the AirForce.(/) A supersonic airliner would cause a sonic boom, and in some circumstances would be noisier than some subsonic aircraft. Therewere also certain solar radiation hazards. But these considerationsdid not amount to arguments against the project. Rather, they wouldresult in certain limitations on the operation of the aircraft, theeffect of which would be felt in the economics of using it.
Industrial 3.   The Minister of Labour informed the Cabinet that the unionsDisputes concerned had now given notice of an official strike to be called at(Previous the Ford Motor Company works at Dagenham.  He had asked bothReference: sides to report to him during the course of the day.  He had thoughtCC.

The employers&apos; object had been to remove from theirFord Motor employment a small number of pe; ustent and politically-mindedCompany, troublemakers; this was a sensible . im which the unions mightDagenhamCC. 66 (62)Summing up, the Prime Minister said that it was peculiarlydifficult to judge this proposal. The airlines which would buy theaircraft were in any case not commercially profitable, and for commercial reasons would tcrd to oppose it. The advocates ofslower, safer and more comfortable air travel, however, were notnecessarily right; slower aircraft had not proved cheaper to operate,and in any case there was a natural inclination to prefer higherspeeds even at some cost in comfort. The project would, however,not make money, partly because of its own high cost and possibly also because of United States competition. The possibility of ensuring by consultation with other European countries a substantialmarket for the new airliner ought to be explored further. The factthat two companies of high quality were prepared to devote theirdesign teams, their plant and manpower to this project was some indication that they had confidence in it; for they would certainly be ruined if the project turned out to be a failure. There wasadvantage in a project which would demonstrate dramaticallyinterdependence between the United Kingdom and France at thisstage; and there might be advantage from such a link between theUnited Kingdom and Europe in the wider field of relations betweenthe major Powers. Conversely, there would be disadvantage in allowing France to go ahead alone with the project. It would be important, however, to ensure that if the project were to go aheadthen it should do so on a basis which involved some financial contribution from the companies and ensured that they participatedwith the maximum efficiency; and that the aircraft was known by aname which would reflect the joint participation of the UnitedKingdom and France in the project.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Aviation to inform the FrenchGovernment that the proposal for the joint developmentof an Anglo-French supersonic airliner, was in principleacceptable to the United Kingdom Government, subjectto satisfactory assurances on the participation of Frenchairlines and to final examination of market prospects.(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation, in further discussion withthe French authorities, to obtain fuller information aboutthe nature, extent and firmness of the market for thisairliner, both in its medium-range and in its long-rangeversion.(3) Invited the Minister of Aviation to discuss with the french authorities the drafting of formal Heads of Agreementbetween the two Governments on the development andthe financing of the airliner and in particular to proposea name for it which would reflect their joint participation in the project.(4) Invited the Minister of Aviation in the light of his discussions to bring the subject before them again at a later meeting.

He would keep the Prime Minister and the other ministers concerned closely informed of developments.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.
