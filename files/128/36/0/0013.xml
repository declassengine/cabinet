2. The Foreign Secretary said that the United Nationsauthorities wished to put troops into Jadotville and Kolwezi, twotowns in Katanga containing important installations of the UnionMiniere. Their professed purpose was to round up mercenariesbelieved to be operating in this area. There was however reason tobelieve that they were also concerned to bring pressure on the UnionMiniere to pay a larger share of their profits to the central CongoGovernment. This operation could therefore be represented as anattempt to use military force for political ends. It was therefore important that it should not be undertaken without the agreementof Mr. Tshombe, the Prime Minister of Katanga. It was possiblethat the Prime Minister of the Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland might be willing to advise Mr. Tshombe to reach anagreement with the United Nations authorities regarding the deployment of these troops.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary; and agreed that no objection need be raised to this proposeddeployment of United Nations forces in Jadotville andKolwezi if it were carried out in agreement with the PrimeMinister of Katanga.3. The Cabinet were informed that the outstanding claim for wage increases in the gas industry might have a bearing on any settlement now proposed for railwaymen. The workers in the gas industry were claiming 4 per cent., in the light of the recent award of a 6 per cent, increase to workers in electricity undertakings; butan award of more than 2\ per cent, to 3 per cent, would prejudice a railway settlement and would be contrary to the Governmentscurrent policy.  As regards the railwaymen there seemed to be twoa 2i. The Foreign Secretary said that Mr. Khrushchev had sent a prompt reply to the messages which the Prime Minister and thePresident of the United States had addressed to him suggesting anew initiative towards an effective international agreement on disarmament. In this he made the counter proposal that Heads of governments should themselves attend the opening stages of the18-Power conference on disarmament. It was evident that he hadbeen planning to make this proposal before the Anglo-Americanapproach was made. After consultation with the United StatesGovernment it was proposed to take the line, in reply, that theAnglo-American proposal for a preliminary meeting of foreign ministers would be a more practical approach, though the possibilityof a meeting at a higher level could be considered later if it became clear that there were good prospects of progress towards anagreement.The Prime Minister said that, while he agreed that little practicalprogress was likely to be made by a meeting of 18 Heads of governments, the Governments of the United Kingdom and theUnited States should not allow themselves to be robbed of theinitiative which they had taken. This might happen if a number ofthe other Governments were to support the course suggested byMr. Khrushchev.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Prime Minister andthe Foreign Secretary.
alternatives: to concede now or in a few weeks&apos; time some marginalincrease above 3 per cent. say, 34- per cent. and reach in this waya settlement which would be binding until some time in 1963; or to stand firm on 3 per cent, for the time being but to make it ciear thatif the unions submitted a further claim in the autumn it would be examined in the light of developments in the national economy andof any benefits which might by then have begun to flow from there-organisation of the railway system.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The Prime Ministers objective, at his meeting withrepresentatives of the railwaymen&apos;s unions, would be to avert astrike without making concessions which might undermine theGovernment&apos;s wages policy. It would be particularly important toavoid any statement which could be interpreted as a commitment to allow further increases later in the year. It was also important that no indication should be given that the Government wereprepared to consider any advance beyond the offer of a 3 per cent,increase in wages which had been made to the unions by theChairman of the British Transport Commission.(b) If the railwaymen&apos;s unions accepted a 3 per cent, increase in wages now on the understanding that they would be free to re-open negotiations in the autumn, it was not to be expected that theywould then be content with less than a supplementary award of2 per cent. If this were conceded in the autumn they would havereceived a total of 5 per cent, in the year, which would seriouslyundermine the Governments wages policy.(c) On the other hand 3 per cent, already represented some concession to the railwaymen since it was higher than the figure of24- per cent, on which the Governments present policy was based.It was impossible to predict the course of events if the unionsre-opened negotiations in the autumn; much might have happened in the interval both to the state of the national economy generally and to the level of wages.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would, in the light oftheir discussion, consider with the Ministers concerned theterms of the statement which he should make to representatives of the railwaymen&apos;s unions at his meeting with them on 14th February.4. The Cabinet had before them a telegram from theCommonwealth Secretary (Soscro No. 6 from Zomba) reporting the upshot of a talk which he had had in Zomba with Dr. Banda, the african leader in Nyasaland. In the course of this talk he had askedDr. Banda whether, if Nyasaland were given an unconditional rightto secede from the Federation, he would be willing to negotiatesome looser form of association with the Rhodesias. To thisDr. Banda had replied that he would not negotiate at all untilNyasaland was outside the Federation; that after secessionNyasaland should stand alone for a period before entering into any new association; and that after such a period Nyasaland might go into an East African federation, with which Northern Rhodesiamight also be associated in due course. He was determined thatNyasaland should not be associated with any central african federation, or with Southern Rhodesia, so long as either wasdominated by Europeans. The Commonwealth Secretary proposedthat on his return to Salisbury he should report this conversation tothe Prime Minister of the Federation, Sir Roy Welensky, and advise
him that he had no prospect of retaining Nyasaland in the Federationexcept by force. He also sought the Cabinefs authority to adviseSir Roy Welensky to take the initiative himself, in anticipation ofany public statement by Dr. Banda formally demanding secession,by making a public declaration that he would not desire to retainan unwilling partner in the Federation and was therefore asking the United Kingdom Government to arrange for Nyasaland tosecede from it in accordance with the wishes of its people.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat it would be premature to advise Sir Roy Welensky to make apublic declaration on the lines suggested in paragraph 10 of theCommonwealth Secretary&apos;s telegram. While doubts had been growing about the possibility of preserving the Federation in itspresent form, it had been hoped hitherto that it might be replaced by some form of looser association between the three constituentterritories. T.t need not yet be assumed that this would be whollyimpracticable. In any event the Cabinet should have further timeto weigh the alternatives, and to consider the practical and financial implications of dismantling the Federation, before any public declaration was made which would imply that its dissolution was inevitable.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) The Commonwealth Secretary had said, in paragraph 5 ofhis telegram, that Dr. Banda might modify some of the views whichhe had expressed in this discussion. Past experience had shown thathe was amenable to influence, and he might still be brought to accept some different form of association between Nyasaland and the rhodesias. His attitude in this recent talk might have been affectedby the fact that it took place in an interval between theCommonwealth Secretary&apos;s consultations with Sir Roy Welensky,to whom he was bitterly hostile.(b) Sir Roy Welensky had on the previous day assured theFederal Parliament in Salisbury that he would not allow theFederation to be dissolved while he was Prime Minister. In view ofthe terms of that speech (of which the Commonwealth secretary would not have been aware when his telegram was sent) he could hardly be expected to make a public declaration on the lines contemplated in paragraph 9 of the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;telegram.(c) There was force in the suggestion that, if the secession of nyasaland was inevitable, we should concede it before it was forcedfrom us by Dr. Banda. We ought first however to weigh theconsequences; and there was time to do this before Dr. Bandacame to London in April. During this interval further detailedthought should be given to the administrative and financial implications of a break-up of the Federation.(d) Sir Roy Welensky now seemed to be more ready to make concessions to the two northern territories. In return for theindependence of the Federation he now seemed ready to contemplate that these territories should have a right to secede after five years.A plan for development along those lines had been worked out bythe Monckton Commission. Even now it might not be too late tosecure agreement on some such basis as this.(e) In his recent speech in the Federal Parliament, Sir roy welensky had claimed that the United Kingdom Government couldnot dissolve the Federation without the consent of the federal parliament. The Lord Chancellor said that he was doubtful whetherthis view was soundly based in law. The Law Officers might beasked for their opinion.
aircraft industry(previous reference:C.C. (61) 57thConclusions,Minute 2)Light CargoAircraft5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Defence and the Minister of Aviation (C. (62) 25) aboutthe choice of a light cargo aircraft to meet military requirements.The Minister of Defence said that from a military point of view the Handley Page Herald was marginally better than HawkerSidde!ey&apos;s Avro 748. The Caribou, manufactured in Canada by a subsidiary of Hawker Siddeley would not meet the military requirements. He agreed with the Minister of Aviation that thearguments for placing the order with a firm which had supported the Government^ policy for concentrating the aircraft industry were strong enough to make it right to choose the Avro 748 in preference to the Herald: the military advantages of the latter aircraft werenot decisive.In discussion the following points were made:(a) An order for the Caribou would have been helpful toAnglo-Canadian relations. But the technical reasons for not placingsuch an order had been fully explained to the Canadian Minister ofDefence Production; and it was to be hoped that, in spite of adecision not to order the Caribou, the Canadian maintenancecontract with Scottish Aviation would be continued for as long aspossible.ib) The present estimates of cost suggested that the Heraldwould be cheaper than the Avro 748, but experience suggested thatwhen detailed specifications were put to the firms the cost of theHerald would increase. Nevertheless, it would be difficult to acceptthe additional cost of the Avro 748 unless the compensating economy of cancelling the military order for the Rotodyne had been secured.(c) The principal reason for preferring the Avro 748 to theHerald was to be found in the assurances publicly given at the timeof the re-organisation of the aircraft industry that future government orders would be concentrated upon the main groups (with exceptionswhich did not apply in the present case). The Secretary of Stalefor Air said that particular care should be taken, in any public presentation of the decision, to avoid confirming suspicions that theRoyal Air Force had been forced for political reasons to accept aninferior aircraft. After careful evaluation it seemed clear that ofthe two aircraft the Herald was the more likely to meet therequirements of the Royal Air Force. Other Ministers suggestedthat the comparative merits of the two aircraft were at least opento argument and could fairly be represented as evenly balanced; and against such a background the decision to choose the product of oneof the major manufacturing groups could be justified on grounds ofGovernment policy.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Prime Minister to send an immediate reply tothe Commonwealth Secretary^ telegram Soscro No. 6,asking him to refrain from putting to Sir Roy V/elenskythe specific proposals outlined in paragraphs 9 and 10 ofthat telegram and suggesting that in his further discussions in Salisbury he should confine himself to exploring thesituation generally and without commitment, so that theCabinet might be able to discuss the whole position on his return.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to obtain from the LawOfficers an opinion on the question whether the UnitedKingdom Government had power to dissolve theFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland without theconsent of the Federal Parliament.
CiviJDefence(previous reference:C.C. (60) 65thConclusions,Minute 5)DispersalPolicy6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of housing (C. (62) 26) recommending an announcement by theGovernment that they had accepted the need to have available ascheme for the dispersal in emergency of mothers and children and people in priority classes from major centres of population and thatthe details of the scheme would be worked out with local authorities.The Home Secretary said that he and his colleagues had reachedthe conclusion that it would not be possible for the Government tocontinue to remain silent on this subject. To announce theabandonment of a policy of dispersal would be unacceptable to public and Parliamentary opinion; nor would it be right to deprivea future Government of the power to decide in a time of emergencywhether or not dispersal should be carried out. The only alternativeC.C. 13 (62)(d) There would be advantage in delaying for some days any public announcement of the decision to order the Avro 748 in orderto give time for private discussion with the firms concerned.The Prime Minister said that notwithstanding the arguments infavour of placing the order in Canada, it would not be right to choosea piston-engined machine such as the Caribou to be the future lightcargo aircraft of the British forces. As between the Herald and theAvro 748 there did not appear to be enough difference in performanceto justify a decision contrary to the weight of the industrialarguments.The Cabinet (!) Agreed that no order should be placed for the Caribou.(2) Agreed that the Avro 748 should be ordered rather thanthe Herald, in accordance with the declared policy ofthe Government to support the main groups in theaircraft industry.(3) Authorised the Minister of Defence to announce their decision in the Statement on Defence. 1962.The The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterRotodyne       of Aviation (C. (62) 30) recommending cancellation of the Rotodyneproject.The Minister of Aviation said that the Chiefs of Staff had accepted that the purchase of the Rotodyne could not now be reconciled with the need for economy in the defence budgetNeither British European Airways nor the independent airlines were interested in the Rotodyne, because of its high cost and becausetraffic requirements would not enable its qualities to be fullyexploited. Further progress with the Rotodyne would not bepossible unless there were a demand at home, both civil and military,from which the possibility of sales abroad might be developed.In discussion the point was made that cancellation of theRotodyne would mean that the Army would be deprived for many-years of any heavy lift aircraft with a range of 200 miles which wasindependent of forward airfields. On the other hand, the Avro 748could be operated from short and relatively simple airstrips; whilethe Belvedere had a heavy-lift capacity as well as vertical take-off and landing. It would in any case be unrealistic to continue the project for the sake of an order of 12 aircraft for military purposes.The Cabinet (4) A.greed that the Rotodyne project should be cancelled.
was to proceed with the preparation of detailed plans. This wouldinvolve revealing to particular local authorities whether they werein reception, dispersal or neutral areas, and the details of those tobe included in the priority classes. Objections to the plan would undoubtedly be raised when these facts became public knowledge,but the objections could be dealt with by saying that the plan asa whole was still under examination.The Prime Minister said that he welcomed the abandonment ofthe term &quot; evacuation which was misleading in the context of nuclear war. It was no longer true that the danger to individuals inthe event of war would be greater in major centres of populationthan it was in rural areas; the object of dispersal was to secure betteraverage chances of survival for the population as a whole byspreading them out more evenly through the country.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Statement on Defence, 1962 should containan announcement of the Governments dispersal policyin the terms proposed.(2) Took note that the Home Secretary, the Secretary of Statefor Scotland and the Minister of Housing would thereafterarrange for detailed discussions with local authorities.Statement 7.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister of on Defence (C. (62) 23) covering a revised draft of the Statement on defence, Defence for 1962, and a further note by the Minister of Defence1962 (C. (62) 24) outlining the strategic policy on which the statement hadbeen framed.The Minister of Defence said that the draft of the defence white Paper now before the Cabinet embodied the amendments which the Defence Committee had approved at their meeting on 7th February. He had no further amendments to propose otherthan minor points of drafting with which he need not trouble theCabinet.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, suggested an amendment to paragraph 15 of the draft. In its present form the paragraph might increase the difficulty of his negotiating position with the german federal Government on support costs.The Minister of Aviation said that the paragraph in the statementdealing with research and development created certain difficultiesfrom his point of view; and he would discuss a revised version withthe Minister of Defence.The Cabinet Subject to amendment on the points noted in discussion,authorised the Minister of Defence to present to parliament the Statement on Defence, 1962 in the form annexed toC. (62) 23.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th February, 1962.
