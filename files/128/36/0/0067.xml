Federation of rhodesia endNyasaiand(previous reference :C.C. (62) 64thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The First Secretary of State said that at their last discussion the Cabinet had agreed that he should announce at or just beforethe opening of the forthcoming Nyasaland Conference theGovernments acceptance in principle of Nyasaland&apos;s withdrawal from the Central African Federation. He had now to inform theCabinet that this proposal had produced a strong reaction from theFederal Prime Minister, Sir Roy Welensky. His objections fell underthe following heads. First, he maintained that the United KingdomGovernment could not legislate on the question without the approvalof the Southern Rhodesian as well as the Federal Parliament, and had said that in the event of legislation the position of the federal government would be fully reserved. Secondly, he had said that thewithdrawal of Nyasaland could not be accepted unless accompaniedby an assurance from the United Kingdom Government that the rev/ould be continued association, including political association,between Northern and Southern Rhodesia. Thirdly, he had stressed the serious effect which an early statement about Nyasaland&apos;withdrawal would be likely to have both on the second stage of theelections in Northern Rhodesia and on the elections in SouthernRhodesia. Fourthly, he had stressed the lack of consultation andalleged breaches of faith by the United Kingdom Government on various counts. Fifthly, he foresaw serious economic consequencesif Nyasaland&apos;s right to withdraw were acknowledged. Finally, he had said that unless a statement about Nyasaland was deferred he wouldnot be able to support the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia,Sir Edgar Whitehead, in the forthcoming elections, would feel boundto reveal in the Federal Parliament the detailed course of thenegotiations with the United Kingdom Government and would do his best to rally United Kingdom opinion in his support.The First Secretary of State said that he had also discussed theposition with the Leader of the Malawi Congress Party, Dr. Banda,who had said that Nyasaland&apos;s right to withdraw from the Federationhad been tacitly accepted by the United Kingdom many months ago:he had agreed, at the request of the First Secretary of State, to a postponement of the final decision in order to allow time for thespecial advisers to visit the territory and to report: they had nowdone so and he could delay no longer. If Nyasa!and&apos;s right towithdraw were not recognised at the forthcoming Conference hewould not be prepared to return to Nyasaland to take charge of theGovernment.The First Secretary of State said that after careful reflection hehad come with regret to the conclusion that it would be necessaryto make a statement at the opening of the Nyasaland Conference onthe lines previously agreed. Failure to do so would certainly resultin a serious security situation in Nyasaland itself; nor was it realisticto suppose that deferment of the statement would produce any morehelpful reaction from Sir Roy Welensky; at whatever time thestatement was made it would produce the same objections and thesame arguments for still further delay. The Cabinet should, however,be aware that when the statement was made there would be anunpleasant exchange with the Federal Government, and serious political repercussions in this country. He had offered to go out to central Africa himself in January to discuss the continued associationof Northern and Southern Rhodesia and other related matters; andthere was some hope that the knowledge that this visit was to bemade might help to produce a better atmosphere. But the outlookwas still uncertain;  in the event of any serious or unforeseenParliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
development in the course of the next day or two he would wishto obtain the views and advice of those of his senior colleagues whowere most closely concerned.The Prime Minister said that the prospect was depressing. TheFederation had started with high hopes and had been from every point of view a great and honourable enterprise. There could nowbe no doubt that it had failed. It was, however, necessary to look at the future in a constructive light. If it were necessary for politicaland national reasons that the territories of the Federation shouldseparate now, it was to be hoped that they would find it possible andeven necessary to join together again in some more enduringpartnership founded perhaps on the reality of their economicinterdependence. The Government should do all they could to fosterconcepts of this kind. Accusations of breach of faith were naturallyof concern to the Government and to the Ministers directly involved;but he took some comfort from the fact that charges of bad faithhad been levelled so indiscriminately against so many Ministers asto lead to a supposition of bias on the part of their accusers.The Foreign Secretary said that, not only had the Federationbeen sound as a concept, it had made remarkable progress in raising thestandard of living and administration in its territories. His concernwas to avoid at all costs a dissolution of the Federation which would lead to the establishment of two black African States and one whiteState, Southern Rhodesia, which would then inevitably orient itselftowards South Africa. This would mean the total abandonment ofthe multi-racial policy on which the long-term future of central africa so largely depended. Somehow an association, includingpolitical association, between Northern and Southern rhodesia would have to be preserved. He did not entirely rule out the possible use of force to achieve this end if all other methods had failed. Itmight not at the present stage be possible for the Government toenter into a binding commitment to maintain the association of thetwo Rhodesias, but he hoped it would be possible to declare firmlythat this was the Governments objective. Political consequencesapart, the economic effects of their separation would be grave. Hewould welcome a memorandum setting out in more detail theeconomic and political consequences of a final break between thetwo Rhodesias.The Commonwealth Secretary said that he did not believe itwould be right or possible to commit the Government to a continuingpolitical association between the two Rhodesias. However desirable,it was simply not practicable. Political association would imply acommon policy between the Governments of the two territories atleast on external affairs and on defence; but these were precisely the subjects on which opinion between a black Northern rhodesian government and a largely white Southern Rhodesian Governmentwould be most deeply divided. The prospect of economic association was more hopeful and there might be useful precedents to be drawn from the development of the common services organisation in EastAfrica. It would for other reasons be dangerous to give Sir roy welensky the impression that the United Kingdom Government wouldbe prepared to fight for the retention of what would remain of theFederation after Nyasaland&apos;s withdrawal.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The legislation to effect Nyasaland &apos;s withdrawal from theFederation would not involve the break-up of the Federation, whichwould then consist of Northern and Southern Rhodesia. The UnitedKingdom Government had in 1957 accepted the existence of aconvention under which they would refrain from legislating in matters within the competence of the Federal Parliament except at the requestof that Parliament. The clear intention had been to leave the federal parliament unrestricted rights in matters of domestic legislation and
in such constitutional matters as the franchise. The convention had as it were defined the area within which the Federal Parliament wouldhave fully delegated responsibility. The legal powers of the UnitedKingdom Parliament had at no time been in question. But it wouldbe possible to allege that in legislating for Nyasaland&apos;s withdrawal theUnited Kingdom Government would be in breach of the conventionbecause under the wording of the Federal Constitution Nyasaland&apos;sinclusion in the Federation could be held to be a constitutional matter.The only effective answer to argument on these lines would be topoint to the clear intention of both Governments at the time whenthe convention was accepted.(b) An outbreak of violence in Nyasaland would present seriouspractical difficulties. The use of United Kingdom troops would bedifficult, since there were no secure bases from which to operate.The use of Federal troops would be highly objectionable. Thepossibility could not be excluded that at some stage feelings in theFederation might rise to a point at which it would resort to force in opposition to the policies of the United Kingdom Government. Butit was unlikely that the withdrawal of Nyasaland would in the eventproduce so strong a reaction; it would be more likely to arise on a withdrawal by Northern Rhodesia where larger economic andpolitical issues were at stake. For this reason the withdrawal of nyasaland should so far as possible be treated as an isolated issue andshould not be linked with the question of continued association between Northern and Southern Rhodesia. This would not, however,be easy in practice; for any statement about Nyasaland&apos;s withdrawal would be bound to raise questions about the Rhodesias.The Cabinet then considered the draft statement which the first secretary of State might make at or before the opening of the nyasaland Conference.In discussion of the draft the following points were made:(c) It would be necessary to make it clear that after thewithdrawal of Nyasaland the Federation would consist of northern and Southern Rhodesia. It should not be implied that Nyasaland&apos;withdrawal would lead inevitably to the break-up of the federation as a whole.(d) The statement should so far as possible make it clear that two entirely separate issues were involved those which concerned the effects of withdrawal on Nyasaland herself and those which involved future constitutional developments in the Rhodesias. Thefirst set of problems would be dealt with at the Nyasaland Conferenceand subsequently in negotiation with the Nyasaland authorities.Constitutional developments in the Rhodesias could not be tackleduntil after the forthcoming elections; and at that stage it wouldprobably be necessary to arrange for a resumption of some kind of federal review conference.(e) The statement should make it clear that in so far asNyasaland&apos;s withdrawal increased her economic difficulties the UnitedKingdom Government could not and would not call on the British tax payer to make up the difference. In practice some increase in economic aid to Nyasaland might be inevitable, but it would be a mistake to recognise the possibility of such an increase now.(/) The statement should refer in rather warmer terms to theimportance which the Government attached to continuing links between the two Rhodesias and to continuing association between all three territories. It would, however, be necessary to avoid onthe one hand an implied commitment to maintain the residualFederation in being at all costs or, on the other, an implication thatthe Government already regarded the disappearance of any Federalrelationship between the two Rhodesias as a foregone conclusion.
The Cabinet (1) Authorised the First Secretary of State to make a statement in Parliament at the opening of the Nyasaland Conferenceacknowledging Nyasaland&apos;s right to withdraw from theCentral African Federation.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theLord Chancellor and the other Ministers concerned, to redraft this statement in the light of their discussion.(3) Took note that, in the event of any unforeseen developments,the First Secretary of State would arrange for further consultation with the Ministers concerned.(4) Invited the First Secretary of State to circulate for their consideration at a later meeting a memorandum describing the political and economic consequences of a final breakbetween Northern and Southern Rhodesia.immunities and Privileges(previous reference :CC. (62) 38thConclusions,Minute 4)3. The Cabinet had before them notes by the Secretary ofthe Cabinet covering information provided by officials about the vienna Convention on diplomatic relations (C. (62) 164) and aboutinternational and Commonwealth organisations (C. (62) 165).The Prime Minister reminded the Cabinet that, at their meetingon 29th May, they had called for further information about thelegislation required if we were to ratify the Vienna Convention ondiplomatic relations; and for an examination of the practical resultsfor the revenue which might flow from the adoption of certainprinciples, suggested by the then Lord Chancellor, for determining the extent to which diplomatic privileges and immunities shouldbe accorded to international and Commonwealth organisations.Decisions would have to be taken in due course on the points of policywhich had been noted in the papers circulated by the Secretary ofthe Cabinet, but it seemed evident that improvements were in anycase required in the machinery for inter-departmental consultation on the wide range of problems which arose in connection withimmunities and privileges. There was at present no establishedmachinery to deal with points affecting diplomats or commonwealth organisaitons; and the machinery to deal with points affectinginternational organisations seemed to be inadequate. It would bedesirable to set up a more authoritative committee of officials towhom all inter-departmental problems affecting immunities and privileges could be referred. He proposed to give consideration tothe terms of reference and membership of such a committee and tothe way in which the issues which the committee would throw up should be brought before Ministers.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theestablishment of a committee of officials to consider inter-departmental problems affecting immunities and privileges and for the reference to Ministers of those issues on whichMinisterial decisions were required.(g) That part of the statement which touched on the futureassociation between the two Rhodesias could with advantage be castin more general terms. It would be undesirable to define too closelyat this stage either the methods of future consultation with theGovernments concerned or the subjects which those consultationswould cover.
4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChief Secretary, Treasury, and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment (C. (62) 171) about the basis on which the general grant for England and Wales for 1963-64 and 1964-65 should be fixed.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that it would shortly be necessary to settle the amount of general grant for the next two financial years. Statutory consultation between ministers and the representatives of local authorities would take place on15th November; and the order determining the amount of thegrant would have to be approved before the Christmas recess. TheMinisters particularly concerned were in agreement about theacceptable level of total expenditure on the services covered by thegeneral grant. But, in the circumstances created by the rating and valuation changes which would take effect on 1st April, 1963, therewas room for difference of opinion about the division of the burdenbetween the tax-payer and the rate-payer. The rating and valuationchanges would accentuate the disparity in resources among localauthorities and would involve an increase of about  26 million in ratedeficiency grant. It could perhaps be argued that the general grant should be reduced pro tanto. But if the Government acted on thisview they would be open to criticism from the local authorities, whowould claim that the increase in rate deficiency grant ought not inprinciple to be offset by reduction of the Exchequer contribution inother respects. Strict limitation would also invite renewed criticism from those who objected to the principle of general, as opposed to specific, grants and would make it more difficult for the Governmentto deal with complaints about the effect of revaluation on the level ofrates. On the other hand, the Exchequer contribution to local expenditure already amounted to 52-5 per cent and, if payments for the next two years were calculated on the same basis as in thepast, the proportion would rise to 53-9 per cent. Such an increase would be the biggest single increase in the Governments expenditurein 1963-64 and there were few other opportunities of checking the rising level of Government expenditure. The compromise suggestedin C. (62) 171 would mean that the proportion would be 53 -1 per cent.The total of general and rate deficiency grants for 1963-64 would thenbe some  62 million above the current level of  635 million, and, in answer to claims that the Exchequer contribution ought to be stilllarger, it could be pointed out that at the level proposed it wouldbe higher than in any year since the general grants were introduced.In discussion the following points were raised:(a) In the light of the forthcoming rating and valuation changes,the ideal course would have been to moderate the increase in ratedeficiency grant. This could not, however, be done under the law asit stood.(b) Revaluation would be a heavy burden on the domestic rate-payer in places like the prosperous seaside towns where there wouldbe little gain from industrial re-rating. It was unfortunate that these were precisely the places where there would be no increase, or verylittle increase, in rate deficiency grant to cushion the blow.(c) Although the proposed compromise might be defended on general grounds, there was no doubt that the Government would be subjected to severe criticism from the local authorities. This would tend to prejudice presentation of the unpalatable changes in rateburdens which would take effect in the spring of 1963 and it would create a poor atmosphere for proposals affecting social welfare whichwould by then be maturing.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that it wouldbe convenient to defer a final decision until after the statutoryconsultation with local authority representatives on 15th November.
In view of the short time which would be available for furtherconsideration, it would be important that the Cabinet should resume their discussion as quickly as possible thereafter.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Housing to inform them as quickly as possible of the outcome of the statutory consultationwith representatives of local authorities on 15th November.(2) Agreed to resume at an early meeting their considerationof general grant for 1963-64 and 1964-65.5. The Commonwealth Secretary said that on 13th Novemberthere would be a debate in the House of Commons on a government motion to take note of the White Paper on Aden. It was to beexpected that there would be criticism of the Governments intentionto go forward with proposals for the merger of Aden Colony withthe Aden Federation, and there was every likelihood of seriousdisturbance in Aden itself. Continuance of the confused situationin the Yemen would contribute to the risk of disturbance but allpossible steps had been taken to maintain order. He believed thatin spite of the difficulties it would be right to proceed with thenegotiations for a merger.In discussion it was noted that, in view of recent evidence ofmilitary activity by forces of the United Arab Republic against villagesin Saudi Arabia, United States recognition of the republican regime inthe Yemen might be deferred.The Cabinet Reaffirmed their decision to proceed with negotiations fora merger of Aden Colony with the Aden Federation.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th November, 1962.Aden(previous reference :C.C.
