The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that since thePolicy CabinetS last discussion there were signs that the GovernmentsRailwaymen&apos;s incomes policy was securing wider acceptance. It now seemedWages possible that in the coal and gas industries the next stage in the(Previous negotiating procedure could be deferred for a short period, and that reference: settlements might eventually be reached which were not seriouslyC.C. (62) 5th out of line with the Governments general policy. It was understood,Conclusions, however, that the Chairman of the British Transport Commission,Minute6) whom the Minister of Transport would be seeing later that day withthe Minister without Portfolio and the Minister of Labour, still feltthat the minimum offer which could be made to railwaymen on a basisof comparability was about 6 per cent. But the Chairman had suggested that he might try to postpone the discussion with therailway unions due on 23rd January and had said that, if theGovernment so instructed him, he would make no offer or would offer less than 6 per cent. In the event of arbitration he would arguethe Governments case and would maintain that, in current economic circumstances and having regard to the deficits of the Commission,railwaymenS wages could not be increased at present to the extent that would be involved by following the Guillebaud recommendations.In answer to argument about the need to improve recruiting, he wouldstate the case for abandoning the National Wage Agreement; andthis might at least influence the arbitration tribunal against making alarge award. The immediate points for the CabinetS considerationwere whether the Chairman should be encouraged to seekpostponement of negotiations and what guidance, if any, should begiven to him on the Governments behalf.In discussion it was suggested that, if early settlements couldbe made in other industries at levels consistent with government policy, there would be advantage in some postponement of negotiations on railwaymenS wages. The disadvantages would bethat moderate opinion on the union side might be unable to preventunofficial strikes which, once started, might spread; and that, if theunions agreed to postponement, they would be taken by publicopinion to be doing so in the belief that they would obtain a more generous settlement later. Any substantial postponement, therefore(for example until the end of March, which the Chairman of theCommission appeared to have in mind), might be regarded as implyinga commitment on the Governments part to accept a settlementfavourable to the railwaymen. It would, however, be worth while to secure a shorter postponement, say, until the end of February.It could be argued that the use which would be made by theChairman of any letter of instruction issued to him would inevitablyshow that he would himself prefer a more generous settlement thanthe Government were prepared to approve. This might influence the arbitration tribunal to make an award unduly favourable to the railwaymen, but the effect would be offset by the arguments whichthe Chairman was prepared to bring forward on the national economic position and on the financial position of the transport commission.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that, in viewof the crucial importance of avoiding a large increase in railwaymenSwages and the ChairmanS readiness to accept guidance, it would bedesirable that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should give himnotice in writing of the Governments attitude towards this claim. Itwould be unrealistic to allow no offer to be made. The letter mightbegin by restating the main considerations in favour of wage restraintwhich had already been put to the Trades Union Congress andemphasising the importance of a settlement consistent with theGovernments incomes policy.   It should make it clear, without
specifically authorising the Chairman to make an offer of that amount,that a final settlement, either before or after arbitration, on the basisof an increase of the order of 2\ per cent, would not be resisted bythe Government. In arbitration proceedings it might not be necessaryto state whether the Government would or would not permit theCommission to implement an award in excess of 2\ per cent., and in drafting the letter care should be taken to ensure that the Governmentwould not be held committed to reject an award only slightly inexcess of that figure; but no doubt should be left in the Chairmarfsmind that an award for substantially more would not be implemented.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that in discussion with the Chairman of the british transport Commission the Minister of Transport, theMinister of Labour and the Minister without Portfolioshould encourage him to seek postponement of negotiations on railwaymerfs wages until about the endof February, and should consider with him, in the light ofthe Cabinefs discussion, the terms of a letter setting outthe Governments view on the railwaymen&apos;s claim.(2) Subject to the discussion referred to in Conclusion (1),authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to write tothe Chairman of the British Transport Commission on thelines indicated by the Prime Minister in summing up the cabinets discussion.*2. The Cabinet had before them telegrams Nos. 135, 136 and164 from Washington to the Foreign Office and telegrams Nos. 457and 458 from the Foreign Office to Washington, about the provisionof facilities at Christmas Island for a further series of nuclear tests.The Prime Minister said that in the light of the Cabinet&apos;discussion on 3rd January he had sent a personal message to president kennedy proposing that agreement on the use of Christmas Islandfor a further series of tests should be accompanied by a fresh appealto Mr. Khrushchev to co-operate in constructive measures of disarmament which would avoid this further extension of the nucleararms race. The Presidents reply, while welcoming the suggestion for a new initiative on disarmament, had urged the need to take anindependent decision about Christmas Island. The Prime minister had therefore suggested, in a further message, that a public announcement should be made which, while not making the start of preparations at Christmas Island contingent upon an agreement to approach the Soviet Government with new disarmament proposals,would establish some connexion between the two. The draft annexed to telegram No. 457 made it clear that, although preparations for a further series of tests were being put in hand, the decision tomake tests would depend at least in part on the Soviet Governmenfsreaction to the disarmament proposals and on the progress made inthe forthcoming eighteen-power conference at Geneva. president kennedy had suggested an amendment of this draft which revealedthe different positions of the two Governments on this question.President Kennedy had not yet decided to resume testing and wanted to avoid it if possible; but he was under heavy pressure to resumetesting from public opinion, from his military advisers, and from some of his scientific advisers. He therefore wished, in any public announcement, to avoid giving the impression that a decision to testhad already been taken or that the arguments for doing so wereincontrovertible. He also wished it to be clear that the final decisionrested in his hands. The United Kingdom Government, on the otherhand, did not wish it to be known that they had offered facilities for* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
testing at Christmas Island unless they were able to say at the sametime that it had been decided that further tests were necessary. for it would be embarrassing to admit that the final right to decide whether those facilities should be used was to be left to the unilateraldecision of the United States Government. The draft text put to president Kennedy had stated positively that the present state of nuclear development justified the West in making a further series of nuclear tests for military reasons. The Presidents amendment saidmerely that the present state of development would justify the Westin making such further tests as might be necessary. By thus leaving the issue in doubt the President met his own domestic problem; but his amendment might create political difficulties for the UnitedKingdom Government.The Prime Minister said that he would welcome the views of hiscolleagues on this issue.In discussion the following points were made:(a) Much would be lost by declining to make the facilities at christmas Island available to the United States Government. Thiswould not prevent the United States Government from deciding to resume testing, and the United Kingdom Government would losewhat power they had to influence that decision and to be brought into consultation. Moreover it would bring no political advantage, sincethe Government would be bound in any event to support a decision by the United States Government to resume testing. It would weaken the standing of the United Kingdom in the forthcoming discussions on disarmament.(b) It would not be possible to postpone a decision on the useof Christmas Island. While it was true that it would take only eight weeks to prepare Christmas Island for a further series of tests, itwould take much longer to prepare alternative facilities elsewhereand for this reason the United States Government needed animmediate decision.(c) There was reason to believe that scientific opinion in theUnited States was by no means unanimous on the need to resumetesting; and there was still a possibility that the President might decide in the event not to do so. If therefore the United KingdomGovernment now announced that in their view a further series of tests was justified, they would be in some political difficulty if thePresident eventually decided not to resume testing. It would appeareither that the Government had been misinformed by their ownadvisers or that they had been urging the need for tests unnecessarily.(d) There was no doubt that, once it had been agreed to makefacilities at Christmas Island available, the Government would supportwhatever decision the United States Government might eventuallyreach about the resumption of tests. The President could be givenspecific private assurances to this effect. Could he not be asked, onthe basis of these, to say publicly that the resumption of tests wouldbe a matter for joint decision between the two Governments? Theterms of telegram No. 135, however, could be read as implying thatit was precisely this kind of public commitment that the president was anxious to avoid. There was also a danger that any privateunderstanding with the President would become public knowledge.(e) It might be possible to say in any announcement that inpresent circumstances a decision to resume testing would be justifiedfor purely military reasons, with the implication that further developments either in the scientific or in the political sphere mightalter the position. If in the event the United States government decided to test, it could be argued that there had been no change inthe scientific or political background, and therefore no need for afurther formal decision.   It could be emphasised that consultation
at the scientific and at the political level had been continuous. If,on the other hand, the United States Government decided not to test, it could be argued that new factors had made the earlier decisioninvalid. A decision not to test would in any case be unlikely to cause political difficulty.After further discussion the Cabinet agreed that the best coursewould be to suggest to the President that the announcement shoulddeclare it to be the present view of both Governments that theexisting state of nuclear development, in which the recent massiveSoviet tests were an important factor, would justify the West inmaking such further series of nuclear tests as might be necessaryfor purely military reasons. The United States and United kingdom governments had therefore decided that preparations should be madein various places and that as part of these the United KingdomGovernment had made available to the United States Governmentthe facilities at Christmas Island.The Cabinet agreed that there would be no objection to accepting the Presidents suggestion that the second paragraph of the draft announcement should be omitted and took note that the finalwording of the third paragraph would have to be decided when further progress had been made towards agreement on the details of the newinitiatives on disarmament.The Cabinet -Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange, in thelight of their discussion, for the transmission of a further message to President Kennedy through H. M. ambassador in Washington.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,18th January, 1962.
