congo republic(previous reference :CC. (62) 73rdConclusions,Minute 2)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C. (62) 204) about recent developments in the congo and the possible courses of action now open to theGovernment and a memorandum by the President of the Board ofTrade (C. (62) 205) on the practical implications of an internationalembargo on purchases of Katangan copper.The Foreign Secretary said that the two main issues in dispute between the Prime Minister of the Central Government, Mr. Adoula,and the Prime Minister of Katanga, Mr. Tshombe, were the divisionof revenues between the Central Government and Katanga and theConstitution. He had in his memorandum suggested that theGovernment might usefully take the initiative in pressing formediation on both issues; by the International Monetary Fund forthe division of the revenues and by some independent and respectedAfrican statesman, perhaps the Prime Minister of Nigeria, for theConstitution. He had also set out the implications of various other possible developments; in particular the imposition of sanctions onKatangan copper either by an embargo or by physical interruption of supply and the withdrawal of the United Nations from the Congoaltogether. There had, however, been fresh developments over theweek-end. It had earlier been proposed that Mr. Adoula should come to the United Nations Headquarters in New York to discussa possible settlement which Mr. Tshombe would subsequently havebeen told to accept. Mr. Adoula had, however, refused the invitation. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, U Thant,had proposed over the week-end to invite the United KingdomGovernment, and also the Governments of Belgium, Portugal andSouth Africa to co-operate in imposing physical restrictions on theexport of Katangan copper through Northern Rhodesia or throughAngola. He had with difficulty been persuaded not to send such aletter at the present time, but might well do so before long. A furtherletter asking all member countries of the United Nations to stopbuying Katangan copper was also in prospect. Finally, the PrimeMinister of Belgium, M. Spaak, in the light both of Mr. Adoula&apos;refusal to come to New York and of the evidently increasingdetermination of U Thant to proceed with the imposition of sanctions on Katanga, had despatched an emissary to the Congo ina final effort to obtain by negotiation an agreement on the divisionof the revenues. He had proposed as the basis of this agreement that 40 per cent of the revenues should be retained by Union Miniereand that the remaining 60 per cent should be divided equally betweenthe Central Government and Katanga. This was by no means an unreasonable division and there was a chance that it might beaccepted.The Prime Minister said that the situation in the Congo might develop rapidly during the period of the Christmas recess when for practical reasons it would be difficult to arrange for further meetingsof the Cabinet. It would be helpful to himself and to the foreign secretary to consider at their present meeting the attitude whichshould be taken to the major issues which might come up for early decision.It appeared to him that three such issues could be identified withsome confidence; first, a formal request to the Government to join inblocking exports of copper from Katanga by such physical meansas might be available to them or over which they might have control:secondly, a request to support an international embargo on purchases of Katangan copper; thirdly, a resolution which might be brought before the Security Council calling for the adoption of strongermeasures bv the United Nations.
In discussion the following points were made:(a) A request to block Katangan exports by physical meanswould raise both legal and practical difficulties. The first legaldifficulty was a serious doubt whether the United Nations authorities were entitled to make such a request within the terms of the existingresolutions covering their intervention in the Congo. U Thantmaintained that the prevention of Katangan exports amounted to no more than giving the Central Government support in seeing thattheir own laws were respected; but even this was bound to raisedoubts, since it would involve the United Nations in physicalmeasures directed to the support of a central government against arecalcitrant province; in other words interference in a matter ofinternal jurisdiction. This could not be justified either by the termsof the United Nations Charter or by the terms of the resolutionscovering operations in the Congo. The second legal difficulty wasthat the Government had no power to control the actions of theFederal Government of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in questions oftransport, and the only way of preventing the export of Katangancopper through Rhodesia would be by blocking the road and railroutes. The practical difficulties were equally serious. Not onlywas it unlikely that the Portuguese Government would co-operate with blockade measures of this kind, but many Katangan exports were less bulky than copper and could be smuggled out withoutgreat difficulty. On balance, and in spite of the danger that if theUnited Nations intervention in the Congo ended in failure some part at least of the blame might be laid at our door, the general view of the Cabinet was that a request to the Government toco-operate in blocking Katangan exports by physical means shouldbe rejected.(b) A request to stop buying Katangan copper should also be rejected. The Government were in principle opposed to sanctionsbecause of the danger that they might lead to further outbreaks of fighting, because of doubts about their legal justification and becauseof the political objections which would be raised against them in thiscountry. The proper course seemed to be that suggested by theForeign Secretary, namely to maintain United Kingdom purchases of Katangan copper at the average level of the last few years. Thereshould be no attempt to take advantage of the situation in order tostrengthen the international position of the London copper market.The maintainence of our purchases at their present level would have little practical effect on the situation either way, since they amountedto an insignificant proportion of Katanga&apos;s total production.(c) It was difficult to decide what attitude the Government shouldtake if the Security Council were asked to approve a resolutionauthorising stronger measures by the United Nations until the termsof such a resolution were known and could be studied in detail. Infavour of abstaining when the resolution was put to the vote, it couldbe argued that this would better serve our interests than a veto,since it would make clear our dislike for measures of coercion but would not have the effect of transferring the debate to the general assembly. It was likely that a resolution authorising strongermeasures against Katanga would command a larger majority in theGeneral Assembly than in the Security Council. In favour of have to it could be argued that it would set the Governments viewbeyond any possible doubt, particularly to public opinion in thiscountry, that it would have the political merit of demonstrating thatthe Government had the courage of their convictions, and that itmight make it easier for them to resist requests to give further financial support to future United Nations operations in the Congo.The Government were already being pressed for such contributions:and in existing circumstances, and more particularly in the light ofthe recent judgment of the International Court on the subject theymight have considerable difficulty in resisting them.   It should not
be forgotten in this context that the United Nations might at some later stage seek to impose sanctions on Southern Rhodesia and SouthAfrica; and this was an added reason for taking the strongest possibleline against the imposition of sanctions on Katanga.In further discussion it was noted that the effects of a united nations withdrawal from the Congo could not be accurately assessedin advance. It was possible that the Soviet Government might move into the vacuum thus created, and it could not be doubted that thesuccessful establishment of a government of the Congo aligned withthe Soviet bloc could have grave and far-reaching consequences inother parts of Africa. But, if such a development were to take placewhile Katanga still maintained its independence, it would not be easy for the Soviet Government to establish an effectiveadministration. The Congo was about the size of Europe andKatanga itself about the size of Spain; in seeking to administersuch a territory and perhaps to subdue Katanga by force the SovietGovernment would be taking on a formidable economic and militaryburden and might not be prepared or able to do so. It was, however,equally possible that even if the United Nations succeeded inintegrating Katanga with the rest of the Congo Mr. Adoula might stillfall from power and might be replaced by other leaders, for example the former head of the Stanleyville Government, Mr. Gizenga, whowere more under Soviet influence. In this event, the opportunitiesopen to the Soviet Government would be considerably greater. Itcould indeed be argued on this basis that Mr. Tshombe himselfshould be pressing for the retention of a United Nations presence inthe Congo both as a guarantee against extreme measures by a Soviet-dominated central government and as some protection against theeffects of a relapse into chaos in the rest of the Congo. The foreign secretary had indeed made use of this argument in a recent message to Mr. Tshombe urging him to accept a division of the revenues onthe basis now proposed by M. Spaak. At some stage it might benecessary to give thought to the suggestion that, as an alternative toa total United Nations withdrawal, and in default of an agreement ona recourse to arbitration on the lines which the Government hadalready suggested, the United Nations operations in the Congo should concentrate exclusively on economic development and support. Solong as the United Nations was physically present in the Congo itwas unlikely that the Soviet Government would attempt military intervention on any significant scale.Summing up the Prime Minister said that it should not be forgotten that the Government had originally supported united nations intervention in the Congo in order to prevent Sovietdomination of the country; to that extent they must share some ofthe responsibility for subsequent developments. The cabinets discussion had shown clearly the difficulties which would be involvedin associating the Government in any way with United Nations actiondesigned to coerce the Government of Katanga. But here again itshould be remembered that the Government had prevented thesecession of Buganda from the rest of Uganda; the circumstance were not identical but the points of difference might not be generallyappreciated. Nevertheless, on balance it would clearly be right forthe Government to refuse to participate actively in an internationalembargo on purchases of Katangan copper or in physical measures designed to the same end. Their attitude should not, however, be wholly negative; they should continue to press for a settlement by negotiation, to keep alive the idea of arbitration which had much to commend it and had not as yet been given a fair hearing, and to reserve their attitude to any further resolution which might bebrought before the Security Council.
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Government should reject any request whichmight be made to them to participate in measures designed to prevent by physical means the passage of exports from Katanga.(2) Agreed that in the event of a request to place an embargo on purchases of Katangan copper the Government should maintain purchases in this country at the average levelof the last few years.(3) Took note that, if a resolution calling for stronger measures against Katanga were submitted to the Security Councilof the United Nations in the near future, the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary would frame theinstructions to the United Kingdom Representative on theSecurity Council after study of the terms of the resolution and in the light of the points made in the Cabinet&apos;discussion.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster-General (C. (62) 190) explaining how the net assets ofthe Post Office had been assessed and containing revised proposalsfor increased tariffs.The Prime Minister recalled that in their previous discussion theCabinet had attached importance to the calculations underlying thefinancial target to be aimed at by the Post Office. Annex A toC. (62) 190 showed that at the end of the last financial year thecapital employed was  1,028 million, of which  197 million wasfinanced from internal sources and  831 million from Exchequerborrowing. The fixed assets amounted to  950 million and thefigure of net assets, on which the return was calculated, was thevalue of the fixed assets, less historical depreciation; the return wasthe percentage profit, before interest on capital and beforesupplementary depreciation. On this basis of calculation the returnappeared likely to average a little over 7 per cent over the past few years and the next two years. The main point for the Cabinetto consider was whether, bearing in mind the improvement whichwas to be expected in the level of Post Office business and theimportance of keeping down borrowings from the Exchequer, itwould be desirable to increase Post Office charges, either now or inthe near future.In discussion the following points were raised:(a) In view of the substantial increases in estimates which seemed likely for the coming financial year, it was particularly important that the affairs of the nationalised industries should be so conductedthat their demands on the Exchequer were kept to a minimum. Thesuccess of the electricity industry in financing a good proportion ofits investment from internal resources would be a material help,but any sign of willingness on the part of the Government to acquiesce in reduced returns from the Post Office (which was the onenationalised industry under the direct control of a Minister) wouldbe ill-received by the others, particularly by the electricity industry itself.(b) It could be argued that as any increases in Post Office charges would be unpopular, however selectively they might be applied,there would be advantage in making the increases as substantial asthe situation required. On the other hand, the revised proposals setout in Annex B to C. (62) 190 were much less objectionable than theoriginal proposals, which would have imposed substantial increased charges for local telephone calls and for small parcels. These revised
o (Jproposals would increase Post Office borrowings from the exchequer by about  8 million in the following year, but it would be reasonable,in view of the difficulty of estimating the effect for the Post Officeof an improved level of business activity, to adopt them in substancewithout reducing the capital investment programme of the PostOffice.(c) Although the public might be expecting some early increasein Post Office charges, it would be inappropriate to announceincreases at this time of year. The occasion for deciding for or against increases at this stage arose because of the need to settle the investment programme, but it was not strictly necessary to giveimmediate effect to any changes which might be decided upon. Itwould be preferable to make such changes at or about the time ofthe Budget, when it should be possible to avoid laying stress on investment considerations and to present the increases which were small in relation to the annual income of the Post Office as being required by normal commercial practice. There was some risk that increases made at the time of the Budget would be regarded as a form of taxation, but this risk could be minimised by making theannouncement shortly before the Budget statement, or when theEstimates were presented.(ft) Deferment of any announcement would enable furtherconsideration to be given to the details of the increases proposed.It was noted that a substantial part of the increased revenue to beraised was attributable to the proposal to alter the basic time forSubscriber Trunk Dialling (S.T.D.) local calls from three to sixminutes and that, under the revised proposals, non-S.T.D. trunkcalls would produce  2-2 million more than under the original proposals. Further consideration should, in particular, be given tothe proposal (which would be the subject of consultation with other commonwealth Governments) to treble the Commonwealth PennyPress Rate, and to the possibility that other telegram charges couldbe adjusted to allow the first few words of a message to be sent at theexisting rate.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that an increase in Post Office tariffs to bring in atleast  15 million more revenue in a full year should be announced in the context of the next Budget.(2) Agreed that the announcement to be made at that stageshould present the increased charges as required in thenormal course of Post Office business and should not be related to the Governments policy on capital investment and return.(3) Invited the Postmaster-General, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to consider further in thelight of the Cabinets discussion the precise means bywhich the increased revenue should be secured.Road TrafficSpeed Limits(previous reference:CC. (59) 64thConclusions,Minute 6)3. The Minister of Transport said that in recent years the roadaccident rate at Christmas had been so high, particularly onunrestricted roads, that he was already under pressure to include theimposition of a general speed limit in the safety campaign he proposed to launch this Christmas. After examining the result ofan experiment in Sweden and consulting a number of public bodies,including the British Medical Association, the Royal Society forPrevention of Accidents and the Associations of Local Authorities,he had come to the conclusion that it would be.appropriate, to impose a 50 m.p.h. limit during the hours of darkness for a few days before
and after Christmas on all roads (except motorways) which were notat present subject to speed limits. This proposal, to which effect could be given by an Order under Section 13 of the Road Traffic Act,1962, had been considered by the Home Affairs Committee but hadnot been authorised, partly because of the difficulty of enforcing atemporary limit. Subsequent discussions, including further discussions with the Road Research Laboratory and Chief Officers ofPolice, had convinced him both of the importance of checkingaccidents due to speeding and of the determination of the police to do their best to meet the admitted difficulties of enforcement.Imposition of a speed limit would be fully supported by a wide range of influential organisations and he believed that theGovernment would be open to severe criticism if they were not seen to be doing everything possible to reduce road accidents at christmas.In discussion the following points were raised:(a) Those Ministers who had felt that no temporary speed limit should be imposed had been influenced by the thought that most ofthe accidents at Christmas probably occurred on roads in urban areas to which a lower speed limit already applied. The proposedtemporary limit would cause irritation to drivers on deserted countryroads; it could be promulgated only through public announcementsand not by alteration of signs, and the difficulties of enforcementwould increase the contempt with which existing speed limits were treated. This would bring the law into further disrepute and it couldbe argued that more lives would be saved by firm enforcement ofthe existing restrictions than by adding a new one.(b) Statistics showed that while the Christmas accident rate forpedestrians was high in urban areas, accidents to the occupants of cars were much more common on unrestricted roads. Thissuggested that speed was a serious contributory factor in animportant category of accidents.(c) In Scotland the number of accidents at Christmas was smalland it would be difficult on present evidence to justify imposition ofa limit: if one were imposed it would have to be extended to cover the first day or two of January. A time might come, however, whenaction would be required and it would then be valuable to have theresults of an experimental limit over the Christmas period in Englandand Wales.(d) The police could not be expected to promise more thanthat they would do their best to enforce the proposed limit. Thereshould be no suggestion that in practice they would do less thanthat or that imposition of the limit would be treated as a form ofpsychological exercise. The limit should be presented as a desirableexperimental measure which would be firmly enforced.Summing up the Prime Minister said that the general view of theCabinet was that no great harm would be done if the experimentwere not successful while much good would result if it succeeded.There was widespread concern about accidents at Christmas, and failure on the part of the Government to carry out the experimentmight lead to damaging criticism. On balance, and notwithstanding the difficulties which had been mentioned, it would be desirable thatthe experiment should be authorised.The Cabinet-Approved the proposal of the Minister of Transport for atemporary speed limit during the Christmas period.
