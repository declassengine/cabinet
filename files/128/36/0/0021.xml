Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference :C.C. (62) 17thConclusions,Minute 5)The Cabinet Took note with approval of the Prime Ministers statement on the redistribution of Ministerial responsibility forrelations with the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and its constituent Territories.Valuationfor Rating(previous reference :C.C. (62) 20thConclusions,Minute 5)2. The Prime Minister said that since the Cabinefs meeting on 8th March he had discussed with the Ministers immediately concerned the possibility of providing special relief for householders in certain areas when new valuations for rating were introduced in 1963. Hehad come to the conclusion that in all the circumstances the balanceof advantage lay against this course. Even in areas where the average increase in valuation might be comparatively low certain householderswould still be carrying a substantially increased burden. The limited measure of de-rating proposed would provide them with no relief andwould create a feeling of injustice. Secondly, the effect of de-ratingin the seaside towns, particularly Bournemouth and Blackpool, wouldPreviously recorded in a Confidential Annex.*1. The Prime Minister said that he had been reviewing, inconsultation with the Ministers concerned, the distribution of ministerial responsibility for the Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland and its constituent Territories. It had been recognised for some time that the existing division of responsibility, between theCommonwealth Secretary and the Colonial Secretary, had enhancedthe intrinsic difficulties of the problems of the Federation and had placed a serious strain on the working of the Cabinet system.Constitutional development in the Rhodesias and Nyasaland had nowbeen carried to a stage at which the affairs of the Federation and its constituent Territories could appropriately be brought under thecontrol of a single Minister. In agreement with the other ministers concerned, the Home Secretary had undertaken to assume this task.Accordingly, from 19th March, the responsibilities of theCommonwealth Secretary for the Federation and Southern Rhodesia,and those of the Colonial Secretary for Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland, would be transferred to the Home Secretary. The staffsdealing with these matters in the Commonwealth Relations Office andthe Colonial Office would be brought together in a single unit reportingto the Home Secretary through a senior official specially appointed for that purpose. An announcement to this effect would be made inParliament on 15th March.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would be grateful to theHome Secretary for undertaking this difficult task at a critical stage in the development of the Federation. He was doing so with thegood will of the two Secretaries of State who had hitherto shared this burden between them. He could count on their support and on thatof the Cabinet as a whole.The Commonwealth Secretary and the Colonial Secretaryexpressed their agreement with the reorganisation proposed by thePrime Minister.The Home Secretary said that he would assume this newresponsibility as a public duty, with a keen sense of the difficulty ofthe problems which faced the Federation and its constituentTerritories. He would need the assistance and support of his cabinet colleagues in dealing with those problems; and it would be his intention to keep them fully informed of the situation as it developed.
EconomicSituation(previous reference :C.C. (62) 8thConclusions,Minute 3)BuildingLicensing3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (62) 47) setting out the arguments for and against reintroducing building licensing.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Governmentscontrol over public investment was imperfect because decisions in thepublic sector could be frustrated by lack of control over investment in the private sector, which accounted for three-fifths of all newconstructional work. It could be argued that Government controlover building in the private sector would strengthen the country&apos;sdefences against inflation. It could also be argued that a controlover building starts would limit the waste of resources due tolengthening periods of construction. On the other hand, there was evidence of improving efficiency in the building industry and thevolume of new orders was declining. This would therefore be a badtime to reintroduce licensing, which would have a depressing effecton the industry. Direct controls, moreover, would be both difficult and expensive to administer. The better policy would be to seek byall possible means to improve the efficiency and expand the capacityof the construction industries. The general view taken in preliminary discussion in the Economic Policy Committee had been that thebalance of argument was against the reintroduction of licensing.In discussion the following points were made:(a) Building licensing had been suggested as a means of relievingoverload on the industry which had seemed likely, because of high prices and long periods of construction, to inhibit the Governmentsslum clearance policies, particularly in the Midlands and North. Butrecent investigations had shown that the industry was not overloaded,save possibly in a few areas; and as it now seemed possible to makea start with a programme of slum clearance it would not be right tofound a case for licensing on the requirements of local authority housing.(b) There was a special local problem connected with office building in city centres. This had been considered in a preliminaryway by the Home Affairs Committee and had been remitted to theEconomic Policy Committee, who would examine proposals fordealing with it.(c) There were also regional problems arising from the heavyconcentration of employment in certain parts of the country,particularly the South-East, where overloading of the buildingindustry was most evident. In Scotland, on the other hand, muchmore employment was required, as had been shown in the Report ofthe Committee of Enquiry into the Scottish Economy under theChairmanship of Mr. J. N. Toothill. The study by officials of these problems of employment distribution should be pressed forward. Ifmeasures could be devised to spread the load more evenly, the economy of the country as a whole would benefit.(d) The building industry had recently established a council which it was hoped would co-operate effectively with the Buildingbe to increase the burden carried by hotels and boarding houses; and,as they were already suffering from a depression in trade they would raise strong objection to the imposition of this extra rate burden.Thirdly, these were areas in which the level of rates was well below thenational average.The Cabinet Agreed that no counties or county boroughs should bede-rated when the new valuations for rating were broughtinto force in 1963.
Works of Art 4.   The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that during the previousLeonardo month the President of the Royal Academy had informed the PrimeCartoon Minister that, in order to ensure their financial independence, theAcademy had decided to sell the Leonardo da Vinci cartoon for hispicture of The Virgin and Child with St. John the Baptist and SaintAnne. Before offering it for public aution the Academy had thoughtit right to give the Government the opportunity of buying it at a figure which might be less than the price which it would realise atauction. The Prime Minister had replied that the Government werenot prepared to buy the picture. The Academy had now announced their intention to sell it at auction, and public pressure was building up for some action to acquire it for the nation so as to prevent it from passing into foreign hands. Dr. B. Stross, M.P., andSir Hamilton Kerr, M.P.. would be seeing the Chancellor of theExchequer that afternoon and Questions about the attitude of theGovernment had been put down for answer by Treasury ministers on 22nd March.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that the Government should not at this stage indicate anyreadiness to subscribe any substantial sum of money towards thepurchase of this picture. Nor should they give any officialencouragement for the establishment of a public fund towards itspurchase. If such a fund were started by private initiative, and if asubstantial proportion of the probable purchase price were raised bythat means, the Government might have to consider at a later stagewhether some Exchequer contribution would be justified. Meanwhile,C.C. 21 (62)Research Station and other agencies interested in improving theefficiency of the industry. The Report of the Committee on theConstruction Industries under the Chairmanship of Sir HaroldEmmerson, which had recently been received, would provide a basis for technical discussions and the industry might be brought to acceptmeasures, including reduction in the period of apprenticeship, for increasing the supply of skilled labour. One point for consideration would be whether competition between major constructional projectscould be limited by regional or local co-ordination. standardisation of designs and constructional techniques would also contribute towards efficiency.(e) Monetary measures were not the best instruments for dealingwith problems which were local and regional in character. Moreselective instruments of policy were required for these purposes. TheGovernment should therefore consider the possibilities of selectivecontrols both for building and for imports. A more positive policy on monopolies and restrictive practices was also needed. A difficultbalance had to be maintained between individual freedom and theoperation of market forces on one hand and over-reliance on Stateintervention on the other. But it was possible that the time had now come to ensure closer control by the State of activities which mightdamage the efficient working of the economy.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that it would be inappropriate to reintroduce buildinglicensing for the time being.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider, in thelight of their discussion, how far control over the economycould be improved by instruments which would be selectivein their effect and could be applied to particular industries or particular areas.
germany berlin(previous reference :C.C. (62) 17thConclusions,Minute 1)The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Germany(previous reference :C.C. (62) 17thConclusions,Minute 1)Support Costs6. The Chief Secretary, Treasury, informed the Cabinet of thepresent state of the negotiations with the Federal Government ofGermany for relief from the foreign exchange cost of maintainingBritish forces in Germany. The cost at present amounted to 73 million a year in foreign exchange. At the opening of negotiations the Federal Government had been thinking in terms of providing halfthis amount, largely by way of increased arms purchases, but it hadbeen made clear to them that so low an offer would be unacceptable.As compared with our original request for relief amounting to the equivalent of  63 million a year, it had now been suggested to theFederal Government that a contribution of the equivalent of  55million a year for two years or more might be acceptable.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that he had been informedthat the Federal Government were prepared to make a serious effort to reach this figure. It would not be easy for them because of theextent to which they had already committed themselves to the purchaseof United States equipment, but he had been impressed during had discussions by the anxiety of the Federal Ministers concerned to reach an acceptable settlement. Assuming that their efforts were succesful and that the German contribution, largely in terms of arms purchases,reached a figure of  55 million a year for a period of at least two years,the next step would be to report the outcome of the negotiations tothe North Atlantic Council. He asked for the authority of the Cabinetto accept a German offer of the equivalent in foreign exchange of 55 million (DM.600 million) a year for a minimum period of two years as constituting a reasonable contribution to our foreign exchangeproblem.In discussion it was pointed out that the true value of such an offer would be less than  55 million, since the equipment to be purchased contained elements which had involved expenditure offoreign exchange in the first instance: only the conversion value of the equipment could be reckoned as a direct contribution to our foreignhowever, it would be preferable to leave an interval for the expression of public opinion on the means by which the picture could best be acquired for the nation.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that Ministers should for the present refrain fromexpressing any view on the means by which the Leonardocartoon might best be acquired for the nation.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a later meeting.5. The Lord Privy Seed said that the Russians had resumed theirattempts to interfere with Western use of the air corridors into west berlin. They were dropping metal strips, with a view to obstructingthe use of radio and radar; and they had given notice that Sovietaircraft would operate in the corridors between 7,000 and 10,000 ft.General Norstad had in these circumstances been given authority toarrange for limited use of the corridors by Western aircraft at heightsabove 10,000 ft.In discussion it was noted that, in spite of provocation from theUnited States authorities in Berlin, General Norstad was showingcommendable restraint in handling this situation.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th March, 1962.exchange problem. It would also be right to re-emphasise in any discussion of the German offer the fact that we were paying inGermany, not only for our own troops, but for the large numbers ofGerman civilians employed in their administrative support.The Cabinet Authorised the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to accept relief bythe Federal Government of Germany amounting to  55million (DM.600 million) a year for a minimum period oftwo years as constituting a reasonable contribution to theforeign exchange cost of maintaining British forces inGermany.
