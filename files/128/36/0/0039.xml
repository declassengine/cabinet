*2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the economicsituation was now such as to justify some relaxation of creditrestrictions. He had decided to reduce the amount of the specialdeposits which the Clearing Banks were required to place with theBank of England. This had been raised to 3 per cent, in July 1961:he had decided that it should now be reduced to 2 per cent. Anannouncement to this effect would be made that day. The Bankswould be advised that, in advancing money, they should continueto give priority to exports; that advances for speculative purposes should continue to be subject to restraint; and that special care should be taken over loans for building and property development in areas where there was heavy pressure on labour and other resources.Hire Purchase The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was also satisfied,after consultation with the President of the Board of Trade, thatsome easement could now be made in the restrictions on hire purchase. He proposed that, for a range of durable consumer goods(excluding motor cars) the minimum deposit on a hire-purchasecontract should be reduced from 20 per cent, to 10 per cent. Themaximum period for completing payment would continue to be three years.In discussion the point was made that frequent changes in the hire-purchase regulations were a serious inconvenience to traders,and it would be important to avoid giving the impression that this change was designed to meet a temporary situation. TheChancellor of the Exchequer said that he regarded this as apermanent adjustment, which would stand unless conditionsdeteriorated to an extent requiring a number of restrictive measures.In further discussion it was agreed that this change in the hire-purchase regulations should be announced on 4th June.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the 1 per cent, release of special depositswhich was to be made that day.(2) Agreed that the restrictions on hire-purchase contracts should be adjusted, on the lines indicated by theChancellor of the Exchequer, with effect from 4th June.EconomicSituation(previous reference:C.C. (62) 30thConclusions,Minute 2)SpecialDepositsNationalSocialistMovementRally inTrafalgarSquare(previous reference:C.C. (62) 35thConclusions,Minute 7)3. The Lord Chancellor said that in pursuance of the cabinets decision of 24th May he had considered, in consultation with theHome Secretary and the Minister of Works, whether the meeting which the National Socialist Movement were proposing to hold inTrafalgar Square on 1st July was likely to lead to a breach of thepeace. He had concluded that, while some scuffles might beexpected, it was unlikely that there would be a breach of the peace on such a scale as to constitute a threat to public order. It wouldnot therefore be justifiable to withdraw the permission already givento hold the meeting unless it were decided as a matter of policy to suppress the public expression of anti-Semitism. Such a policy,if adopted, would have to be applied on a national basis and mightbe thought to require legislative authority.   But Parliament hadm SECRET 3C.C. 39 (62)Parliament 1,   xhe Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
expressly rejected a clause proposed for inclusion in the public order Act, 1936, which would have prohibited &quot; the making ofspeeches calculated to excite racial or religious prejudice&quot;. the attorney-General had also advised that there was insufficientevidence to justify an application to the courts for an order bindingover the sponsors of the meeting to keep the peace.In discussion it was noted that, in 1956 and again in 1961, the leader of this Movement had been convicted of using insulting wordsand behaviour. On the other hand, on four earlier occasions whenthe Movement had held meetings in Trafalgar Square no violencehad resulted.There was general agreement in the Cabinet that the best coursewould be to allow this meeting to take place and to encourage thosewho had made representations for the withdrawal of permission to treat the Movement with contempt and refrain from organising any counter-demonstrations.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the permission given for the meeting of theNational Socialist Movement in Trafalgar Square on1st July should not be withdrawn.(2) Invited the Minister of Works, in consultation with the attorney-General, to suggest to those who had soughtor might seek withdrawal of the permission that theappropriate course would be to take no notice of thismeeting and to refrain from organising any counter-demonstrations.Burma(previous reference:C.C. (53) 51stConclusions,Minute 3)War DamageClaims4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C. (62) 91) on certain legal proceedings which were being brought against the Crown for compensation for war damage in burma.The Lord Chancellor said that he had been asked by the PrimeMinister to bring to the notice of the Cabinet claims against theCrown which were being pursued in the Scottish courts by theBurmah Oil Company and other firms. These claims were for compensation for war damage done to the companies&apos; propertyunder the scorched earth policy pursued in Burma in 1942. A totalof nearly  40 million plus interest was involved and, if other companies took similar proceedings and were successful, the cost tothe Exchequer could exceed  100 million. The claims, which wouldbe heard by the Court of Session about mid-July, were being resistedon legal grounds which were believed to be sound, but it could notbe certainly assumed that judgment would be given for the Crown.The Home Affairs Committee had taken the view that the claims were without merit; that it would be intolerable if the exchequer had to meet them; and that, if the courts were to decide against theCrown, it would be right to introduce legislation to set aside thedecision. The Committee had therefore concluded that there wouldbe advantage in warning the companies of the governments intentions before they incurred further heavy expenditure onlitigation. This course might expose the Government to criticismunnecessarily (since the courts might reject the claims) and it wouldinvolve interference with a case actually pending before the courts,but if the companies proceeded with their claims despite a warningthe Government would be in a stronger position to introduce legislation. If, as a result of the warning, the claims were abandoned, no legislation would be required. A draft letter whichhad been prepared for the purpose of warning the claimants would leave the companies in no doubt that the Government were confident that the claims would be rejected by *he courts.
South-East 5.   The Foreign Secretary said that Pathet Lao forces had nowAsia Treaty overrun a large area of northern Laos and at some points hadOrganisation reached positions near the Mekong River. This advance was aLaos serious threat to the security of Thailand.   It might also encourage(Previous        General Phoumi to stand out against the pressures which were reference:       being applied to him to join in the formation of a nationalC.C. (62) 35th government.   Little time was now left for the formation of such a conclusions,    government; for Prince Souvanna Phouma was returning to ParisMinute 5)       on i4tn june and, unless agreement on a national government hadbeen reached by then, he might well be unwilling to return to Laos.The United States Government were therefore increasing theirpressures on the Laotian Princes with a view to inducing them toreach agreement before Prince Souvanna Phouma left the country.If this last attempt to secure agreement was successful, there was afair chance that the position in Laos might be stabilised for several years.   If it failed, the Western Powers would face the alternativesof working for a partition of Laos or undertaking military operationsacross the Mekong River.The Foreign Secretary said that some statement on Laos mighthave to be made in Parliament before the Whitsun recess. He would however refer the matter to the Cabinet again before any such statement was made.C.C. 39 (62)In discussion there was general agreement with the conclusions reached by the Home Affairs Committee. It was true that issue ofa warning of this kind could be criticised as an intimation that theGovernment would alter the law in defiance of a decision of thecourts; and, as the claims appeared to have so little merit, therewas something to be said for leaving the proceedings to take their course. On the other hand, if judgment went against the Crownit would be difficult to defend payment to a few firms of the large sums which would be involved. As a judgment by the Court of session against the Crown might, whatever the outcome on appeal,create a vested right to damages, it would be desirable that warning should be given as soon as possible.In further discussion the following points were raised:(a) In 1948 the Treasury had distributed ex gratia  10 millionamong British-Burma companies, but this payment had been madenot by way of compensation but in the interests of the national economy as a means of enabling British concerns to rehabilitatetheir pre-war businesses.(b) If, as a result of the warning, the claims were withdrawn,there could be a case for making an ex gratia payment towards thelegal costs already incurred by the companies.(c) Careful consideration should be given to the terms of theletter to be sent to the companies and to the arrangements forissuing it. It would be inappropriate that it should be sent by theLord Advocate.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Burmah Oil Company and other companies should be informed that, if they proceeded with their war damage claims and were successful in thecourts, legislation would be introduced to nullify theeffect of the judgment.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Attorney-General and the Lord Advocate, to give further consideration to the terms of the warning letter and to the arrangements for issuing it.
Federationof rhodesia and Nyasaland(previous reference:CC. (62) 37thConclusions,Minute 1)6. The Home Secretary made a report to the Cabinet on his recent visit to the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Therewere many difficulties ahead, and it would be a mistake to take anoptimistic view at this early stage; but it was satisfactory that theFederal Government had now come to accept the need for change inthe present organisation of the Federation.Of the three territories he had formed the impression that thesituation in Southern Rhodesia was the most critical. Their budgetwas in deficit, largely because of expenditure on African education.The leader of the main African opposition party was withholdingco-operation because of his belief that the support which he hadalready received at the United Nations would in the end enable himto dictate his own terms. It was by no means certain that thepresent Government would be returned to power at the nextelection; and if they were defeated it was possible that SouthernRhodesia might seek secession from the Federation.In Nyasaland the present Ministers were obsessed with questions of status and independence and had not yet grasped the realities of the economic situation. He had, however, been able to persuade the leader of the Malawi Congress Party, Dr. Banda, toagree that a decision on secession should be deferred until its economic effects had been examined by the special advisers whowould start work in July and would also examine the possibility of continued co-operation between Nyasaland and the other territories of the Federation. Dr. Banda would undoubtedly press for a greaterdegree of self-government and this might not be unwelcome to theEuropean settlers who felt that a self-governing Constitution,including a Bill of Rights and guarantees for the farming community,might give them greater security of tenure than they now had. Theultimate secession of Nyasaland seemed inevitable, and the federal government had accepted that Nyasaland presented special problems which demanded special solutions.In Northern Rhodesia elections under the new Constitutionwere due to be held in October. The result might well be astalemate between the main parties in which case the small liberal party under Sir John Moffatt might find itself holding the balanceof power.There would now be a period of a few months before final decisions about the future of the Federation had to be taken.During this period special advisers would examine and report onthe implications of Nyasaland&apos;s secession, would consider futureforms of association between Northern and Southern Rhodesia andwould also consider the scope and nature of continued co-operationbetween Nyasaland and the other territories. The Federal PrimeMinister had expressed the hope that any new form of association between the territories would not be wholly confined to economic questions; he was thinking in terms of a federal authority with someresponsibility for political consultation and, if possible, reserved powers in respect of external relations and defence.In discussion it was pointed out that, while there would be advantage in continuing co-operation between the territories on political matters, this might be difficult to achieve in practice. on many issues of foreign policy the African parties would be boundto hold extreme views. There was a real danger that SouthernRhodesia might find itself completely isolated.The Cabinet (1) Took note of this statement by the Home Secretary.(2) Took note that the Home Secretary would arrange for an examination of the economic consequences of nyasaland&apos;s withdrawal from the Federation, of the
Shipping 7   xhe Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister(Previous of Transport (C. (62) 87 and 88) on the future of the CunardReference: Company&apos;s passenger service and on the request by the PacificC.C. (62) 32nd Steam Navigation Company for an operating subsidy for the linerConclusions, Reina del Mar; and a memorandum by the Minister of AviationMinute 7) (C (62) 86) on a proposal for a joint Cunard-B.O.A.C. company to operate air services across the Atlantic.The Minister of Transport said that the Cunard Company hadnot asked for a Government subsidy: they had confined themselvesto asking the Government to take note of their increasingly serious financial position. Their total losses for passenger services for 1962were estimated to amount to  If million of which over  600,000would be accounted for by the operation of the Queen Elizabethand the Queen Mary. The company were still making a smallprofit on their cargo services. The main reasons for the losses onthe passenger services were the steep increase in crew costs, thesubsidised competition of French and American liners, and theincreased competition from airlines since the introduction of thelarge jet aircraft on the Atlantic route. The Pacific Steam NavigationCompany were similarly facing increased competition from jet aircraft, and from subsidised shipping.The Minister of Transport said that he could not recommend the payment of a subsidy in either case. It could be argued that, ifthe &quot; Queens &quot; had to be withdrawn from the Atlantic service andthe Reina del Mar from the South American routes, national prestigewould suffer severely and there would be loss to the balance ofpayments. As against this a subsidy would involve continuingexpenditure on services which were becoming increasingly out of date. It might be right that the Government should give some help to the shipping industry, but this should be done in a broader andmore imaginative way than by the grant of subsidies to services whichcould never hope to pay their way. The purpose of Governmenthelp should be to enable the industry to modernise itself and become more competitive.The Minister of Aviation said that the proposed formation of ajoint company with B.O.A.C. would be unlikely to have any impact on Cunard&apos;s present position, although it might help presentationallyto soften the blow to national prestige which would be involved bythe withdrawal of the &quot; Queens&quot; from the Atlantic route. Thepresent idea of the merger was that B.O.A.C. and Cunard should form a joint company to which Cunard would contribute about25 per cent, of the total assets. The services operated by the jointcompany would be supported by the shore organisation and facilities of both the parent companies. Both parties would be likely to benefit and as neither was in a sound financial position it would beto their advantage to co-operate rather than to compete on the atlantic route. Talks between the two parties were now in progress and, while it would be necessary for the Treasury and the Ministryof Aviation to consider carefully the details of any financial agreement, it was to be hoped that it might be possible to make anearly announcement that a joint company was being planned. Therewas a serious danger of premature leakage if an announcement werelong delayed.C.C. 39 (62)future possible forms of association between northern and Southern Rhodesia and of the possibility ofco-operation both on economic and on other questionsbetween the three territories.
In discussion the following points were made:(a) The arguments against a subsidy to the Cunard company were strong. If the national economy was to enter a period of increased growth it would be essential that Government expenditure should be concentrated on industries with high productivity andgood prospects. Dollar earnings were not enough to justifyGovernment support for enterprises which were manifestly on thedecline. It would be undesirable that the Government should encourage the Cunard Company even indirectly to maintain the&quot; Queens &quot; in service against their better judgment. At the sametime, the progressive withdrawal of British passenger liner services would have a profound effect on public opinion. Apart from the breach with our long seafaring tradition, it would be argued thatthe Government had surrendered the country&apos;s interests tosubsidised foreign liners which would absorb the traffic. TheGovernment ought to frame as rapidly as possible a comprehensive plan for the future of British shipping as a whole; it was onlyagainst such a background that it would be possible to set thepossible withdrawal of the &quot; Queens &quot; in a proper perspective. Anysuch general policy would have to include proposals forreorganisation of ports and docks and for the cargo services,including the construction of new and possibly standardised ships,on which the future of the industry would increasingly depend.(b) No Government announcement need be made about the passenger services of the Cunard Company. The company had notasked for a Government subsidy. They would not themselvesforeshadow the withdrawal of the &quot; Queens &quot; from the Atlanticservice. Speculation would, however, be provoked by the disclosure of their trading losses; and questions would probably beasked about the Governments intentions. The Minister ofTransport should therefore press forward with urgency the study of constructive proposals for the future of the shipping industry as awhole.(c) The details of the proposed Cunard-B.O.A.C. merger would need careful study and it would not be possible to form a final viewof this project until that study has been completed. In themeantime it would be important to avoid any public intimation thatthe proposed merger had the support of the Government.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Minister of Transport should reject theapplication by the Pacific Steam Navigation company for a subsidy for the operation of the passenger linerReina del Mar.(2) Agreed that no subsidy should be granted to the cunard company in respect of their passenger services on theNorth Atlantic route.(3) Invited the Minister of Transport to bring before them assoon as possible comprehensive proposals for the futured development of the British shipping industry as a whole.(4) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and the Minister of aviation to examine the details of the proposed Cunard-B.O.A.C. merger and to ensure that until thatexamination had been completed no public statement should be made by the Companies which implied thattheir proposals had the support of the Government.Cotton 8.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous President of the Board of Trade (C. (62) 90) covering the draft of aS^ei?? e:^, statement on cotton textiles.CC. (59) 50thConclusions, The President of the Board of Trade said that the cottonMinute 5) industry was suffering from a crisis of confidence and was not
making satisfactory progress with re-equipment and modernisationschemes in pursuance of the Cotton Industry Act, 1959. It was desirable that an early announcement should be made on the import of cotton textiles from Hong Kong, India and Pakistan, since theindustry would not feel able to proceed with applications under theAct of 1959 (which had to be submitted by 9th July) unless they knew that duty-free imports from these countries would continueto be kept in check. The industry had pressed for a renewal of thepresent arrangements, which would expire at the end of this year,but on the basis of a reduction in the ceilings permitted. No such reduction was practicable but it was likely, subject to certainoutstanding difficulties with Pakistan over cotton yarn, that anextension on the present basis could be secured for a further threeyears. The industry had also expressed anxieties about importsfrom other parts of the world, including many countries which hadnot previously been regarded as textile exporters. The presentdepressed state of the industry was largely due to inflated demand18 months ago and to the fact that both imports and home production had fallen sharply since then; but the industry feared that when demand revived the benefit would go to other countriesunless special steps were taken to avoid this.In the proposed statement it would be appropriate to announce,in addition to the continuance of the arrangements with Hong Kong,India and Pakistan, a change in the licensing system which wouldinvolve the withdrawal (from all sources except the three Common-wealth countries) of the Open General Licence under which cotton textiles and yarns could be imported freely. This would bereplaced by a system of Open Individual Licences which wouldrequire importers to make monthly returns to the Board of Trade.This would make it possible for the Government to applyrestrictions, if they should be required, more quickly and moreselectively than they could at present. Such a system would not constitute a control on imports and could be defended so long asit did not involve discrimination. It was also proposed that certainexporting or potentially exporting countries should be approachedwith a view to enlisting their co-operation in avoiding the difficult situation which would arise if there were a marked rise in their exports to this country.In discussion there was general agreement with the action proposed.  The following points were raised:(a) Although it would be desirable to emphasise in theproposed statement the need for action by the industry itself, itwould be better to omit the last two sentences of the draft statement annexed to C. (62) 90.(b) The proposed change in the licensing system might leadother countries to expect protective measures to be taken against their exports. It was not, however, necessary to say in the statement that new restrictions would not be imposed or that international obligations would be maintained. It was unlikely in practice thatthere would be any need to adopt a quota system, but the possibilityhad to be kept in mind.(c) It seemed unlikely that the proposed statement would have any adverse effect on the negotiations in Brussels for entry to theEuropean Common Market, but the Lord Privy Seal should have theopportunity of considering this point.The Cabinet (1) Subject to the deletion of the last two sentences, approved the draft statement on cotton textiles annexed toC. (62) 90.
(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to consult theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster about the date onwhich this statement should be made in Parliament.(3) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to consult theLord Privy Seal about the effect of the proposed statement on the current negotiations with the european economic Community.9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Transport (C. (62) 72) on the facilities for passengers atthe main passenger ports.The Home Secretary said that a number of detailed points inthis memorandum seemed to require further consideration and itwould be convenient if the Minister of Transport could arrange forthese to be examined by Junior Ministers from the Departmentsconcerned.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Transport to arrange for junior ministers from the Home Office, Treasury, scottish office, Board of Trade, Ministry of Aviation and Ministryof Transport to give further detailed consideration to thereport annexed to C. (62) 72.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,31st May, 1962.Tourism(previous reference:C.C. (61) 36thConclusions,Minute 7)
