South-east asia treaty organisation laos(previous reference:C.C. (62) 41stConclusions,Minute 2)1. The Foreign Secretary said that a national Government hadbeen formed in Laos. The Soviet Foreign Minister had agreed thatthe Geneva Conference should now be re-convened with a view to providing an international framework for Laotian neutrality. It wasto be hoped that, when the discussions were resumed, the SovietGovernment would not seek to make it a condition of agreement that Western troops should be withdrawn from Thailand.Cuba(previous reference:C.C. (61) 22ndConclusions,Minute 1)2.   The President of the Board of Trade said that the UnitedStates Government had sought the support of the other members ofthe North Atlantic Alliance for drastic measures to restrict tradewith Cuba.  It had become clear that most members of the Alliancewould accept the continuance of the existing embargo on the supplyof arms to Cuba but in other respects would not be prepared to goas far as the United States Government had originally proposed.The measures which they would be prepared to take had been setout in a report submitted to the North Atlantic Council by theCommittee of Political Advisers. This recommended that member countries should report to the Secretariat the amount of credit and credit guarantees given to Cuba; that member countries should keep their exports to Cuba under review so that the possibility of controlling the movement of strategic goods could be considered;and that, if there were signs that United States goods were beingtrans-shipped to Cuba on a significant scale, means of controllingsuch trans-shipment should be further studied.  The continuance ofthe arms embargo would present no difficulty for the UnitedKingdom Government, but there seemed to be no great value inthe other arrangements proposed and there was a danger that, ifthese were accepted, the Government would appear to be reversingtheir stated policy of not taking economic measures against Cuba.Moreover, acceptance of these arrangements might be used at a later stage as an argument in favour of more active measures such as therestriction of credit, the prohibition or restriction of the export of strategic goods and the prohibition of exports of goods containingUnited States components.   With these considerations in mind, hesuggested that the United Kingdom representative on the north atlantic Council should oppose the adoption of the report of theCommittee of Political Advisers.The Foreign Secretary said that the members of the north atlantic Alliance already reported to the Secretariat the grant ofcredits to countries of the Communist bloc and he saw no greatobjection to extending this system to Cuba. The United StatesGovernment felt strongly about Cuba and, since the measures recommended were not in themselves important, he would prefer that we should not oppose them. He had already informed theUnited States Secretary of State that the United KingdomGovernment were doubtful about the efficacy of a general policy of applying economic sanctions to Communist countries; but he would prefer to pursue that argument as a general problem of policy than to adopt a position on Cuba which would not have the support ofthe other members of the Alliance.Discussion showed that the balance of opinion in the cabinet was in favour of accepting the recommendations now before theNorth Atlantic Council. At the same time the United StatesGovernment should be left in no doubt that in accepting these recommendations on Cuba the United Kingdom Government werenot acquiescing in the view of the United States Administrationabout the undesirability of trading with Communist countries.

Europe(previous reference:C.C. (62) 30thConclusions,Minute 1)*3. The Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet that the nextround of Ministerial discussions on the United Kingdom&apos;application to join the European Economic Community would startin Brussels on 27th June. This would concentrate on four mainsubjects, temperate foodstuffs, the problems of the Asian Common-wealth countries, the association of under-developed or dependentCommonwealth territories with the Common Market, and domesticagriculture.On temperate foodstuffs from the developed countries of theCommonwealth, which was perhaps the most critical problem, littlereal progress had as yet been made, although the pattern of apossible solution was beginning to emerge. It would be unrealistic to expect that Ministers could reach at this next meeting anysubstantial measure of agreement; it would be their object to takeagreement on principles to the stage at which further constructivework could be undertaken by the Committee of Deputies.On India, Pakistan and Ceylon it might now be possible to reach agreement on the steps by which the common external tariff of theCommunity would be extended to textiles, with special arrangementsfor review in the event of serious disruption of trade. It was hoped to negotiate a nil tariff for tea, which would be an important gain.For manufactured goods the arrangements envisaged a gradual reduction of preferences over an agreed period. These provisionsdid not apply to Hong Kong, for which special arrangements wouldhave to be made. Although it was unlikely that any arrangements which might finally be concluded for textiles would meet Indiananxieties in full, further delay would probably make the situationworse; for British textile manufacturers were already urging on theircontinental colleagues the importance of imposing the full external tariff of the Community on imports from Asian countries as soonas we joined it, and pressure from this source would increase.On the association of dependent and under-developedCommonwealth countries little formal progress had been made. the six existing members of the Community had, however, now reached agreement among themselves on the trade and financial arrangements should affirm our belief that measures to restrain trade with Com-munist countries would have the effect of exacerbating relationsbetween East and West and driving the Communist countries tomake themselves more self-sufficient. This opportunity should alsobe taken to urge the United States Government to show, in theapplication of their trade policies, more consideration for legitimateBritish interests.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the United states secretary of State that the United Kingdom Government,while prepared to concur in the recommendations abouttrade with Cuba which were before the North atlantic council, would shortly make general representations tothe United States Administration about trading policies.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister without Portfolio, the Minister of Aviation andthe President of the Board of Trade, to prepare for thePrime Minister&apos;s approval draft messages to the UnitedStates Government on (i) the advantages of continuingtrade with Communist countries and (ii) the effect ofUnited States trade policies on the interests of important industries in the United Kingdom.
CC. 42 (62)to be offered to the existing associated territories after the expiry ofthe present Convention at the end of 1962, although they were stillconsidering institutional arrangements. It might be possible at the ministerial session to reach a broad understanding about the way inwhich association would be extended to Commonwealth countries.It was a hopeful sign that the Six had agreed that existing associatedcountries of the Community should not have the right to veto any arrangements proposed for the association of other territories. Itwas indeed possible that more difficulty would be caused by theattitude of some of the British territories themselves, particularlyGhana, than by the existing members of the Community and theirown associated territories.On domestic agriculture progress had been slow. The Six had now accepted the idea of an annual review and work on this v/ouldnow be accelerated. While they would be unlikely to accept a unilateral right on our part to supplement farmers&apos; incomes in theevent of their relative decline, they would probably agree to some more general form of &quot; residual insurance&quot;. The problems of individual commodities still remained to be dealt with, as did thelength of the transitional period and the use of direct grants.On present indications the negotiations were likely to continueinto August.The Minister of Agriculture said that in respect of agriculturethere were four main difficulties to be faced. The first was the lengthof the transitional period. We had hoped for a period of from10 to 15 years, but the Six were unwilling to concede more than\ years which might in practice amount to no more than 6^ years.Moreover, even in the transitional period it was not clear that weshould have a free hand to make whatever special arrangements might be necessary. Secondly, although the principle of an annual review had been accepted, it was not yet clear that the results of theannual review would be used as the basis of executive action. Inour view the annual review should be used as a guide to levels ofprices and production, as well as for the control of exports. TheCommunity already dealt with cereals and sugar on this basis, but had not accepted it for other important commodities. Thirdly, thequestion of direct grants would give rise to considerable difficulty.These now amounted to about  100 million of the total bill foragricultural subsidies of some  350 million. Fourthly, as the Sixhad not yet settled their own policy for some important products,e.g., milk, it would be impossible for us to enter into negotiation with them on these matters for the time being. Negotiations on milkwould have to be held over at least until November and possiblyuntil later. This meant that the proposals to be put to the Meetingof Commonwealth Prime Ministers in September would beincomplete.In general the Minister of Agriculture said that he believed thatarrangements could be negotiated which would include reasonableassurances for the British farmer. It was, however, unlikely thatthe farming community would see them in this light.The Commonwealth Secretary said that negotiation on theproblems of the Asian countries would reach a critical stage in thenext few days. The fact that the prosperity of these countriesdepended on so narrow a range of exports, particularly textiles, madethem understandably sensitive about the current negotiations. Itwould be important to ensure that the arrangements for reviewing the effect of the application of the common external tariff and for taking remedial action were effective and could be put into operationquickly. It would also be helpful to link any final announcement about the arrangements for textiles with the announcement that anil tariff had been negotiated for tea.
The Colonial Secretary said that, if the problem of Hong Kongcould be solved and if satisfactory arrangements for sugar could bemade, the prospects for the remaining British Colonial territories were encouraging. He was, however, concerned lest in the longer term Commonwealth countries would be aligned with all othercountries outside the Community, with the result that the arrange-ments for trade with the developed countries of the Commonwealthor with British territories which had not achieved associated statuswithin the Community would be no different from those applying tothe United States or Japan. This seemed to him to have important political implications.The Lord Privy Seal said that it was true that the Six were already taking the line that after 1970 the developed countries of theCommonwealth, i.e., those without associate status, should betreated on the same basis as any other third country. It was difficultto contest this in the form in which it had been presented. But he hoped that in the event the Community might recognise three categories of country; those in the Community, whether as fullmembers or associates, those with whom the countries of theCommunity had special relations, and third countries. If such aclassification were accepted it might be possible, even in the longer term, to continue some special arrangements for the Commonwealth.Algeria might be helpful to us in this context, since the French wouldcertainly want to negotiate special arrangements within theCommunity for an independent Algeria.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Lord Privy Seal and ofthe points made in the discussion.Canada 4.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in accordanceEconomic       with the Cabinefs decision of 22nd June, the United Kingdom hadSituation        joined with France, Germany and the United States in arrangements(Previous        for supporting  the Canadian  dollar.    As  part of an interimReference:       arrangement 100 million United States dollars had been contributedC.C. (62) 41st by the United Kingdom to the Bank of Canada.   This advanceConclusions,    would be repayable in three months.   The published figures ofMmute 3)       United Kingdom reserves would not be affected.  Advances had alsobeen made on a longer term basis under the auspices of theInternational Monetary Fund.  The United Kingdom share of these advances ($100 million in sterling) would count towards repayment of the advances obtained from the Fund in July 1961. The canadian authorities were expected to ask that the sterling should be converted into United States dollars; and this would be advantageous in reducing our holding of United States dollars.The emergency measures announced by the canadian government resembled those which had been taken in the UnitedKingdom in 1961, but they would have a greater tendency to restrict the flow of international trade; and since they could not do much to check the out-flow of capital, which was the main cause of theeconomic disequilibrium in Canada, it was doubtful whether theCanadian dollar could yet be regarded as out of danger. There hadnot so far been any pressure for a statement in Parliament aboutthe situation in Canada and there would be no advantage involunteering such a statement.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,26th June, 1962.
