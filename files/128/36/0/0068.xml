Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference:CC. (62) 67thConclusions,Minute 2)Security inthe PublicService(previous reference:CC. (62) 24thConclusions,Minute 1)The VassallCase2. The Prime Minister reminded the Cabinet that, after the conviction of William Vassall for espionage, he had appointed aCommittee of senior officials to establish the facts of the case and,in the light of the full recommendations of the recent Committeeon Security, under the Chairmanship of Lord Radcliffe, to determineamong other things whether there had been any neglect of duty by persons directly or indirectly responsible for vassall&apos;s employment and conduct. In view of recent developments, and in particular ofthe degree to which the personal responsibility of Ministers had been called in question, he had decided to replace the official Committeeof enquiry by an independent tribunal under the Chairmanship ofLord Radcliffe, the other members being Mr. Justice Barry andSir Milner Holland. He would be announcing in Parliament that day the establishment of the tribunal; and the necessary resolutionauthorising its appointment would be moved in both Houses on thefollowing day.In discussion it was suggested that, while it might often be right in future cases of this kind to entrust initial factual enquiries to aCommittee of senior officials, it might also be advisable to considerthe possibility of making some other arrangement, short of theappointment of an independent tribunal, for providing Ministers withadvice on their responsibility in connexion with security in cases in which, for any reason, an enquiry by officials might not be thoughtsufficient.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would give furtherconsideration to the procedure for dealing with casesinvolving breaches or alleged breaches of security in thepublic service.190O-111. The Prime Minister said that at their last meeting the cabinet had authorised the First Secretary of State to make a statement atthe opening of the Nyasaland Conference announcing theGovernment^ agreement in principle to Nyasaland&apos;s withdrawal from the Central African Federation. Since then, however, therehad been two developments which had materially affected thesituation. First, the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, Sir EdgarWhitehead, had strongly urged that any statement should be delayed until after the forthcoming elections in Southern Rhodesia; he hadto this extent reinforced the earlier and more general objections raised by the Federal Prime Minister, Sir Roy Welensky. Secondly,the Leader of the Malawi Congress Party, Dr. Banda, had informed the First Secretary of State that he would not object if a statementannouncing the Government^ agreement in principle to Nyasaland&apos;right to withdraw from the Federation were to be held over untilthe middle of December; Dr. Banda had made clear that in acceptinga delay of this order he expected in return an assurance from theGovernment that a statement to the required effect would be made when the time came and that there would be no further delay. TheFirst Secretary of State, after consulting one or two of his seniorcolleagues, had decided to make no immediate statement aboutNyasaland&apos;s right to withdraw from the Federation, but had assuredDr. Banda that such a statement would be made in the middle ofDecember, shortly before the Christmas recess.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement.
Foreign AffairsYemen(previous reference:C.C. (62) 66thConclusions,Minute 1)3. The Foreign Secretary said that developments in the Yemenwere giving rise to increasing difficulty. Some progress was beingmade by the forces supporting the Imam Badr, but there was as yet no real threat to the position of the republican regime in the maintowns. The republican regime had asked the Soviet Governmentfor assistance and a number of Russian technicians, probably about200, had already arrived in the country. A senior officer of theJordanian Air Force, who was believed to have been in charge ofthe arrangements for deploying a number of fighter aircraft fromJordan to Saudi Arabia, had defected to Cairo. This was further evidence of hostility to the efforts which the Jordanian and saudi arabian Governments were making to support the Imam&apos;s cause.On the question of recognition there was some reason to thinkthat the United States Government were contemplating a change offront. They had up to now taken the position that their recognitionof the republican regime in the Yemen would depend on some priorunderstanding with the Egyptian Government about the withdrawalof Egyptian forces from the Yemen and about the maintenance of stability in Saudi Arabia. It now appeared that they might becontemplating recognition without any conditions of this kind. Itwas possible, but not yet clear, that the United States Governmenthad decided that the early disappearance of royalist regimes in all parts of Arabia was now a foregone conclusion and that their interests would best be served by coming out in open support of any republicanmovements which appeared to stand a reasonable chance of assumingpower. As against this, however, it was understood that the UnitedStates Government had recently increased the scale of their materialsupport to the present regimes in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. He wasexpecting a message from the United States Secretary of State later that day which might clarify the position.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the recognition of the republican regime in the Yemen by the United States could have the gravest consequences for Aden. The maintenance of our position there depended on the continued support of the Rulers of the protectorate. The republican authorities of the Yemen had nowavowed publicly their intention to subvert the authority of the Rulersand our own position in Aden by all means in their power. UnitedStates support for the regime would encourage the forces making for subversion and correspondingly dishearten our supporters.He hoped that strong representations would be made to the UnitedStates Government in this sense, if necessary at the highest level.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theForeign Secretary, would consider what further representations should be made to the United StatesGovernment about the recognition of the republicanregime in the Yemen.The Foreign Secretary said that recent reports about the scale of bombing attacks by aircraft under the control of the Prime Ministerof Katanga, Mr. Tshombe, appeared to have been greatly exaggerated.Nevertheless, the general position in the Congo gave cause for concern.C.C. (62) 59th xhe new Constitution for the Congo, on which all else depended,Conclusions, seemed to be making little, if any, progress. It had on two occasionsbeen found impossible to raise a quorum in the Congolese parliament in Leopoldville to discuss the Constitution, and no copy of it had yet been sent officially to Mr. Tshombe. Moreover, the constitution as now drafted seemed to be far from satisfactory; it was not a federal Constitution in any proper sense. It might be helpful thatMr. McGhee, the United States special envoy for the Congo, had formed a favourable impression of Mr. Tshombe; this might perhapslead the United States authorities to take a less extreme view thanCongoRepublic(PreviousReferenceMinute 1)
Iron and SteelIndustry(previous reference:C.C. (61) 7thConclusions,Minute 3)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (C. (62) 178), proposing the sale of five smallsteel companies by the Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the holdings of theIron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency (apart from certainloans which gave rise to no special problems) consisted of RichardThomas and Baldwins and five small companies. A consortium of10 major steel companies, members of the British Iron and steel federation, had offered to buy the small companies. The value ofthose companies in the Agency&apos;s books was about  11 million but their prospects were generally regarded as poor. The Agency&apos;sprofessional advisers had said that  8 million would be a favourableprice and  7-5 million would be reasonable. The Agency had,however, been unable to negotiate with the consortium a higher figurethan  7-15 million. This figure could be accepted as just satisfying the statutory requirement that the consideration obtained onde-nationalisation should be financially adequate. He felt that if theoffer were refused there would be difficulty in disposing of thecompanies at a later stage; and the Government would then have to face on their own responsibility the early closure of one of the twohematite companies, and probably the eventual closure of the otherfour companies. In that event the Government might be criticised for having failed to implement their declared policy of de-nationalisingthe steel industry. If the sale were approved, a public announcement would be made in the terms of Annex B of C. (62) 178 and it wouldbe made clear, as desired by the British Iron and Steel Federation,that the Government had no present intention of making any furthermajor public investment in the steel industry.In discussion there was some division of view in the Cabinetabout the expediency of accepting the offer made by the consortium.It was pointed out, on one hand, that to decline the offer would notrelieve the Government of the odium which would result from closingthe steel works; that it would be embarrassing if the Agency retainedresponsibility while the assets of the companies were running down;and that if the present offer were rejected there would be little prospectof being able to sell the companies at any later stage.. It should bekept in mind that in Common Market conditions only the largerunits in the industry would be in a position to compete effectively.There would therefore be advantage in facilitating the process of rationalisation on which the consortium were prepared to embark.It was understood that the members of the consortium wereC.C. 68 (62)they had tended to do in the past. As against this the further delay in making progress towards a settlement was once again exhaustingthe financial resources of the United Nations; and, in default ofsome early and hopeful development, the Acting Secretary-general would be likely to propose the imposition of sanctions on Katangaprobably involving a boycott on purchases of Katangan copper. Ourown likely reaction to a proposal for such a boycott would be toundertake to maintain British purchases of Katangan copper at theaverage level of the last few years.The Foreign Secretary said that he had at this stage no particular course of action to propose to the Cabinet; he had, however, felt it right to warn them that there might be a serious deterioration in theposition before very long.The Cabinet (2) Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.
influenced, not only by the desire to modernise the equipment ofthe industry and fit it for European competition, but also by their belief that the sale would help the Governments de-nationalisationpolicy.It was pointed out, on the other hand, that the government might not in practice be much helped if the proposed sale took place.The cartel aspects of the transaction would invite criticism and soalso would its financial implications. Attention would be drawn tothe imprudence of selling at a time when the steel industry was in adepressed condition; although the companies were not well equipped and were engaged in specialised forms of production for which themarket was limited, it did not follow that a better price would notbe obtainable when conditions in the industry generally improved.It might be easier to rebut criticism of the Governments reluctance to press on with de-nationalisation than to deal with the charge thatthe Government had passed over to a consortium of major firms theresponsibility for a series of unwelcome closures. Whateverreassurance could be included in the statement proposed by the agency, it would be publicly assumed that closures were imminentand the effect would be particularly unfortunate in the case of thosesteel works which were located in development districts. From thepoint of view of de-nationalisation policy, too much importanceshould not be attached to retention of the small companies so longas Richard Thomas and Baldwins remained in the Agency&apos;s hands.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that theoffer by the consortium raised difficult issues. The importance tothe Government of carrying forward the policy of de-nationalisationhad to be balanced against the risk that in approving the offer theGovernment might bring discredit on private enterprise. It wouldbe convenient if a small group of Ministers could give furtherconsideration to the questions which had been raised and bring thematter before the Cabinet again at an early meeting.The Cabinet Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Home Secretary and the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster, to give further consideration to the points whichhad been raised in their discussion and to bring the matter before them again.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Pensions and National Insurance (C. (62) 177) submitting proposalsfor changes in national insurance benefit rates and contributions.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance recalled thatThe Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament had indicated thatthe Government would keep under close review the position of thosewho were receiving national insurance benefits and war pensions.It now seemed clear that it would be necessary to legislate during thecurrent session for an increase of not less than 7s. 6d. in the singleuniform rate of benefit under the national insurance scheme, with corresponding increases in the other rates, and increases also in thebenefits under the industrial injuries and war pensions schemes. the precise amounts should be reserved for settlement in the light of earnings, prices and other indices when the Bill was ready for introduction. Before the Bill could be prepared, however, it wouldbe necessary to consider how far it would be right to meet any ofthe proposals which were made from time to time for relaxationsin the earnings rule and for greater regard to be paid to individualneed. It would be practicable to relax the earnings rule during thecurrent session and also to provide for pensioners of over 70 toreceive more than the normal rate of benefit.Pensions andNationalInsurance(previous reference:CC. (60) 54thConclusions,Minute 5)
He did not himself favour the introduction of any form ofdifferential provision. He did not think that the needs of the over-70s,for example, were so markedly different from the needs of other categories that it would be right to give them a higher basic rate.Objection would be taken to additional benefits going exclusively to non-contributors, and special treatment for those over 70 wouldbe unpopular with the large proportion of contributors under thatage. There would also be some difficulty in resisting claims on behalfof other special categories such as widowed mothers and the long-termsick; and in 1952 the Government had removed an age differentialwhich then existed and had taken credit for restoring uniformity inbenefit rates. Moreover, an increase in the benefit rate would notassist many pensioners of over 70 unless there were corresponding increases in the assistance scales: as these were themselves based onneed, the repercussions on the assistance scheme as a whole would bedifficult to handle.He had set out in C. (62) 177 a number of further improvements which would call for consideration either in connexion with the bill or in connexion with the review of the basis and financial structure of the national insurance schemes which he thought ought to be announced when the increase in the benefit rate was announced.In discussion there was general agreement on the need for legislation to increase the basic rate of benefits and pensions. A wide range of related matters would need, however, to be closely examinedbefore a Bill could be prepared and it would be desirable that a small group of the Ministers principally concerned should begin this examination as soon as possible.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that legislation should be introduced during thecurrent session of Parliament to increase national insurance and related rates of benefit and assistance.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for asmall group of Ministers to examine the case fordifferential rates of benefit and other questions referredto in C. (62) 177, and to bring the matter before them at a later meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th November, 1962.
