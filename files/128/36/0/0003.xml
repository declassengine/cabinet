wages policy(previous reference:C.C. (61) 74thConclusions.Minute 6)I. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in discussions which he and oilier Ministers had held on 5th January with theBritish Employers Confederation and the Trades Union Congress(T.U.C.) about economic planning and wages policy, he had found on the employers&apos; side firm support for the policies which he had outlined in the debate in the House of Commons on 18th December.The T.U.C. representatives had been less forthcoming. They had asked for a statement of the Governments intentions on wages policy;and he was proposing to send them, in time for a meeting of their economic Committee on 10th January, a paper dealing with theperiod of further restraint which should follow the end of the currentpause in wage increases. This might help those of moderate opinionswithin the T.U.C. to persuade their colleagues to agree to co-operate with the Government in the National Economic Development Council(N.E.D.C.). The paper would begin by emphasising points whichhad been made in the House of Commons debate and would, inparticular, make it clear that the Government fully accepted the needfor action to ensure that increases in profits and dividends should notout-run increases in wages and salaries. It would go on to say thatthe present phase of the pause was not expected to last beyond theend of the present financial year and to indicate how the government proposed to bring it to an end in the public services for which theywere directly responsible, viz.. that wage and salary increases whichhad already been agreed upon would be implemented, including theM-ratc increases for industrial civil servants and those elements inarbitration awards which had so far been withheld, and that thelimitation imposed on the scope of arbitration would also be removed,though in terms which would exclude retrospection. The paper would then proceed to deal with the need for continuing restraint inthe interim period between the end of the pause and the formulation of a long-term policy in consultation with the two sides of industry.The Government would be expected to give some guidance on thescale of increases which would be tolerable in this period. It was for consideration whether this should be stated in terms of a percentage consistent with the growth in productivity to be expectedduring 1962 or in terms of the total sum of money which might beregarded as available for wage increases. A third course, which hadbeen suggested by the Minister without Portfolio, was to indicate thatsettlements might be made within the limits of the productivity inthose industries where productivity was measurable and that in other employments they might be made on an average based on thesefigures. He was inclined to think that, in view of the complicationsinvolved in establishing the necessary basis for the third course, the effective choice for the interim period lay between quoting a percentage and a money sum.In discussion there was general agreement in the Cabinet that inthis further approach to the T.U.C. the main emphasis should be laid on the concept of economic growth. It should be stressed that the primary purpose of the N.E.D.C.. which they were being asked tojoin, was to plan for a healthy expansion of the economy which wouldenable higher personal incomes in real terms to be earned. In the interim period, however, before increased production was achieved,restraint in wage claims was necessary. It should be emphasised thatthe action the Government had in mind included any necessaryrestraint on profits and dividends as well as on wages. Somemisgivings continued to be felt in tiie Cabinet about the expediency of indicating at this stage any precise measure of the average wage increases which might be tolerable during this period, since it seemed likely that any such average would be regarded as a minimum andwould expose the Government to criticism whenever it was exceeded.There might be particular embarrassment in respect of the engineeriimindustry where the employers had so far opposed any increase ofwages.   Although the T.U.C. had asked for an indication of the
Governments intentions on wages policy, there was no reason tobelieve that they would be more likely to agree to co-operate in theN.E.D.C. if a precise figure were given of the amount of wage increases which the Government would regard as tolerable in the interim period. On the other hand it was recognised that it would at least be something gained if the T.U.C. could be persuaded toaccept the fact that the amount of money available for wage increases in that period was limited.hi further discussion the following points were raised:(a) The Government might in the end gain very little if theT.U.C. joined the N.E.D.C. on the basis of the paper now proposedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer and later felt obliged to withdrawbecause they could not accept the restrictive policies on public expenditure and investment which the Government might feel obligedto adopt. On the other hand, as a matter of tactics, the governments position in the eyes of the public might be strengthened if the T.U.C.refused to accept a reasonable statement of the polic\ proposed for wage restraint in the interim period.(b) The Governments attitude to arbitration during the interim period would be of crucial importance. Could a policy of limitingwage increases to an average of 24 per cent, be reconciled withfreedom of action for arbitrators? Would the Government feel obliged to accept higher awards in the public services? If not.confidence in the system of arbitration might be undermined. It was recognised that it would not be practicable to include in the paper for the T.U.C. any firm statement on arbitration and it might bebetter to say nothing about it at this stage. If anything had to besaid, it might be limited to an invitation to take part in discussions on this aspect of the problem.(c) Much would also turn on the action to be taken by theGovernment in those areas outside the Civil Service over which theyhad some measure of control. The procedure for settling the railwaymen&apos;s wage claim would be particularly important. Inaddition, claims would shortly have to be considered by nurses andothers. In some cases the amounts would be so substantial that inthe light of general policy it might be better to make no offer at all.Ul) In the long term it might be worth considering whether thedifficulties due to leap-frogging could be reduced by arranging thatwage claims were made mainly at one particular time of the year.(e) There was some risk that the proposals made by theChancellor of the Exchequer for bringing the wage pause to an end in the public sector would be accepted without any commitment onthe part of union representatives to co-operate in seeking a solutionof the problems of the interim period and the longer term.Summing up. the Prime Minister said that the main objective atthis stage was to secure the co-operation of the T.U.C. in long-term planning directed towards economic growth. Any proposals for wage restraint in an interim period should be presented as an essential condition of progress towards a viable policy of growth.. It was desirable that in his paper for the T.U.C. the Chancellor of theExchequer should deal with the problems of the interim period insuch a way that, even if he failed to enlist their co-operation, theGovernment might at least, by presenting a reasonable statement,bring influence to bear on public opinion, employers and arbitrators.But as there were grave dangers in specifying, by a percentage orotherwise, the amount of wage increases which would be tolerablein this period and also in making any definite statement at this stageabout arbitration, the paper should deal with these points in general terms. It might suffice to say that the problems of the interim periodcould be approached on the basis of a percentage or on the basis ofa money sum or on the basis which had been suggested by the minister without Portfolio.   The T.U.C. could be invited to discuss these

(62) 6) covering a memorandum by officials setting outpossible courses of action in negotiations on railwaymerfs wages.The Minister of Transport said that the railwaymen&apos;s unions didiiot appear to be pressing the British Transport Commission for anearly decision on their claim, and the Chairman of the commission had now undertaken to meet representatives of the unions on23rd January.In a short general discussion it was recognised that the amountof increase which would be appropriate and the means of securing that only this amount was given would be much affected by theprogress of other wage claims, in particular that for coal miners whichthe Chairman of the National Coal Board was due to discuss withthe National Union of Mineworkers on 17th January. The attitudeof the railway unions might also be much affected by the receptiongiven by the Trades Union Congress to the proposals to be put beforeThem on 10th January by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Withthese considerations in mind it did not seem profitable to discuss the railwaymen&apos;s claim in detail at this stage.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of railwaymems wages ata later meeting.Cabinet Office.
