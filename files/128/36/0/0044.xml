CC. 44 (62)1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord President said that it would be difficult to avoid anearly debate in the House of Lords on the Report of the Committeeon Broadcasting. This could be held either on a Motion alreadytabled by Lord Morrison of Lambeth calling attention to the Report,or on a Government Motion seeking approval of the GovernmentsWhite Paper. After discussion it was agreed that the second of these alternatives was to be preferred.Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference:CC. (62) 43rdConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Home Secretary said that he had been able to persuadeDr. Banda that the constitutional conference on Nyasaland shouldbe deferred until November, and that no statement on secessionshould be made for the time being. This was a satisfactory outcome,as it meant that the elections in Northern Rhodesia would be overbefore the conference on the future of Nyasaland began. during his stay in London Dr. Banda had made little impact on publicopinion and he was now on his way back to Nyasaland.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.ForeignAffairsAlgeria(previous reference:CC. (61) 24thConclusions,Minute 2)Laos(previous reference:CC. (62) 42ndConclusions,Minute 1)3. The Cabinet were informed that in Algeria the provisionalExecutive had assumed the powers of a provisional Government,but members of the earlier Government had now returned fromTunisia and the two bodies were likely to merge into a singleGovernment under the leadership of Ben Khedda. The SovietGovernment had already recognised Ben Khedda as the Head ofthe new Algerian Government; but we, with the knowledge of theFrench Government, were withholding entry into formal relationsuntil the political position had clarified.The Cabinet were informed that discussions on Laos were now proceeding in Geneva. Representatives of Thailand were taking part in these discussions. Two questions were proving difficult -first, the relations of Laos with the South-East Asia treaty organisation and, secondly, the integration of the military forces inLaos. The Laotians were claiming that this second question was amatter of internal jurisdiction, but other parties to the Conferenceconsidered it to be of international concern.british guiana(previous reference:CC. (62) 15thConclusions,Minute 4)4. The Colonial Secretary said that the Commission appointedto enquire into the disturbances in British Guiana in February 1962were not now expected to submit their report before August. Hehad informed the Premier, Dr. Jagan, that in these circumstances he must postpone the Conference on further constitutional development in British Guiana, which was to have been held in July,and that he now proposed to hold this as soon as practicable afterthe Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers in September.   Dr.
Jagan had taken offence at this postponement, and it was possiblethat he might try to get the United Nations to invite the Committeeof Thirteen to make an independent investigation into conditionsin British Guiana. It was to be hoped that, in this event, the UnitedStates Government would support us in opposing any such resolution in the United Nations.The Lord Privy Seal said that he would convey a suitable warningabout this to the Acting Secretary-General of the United Nations,who was at present in London.Europe 5.   The Lord Privy Seal said that further Ministerial meetingsCommon had been held in Brussels on the conditions for the United Kingdom&apos;sMarket entry into the European Economic Community (E.E.C.) and theNegotiations    European Atomic Energy  Community  (EURATOM).    On  the(Previous        E.E.C. negotiations there had been a period of intensive work and reference:       hard bargaining.  Some progress had been made, but it was not nowC.C. (62) 42nd   to be expected that the negotiations could be brought to a conclusionConclusions,     before Parliament rose for the summer recess.   The main sourceMinute 3)       0f difficulty was still the attitude of the French Government; theyhad refrained from entering into substantive discussion of their objections at meetings at which the United Kingdom had been represented but had been active in pressing them on other member countries at meetings of the Six.  A high proportion of the obstacleswhich we were still meeting could be attributed to French initiatives.The French had placed a total reservation on the proposals fordealing with textile imports from India, Pakistan and Ceylon, whichhad at an earlier stage given promise of agreement apart from oneor two points on which Mr. Desai, the Indian Finance Minister, wouldhave had an opportunity for comment and representation. In thelight of the French attitude, which was due to pressure from theFrench textile lobby and indirectly to the current activities of theBritish textile lobby on the Continent, it had been necessary to defer discussion to a later meeting. There had been no progress on domestic agriculture, again because of the attitude of the French.This was now due to be discussed at a three-day meeting from18th to 20th July. No progress had been made with the majorcommodities for which we were seeking to negotiate nil tariffs,although one or two of the smaller items had been agreed.Encouraging progress had, however, been made on temperatefoodstuffs from the developed countries of the Commonwealth. Ithad now been agreed that the transitional period should continueup to 1970, and it was accepted that, if by 1970 no world-wideagreements for a particular commodity had been negotiated, itwould be necessary to devise continuing arrangements for theCommonwealth countries, to be negotiated in each case with thecountries concerned. We had not committed ourselves to acceptFrench ideas on the nature of world-wide commodity agreements.The existing members of E.E.C. had also said that they would beprepared so to operate their price and production schedules as togive reasonable access to Commonwealth foodstuffs. They hadbeen asked for details of the machinery proposed to achieve this.On the association of the dependent or under-developed countries of the Commonwealth it had been accepted that there should be no discrimination between existing associated territories and those tobe associated in future. It had also been agreed that existingassociates should have no right of veto on the admission of newassociates. After argument it had been agreed that detailed discussion on the particular Commonwealth territories concerned should be
CC. 44 (62)handled on an informal basis and directly between Ministers. Thetwo main difficulties were likely to be with Ghana and with theFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. President de Gaulle was concerned at the possible disruptive influence of Ghana on the FrenchAfrican territories, but his anxiety did not seem to be shared by theother European countries or by the French territories themselves.The anxieties of the present associated territories were related rather to the Federation, for political and racial reasons. No decisions had yet been reached.On EURATOM reasonable progress had been made. Thediscussion at the recent meeting had centred on the arrangements,financial and otherwise, which would be needed when the UnitedKingdom became a part-owner of the existing EURATOMinstallations.In discussion the following points were made:(a) There had been a noticeable swing in public opinion in thiscountry against United Kingdom membership of the common market. There had always been a body of opinion, particularly among farmers, which held that the advantages of membership mustbe doubtful until the conditions of entry were known; but more recently this had been replaced by a feeling, no doubt inspired bypropaganda in the anti-Common Market newspapers and magazines,that it would be wrong in principle for the United Kingdom to join the Common Market on any conditions. Up to now anxiety hadcentred on the effect on Commonwealth trade. But in the long runanxieties about the effect on our domestic agriculture might beeven more important. It was among the farmers that the propaganda against the Common Market seemed to be having most effect. Itwas significant that for the first time since the negotiations had started the President of the National Farmers Union was about tomake a statement, which would be widely circulated, condemningin general terms the idea of British membership and paying no morethan lip service to the fact that the issue would remain open untilthe precise conditions of our entry were known.(b) Some apprehensions were also beginning to be expressed on religious grounds. It was being represented by some non-Conformist groups that the Common Market would involve a close association between a Protestant United Kingdom and a largelyCatholic Europe. It would not be easy to deal with such allegationsin public without risk of inflaming controversy in quarters wheresectarian feeling was still strong.(c) It would be necessary for the Government to undertake assoon as practicable a campaign to present membership of theCommon Market in a fairer light. This emphasised the importanceof bringing the current negotiations to a conclusion.as soon as possible.(d) It might be of advantage if an early statement could bemade about the legal consequences of our joining the common market. These had now been studied in detail and presented lessdifficulty than had been thought. An authoritative statement at anearly stage might restore a sense of proportion on this aspect of theproblem.The Cabinet (1) Took note of this statement by the Lord Privy Seal and ofthe points made in their discussion.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to consider further with theMinisters concerned the desirability of making an early statement on the legal implications of United kingdom membership of the Common Market.a 3
6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the colonial secretary (C. (62) 101) outlining a programme for the settlement of africans on land to be purchased from Europeans in Kenya.The Colonial Secretary said that he had discussed this scheme with the Chief Secretary, Treasury. He proposed that over the next five years funds should be made available for the settlement ofabout 70,000 African families on 1 million acres of mixed farmingland now owned by Europeans, and that the Government should indicate their willingness to participate in an extension of the scheme at the end of this period, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions.The rate of settlement and the expenditure involved would be spreadevenly over the five-year period. He hoped that arrangements couldbe made for existing schemes to continue and to be co-co-ordinated with the new scheme. The cost of buying and settling 1 million acres was estimated at about  16-55 million, of which  7-55 million would be grant and  9 million loan; but the total amount of additionalmoney required would be about  12-65 million, since funds forsome existing schemes would be absorbed into this larger plan.The administrative resources of the Kenya authorities wouldbe fully stretched by a scheme on the lines proposed and he did notthink that anything on a larger scale would be practicable. Thescheme would not resettle all the landless unemployed Africansand it would not affect more than about half of the mixed farmingarea owned by Europeans. It should, moreover, be recognisedthat the substitution of African for European farmers would involve some decline in the general standard of farming, with correspondingloss to the Kenya economy. But, if there were no scheme of thiskind, large numbers of European farmers would abandon theirfarms and the local tribes would fight for possession of them. Thescheme would also have the advantage of offering a means of dealingwith the claims of some European farmers who might otherwise makea strong case for direct compensation from the United KingdomGovernment. He sought authority to discuss the outline of thescheme with Kenya Ministers and to make an announcement about it during his forthcoming visit. Further discussions would thenbe held both with the Kenya Government and with the Treasuryabout the detailed arrangements for putting the scheme into effect.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be right to proceed with a scheme of this kind. It was not possible toestimate at this stage how many of the 3,000 European farmers atpresent in Kenya would wish to stay, but it was believed that afair proportion would be encouraged to do so by the knowledge that this scheme would guarantee a reasonable market in land for at least five years. The scheme offered the best hope of avoiding in kenya a situation comparable with that which had arisen in Algeriathrough the dissatisfaction of European settlers. Care should,however, be taken to ensure that the proposed announcement carriedthe concurrence of the Kenya Government and that it was presented,not as a scheme for rescuing European farmers, but as one to securethe orderly settlement of Africans. The Kenya Government shouldbe left in no doubt that this commitment would be a first charge on the financial assistance to be provided by the United KingdomGovernment for development purposes.The Cabinet Approved the proposals outlined in C. (62) 101 for a schemeof land settlement in Kenya.
MalayaGreaterMalaysia(previous reference:C.C. (61) 65thConclusions,Minute 4)CC. 44 (62)7. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime MinisterCC, (62) 106) about the forthcoming negotiations with Tunku abdul rahman, the Malayan Prime Minister, on the Federation of Malaysia.Annexed to this was a memorandum analysing the Cobbold Reporton the views of the peoples of the Borneo territories on the proposedFederation.The Prime Minister said that the early creation of a Federationof Malaysia would avoid the difficulties which would arise if Singaporewere left to seek independence on its own. There seemed to be noother course which offered a reasonable prospect of maintainingstability in the area. It was clear from the Cobbold Report thatthe difficulties centred almost exclusively on the arrangements tocover the transitional period before the Borneo territories couldassume responsibility for their own administration. It had seemedto Lord Cobbold that it would be necessary to maintain British staffin the territories during this transitional period, possibly under british Governors.The Prime Minister said that since his memorandum was circulated he had received a personal message from the Tunkuexpressing his unwillingness to negotiate on the basis of the CobboldReport if the views of the British members of the Commission wereto form the basis for the discussion. He seemed to be under theimpression that the United Kingdom Government had inspired, or at least accepted, these views. The Prime Minister said that, in replying to the Tunku, he had pointed out that he was not in anyway committed to those views and was prepared to discuss withoutprejudice or commitment any proposals which the Tunku might wish to put forward, and had urged upon him again the importanceof coming to London at an early date.It was important that, if a Federation was established, theUnited Kingdom Government should not retain responsibility forthe administration of the Borneo territories. We should then beanswerable for events in those territories without having effective control over them. Both the Malayan and the British members ofthe Cobbold Commission had agreed that it would be necessaryto retain British staff. But some means must be found of doing this without retaining constitutional responsibility for the territories. this problem would need further thought. The immediate question onwhich he now sought the views of the Cabinet was whethernegotiations with the Tunku should be pursued with the aim of bringing a Federation of Malaysia into being at the earliest practicabledate and agreeing on acceptable solutions of the transitionalproblems which would protect the interests of the peoples of theBorneo territories.In discussion it was pointed out that it would be difficult to overlook the specific commitments into which we had entered tosafeguard the interests of the population of the Borneo territories,particularly Sarawak. It was hoped that any arrangements eventuallyagreed for the transitional period could be presented as beingconsistent with those undertakings.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the Prime Ministers proposal that negotiations should be urgently pursued with the Prime Minister of malaya with the aim of bringing the Federation of malaysia into being at the earliest practicable date andagreeing on acceptable solutions of the transitionalproblems which would protect the interests of the peoples of the Borneo territories.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would press the PrimeMinister of Malaya to come to London in the currentmonth, as planned, to pursue these negotiations.
8. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the record of the cabinets discussion of 28th June on the economic situation gave a misleading impression of his view of the economic prospects.While it was true that he had not thought it necessary that further measures should be taken at that date to stimulate expansion, he didnot exclude the possibility that such measures might become necessary. Moreover, while it was true that exports were increasing,he was not satisfied with their rate of growth.The Lord Chance/lor said that he presumed that, even so,Ministers might continue to take credit for the increase in the volumeof exports.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had noted with satisfaction that the wage increase awarded in the engineering industry had not exceeded 3 per cent.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (62) 104) describing the results of areappraisal of the future of the coal industry, and a note by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (62) 105) covering a draft statement on the action proposed to deal with redundancy in thecoal industry in Scotland.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that on the basis of areport by a group of officials and representatives of the national coal Board, the Minister of Power had put before the economic policy Committee a series of proposals for the future of the coalindustry. The Board, who had been more optimistic than theDepartments about the level of future demand, believed that on the policies at present followed by the Board and the Government therewould be a demand for about 190 million tons of coal a year formany years ahead. In adjusting the size of the industry to this demand, the main problems would relate to financial policy and the closure of uneconomic pits. The financial target suggested by theBoard&apos;s consultants and accepted by the Board in the light of thepolicy set out in the White Paper (Cmnd. 1337) was that the board should, over the five years 1963-67, aim to break even and to provide 10 million a year in respect of the difference between historic and replacement costs of assets. The Economic Policy committee considered that the Government should accept this as an appropriatetarget. On closure of pits, the Board&apos;s present policy was to closelosing collieries as rapidly as possible. This policy was economicallysound, though it would give rise to some social and political difficulties. In 1961 the Board had been maintaining 162 collierieswhich were &quot; gross losers &quot; in the sense that their operating costs,taking no account of overheads, exceeded the income from coalproduced by them. The other proposals made by the group, and supported by the Economic Policy Committee, were that the board should not be pressed at this stage to embark upon capital reconstruction; that for the present at least imports of American coalby private importers should not be allowed; and that in due courselegislation should be introduced to enable the Board to borrowtemporarily, to meet their deficits, more than the amount providedfor in section 27 of the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act, 1946.The Cabinet first considered what action they should take inconnexion with pit closures in Scotland, about which the board would be in discussion with the miners&apos; unions during the following week. It would become evident on 11th July that by 1966 therewould be a reduction of 24,000 in the number of jobs in Scottish
The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Scotland, the President of theBoard of Trade and the Minister of Power, to prepare inthe light of the CabinetS discussion a revised draft ofthe statement attached to C. (62) 105; and to submit the revised draft to the Prime Minister for hisconsideration.In further discussion on the longer term implications of theproposals described by the Chancellor of the Exchequer the followingpoints were raised:(a) The proposed financial target could be regarded as attainable.It was related to an output target of 190 million tons a year and itmight at some stage be necessary to say this; but in any general statement of the Governments attitude towards the principles adoptedby the Board it would be inexpedient to appear to approve a specificfigure either for demand or for output.(b) The Board&apos;s policy on pit closures could be supported, butnot without qualification. It was reasonable that, as had beensuggested by the group, the Board should not be held responsiblefor considerations going beyond the mining industry, but a general statement to this effect might have unfortunate implications, bothin the coal industry and in other industries. The BoardS recordsuggested that there would be no disposition on their part to ignore the social consequences of their actions, and it would be to their advantage to show consideration for the future of miningcommunities. In indicating the Governments general approval ofthe BoardS policy, the Minister of Power should inform the Boardof the Governments assumption that the Board would, so far aspossible, time their closures to minimise the social difficulties whichwould result from them; and the BoardS attention might be drawn to the discussion in Appendix II of the report submitted by thegroup about the parts of the country in which those difficulties wouldbe most acute.(c) There appeared to be no need at present to press for furtherconsideration of capital reconstruction in the industry.(d) The policy of not allowing imports of American coal by private importers should be maintained for the present. protests from the United States Government about the inconsistency between this policy and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade couldmines; this would be offset by normal wastage of about 20,000 andthere would be a net displacement from coal-mining of 4,000 men.There was general agreement that a statement should be made inParliament on 11th July. This should, however, be shorter thanthe draft circulated under cover of C. (62) 105 and should lay greaterstress on the extent to which miners displaced by past closures had found other employment, on the value of being able to plan aheadfor the next phase in the adjustment of the coal industry to current economic conditions, and on the importance of manning the expanding industries which would be in need of labour. Thegeneral emphasis should be on dynamic action, and a more confidentnote should be struck, though it should be kept in mind in preparing a revised draft that there would be a difficult stage of readjustmentand that there would be areas in which the rate of unemploymentbrought about by pit closures would be high. The statement shouldbe made by the Secretary of State for Scotland. On balance, it wouldbe preferable that he should not seek to deal on the same occasionwith the social problems raised by the closure of branch railway lines in Scotland.
be met by an assurance that the policy would be re-examined in ayear&apos;s time.(e) There should be no great difficulty in finding a place in the1962-63 legislative programme for a Bill to amend section 27 of theCoal Industry Nationalisation Act, 1946.(/) As Parliament had been promised information about thefinancial target to be adopted for the coal industry, an indication of Government policy should be given before the summer recess.A suitable occasion would present itself if there were a general debate,in Opposition time, on the nationalised industries.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Minister of Power to arrange for Parliament tobe informed of the financial target agreed upon for thecoal industry and of the Governments attitude to thepolicy of the National Coal Board on pit closures.Cabinet Office, S.W.J,5th July, 1962.
