The Queen&apos;sSpeech onthe Openingof Parliament(previous references:C.C. (62) 60thConclusions,Minute 2, andC.C. (62) 61stConclusions,Minute 3)1. The Cabinet considered the reference to Cuba in the draftof The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament. amendments were approved which took into account the undertaking given bythe Soviet Government that the offensive missiles introduced intoCuba would be dismantled under the supervision of the united nations.The Cabinet also approved the text of an additional paragraphreferring to the invasion of Indian territory by Chinese armies.The Cabinet (1) Approved new passages on Cuba and India for inclusion inThe Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would submit these amendments for The Queen&apos;s approval.*2. The Prime Minister said that during the preceding days hehad been in close consultation with President Kennedy about thedevelopment of the Cuban situation. In retrospect it was evidentthat the President had played his hand with great skill; he had infact turned the usual Communist methods against themselves byobserving to the full the proprieties of international consultation, e.g.,in the United Nations, but by showing at the same time anunwavering determination to attain his objective of securing theremoval of the offensive missiles from Cuba, with the implication that he would not shrink from the use of force in the last resort. Hehad also dealt effectively with the pressures which had been broughtto bear upon him within the United States, where a strong body ofopinion had been calling for violent measures. President Kennedyhad steered a difficult course between being driven into a prematureuse of force and appearing to waver in his determination. Whilereluctant to authorise an invasion of Cuba, he had shown greatfirmness in continuing to make preparations for it.So far as relations with the United Kingdom were concerned,both President Kennedy and his advisers had shown themselvesready to ask for and to consider advice. This had been done quiteinformally without commitment on either side.The Prime Minister said that it would clearly have been wrong for him, at any stage in the situation as it had developed, to have offered himself as a mediator; this would have meant a withdrawal from the position, in which we had supported President Kennedy,that no discussions could take place until the missiles had been withdrawn. He had, however, in the concluding stages judged it right to send a message to Mr. Khrushchev making clear our supportof the United States position in this respect. It was unfortunate thatthis message had been delivered in Moscow at about the time thatMr. Khrushchev despatched and gave publicity to his final decisionto withdraw the missiles under United Nations supervision. Thissharpened the political dilemma in which the Government nowfound themselves. In fact we had played an active and helpful partin bringing matters to their present conclusion, but in public littlehad been said and the impression had been created that we had beenplaying a purely passive role. It would not be easy to correct this without revealing the degree of informal consultation which hadtaken place; but this might be embarrassing to President Kennedyand perhaps an irritation to other European leaders. The point would need to be further considered.   -* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET1900-6 a 2Cuba(previous reference:C.C. (62) 62ndConclusions,Minute 3)
On the situation itself the Prime Minister said that he felt therewere now three tasks facing the Government; to present the courseof events, and the Governments part in them, to public opinion; to identify the lessons to be learned from the negotiations both betweenthe Allies and with the Soviet Government; and to consider howthose lessons might be applied for the future.The Foreign Secretary said that if the United States had attacked Cuba there could be little doubt that the Soviet Governmentwould have reacted in Berlin. There would then have been a real and immediate risk of nuclear war. In the public presentation ofrecent events it would be important to avoid engendering over-optimism. It would be necessary to point out that both the majorCommunist Powers Russia and China had moved simultaneously to improve their strategic position, with the admitted difference thatthe Russians no longer believed in the inevitability of world war.The free world would have to take account of the fact that theCommunist Powers had deliberately engaged in a policy of deceptionto further their strategic designs; and this underlined the need for measures of international verification to be included in any agreement on disarmament, whether nuclear or conventional. A particulardanger here was that the sense of relief engendered by the solution ofthe Cuban crisis might lead to demands for the elimination of nuclear weapons as the first stage of any disarmament plan. The Westcould not accept this, since it would leave a clear field to the massiveconventional superiority of the Communist Powers: at all stages ofany disarmament plan nuclear and conventional disarmament wouldhave to be considered together. An agreement on missile baseswould also present difficulty, since all the Russian bases of any importance were on their own soil. In short it would be necessaryto point out realistically that the chances of international agreement on major issues had not been improved, but might have becomeworse because the West had more reason to be suspicious of communist professions of good faith. The situation would of course be transformed if, on the basis of the Cuban precedent, the SovietGovernment were now to accept the principle of verification on a wider front.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The fact that Cuba would remain a Communist countryclose to the American mainland might not be a disadvantage. Insome ways it presented a parallel to Berlin, with much the sameopportunities for the exercise of diplomatic and economic pressure.The fact that Mr. Khrushchev had not reacted in Berlin during thelast week was in itself curious: it might perhaps indicate that theSoviet Government were not as confident of their position as theyhad appeared to be. It was known that the Soviet economy hadbeen under strain.(b) It would be important to avoid allowing the impression to gain ground that Mr. Khrushchev was now to be regarded as atrustworthy man of peace. There was no reason to think that hischaracter or ambitions had altered. If the Cuban affair were seen in perspective, it appeared that he had brought the world to thebrink of war, and had lost his nerve at the last moment. There was nothing in this on which to build great hopes for the future.Nevertheless, it was true that on this occasion the free world was entitled to enjoy a sense of relief without a sense of surrender:nothing had been given up and the mistake had not been made of feeding the aggressor&apos;s ambition by yielding to his demands little bylittle. Against this background the next step would be critical; thesituation could not be allowed to rest where it was; perhaps an earlyinitiative on the banning of nuclear tests might be considered apartfrom and in advance of any general move on disarmament.(c) The content of the speech which the Prime Minister wouldbe making on 30th October would need careful thought.   It was
3. The Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet of the present state of the negotiations for membership of the European economic community.During the Ministerial meetings which had concluded on27th October there had been discussions about transitional arrangements for domestic agriculture, about the requests made onbehalf of India and Pakistan for early comprehensive trade agreements and for suspension of the common external tariff ontextiles and manufactured goods imported into the United Kingdom,and about nil tariffs for newsprint and aluminium. Little progress had been made. Ministers would meet again on 15th November todiscuss temperate and processed foodstuffs from the commonwealth and the financial regulation. There would be a further meeting on29th November, when discussion of domestic agriculture would be resumed. But it seemed likely that by that time the negotiations would have reached deadlock on several points.In the discussion of domestic agriculture it had become clearthat the Six feared the effect on agricultural opinion in their own countries if our system of deficiency payments were allowed tocontinue, even in modified form, after our accession. For thisreason, and because low consumer prices here would enable Frenchfarmers to export to us without subsidies, there had been heavy pressure for replacement of deficiency payments by a system of consumer subsidies. This would last for only a few years, and therewere the strongest political objections to it in the United Kingdom.The extreme position adopted by the Six on this basic questionsuggested that serious difficulties would be encountered in securingacceptable regulations on other agricultural matters not yet discussed and in amending those arrangements on which the Six had already reached agreement among themselves.It had been agreed that negotiations for comprehensive trade agreements would be begun within three months of our accession,but the Six had refused to consider suspending the common external tariff on textile and manufactured exports from India and Pakistanto the United Kingdom during the period of negotiation. The offer made by the Six on nine items of interest to India and Pakistan forwhich nil tariffs had been requested had been unsatisfactory, andtheir attitude about nil tariffs for newsprint and aluminium had beenhardly more forthcoming, although there was some prospect ofa 3important to avoid the impression that the Government had beenpassive and that their attitude to these events had been purelynegative. There might be no harm in leaving somewhat vague the degree of consultation which had taken place; for public opinion would be more interested in future developments than in the detailsof past negotiations. The initiative which the Government hadfinally taken in sending a message to Mr. Khrushchev, reinforcingPresident Kennedy&apos;s stand, had been the right one in thecircumstances and it was unfortunate that it had been overtaken by events. One fact which might be emphasised with advantage wasthe degree to which the North Atlantic Alliance had maintained itscohesion under severe pressure.The Cabinet (1) Took note of these statements by the Prime Minister and bythe Foreign Secretary.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister in preparing the speech which he was due to make in Parliament on 30th Octoberwould take account of the points made in their discussion.
PopulationandEmployment(previous reference:C.C. (62) 62ndConclusions.Minute 4)4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of memoranda by theHome Secretary (C. (62) 157 and 158) reporting on the work so fardone by the Committee on Population and Employment anddiscussing proposals for checking the growth of offices in big cities.The Home Secretary said that, while there were differences ofview between Ministers, these should not be exaggerated. all members of his Committee had agreed that there could be noquestion of reversing the trend towards more concentration of thepopulation in the South-East. The problem was rather to devisemeans by which the Government could canalise that and other trendsso as to create better conditions for economic growth and at the sametime produce social advantages. An instance from the past was thedevelopment of new towns, which had been successful politically,financially, economically and socially. Existing policies for thedistribution of industry were designed, as it were, to soak up pools ofunemployment. This was satisfactory as far as it went, butsomewhat negative. In an age when the National economic development Council would be devising plans for greater economic growth, there was a case for trying positively to bring about, by taking Government action in good time, the kind of location of population and industry that would bring the greatest benefit to the lives of people generally. The Committees effort had been directed to finding constructive policies to this end, and the differences ofview between Ministers had been conditioned by their agreement onthat common objective.The Prime Minister said that discussion in Cabinet had shownthat great changes would be taking place in the next two decades inthe pattern of population and industry. He would like to presentthem to his colleagues in the wider context of the modernisation of britain. This had many aspects. First, there was the questionwhether the present machinery of Ministerial Government wassuitable for the conditions of to-day and the coming years. Theburden on Ministers was becoming almost intolerably heavy, notmerely in meeting the requirements of consultation as the basis forthe collective responsibility of the Cabinet, but also in taking theprogress on aluminium. It had been necessary to say plainly thatthe offers made did not provide a satisfactory basis for negotiation.In discussion the following points were raised:(a) The hardening in the attitude of the Six was influenced bytheir belief that it was now open to them to force up the price ofour membership. The French were showing themselves particularly difficult and there was no immediate sign of any relaxation in that quarter.(b) The French felt themselves in difficulties about theundertaking given on 5th August to devise a special arrangement for new Zealand. It would not be easy, although of course it remainedessential, to ensure that satisfactory effect would be given to thatundertaking.(c) From the standpoint of the Governments relations withdomestic agricultural interests, it was no disadvantage that such a firm position had had to be adopted against consumer subsidies. Itwould, however, be helpful to Ministers to have information aboutthe line which would be taken by the Minister of Agriculture in the speeches he would shortly be making in agricultural areas.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Lord Privy Seal and ofthe points raised in their discussion.
growing volume of decisions which their Departments and the publicexpected them to take personally, and in facing the daily barrage ofthe Press, radio and television. Members of Parliament generallywere under similar pressures in meeting the demands of their constituencies. At the same time, the procedures of Parliament were designed for a less busy age. There were many Bills which had tocome before Parliament, which were important and difficult in themselves, and absorbed a great deal of Parliamentary time, but were not concerned with matters of general policy or national interest.An abortive attempt had been made under the Labour Administrationimmediately after the last war to modernise Parliamentary procedure.It might be time for a new attempt. The Government should perhapswork out a plan to modernise their own machinery and that ofParliament, and seize the initiative in demonstrating that changesmust be made to help the country to operate successfully in modern conditions.Secondly, he agreed that, in seeking a solution of the problem of population and employment, the choice did not lie simply betweenlaissez faire and dirigisme. There was also the alternative ofpragmatic compromise which was in line with the broad approach which the present Administration had inherited from their predecessors. It was clear that the Government should not attemptto reverse trends deriving from such fundamental forces as weredrawing population towards the South-East. Merely to continue the policies embodied in the Local Employment Act, 1960, would not be enough, however, and positive action was required to build upgrowing points. These should take account of social and politicalrequirements. It was out of the question to allow Scotland or theNorth-East or any large area to be abandoned to decay. The remedydid not lie in trying to preserve each individual community whichhad grown up for reasons long since irrelevant to modern conditions,such as a cotton town whose location depended originally on thepresence of water power to drive a water wheel. More imaginativechanges and developments were required. The Highlands ofScotland, which had been the playground of the rich in the last century, might be developed into the playground of the masses, likethe National Parks of North America. But the industrial belt inScotland must remain industrial, in a modern and constructive form.It would be a mistake to think only in terms of entirely newcommunities. Ford&apos;s of Dagenham contrasted with VauxhalPs atLuton to show the dangers of bringing people together into localitieswhere no tradition of common social interest existed, where therewas no diversity of employment and where the relationship ofemployee to employer was as remote as any between the workers ina nationalised industry and its management.Thirdly, the pattern of industry itself must be considered. Duringthe war industry in this country had been geared to war production,and the production of everyday consumer goods had been curtailed.After the war there was enormous unsatisfied demand and a seller&apos;smarket which to some extent obscured the need for industrial change.This was further masked by the extent to which advantages intechnology had tended to flow from the defence programmes. Ifdisarmament became a reality there would be an immense problem in substituting civil development and technology for the contributionsmade hitherto by the defence industries. The problem of industrialchange tended at present to be viewed in terms of declining industries,such as the railways and shipbuilding. It was to these that theGovernment gave most attention. It was important to put equaleffort, investment and research into the industries that should growin their place. The Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting hadunderlined the need for advanced nations, such as Britain, to
concentrate increasingly on the more sophisticated manufactures soas to leave room for the developing nations to supply the market forthe simpler manufactured products.The Government should also consider whether the financial basis for Britain&apos;s exporting industries was satisfactory. Much had beendone to improve the system of export credits, but he wondered whether the City and the merchant bankers were playing the partrequired of them in developing exports in the longer term, and in building up the markets on which those exports depended.The new Minister of Public Building and Works had been givenparticular responsibility for re-organising the construction industry,in which there was a prospect of radical and speedy improvement.The development of British agriculture was another instance of theresults of a positive policy achieved by the intensive application of science and technology as well as by investment in the industry itself.It was necessary to consider how the Government could be organised to promote the same kind of positive and constructive changes in industry generally.The Prime Minister said that, while he recognised that theproblem of office employment in London was a special one, he didnot altogether like the proposal that it should be tackled byrestrictive measures such as the imposition of a new tax or thetightening of planning restriction. It was hardly consistent to couplemeasures which might obstruct redevelopment with the projectedShops and Offices Bill, which would require improvements to be madein a great deal of existing office building. Given a city in which more and more work was being created in the centre and homes hadto be built further and further out beyond the Green Belt, it was certainly right to encourage firms to reduce their staffs in central london to the minimum and, if possible, to create more housing inthe inner areas. The Government ought to give a lead themselves by dispersing more Government offices. On the other hand, they ought perhaps also to consider radical new measures to replacedecaying areas of housing with modern metropolitan developmentwithin London itself on the scale of a new town.Generally, he would like to see each of these matters looked at,not from the standpoint of what the Government should prevent,but rather of what they should do. This should be the centralprinciple of a coherent body of doctrine, a blueprint for the modernisation of Britain, which should guide the governments policies for the future. The studies which the Committee onPopulation and Employment had put in hand would clearly be valuable in this context. As an earnest of their determination tocarry through a complete plan of modernisation, the Governmentshould aim at implementing the first elements in such a plan in the life of the present Parliament.In the meantime it was necessary to make progress on the specific issues which the Cabinet had been invited to decide, namely,whether to invite the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider a tax on offices, and whether to amend the Third Schedule to the Townand Country Planning Act, 1947, so that there would no longer beany liability to pay compensation if permission were refused for the redevelopment of pre-war offices to provide more than 10 per centadditional floor space. The Chancellor of the Exchequer should begin his examination of the former proposal immediately and,together with the Home Secretary, should give further considerationto the latter. He himself would consider further what arrangementshe should make for the development of the general principles he had put forward into specific and concrete proposals.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of C. (62) 157 and 158.
