The Foreign Secretary said that current Russian activities inCuba had caused intense feeling in the United States. president kennedy had been placed in a difficult personal position because ofthe pledges which he had given during the Presidential Elections andthere would be increasing pressure upon him to intervene. Heseemed inclined to believe that the Soviet Government were deliberately increasing the scale of Russian activity in Cuba in orderto provoke such intervention, which they would then use as a pretext for the forcible occupation of West Berlin. The Foreign secretary thought this unlikely; the situations were not comparable and theSoviet Government were well aware of the risks that would be involved in Berlin. It was more likely that they would continue touse the Cuban situation to exacerbate President Kennedy:s difficulties and then offer a reduction of tension over Cuba in return for concessions over Berlin.This intensity of public feeling in the United States made itdesirable to restrain our reaction to the attempt to restrict the supplyof arms to Cuba by denying access to United States ports to shipsengaged in this traffic. It would of course be necessary to maintainobjection in principle to the action which the United states administration had taken, but beyond that he hoped that for thetime being we could confine ourselves to discussions with the UnitedStates authorities to establish exactly what they had in mind and toconsider in the light of those discussions how best to minimise its effect on our trade. As a separate issue it might be necessary toconsider legislation to prevent the carriage of such arms in UnitedKingdom ships; it was at least conceivable that the Russians mightdeliberately ship arms to Cuba in United Kingdom ships undercharter.The Minister of Transport said that he had already appealed to united Kingdom shipowners to refrain from the carriage of arms toCuba and he had reason to think that his appeal had been effective.The position about the carriage of strategic materials was less clear.He was due to discuss the Cuban situation that afternoon with a delegation of shipowners. A particular difficulty arose over ships under charter. If refusal to carry arm&amp; involved a breach of contractunder the terms of the charter the shipping companies concerned would be liable for damages. No such liability would lie against them if the carriage of arms had been prohibited by legislation.After discussion the Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Transport in his forthcoming discussion with representatives of the shipping industryto confirm the Governments objection in principle to theaction which the United States Administration had taken,but to say that consultations were still proceeding withthe United States authorities about its practical effects and consideration would be given to the possibility of takingmeasures to minimise its effect on our trade.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Transport, to circulate for their consideration a paper setting out in more detail the issues involved and recommending possible courses of action.The Cabinet were informed that Mr. Tshombe, the PrimeMinister of Katanga, had now agreed in principle to integrateKatangese forces with those of the Central Government, to releasefood stocks for general distribution and to make the accounts of hisGovernment available to the Commission responsible for proposing the terms of a financial settlement between Katanga and the CentralGovernment. No progress had however been made with the drafting of the Federal Constitution owing to the refusal of Mr. Adoula, the

Berlin(previous reference:C.C. (62) 57thConclusions,Minute 1)Yemen(previous reference:C.C. (58) 43rdConclusions,Minute 7)The Foreign Secretary said that the situation in the Yemen was still obscure. It was improbable, in spite of rumours to the contrary,that the Imam was still alive. Prince Hassan had not yet arrived inYemen, but his son was rallying such support as he could from the tribes. He felt that for the time being it would be necessary to pursuea policy of non-involvement and that recognition of the revolutionaryregime should be delayed in spite of the arguments which had been advanced in favour of immediate recognition.Prime Minister of the Central Government, to send representatives to discuss it. Mr. McGhee, the United States special envoy for the congo, still considered that there was a fair chance of a settlement;and it had been suggested to Mr. Tshombe that it might help to thisend if he were now to release funds to the Central Government on a provisional basis making clear that the arrangements would be discontinued if no satisfactory agreement was reached on theConstitution.In default of a settlement within a reasonable period a large majority in the United Nations would favour the imposition of sanctions; it would be impossible for the United Kingdom to support this, not only because of the probability that sanctions would leadto further fighting, but because of the possibility that attempts mightbe made later to impose sanctions on Southern Rhodesia. A furtherpossibility, not involving collective action by the United Nations, wasthat the Belgian Government might be persuaded to close down theoperations of the Union Miniere. This was unlikely, not only becauseof the damage to Belgian prestige, but because of the possibility of violent reaction from the Government of Katanga which might extend to nationalisation of the Union Miniere,The Prime Minister said that he would be glad if the Presidentof the Board of Trade would let him have a note setting out the presentposition of the international copper market and the implications forthat market of action involving the Union Miniere.The Foreign Secretary said that he had discussed the Berlinsituation at length with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko,during his recent visit to New York. He had made it clear toMr. Gromyko that so long as the Russians refused to contemplatea solution of the Berlin problem based either on self-determinationfor Germany or on arrangements covering the whole of Berlin, itwould be necessary for Western troops to remain in West Berlin, andthat any solution would have to be based on that assumption. Hehad suggested that the idea of an international access authority forBerlin warranted further study. If agreement could be reached onaccess it would be possible to consider guarantees for the frontiers of East Germany and some formal understanding between thecountries of the North Atlantic Alliance and of the Warsaw Pact.Mr. Gromyko, although he had emphasised the objections of theSoviet Government to the continued presence of Western troops inBerlin, had not rejected the idea of further study of an internationalaccess authority and had reverted to it in a subsequent discussionwith the United States Secretary of State.The Foreign Secretary said that there was some evidence thatMr. Khrushchev was hoping to arrange a meeting with president kennedy to discuss broader questions of international policy; theSoviet economy was under strain and the Soviet Government were showing interest in measures to increase world trade. They might also for economic reasons be disposed to consider seriously practical measures of disarmament and an agreement on nuclear tests. If ameeting between Mr. Khrushchev and President Kennedy were to leadto some agreement on any or all of these broader issues, it was atleast possible that the Berlin question might be shelved.
4 IBHousingPolicy(PreviousR reference:C.C. (62) 38thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Housing and Local Government (C. (62) 145) and the chief secretary, Treasury (C. (62) 148) about housing policy.The Minister of Housing said that owing to the growth in population and in the number of separate households and to rapidobsolescence and the difficulty of securing land for building, theshortage of houses in many parts of the country had become acute.In seeking to give housing a new impetus he thought it would be rightto proceed with a number of linked proposals, which he had set outin general terms in C. (62) 145. These proposals dealt with the needfor an increased total housing output; the need to cater for a wider range of demand and provide alternatives to local authorityownership; and the need to improve the standard of older houses.It had already been agreed that the aim should be to increase output for Great Britain from 300,000 houses per annum to 325,000,mainly by stepping up local authority building. Studies had shownthat further ground would be lost if output were not increased to350,000 and held at that level for a number of years. This further increase should be sought mainly in the private sector but could notbe achieved immediately. Increased productivity would be essential and so also would a sounder and more realistic financial basis for both publicly and privately built houses. Some revision of subsidieswould be called for to ensure that benefit would accrue to those localauthorities and to those tenants who were most in need of assistance.It would not be necessary or expedient to apply a further measureof decontrol of rents in the private sector but in due course the permitted rent limit should be raised for houses remaining in control.More land would be required, and it would be necessary to reviewgreen belt policies. It should, however, be possible to confirm mostof the green belt plans which had been submitted. Decisions aboutland would turn on the Cabinet&apos;s consideration of proposals aboutthe distribution of industry and the growth of office building whichwould shortly be submitted by the Home Secretary, as Chairman ofthe Committee on Population and Employment. Even withmaximum use of expanded towns, there would be a need for furthernew towns; and announcement of the Governments willingness tohelp in this way would enable the local authorities to concentrate on expansion projects which were within their capabilities.The chief means of catering for a wider range of demand wouldbe by encouraging owner-occupation, which could be helped by thebuilding societies if they had the assurance of continued stability inthe housing programme; and by developing co-operative ownership of houses on the Scandinavian model. Co-operative schemes wouldbe fostered by housing societies under central guidance and it wasC.C. 59 (62)The Prime Minister said that the implications of a revolutionaryGovernment in the Yemen could be serious. Such a Governmentwould be bound to work actively against the merger of Aden Colonywith the Federation of Aden which was now in process and, if as aresult the control of Aden Colony were to pass out of our hands, our whole position in the Persian Gulf would be endangered. At thesame time active support of the reactionary forces opposed to therevolutionary Government now trying to establish itself would be politically repugnant. For these reasons there seemed no presentalternative to a policy of non-involvement. It would be prudent to delay recognition of the new regime until its position, including the degree of control which it could in practice exercise, could be more clearly seen. He would wish to discuss separately with the Ministerof Defence and the Foreign Secretary the military implications of thepresent situation.
likely that finance for such schemes would be provided both by building societies and insurance companies. The local authoritycontribution to an enlarged housing programme should be mainly in terms of more slum clearance, more building for old people and building to deal with obsolescence.The rate at which advantage had been taken of improvement grants needed to be improved. Some compulsion might be requiredto achieve this.In discussion the following points were raised:(a) The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the additional demand on resources which would be made by increasing the outputof houses to 350,000 per annum would be about  110 million. Beforeaccepting a commitment of this order it would be prudent to considerthe proposal in the context of other major investment proposals whichwould be coming before the Cabinet shortly and to see how far theconstruction industries would be able to meet the demands whichwould be made upon them.(b) The Minister of Public Building and Works said he believedit would be possible to achieve 350,000 houses a year without prejudicing other demands. But time would be required to securethe necessary improvements in the management, professional andlabour aspects of the construction industries. It would, in his view,be right to make the first move in the public sector, where GovernmentDepartments and other main clients of these industries could place orders big enough to justify the standardisation, modernisation and heavy capital investment which would have to be undertaken. Theprivate sector would then obtain the incidental advantages of these measures. Arrangements would be necessary to secure co-ordinationof departmental requirements.(c) There was general agreement in the Cabinet on the need toimprove on the present aim of 325,000 houses a year, but it was notedthat if any specific figure was announced there would be a danger that failure to achieve it, by however small a margin, would be represented as a defeat for the Governments policies. Special care would need to be given to the content and form of any announcement of theGovernments intentions.(d) The proposal to secure more realistic private rents would bea major political issue and so also might be the proposal to revise the subsidy structure, which would require legislation in due course.There might, however, be advantage in announcing the government&apos;s policy on these matters in the context of the other proposals whichwere in mind. Revision of the subsidy structure would be welcomed by many of the bigger cities.(e) It would be easier to secure the co-operation of the building societies in taking measures which were within their own control ifit could be shown that the Government were determined to maintainthe general scale of their housing effort and would not try to use thebuilding industry as one of the regulators of the economy. In further examination of proposals for owner-occupation and co-operativeschemes the need to encourage mobility of labour should be kept inmind and attention should be given to ways of simplifying the processes of buying and selling land.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister suggested that theCabinet should at this stage do no more than form a general viewabout the objectives to be sought. Presentation of those objectives,the means to be used to achieve them and the timing of the programme would require careful thought at a later stage. Subject to closerexamination of the political, economic and legislative implications,he believed that the Cabinet were prepared to accept the objectivesdescribed in C. (62) 145. Although an output of the order of 350,000houses per annum would impose additional demands on resourcesit would be wrong to suppose that these demands could only be met
3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that following theappointment of Mr. Geoffrey Lawrence, Q.C., as Chairman of theNational Incomes Commission, two other full-time appointmentswould be made together with a few part-time appointments. He hadnoticed evidence of a greater public support for the proposal to set upthe National Incomes Commission, and it would be important tocontinue to link the Commission in the minds of the public with theNational Economic Development Council, particularly because theTrades Union Congress had already agreed that wages generallyshould be a matter for discussion in the latter. The Commission^terms of reference had not yet been finally determined, but it was hoped that, after consultation with the Chairman, it would be possibleto publish them in the near future. He had again considered, withthe Minister of Labour, whether there should be powers to referdisputed issues on wages and salaries to the Commission where onlyone party to the dispute wanted this to be done and had finally decided against it. He had also considered how far the national incomes Commission should be concerned with profits and dividends.There was some risk that critics of the Commission might argue thatit was solely an instrument to restrain wages and salaries, and thatthe Government had taken care not to extend restraint to profits and dividends. Part of the answer was that the Commission was designed not merely to restrain increases in incomes that might otherwise have been excessive, but also to enable incomes to beincreased, where increases were justified, by isolating the appropriate cases; and any ex post facto enquiry would be liable to entailexamination of profits and dividends. But there still remained thepossibility that large profits might be earned or large dividends paid at the expense of other programmes. Some resources were at present under-employed and there was no doubt about the scope for improvement in the performance of the industries concerned withbuilding and building materials. The task before the Governmentwould be difficult but he was convinced that if an energetic approachwere adopted it could be achieved. Any immediate announcement should concentrate on slum clearance and should deal only in general terms with owner-occupation, building to let and other features ofthe proposals. At a later meeting the steps to be taken for securingmore land and for further new towns could be considered in the lightof the reports to be submitted by the Home Secretary.The Cabinet (1) Approved, as general objectives and subject to later consideration of the political, economic and legislativeimplications, the proposals on housing policy set out inC (62) 145.(2) Took note that the public statement which would shortly bemade by the Minister of Housing, after consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, would stress theproposals relating to slum clearance and would deal onlyin general terms with owner-occupation and building to let.(3) Agreed to resume their consideration of green belt policy andnew towns in the light of the reports which would shortly be submitted by the Home Secretary on the distributionof industry and the growth of office building.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would give furtherconsideration to the machinery required to secureimplementation of their conclusions and to the timing ofannouncements about them.
illIndustrialDisputes(previous reference:CC. (62) 33rdConclusions,Minute 3)Steel4. The Minister of Labour said that a demarcation dispute had arisen between the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade workers and the Iron and Steel Trades Federation. A new technique for making steel involved the use of a converter lined with dolomiteblocks. These blocks had been laid by steel workers, whereas thebricks which lined open-hearth furnaces of the older pattern were laid by bricklayers. The bricklayers claimed that they should laythe dolomite blocks in the new plant. At the end of the precedingweek it had appeared that the leaders of the Bricklayers&apos; Union werein favour of arbitration or conciliation and that those of the SteelWorkers&apos; Union were prepared to accept arbitration at one particularplant, but not at others.   Subsequently, however, a meeting of the by an industry which had not thrown up any issue on wages and salaries for the Commission^ consideration. He thought that sucha case would be rare. The Government must not appear to be opposed to large profits except where these derived from monopolyinfluences or excessive protection. The Monopolies Commissionalready existed to make enquiries into such industries, but hesuggested that the Government might leave the way open to ask theCommission for an opinion in any particular case; and if theCommission advised that further action appeared to be justified itcould be taken either by referring the matter to the monopolies commission or perhaps by adjusting tariffs.The President of the Board of Trade said that, strictly, there wasno such thing as the profits of an industry; the profits were made byparticular concerns. If, therefore, the arrangement suggested by theChancellor of the Exchequer were adopted, it might be criticised bythe Trades Union Congress and by others as a subterfuge which wasnot intended to have any effect in practice. At the same time theproposal might alarm employers.In discussion it was pointed out that, in spite of its presentationaladvantages, the Chancellor^ suggestion would not meet the criticism that the Commission would not cover all incomes; rents, for instance,would still be excluded. Moreover, the enquiries of the monopolies commission took a long time, effective though they were in some circumstances. On the other hand, the Government had already declared that their incomes policy embraced profits and dividends;and, although it might be difficult to express them in precise statistics,the profits of an industry were commonly taken into account in wage and salary settlements.Summing up, the Prime Minister recalled that when he had announced the intention to set up the Commission he had referredto profits and dividends. He had pointed out that it might be argued that it would be wrong to restrain wages and salaries if the effectwere to increase profits and dividends, but that, in practice, whenprofits and dividends were rising, rises normally occurred also in wages and salaries. He had promised, however, that the Governmentwould by fiscal or any other appropriate means restrain any unduegrowth in aggregate profits that might follow from restraint in wagesand salaries. In relation to the National Incomes Commission, theproblem was to find a form of words that would make it clear thatthe Commission were not precluded from examining profits and dividends.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer so to frame theterms of reference of the National Incomes commission that the examination of profits and dividends would not be excluded.
Federationof rhodesia and Nyasa-land(previous reference:C.C. (62) 44thConclusions,Minute 2)SouthernRhodesia5. The First Secretary of State informed the Cabinet that thePrime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, Sir Edgar Whitehead, had expressed the wish to speak at the General Assembly of the united nations on the situation in Southern Rhodesia. Apart from being acourageous step he felt that a speech by Sir Edgar Whitehead might help to put the Southern Rhodesian situation in a better perspective.The Foreign Secretary said that, while he welcomed the idea of a personal intervention by Sir Edgar Whitehead, it would be preferable that this should take place in the Fourth Committee rather than in theGeneral Assembly. In the General Assembly it would be necessaryfor Sir Edgar Whitehead to speak from the United Kingdom seat;and this would tend to confirm the impression that Southern Rhodesiawas under the effective control of the United Kingdom Government.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,9th October, 1962.Executive of the Bricklayers&apos; Union had decided, apparently by asmall majority, to continue the strike, and to reject arbitration. the steel Workers&apos; Union, on the other hand, had now expressed their readiness to accept arbitration on the dispute for the whole industry.He had told the Bricklayers&apos; Union that he greatly regretted their action and he had encouraged the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.)to take action in accordance with their normal procedure in disputes between unions. A meeting had already been held between the spokesman of the T.U.C. and the unions&apos; leaders on the previous day and another had been arranged for that afternoon. It waspossible that this would need to be continued on the following day.Meanwhile, the Bessemer steel plant of Richard Thomas and BaldwinsLimited at Ebbw Vale had closed, and certain open-hearth furnacesmight be closed within a few days. It was hoped to keep other plants in operation until the middle of the following week, but after that thewhole industry might come to a halt unless the dispute had been resolved. The industry might lose permanently many of its orders to its oversea competitors. Some of the smaller firms with olderplant might never reopen, though this would not necessarily be detrimental to the economy, since the modern plants had been designed on a scale which should suffice to meet demand. He couldnot intervene further himself while the T.U.C. were attempting to mediate, but the Government could not stand aside if the industry were forced to close down. The courses open to him if the TUG.efforts proved unsuccessful were to appeal to the unions to settletheir differences, to set up a Court of Inquiry, or to use his good offices in conciliation or in persuading them to accept arbitration. He hadno means, however, of compelling the men to return to work.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.
