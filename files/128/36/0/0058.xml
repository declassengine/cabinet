IncomesPolicyRailwaymen&apos;sWages(previous reference:CC. (62) 56thConclusions,Minute 5)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Labour (C. (62) 143) reporting the views of the Wages Committeeon the current claims of the railway unions for increases in pay; two memoranda by the Minister of Transport (C. (62) 149 and 152) statinghis views on the merits of the claims and describing the means bywhich the Government might impose a particular solution; and anote by the Secretary of the Cabinet (C. (62) 151) covering an analysis of the claims and statistical data concerning them.The Minister of Labour said that the National Union of railwaymen had claimed increases variously calculated at 11-5 percent and 12-9 per cent in the pay of the lowest paid railwaymen, and5 - 65 per cent in the pay of the salaried staff whom they represented.The Transport Salaried Staffs&apos; Association and the Associated society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen had claimed 7 per cent. these claims had been presented as continuations of the earlier claims inrespect of which a 3 per cent increase had been granted as from 1st April, 1962. The Government must decide their view on these claims before the Chairman of the British Transport Commission,Dr. Beeching, met the unions to give them the Commission^ answer in the course of the week beginning 15th October. The Minister ofTransport had advised the Wages Committee that Dr. Beeching was likely to want authority to offer 6 per cent and was disposed to offer the full amount at the outset and to refuse to negotiate on it; but until Dr. Beeching had completed his review of the claims it wouldnot be known definitely what figure he would want to offer. Themajority of the Wages Committee had thought that 6 per cent wouldbe too much and might seriously damage the Governments incomes policy; but they were all agreed that 3 per cent would be tolerable,and some of them had thought that there should be negotiatinglatitude up to 4 per cent or even a little more. The Committee had seen attractions in presenting a Government view in terms of the total amount of cash which the Commission would be authorised to spendon the increases, rather than in terms of a percentage of the railwaymen&apos;s wage rates; but it was not clear that this would be practicable. The main considerations which had influenced themajority of the Committee had been that the cost of a 6 per cent increase would amount to  24 million, all of which would fall onthe Exchequer, and that damaging repercussions must be expected,particularly in the engineering industry where a settlement had beenreached earlier in the summer which had been satisfactory in relationto incomes policy.The Minister of Transport said that his own views were influenced by his responsibility for the management of the railways; he was anxious not to jeopardise the plan for reorganisation, which would open the possibility of substantial relief to the Exchequer.Dr. Beeching had adopted methods of consultation with the railway staff and their representatives modelled on those with which he hadbeen familiar in Imperial Chemical Industries. In this he thoughtthat Dr. Beeching was attempting to swing the railway unions tooabruptly away from the traditional methods of negotiation in therailway industry. But he hoped it would be possible to persuade himto alter this method. He also considered that, although considerationof the wage claim would now take place concurrently with theconsideration of redundancy in the railway workshops, Dr. Beechingwould be able to keep the two matters separate in negotiation.In discussion the following points were made:(a) Some of the leaders of the railway unions had beenembarrassed by Dr. Beeching&apos;s tactics in presenting his proposals on redundancy and redundancy payments in the railway workshops.
They recognised that sooner or later they would have to talk aboutthe Commission^ workshop redundancy plan and they were anxiousto ensure that they would be given more freedom of manoeuvre whenthe programme of line closures was announced later in the year. Bythis they meant that they would prefer something closer to the practiceof wage bargaining, since this would make it easier to persuade the rank and file to accept the agreement with due credit to the unions.(b) Dr. Beeching had held a series of meetings with the railway unions at which he had explained the need for a reduction in thelabour force in the railway workshops and the extent of the redundancy, and then on 19th September had produced a detailedplan. But at the same time as he laid this plan before the leadersof the unions, he had also made it known through the localmanagements to the men on the shop floor. The union leaders hadthus found themselves unable to suggest that a better result wouldhave been achieved by less redundancy in one workshop and more in another, since the men in both workshops knew what theCommission had suggested.(c) Dr. Beeching should be urged to change his tactics, not onlyin relation to the current wage claims, but also in relation to the redundancy from the projected closures of railway lines. There wasstatutory provision for opportunities for raising objection to proposalsfor the closure of passenger services, and it was for the Minister ofTransport to determine these cases. There was no similar procedure in relation to goods services. It would be important to ensure that,when the plan for closure of lines was announced, the public would realise that particular lines would only be closed if the Governmentwere satisfied that it was not necessary to keep them open for socialreasons until alternative travel facilities could be provided. If a linewere kept open in such circumstances, however, it would have to berecognised that the loss would not be laid to the charge of the british transport Commission as a commercial undertaking.(d) There would be advantage in bringing together the problemsof the pay claims, the workshop redundancies and the redundanciesattributable to line closures. Ministers had proposed to Dr. Beechingthat if he could persuade the unions to accept the redundancy schemes,including the Commission^ proposed redundancy payments, this initself might be a justification for a somewhat higher increase in paythan in other industries which did not face difficulties of the same order.Summing up, the Prime Minister said that it was important to overcome resistance to redundancies in the railways. The process ofeconomic growth entailed the contraction of some industries, and the objective should be to facilitate the transfer of labour to the growingindustries. Whatever might be the suitable method of conductingstaff relations in a new industry, in an old industry such as the railwaysit would be a mistake to depart abruptly from traditional methods ofbargaining. The prevailing opinion in the Cabinet was in favour of attempting to settle the wage claims by an opening offer in the region of 3 per cent from a current date, holding in reserve the possibilityof a rather higher offer if the unions were ready, in return, to acceptthe proposals on workshop redundancy and on the amount of redundancy payments, both in themselves and as a precedent forredundancies created by the closure of lines.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofTransport to explain to the Chairman of the british transport Commission the Governments views as expressedby the Prime Minister in summing up the cabinets discussion.
ill(The Queen&apos;speeches onthe Proroga-tion and opening ofParliamentProrogationSpeechOpeningSpeech2. The Cabinet had before them notes by the First Secretaryof State (C. (62) 146 and 147) covering drafts of The Queeifs speeches on the Prorogation and on the Opening of Parliament.The Cabinet agreed upon a number of amendments of the draftcirculated under cover of C. (62) 146.The Cabinet (1) Invited the First Secretary of State to put before the PrimeMinister for submission to The Queen a revised draft ofthe Prorogation Speech, taking account of the amendmentsapproved in the Cabinefs discussion.In discussion of the draft circulated under cover of C. (62) 14Vvarious amendments were suggested and approved. It was agreedthat the references to legislation which would be required if theUnited Kingdom joined the European Economic Community shouldbe further considered and that a revised draft of this paragraph should be brought before the Cabinet at a later meeting.The Cabinet (2) Invited the First Secretary of State to circulate, forconsideration at a later meeting, a revised draft of theOpening Speech, taking account of the points raised in discussion.Supply ofArmsMiddle East(previous reference:C.C. (62) 57thConclusions,Minute 3)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof State for Foreign Affairs (C. (62) 150) covering a report preparedby officials of the Departments concerned, in pursuance of theCabinet&apos;s request of 20th September, on the political and economic implications of supplying ground-to-air missiles to countries in theMiddle East.The Foreign Secretary said that it had now become publiclyknown that the United States Government were prepared to considersupplying these missiles to Israel. There was, however, a conflict ofevidence about the firmness of their offer. The Israeli ForeignMinister, whom he had seen in New York, had said that the americans had given a definite undertaking to supply Hawk missiles, thoughprice and delivery date had still to be negotiated. The United states authorities had said that, while they had indicated that they wereprepared in principle to offer to supply these weapons, no negotiationswith Israel had yet been undertaken. In these circumstances he was inclined to ask the United States Secretary of State to tell him franklywhat the intentions of the Administration were. There was no doubtthat the offer had been made for reasons of domestic politics. If,having secured the immediate political benefit, they now intended to delay the delivery of the missiles, it might suit us to refrain from anyattempt to sell our missiles to Arab countries in the Middle East; for,as was shown by the note annexed to C. (62) 150, a policy of offeringthese weapons to Arab countries was likely to involve us in some political embarrassment. If, on the other hand, the sale of Hawkmissiles to Israel was actually imminent, he considered that british manufacturers of equivalent weapons must be allowed to make enquiries of those Arab countries who were in a position to pay forthem, though they must understand that, if any order was obtained,the United Kingdom Government would have to consider the politicaland financial implications of executing it.
In discussion the following points were raised:(a) If any such orders were obtained they would have to be fulfilled by supplying weapons already delivered to the Royal AirForce. The sales would therefore bring little immediate financialadvantage to the British aircraft industry. The transaction would,however, be of ultimate value to the industry on account of the further orders which might be expected in the future.(b) There was no doubt that Israel would prefer to obtain thesemissiles from the United States, and it would now be inexpedient tooffer to supply missiles of British manufacture to Israel. Indeed, ifany such offer were made, it would tend to diminish the prospect ofobtaining orders from Arab States.(c) It was unfortunate that the United States should have made this unilateral breach of their long-standing agreement with theUnited Kingdom and France to refrain from sales of military equipment which would disturb the balance of military strength inthe Middle East. If, therefore, the United States Administrationwere ready to delay the supply of these missiles to Israel, it wouldbe expedient that we should refrain from making any more rapiddelivery of British missiles to such Arab countries as were willingto buy from us. It might be possible to harmonise the timing of deliveries, both American and British.The Cabinefs conclusion was that the Foreign Secretary should arrange for the United States Government to be informed that, ifthey intended to proceed with the delivery of Hawk missiles to Israel,British manufacturers of equivalent missiles would be advised to make enquiries into the possibility of sales to Arab countries in the middle east, though the United Kingdom Government would reserve theright to decide, in the light of the political and financial implications,whether any order so obtained should be executed. This message should, however, make it plain that we would have preferred tomaintain the earlier agreement about the supply of arms to countriesin the Middle East; and that, if we had a firm assurance that theUnited States would delay the delivery of Hawk missiles to Israelfor a substantial time, we would similarly delay any attempts to selicorresponding British missiles to Arab countries in the Middle East.If this assurance was not forthcoming within a few days, the Ministerof Aviation should advise the British firms concerned, in terms to beagreed with the Foreign Secretary, that it was open to them to make enquiries into the possibility of selling ground-to-air missiles to suchArab countries as could afford to pay for them. They should not make any such approach to Israel, and should inform the government if the Israelis made any approach to them.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to send a message to the UnitedStates Secretary of State in the terms of the Cabinefsconclusion, as set out above.(2) Agreed that, if this message failed to elicit a satisfactory response, the Minister of Aviation should advise british manufacturers of ground-to-air missiles, in terms to beagreed with the Foreign Secretary, that it was open tothem to make enquiries into the possibility of sellingground-to-air missiles to such Arab countries in theMiddle East as were in a position to pay for them.
NorthernIreland(previous reference:CC. (61) 11thConclusions,Minute 6, and cc. (61) 57thConclusions,Minute 2)Short Brothersand Harland,Ltd.CC. 58 (62)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence and the Minister of Aviation (C. (62) 144) about the futureof Short Brothers and Harland, Ltd.The Minister of Defence said that Shorts, who were largely owned by the Government and were dependent on Government orders, werein serious financial difficulties. These had arisen partly because the firm&apos;s production costs were so high that they could not compete withother British firms; and partly because they had not succeeded inobtaining any orders, apart from the Governments order for10 aircraft, for the Belfast freighter They had expected orders fora further 20 aircraft and completion of those which were on order would result in a loss of about  15 million. If further work andfinancial assistance could not be obtained very soon the firm wouldbe unable to carry on.The company had suggested that their problems would be easedif they could develop for the Royal Air Force a tactical freighter toreplace the Beverley/ Hastings aircraft now in service. the requirement for a tactical freighter would have to be given furtherconsideration, but even if the project (known as O.R.-351) proved tobe realistic it would be a mistake to hold out any hope that development and construction could be entrusted to Shorts. A more practical course would be that the firm should gradually discontinuetheir design work and be given production sub-contracts possiblyincluding some for the O.R.-351 itself. It would have to be accepted that this subcontracting would increase the cost of the project andwould be at the direct expense of the larger aircraft groups in Englandwhich were themselves running short of work. In any event money should be found (probably of the order of  10 million) to enable the firm to complete the work now in hand on the Belfast and Seacatmissiles for the Royal Navy. If sub-contracts could not be providedthere was no possibility of deferring for long the complete closure ofthe firm.The Home Secretary said that Northern Ireland Ministers weregravely concerned at the high rate of unemployment in NorthernIreland. Within the next three weeks it would be necessary to publish the report of a Working Party which had been examiningmeasures to bring about a lasting improvement. The report had assumed a limited but not critical fall in employment by Shorts, andthe statement of Government policy which would have to be madeon publication of the report would have to include some referenceto the future of the firm. Their labour force consisted of 7,000, ofwhom 1,000 were design staff, and the firm&apos;s position in the NorthernIreland economy was of considerable economic and political importance, Any decision which involved much reduction inemployment would be regarded as a breach of the Governmentsundertakings to maintain the firm as a fully balanced aircraft unit and would be heavily criticised in Northern Ireland. It would bedifficult to convince local opinion of the need to disband the designteam, since it appeared that the work which might be done by the firm would be undertaken instead either in the United States or inthe Midlands, where unemployment was at present at a low level.He hoped it would prove possible to adapt the O.R.-351 requirementso that Shorts would be able to handle it.In discussion there was general agreement on the need to providefunds to enable the work now in hand on Seacat missiles and the belfast strategic freighter to be completed. This work, together withcertain sub-contracting work on the VC-10, for which arrangements had already been made, would keep the firm going for about nine months. By about the end of the year it should, however, be possibleto take decisions on the requirement for a tactical freighter; and untilO
those decisions were taken it would be inappropriate to make any announcement about the running down of the design team at Shorts.Consideration should meanwhile be given to the possibility that thenumber of strategic freighters required had been under-estimated:further examination might show that more Belfasts would in fact be required. It was recognised that to enlarge the order for Belfastssolely for employment reasons would be an expensive way of reducingunemployment in Northern Ireland and that for the same outlay itmight be possible to secure a more lasting improvement in thesituation there. In modern conditions the competitive disadvantagessuffered by Northern Ireland were most evident in the aircraft industry, and these disadvantages would become more acute if theUnited Kingdom became part of the European Common Market.This point should be kept in mind in examining whether the firm&quot;spremises could in the long run be used for production of somethingother than aircraft.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that funds should be provided to enable ShortBrothers and Harland, Ltd., to complete work on theorders they held for Seacat missiles and the Belfaststrategic freighter.(2) Agreed that enough sub-contracting work should be placed with the firm to keep most of the labour force employed for at least nine months.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theMinister of Aviation and the Secretary of State for Air,to submit to a meeting of the Cabinet before the end of1962-(i) proposals arising from the obsolescence of the tacticalfreighter aircraft now in service; and(ii) a review of the number of Belfast strategic freightersrequired for the Royal Air Force.(4) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to consider theuses to which the premises of Short Brothers and Harland,Ltd., could be put if they were no longer required for aircraft production.Cabinet Office, S.W.J,4th October, 1962.
