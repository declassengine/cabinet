2. The Minister of Labour said that the threat of an officialstrike at the Ford Motor Company works at Dagenham had been withdrawn in order to allow negotiations to take place between theunions and the management. Although the unions had somesympathy for the object which the management had in mind, namely the removal from their employment of a number of known andavowed trouble-makers, they had been placed in a difficult position by the refusal of the management to consult them in advance aboutthe selection of the men to be declared redundant or about the undertakings which the management had tried to secure from all their workers as a condition of further employment. In his view itwould be necessary for the management to make some concession to the unions; the most obvious concession would be agreement todiscuss with the unions the individual cases of the men whom the firm wished to declare redundant or to dismiss. He would beprepared, if necessary, to see the Chairman of the Company privately to urge on him the importance of finding some reasonable compromise on these lines and to offer to establish some arbitral machinery todeal with cases in which the unions and the company could not reach agreement; he was, however, anxious to avoid associating theGovernment publicly with action which would in many quarters beregarded as a retreat by the management from the stand they had previously taken.In discussion it was suggested that it would be undesirable forthe Government to set up arbitral machinery which might have theappearance of derogating from the right of management to decidewhom to employ and whom to discharge. It would be worth whileconsidering whether some other compromise, based perhaps on rather more generous redundancy terms, might not be acceptable to theunions.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Labour, in any further action whichhe might think it right to take, either with the management of the Ford Motor Company at Dagenham or with theunions concerned, to bear in mind the point raised in their discussion.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster-General (C. (62) 381) covering the draft of a White paper on broadcasting and television.The Postmaster-General recalled that in the White Paper on broadcasting and Television (Cmnd. 1770), published in July, theGovernment had given an interim statement of their views on theReport of the Committee on Broadcasting (the Pilkington Report).The substance of the draft White Paper annexed to C. (62) 181 hadbeen approved by the Ministerial Committee on Broadcasting and television, but there were some points on which the Committee hadnot reached agreed conclusions. On the main question, however,namely, the recommendation in the Pilkington Report for a radicalreorganisation of independent television, there had been full agreement; and the draft contained an exposition of the reasons whythe recommendation could not be accepted and of the Government&apos;sproposals for redefining the relationship between the independent television Authority and the programme companies.   The Authoritya 21. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
would have a much more active role than in the past in connexionwith programme standards, control of networking and control of advertising. The draft also dealt with certain other matters particularly the question of a second programme of independent television, local sound broadcasting and pay-television on whichthe Government, in the interim White Paper, had reserved their views;and with a number of further points of general interest, includingPress interests in programme companies, a proposed levy on theprofits of programme companies and the future financing of theBritish Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.). It would be convenient to present the White Paper shortly before Christmas, when it was hoped that the Television Bill could also be introduced; if the twocould be published about the same time there might be no need fora separate debate in Parliament on the White Paper. Early approvalwas, however, required for the main points of policy dealt with in theWhite Paper, since progress could not be made with drafting the bill until these points had been settled.In discussion there was general agreement that the paragraphsin the draft which explained the Governments reasons for rejecting the Pilkington recommendations on the future of the Authority and set out the Governments alternative proposals for control ofnetworking and programme planning held a satisfactory balance between the extreme positions which had been taken up on the onehand by the Pilkington Committee (who had considered that thepurposes of broadcasting could not be achieved so long as the saleof advertising time remained in the hands of the programme companies) and on the other hand by those who thought that thepresent system should not be altered. There would be substantialsupport for measures tending to reduce the dependence of independent television on the four main programme companies and to ensure thatthe smaller companies would have a better opportunity than was open to them at present to contribute programmes of their own. Inthe detailed working out of the proposed levy system it might prove possible to help the smaller companies financially by adjusting therate of levy to be imposed on them.The Cabinet felt, however, that the question of Press participation in programme companies had not been dealt with adequately inparagraph 21 of the draft. In this part of their discussion thefollowing points were raised:(a) The Royal Commission on the Press, under Lord Shawcross,had recently reaffirmed the objections put forward by the PilkingtonCommittee to the control of programme companies by Press interests.Neither the Royal Commission nor the Pilkington Committee had however defined with any precision the circumstances in which a press interest in a programme company should be regarded asdominant. It could also be argued that the case for preventing a press interest becoming dominant had not been made out. But itwould not in any case be satisfactory to dismiss the subject, as inparagraph 21, with a statement that the Postmaster-General wouldbe empowered &quot; to direct the Authority to suspend or cancel the contract of a company in which a newspaper holding gives rise toabuse &quot;.(b) The basis of the case for taking special action againstdominance by Press interests was that control by one group of personsover channels of communication through both Press and televisionwas in principle offensive. If there were, as the law and government policy recognised, objections to monopolistic practices in otherindustries, it was difficult to deny that similar tendencies incommunications ought to be kept under control. It would not besufficient to say, in answer to criticism of inaction on this point, thatthe links at present existing between the Press and programme companies had been established for the legitimate purpose of
CC. 69 (62)protecting advertising revenue and did not in practice give rise toabuse. Some people would hold that the violence of the reactionby the interested Press to the Pilkington Report was in itself evidenceof an undesirable situation; and, although the Thomson interests in scottish Television appeared not to have given rise to any definableabuse, the latent danger they represented could not be ignored.(c) There might, however, be real difficulties in defining themeasures required. There would certainly be difficulty in definingwhat was meant by an abuse and in safeguarding the Postmaster-General against claims for damages arising out of the suspensionor cancellation of a contract. The specific proposal in paragraph 21of the draft would have to be reconsidered.(d) The fact that advertising agencies were prohibited fromholding shares in programme companies might provide a usefulprecedent. But this prohibition was absolute; and if any Pressparticipation were allowed the permissible limit would not be easy to define, since effective control could in practice be secured by acomparatively small holding.(e) It might, nevertheless, be worth considering whether theAuthority should be empowered to direct Press companies to divestthemselves within a limited time of share holdings in programme companies above a defined percentage. It must be recognised,however, that this might have the result of forcing the companies to dispose of their newspaper interests rather than their programmecompany interests and might thus lead to the disappearance of morenewspapers.Summing up this part of the discussion the Prime Minister saidthat further thought should be given to the principles on which theGovernment should approach the question of Press participationand also the more general question, dealt with in paragraph 22 ofthe draft, about the character of programme companies. ThePostmaster-General should consider, with the help of the lord president and the Lord Chancellor, whether the Government shoulddeclare themselves opposed altogether to Press participation; and,if not, how and how far such participation should be limited andunder what sanctions. The relevant passage in the draft should be revised and expanded in the light of the discussion and should bebrought before the Cabinet again at an early meeting.In further discussion of the draft the following additional points were raised:(/) Discussions were in progress between the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Postmaster-General about the proposed levy onthe profits of programme companies, which was referred to inparagraph 23. On the precedent of entertainment duty, which hadbeen adjusted to benefit the smaller cinemas, some adjustment mightbe made to assist the smaller programme companies.(g) Paragraph 38, on B.B.C. finance, did not add materially towhat had been said on this point in the interim White Paper. the ministerial Committee had accepted in principle the Pilkingtonrecommendation that the B.B.C. should be financed only from licence revenue, and means of ensuring this result would have to be further examined. The paragraph could, however, be held to imply that theGovernment might make some form of contribution and it would bebetter that no such inference should be drawn. The paragraph should therefore be omitted.(h) It might be desirable to explain in greater detail the steps which were being taken to eliminate excessive violence in programmes(paragraph 34) and to distinguish the purposes of the committees
on children and on educational broadcasts (paragraph 18). these points should be further examined in consultation with the HomeSecretary and the Minister of Education.(0 The Ministerial Committee had been generally in favour ofexperiments in pay-television. It was pointed out, however, thatwhile experiments might show whether there was any ground for theview that pay-television could not succeed in this country they wouldnot throw much light on the question whether the established servicesof the B.B.C. and the Authority would suffer if it did succeed. Therewas a danger that, since pay-television would be distributed by wireonly, at least at the outset, such major programme features as the organisers secured would be withheld from people living in the more remote parts of the country. In Scotland, in particular, there wouldbe objection to a pay-television service, and accordingly to theproposed experiments, on these grounds. The general view of theCabinet, was that safeguards could be devised against the pre-emptionof major feature programmes by pay-television, that there was insufficient ground for withholding permission for experiments bywire and that, on balance, it would be appropriate to proceed on thelines described in paragraphs 42-45 of the draft.(/) It would be desirable to proceed at once with the discussions(paragraph 46) on Party political broadcasting.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Postmaster-General to arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the points raised in their discussion of the draft White Paper annexed to C. (62) 181;and to arrange, in particular, for consultation with theLord President and the Lord Chancellor on the references to be made to Press interests in programme companies,and with the Home Secretary and the Minister ofEducation on the references to excessive violence.(2) Invited the Postmaster-General to submit to them at anearly meeting a revised draft of the White Paper on broadcasting.(3) Took note that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterwould proceed with discussions with the political parties and broadcasting authorities on Party politicalbroadcasting.Land(previous reference:CC. (58) 76thConclusions,Minute 2)Use of BushyPark4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Housing on the use of the buildings in Bushy Park which had beenvacated by the United States Air Force (C. (62) 175).The Minister of Housing said that, in view of the legal difficulties involved in using the buildings for housing homeless families, he had with regret decided to withdraw his proposal that they should be soused. It was however fair to add that the London County Council(L.C.C.) had shown no enthusiasm for the project. It would have presented them with severe administrative difficulties and would tosome extent have cut across the present lines of their policy; a newL.C.C. reception centre for homeless families would shortly be opened and in general they were anxious to avoid the provisionof accommodation for the homeless on a scale which might, howevermarginally, increase the size of the problem either by attracting morehomeless families into the London area, or by encouraging people who could have found other accommodation to regard themselves as homeless. The L.C.C. were also anxious to increase, wherever possible, the provision of open spaces and recreational facilitiesgenerally.
In discussion the following points were made:(a) To spend a substantial sum of public money of the order of 100,000 in demolishing buildings which could have been used for housing or for other purposes would attract a great deal of criticism.Legislation would, however, be required for any continued use of thebuildings, certainly for housing purposes, and it was unlikely thatthe Opposition would facilitate the necessary Bill without at the sametime involving the Government in a general and controversial debateabout the problem of the homeless. Legislation would equally berequired if the buildings were to be used for a teacher training college.(b) There would be great practical difficulty in allowing thebuildings to stand empty. Whatever arrangements were made forguarding them they would in all probability be occupied by squatters.Even their use on a more organised basis for housing purposes wouldnot protect the Government from criticism; it would not be regardedas creditable that the Government, after many years in office, should find it necessary to convert surplus military accommodation of thiskind for use by homeless families.(c) Clear and specific pledges had been given by the Governmenton many occasions that as soon as occupation by the United states air Force had ceased the buildings would be demolished and thepark restored for public use and enjoyment. Criticism of theGovernment, if they were now to act in breach of those pledges,would be widespread and would not be confined to local residents.id) The Service Departments had no reserve of accommodation in this country in which to house units which might have to be withdrawn from overseas. The possible use of the buildings atBushy Park in this connexion should be urgently examined.(e) There would be no question of removing the recreational facilities, including a running track and tennis courts, which theUnited States Air Force had installed. It might be possible to devise a more elaborate and imaginative scheme for making use of some,at least, of the buildings in Bushy Park as part of a recreational centre-Summing up the Prime Minister said that a majority of Ministersclearly accepted the impracticability of using the buildings in BushyPark for housing purposes or for some such purpose as a teacher training college. Apart from the pledges which the Governmenthad already given, legislation would be involved. It was neverthelessunpalatable that, at a time when accommodation of every kind was at a premium, the Government should demolish these buildings at considerable expense. Some more constructive alternative shouidbe looked for. He would arrange for an urgent examination of thepossibility of retaining the buildings for contingent use by theServices, in the light of the very serious shortage of reserve barrackaccommodation in the country as a whole. Subject to the resultsof this examination it would be right to make the maximum use ofsuch buildings as might be suitable for recreational purposes. Theobject should be to produce an imaginative and constructive schemewhich would command public support. Any buildings which couldnot be used as part of such a scheme would have to be demolished.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for an urgent examination of the possibility of using the buildings in Bushy Park, which had been vacated by the UnitedStates Air Force, for some military purpose.(2) In the light of the results of this examination invited theMinister of Public Building and Works, in consultationwith the other Ministers concerned, to prepare a schemefor making the most of the site, and of such buildings as could usefully be retained, for recreational purposes.
5i5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (62) 179) and by the Lord Chancellor and theLaw Officers (C. (62) 180) on the decision of the Birmingham city and Aston Villa Football Clubs to sue the Board of Customs and excise for repayment of Pool Betting Duly paid in respect of footballpools conducted between 1954 and 1960.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that local club supporters&apos;weekly pools, of which those run by Birmingham City and Aston Villawere typical, had at the outset involved no more than the purchase by the individual punter of a numbered card, prize money beingdistributed to the winning numbers. When it was pointed out to theclubs that pools run on these lines were in fact lotteries and thereforeillegal, they had altered the rules under which the pools were runwith the intention of turning them into systems of betting. Theyassumed, and it was implicit in this intention, that the pools wouldthen become liable for Betting Duty. The Customs and Excise alsoassumed this and the duty was accordingly paid. Later, however,one club, Stockport, had refused to pay the duty; the Customs and excise had felt obliged to sue and the Court had held that pools ofthis kind did not in fact constitute betting systems and that no taxwas payable. The Government had rectified the anomaly in theFinance Act, 1961, but had refused to refund duty which had been collected before the Stockport judgment. Birmingham City andAston Villa were now sueing for such a refund. The amountimmediately at stake was about  2 million, but if all the other footballclubs followed suit the total amount involved would be  7 or 8 million.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in his view there wasno moral or legal obligation on the Government to pay. In the firstplace it was worth noting that in so far as clubs were reclaimingrepayment because their pools had not involved betting, they wereadmitting them to have been lotteries and therefore illegal. It wasodd, to say the least, that the Government should be contemplatingthe repayment of large sums of money in respect of admittedly illegaltransactions by private organisations. Secondly, the defence thatthere had been a mutual mistake of law was valid and he consideredthat it should be pleaded; the Law Officers held that this defencecould not be used unless it had first been established that any sumsrepaid to the clubs could not be distributed by them in turn to thosewho had borne the original burden of the duty. The Law Officersheld that this burden has been borne by the prizewinners and that theclubs should therefore be asked to say whether they could identify the prizewinners. In his own view, as a matter of fact rather thana matter of law, the burden of duty had been borne by the individualpunters who could manifestly not be identified. There was a parallelhere in the case of entertainment duty; the burden of entertainmentduty had clearly been borne by the individual theatregoer, since theduty had been reflected in the price of the ticket. He appreciated thedifficulty in which the Law Officers found themselves, but in the last resort the responsibility for a decision must rest with the Ministerimmediately concerned; he was fully prepared to take the decisionto use the defence of a mutual mistake of law in the present case andto accept responsibility for it.The Lord Chancellor said that he saw the position differently.There could be no doubt that in the case of these particular pools theRevenue had illegally extracted duty and there was a correspondingobligation on them to repay it. A rather similar case had arisen soon after the end of the war when the Customs had been sued for thereturn of money paid as purchase tax. Mistake of law had beenpleaded in defence and the Judge had remarked that this defence wasone which in his view ought to be used with great discretion.Following discussion in Parliament the then Lord Chancellor had inBettingandGaming(previous reference:C.C. (57) 71stConclusions.Minute 5)Pool BettingDuty
1949 committed the Government to following a consistent policy in questions of this kind. The essence of that consistency was that thedefence of a mistake of law would only be sanctioned if the LawOfficers could be satisfied that the money, if repaid, would not get back into the hands of those who really bore the burden of paying it.What worried him about the present case was that there had been no effort to establish whether or not this condition could be fulfilled,i.e., whether the clubs could identify the prizewinners who, in his view, and that of all the Law Officers who had considered this questionover a period of years, were those on whom the burden of paying theduty had fallen. He thought it very likely that the clubs would notbe able, after so long a lapse of time, to identify the prizewinners.In that case the defence of mistake of law could be pleaded and thepolicy of consistency would have been maintained; if on the otherhand this defence were to be pleaded, despite the absence ofinformation which would justify it, then in his view it would benecessary to relieve the Law Officers of their present duty to secureconsistency of policy and Parliament would have to be informed inthat sense. He also thought it right to remind the Cabinet that in1961 the then Solicitor-General, in dealing with these particular cases,had given an assurance in Parliament that the policy of consistencywould be maintained.In discussion several Ministers expressed the view that thequestion whether the burden of duty had been borne in the first placeby the prizewinners or by individual punters might reasonably beconsidered to be a matter of fact, and therefore of individual judgment,rather than a matter of law. The view that the burden had beenborne by the prizewinners was supported by the rules of the StockportClub which provided that any under-payments or over-payments insuch matters as administration expenses would be reflected in theamount of the prizes; on the other hand, the wording of the relevantAct could be held to support the view that the duty was levied on the initial contribution and that to this extent its burden was borne bythe individual contributor. The view was also strongly expressed that in the absence of any moral obligation, particularly since the basisof the claim by the football clubs was tantamount to an admission that their pools had been lotteries and therefore illegal, it would be right to decide the issue on broad grounds of commonsense; there could be no doubt that the clubs had in fact no intention of repayingany sums they might recover either to their supporters or to theprizewinners. As against this, however, it might well be the case thatthe clubs would be unable to identify all the prizewinners and thata request to them to do so would provide full justification for pleadingthe defence of mistake of law. Considerable embarrassment might,however, be caused if the clubs were able to identify some, but not all,of the prizewinners or if one club could identify them and the othercould not.Summing up the Prime Minister said that he fully appreciated the difficulty which the Law Officers saw in proceeding on the lines which the Chancellor of the Exchequer had suggested and the embarrassment in which they believed that such a decision would place them. Nevertheless, the trend of the discussion had shownthat there was a considerable measure of support in the Cabinet forthe object which the Chancellor of the Exchequer was seeking tosecure and on practical grounds there was much to be said for his proposal. He hoped that the Cabinet would allow him to considerthe lines of a possible compromise, in consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer and with the Law Officers. To this end he wouldbe grateful if the Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers could arrangefor the drafting of the kind of letter which in their view it would be right to send to the two football clubs concerned; he assumed that
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th November, 1962.such a letter could be sent without prejudice and that it could be drafted in such a way as to make it improbable that the clubs couldso reply to it as to strengthen the chances of their suit succeeding.When such a draft had been prepared he would consider the matter further.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Law Officers, toarrange for the preparation of a draft letter to the birmingham City and Aston Villa Football Clubs on thelines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up.(2) Took note that in the light of this draft the Prime minister would, early in the following week, consider the matter further in consultation with the Ministers immediately concerned.
