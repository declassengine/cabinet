industrial disputes(previous reference:C.C. (61) 63rdConclusions,Minute 7)National DockStrike1. The Minister of Labour informed the Cabinet of the present state of negotiations between the National Association of port employers and representatives of the Trade Unions concerned. TheTrade Unions had demanded a shorter working week and a substantial increase in wages and had given formal notice of a national dock striketo start on 14th May if these demands were not met. It appeared thatthe Port Employers might be willing to make a concession on theworking week or to concede some increase in wages, but were notat present prepared to do both. A meeting of the National joint industrial Council would probably be held on 8th May and it wasonly in the light of this meeting that the likelihood of a settlement could be properly assessed. If the meeting failed to reach agreementhe would be asked to intervene and it would be his object to use thegood offices of his Ministry in bringing both sides together for a further meeting, probably on 9th May.The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet that officials hadalready examined the position which would arise if a dock strike tookplace and had considered the scope of the emergency measures whichmight be taken to meet it. Food stocks were sufficient for at least a fortnight and in the case of many commodities for three or four weeks.Stocks of fuel for electricity power stations were sufficient for abouta month and for gas works for about three weeks. There would,however, be great difficulty within two or three days in the disposalof London refuse if river lightermen were affected by the strike. while a Proclamation of Emergency would not be necessary for theemployment of troops on a small scale to handle perishable foodstuffs,it would be essential to issue a Proclamation and to make regulations under it if troops were to be used on a wider scale or if other measuresbecame necessary to deal with a prolonged strike. Such a strike would be likely to spread beyond the dock workers.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The plans which had been prepared in 1958 for the use oftroops had already been reviewed and brought up to date where necessary. It would be possible to provide up to 36,000 men, drawn from the three Services, without any adverse effect on the strategic reserve or on current training. This number would be adequate tounload ships carrying perishable foodstuffs and other essential supplies. It would, however, be necessary to hold detailed discussions with the port authorities as soon as possible in order to prepare a detailed plan for the introduction and build-up of Service manpower.It would also be necessary at an early stage to requisition propertynear the docks for billeting. The discussions with the port authorities could not be kept secret and should, for this reason, be delayed until after the meeting of the National Joint Council on 8th May.(b) In order to demonstrate the Governments determination todeal firmly with the emergency it would be desirable to issue a proclamation of Emergency as soon after 8th May as possible if themeeting on that date had failed to produce a settlement. There wouldbe no legal difficulty about the issue of a Proclamation, but it wouldbe an empty gesture unless at the same time, or very shortly afterwards,Emergency Regulations were made under it. The Regulations whichhad been prepared in 1958 should be reviewed and a selection shouldbe made of those Regulations which might be made immediately afterthe issue of a Proclamation, leaving the others to be introduced as theneed for them became apparent.(c) While for practical reasons it would be necessary to concentrate Service labour in the early stages of a strike on theunloading of foodstuffs and essential supplies, consideration shouldbe given to their later use on a wider scale, if necessary at the expenseof the military training programme, for loading as well as unloading
Federationof RhodesiaandNyasaiand(previous reference:C.C. (62) 28thConclusions,Minute 4)2. The Home Secretary reminded the Cabinet that it was his present intention to make a statement in the House of Commons inthe course of the debate on 8th May in which he would explain thenature of the new initiative being taken by the United KingdomGovernment in Central Africa and would, in particular, announce theappointment of a small mission of special advisers to consider withthe Government of Nyasaland the consequences which would flow from Nyasaland&apos;s secession from the Federation and the possibilityof other forms of association. The leader of the Malawi congress party, Dr. Banda, who had been informed of this intention, had agreed for his part to postpone his earlier demand for Nyasaland&apos;s immediatesecession and had agreed to await the findings of the mission. this represented a considerable concession on his part, given his own views and the attitude of his supporters in the Malawi Congress Party.The Federal Prime Minister on the other hand, while he had taken a reasonable line in the course of his election campaign and had indicated publicly that he would be prepared to see changes in thepresent structure of the Federation, had asked that no reference tothe appointment of the mission should be made at this stage and that action should be suspended until after the Home Secretary^forthcoming visit to the Federation. The Federal Prime minister had taken particular exception to a passage in the draft statement which could be read as an acknowledgment by the United KingdomGovernment of Nyasaland&apos;s unqualified right to secede from theFederation.ships and for keeping priority exports on the move. The use of troopsin this way to maintain full port services might have legal implicationswhich would need to be examined.(d) Particular difficulty would be caused in the distribution of oiland petrol if the crews of tug boats were to come out on strike in sympathy with the dockers. It would be desirable to discuss in strict confidence with representatives of the oil industry the steps whichmight be taken to meet such an emergency.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no overt action to deal with a national dock strikeshould be taken before the meeting of the National joint industrial Council on 8th May.(2) Agreed that if the meeting on 8th May failed to reach asettlement, consideration should be given to the issue ofa Proclamation of Emergency later in the same week.(3) Invited the Home Secretary to consider which of the draftEmergency Regulations prepared in 1958 should bebrought into force immediately after the issue of a proclamation,(4) Invited the Secretary of State for War to consider further the practicability of using Service manpower, not only forthe unloading of perishable foodstuffs and essential supplies, but for the maintenance of fuller port services including the loading of priority goods for export.(5) Invited the Attorney-General to consider the legalimplications of such wider use of Service manpower in the docks.(6) Authorised the Minister of Power to discuss in confidence and in general terms with representatives of the oil industry the situation which would arise if the crews of tug boats in the London area came out on strike in sympathy withthe dockers.
IllLocalGovernmentOrganisationGreaterLondon(previous reference:C.C. (61) 65thConclusions,Minute 6)3. The Lord President said that a small Committee of ministers under his chairmanship had been considering the size of the centralarea for education which had been foreshadowed in the White paper on London Government (Cmnd. 1562). It had become evident (afterre-examination of the case for reverting to the proposal of the RoyalCommission for a division of responsibility between the greater london Council and the boroughs and of the case for conferringeducation functions on the boroughs themselves) that there were acutepractical difficulties in adopting as the central area any area other thanthe existing area of the London County Council (L.C.C.).   This areaC.C. 29 (62)The Home Secretary said that his present view was that theimportance of retaining Dr. Banda&apos;s goodwill outweighed the dangerof a further worsening of relations with the Federal Prime Ministerand that on these grounds he should make his statement as proposed,if necessary re-drafting its terms in order to give as little offence aspossible to the Federal Prime Minister, while still giving Dr. Bandasufficient encouragement to make it possible for him to ltold his line with his own supporters. The debate in Parliament would be on a motion drafted in general terms which Government supporters should find no difficulty in accepting.In discussion the following points were made:(a) In present circumstances it was imperative to retainDr. Banda&apos;s co-operation and to this end it would be necessary to announce in Parliament on 8th May the appointment of the smallmission of special advisers and to indicate in general terms that dr. Banda&apos;s views and the views of his supporters on Nyasaland&apos;right to secede from the Federation had been accepted as one of thefacts which the advisers would have to take into account in the courseof their enquiry. It would not, however, be necessary to imply thatthe United Kingdom Government had formally acknowledgedNyasaland&apos;s right to secede at this stage.(b) The motion to be tabled on the occasion of the debate inParliament on 8th May should omit reference to the wishes of the peoples of the territories concerned; for it had long been clear thatit would not be possible to reach any solution which did not run counter to the wishes of some at least of the peoples concerned. the motion should do no more than invite the House to support her majesty&apos;s Governments efforts in seeking a solution of the problemsof Central Africa.(c) There were encouraging signs that Dr. Banda was becoming increasingly aware of the economic difficulties which Nyasaland wasfacing and of the consequent need for continuing association andco-operation with neighbouring territories. This made it all the moreimportant to support his political position at the present juncture.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Home Secretary should announce inParliament on 8th May the appointment of a small mission of special advisers to consider with the Government of nyasaland the consequences which would flow fromNyasaland&apos;s secession from the Federation and thepossibility of other forms of association.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to amend the terms of his statement in the light of their discussion.(3) Invited the Home Secretary to amend the terms of the motion for debate on 8th May in the light of their discussion.
would have a population of about 3 million and the White Paper had indicated that the Governments objective in discussions with thevarious authorities concerned would be to reach an agreement on an area with a population of about 2 million. Work by officials had beenput in hand to ascertain whether by adjustments on the peripheryof the L.C.C. area a defensible smaller area could be devised, but this work seemed unlikely to be fruitful. Adoption of the L.C.C. area for education might affect the structure of administration for other services, and some Ministers had felt that there would be serious political objections to this course; others had felt that there would hegreater disadvantage in insisting upon a smaller area, since it would bedifficult to defend this on any grounds connected with the well-being of the education service in London.In view of the keen public controversy which had arisen, an early statement on behalf of the Government was now necessary. Hesuggested that the Cabinet might approve a compromise proposal which he understood was acceptable to the Minister of Housing andLocal Government and to the Minister of Education. Under thisproposal responsibility for education in the area at presentadministered by the L.C.C. would be undertaken for a period of fiveyears by a statutory committee of the Greater London Council, with provision for review of the arrangement at the end of the period.Boroughs within the central area would have the opportunity ofasking the Minister of Education to agree that they might then takeover education functions and he would be empowered to define theconditions on which they might do so. If a compromise on theselines were approved it would be convenient that a statement shouldbe made by the Minister of Housing and Local Government in thecourse of a speech he would be making on 4th May.In discussion it was recognised that the Government would beopen to criticism whether they adhered to the idea of an educationarea of about 2 million people or modified the White Paper approachby introducing an interim arrangement such as had been suggested.Any material departure from the White Paper would be taken in some quarters as an indication of indecision on the part of the Governmentand might have effects which were difficult to assess on theadministration of services other than education. On the other hand,the interim arrangement would enable the Government to dispose of any argument that educational efficiency was being sacrificed to political considerations; and it would keep open the possibility thatin the long run education might be a borough responsibility throughoutGreater London. Education would in any case be a boroughresponsibility in relation to the 5 million Londoners living outside thecentral area. The interim arrangement would, moreover, simplify the handling of a number of difficult transitional problems and wouldprovide an opportunity for the boroughs which would be constituted in the central area to assess the financial implications of taking over responsibility for education.The success of the arrangement would in large measure dependon the extent to which in the early years educational administration in areas adjoining the central area could be brought up to the standardof that area so that the fullest exchange of pupils could be securedamong all the authorities concerned. The statutory committee wouldbe given, and would be expected to exercise, powers to co-opt membersadditional to those representing constituencies within the central area;but there would be no ready means of giving persons who representedconstituencies elsewhere in Greater London a share (save as individuals) in the administration of education in the central area.The general view of the Cabinet was that, on balance, the interim arrangement which had been suggested should be accepted and that,subject to further soundings among the Governments supporters inLondon, an early announcement should be made.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,2nd May, 1962.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that education in the area at present administered by the London County Council should for a period of fiveyears be the responsibility of a statutory committee ofthe Greater London Council, with provision to enableindividual boroughs which would be constituted in that area to take over responsibility, with the consent of theMinister of Education, at the end of that period.(2) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster and the Minister of Education, to announce this decisionon 4th May.
