CC. 34 (62)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Soistfc-east asia treaty organisation laos(previous reference:CC. (62) 33rdConclusions,Minute 1)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the decision of the UnitedStates Government to send reinforcements to Thailand had beentaken in order to stiffen the morale of the Thais and to deter theRussians from encouraging further aggression by the Pathet Lao.The United States Government had suggested that other membersof the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) shouldassociate themselves with this action by sending token forces intoThailand. The Governments of Australia and New Zealand hadalready indicated their readiness to do this. He hoped the cabinet would agree that the United Kingdom should also contribute tokenforces, if so requested by the Government of Thailand. The DefenceCommittee recommended that, if such a request were made, v/we should send back the squadron of fighter aircraft which had recently taken part in a SEATO exercise in Thailand.The Prime Minister said that, subject to the Cabinets approval,he would say, in answer to a Private Notice Question in the House ofCommons that afternoon, that if the Government of Thailand askedfor our assistance, we should be ready to supply a squadron of fighter aircraft in support of the United States forces already inThailand. He would explain that this action was being taken underArticle 4 (2) and (3) of the Manila Treaty.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in full agreement withthis proposal.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, if the Government of Thailand asked for our assistance, we should send a squadron of fighter aircraft to support the United States forces in Thailand.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would make a statement to this effect in the House of Commons that afternoon.(3) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to inform theGovernment of Malaya of the response which we proposed to make to any such request from theGovernment of Thailand.EducationGrants toStudents(previous references:CC. (62) 18thConclusions,Minute 4 and cc. (60) 61stConclusions,Minute 5)3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the chief secretary, Treasury (C. (62) 69), the Minister of Education (C. (62) 71)and the Lord President (C. (62) 75) on the level of grants to students.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that, while he did notquestion the basis on which the proposed increases had been calculated, he found difficulty in reconciling them with currentGovernment policy for university expenditure generally. At a timewhen the Government had found it impossible to meet in full the requests of the University Grants Committee and were limiting theincrease in the salaries of university teachers to 3 per cent., ministers would appear to have a distorted sense of priorities if students weregiven substantially larger increases amounting in some cases to 32 percent. He recognised, however, that the Government were placed inan invidious position by the recommendations of the Hill Committeeand that it would be difficult to justify the total rejection of theiirecommendations. He had, therefore, proposed as a compromisethat the increases should be implemented over a three-year period.
The Minister of Education said that the whole basis of thepresent system of grants for students might have to be re-examinedwhen the report of the Committee for Higher Education had beenreceived. Meanwhile, he saw no alternative to accepting the increases which he had proposed. When the Government hadwidened the field of eligibility for these grants, they had undertaken to review not only the standards of grants as between the various types of university and the other centres of higher education, butalso the level of individual grants in relation to the students&apos; needs.The Hill Committee had advocated an average increase of the orderof 30s. per week; his own proposals were for an increase of the orderof 15s. per week. This reduction of the Committee&apos;s proposalsalready involved an element of political risk, but could be justified on the ground that an increase of 15s. per week correspondedbroadly to the rise in the cost of the students&apos; budget since the lastreview in 1958. But to reduce the increase to 5s. a week, as suggestedby the Chief Secretary, would lead to very great difficulties. Theevidence available to him suggested that university teachers, in spiteof their disappointment about their own salaries, would support the increases to students which he proposed.The Lord President said that, whatever decision the cabinet might take on university students in general, he hoped they wouldacknowledge that the postgraduate students were in a specialcategory. There were only 3,000 of these students, and the futureof scientific teaching in this country depended on maintaining their numbers and quality. Postgraduate students in science were drawn from graduates with first or second-class degrees for whose servicesthere was keen competition. It was essential that a good proportionof the best students should be attracted into postgraduate work andthere were already signs that standards were declining. Nothing was more likely to damage our scientific and economic future than afalling-off in the quality of postgraduate and research students.Moreover, grants to postgraduate students were not treated asincome for tax purposes, and it was unjustifiable to use theGovernments present incomes policy as an argument for denyingthem the increase to which they were entitled.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The amount of individual grants to students in this countryand the number of students to whom they were granted produced a degree of State support for university education greater than inother European countries or in the United States. It might benecessary at some stage, particularly if the Committee on higher education recommended substantial increases in the total number of university students, to reconsider the whole financial basis for higher education. The Committee had already been giveninformation about the systems in force in other countries. radical changes of this kind would, however, have to form part of along-term policy: decisions on the present proposals for increasedgrants would have to be taken in the context of existing policy.(b) Two Committees had already examined the system of grants to students, in terms of eligibility and of amounts. Therecommendations of the Anderson Committee on eligibility had been severely pruned, and under the proposals of the Education ministers and the Lord President the proposals of the Hill Committee on theamounts of grants would be similarly reduced. It would be politically undesirable to reject the recommendations altogether orto cut them to such an extent that the awards eventually made boreno relation to the line of argument on which the Committee hadjustified their own recommendations.The Cabinet Agreed that awards to students including postgraduatestudents should be increased on the basis proposed by the
UnitedNationsChineseRepresentation(previous reference:C.C. (61) 71stConclusions,Minute 2)4. The Committee had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C. (62) 70) on Chinese representation incompetent United Nations organisations.The Foreign Secretary said that certain agencies of the united nations had the right to determine their own membership. these were known as &quot; competent organisations&quot;. There was little likelihood that the Chinese Communist Government would apply for membership of any of these organisations, so long as they were excluded from the General Assembly, and they would probablyreject such membership if it were offered. But the United StatesGovernment thought it possible that some member of the united nations might make such a proposal with a view to embarrassing theWestern Powers, and they had been considering what attitude theyshould adopt in that event. They would have no difficulty in opposing such a proposal since they had voted against the admissionof Communist China to the United Nations itself. Our position was, however, more difficult since we had voted in 1961 in favourof Communist China&apos;s admission. He had suggested in his papera compromise solution under which the United kingdom representative would rest on the terms of a recommendation of theGeneral Assembly on 14th December, 1950, which in effect required the membership of other organs of the United Nations to be alignedwith the membership of the General Assembly itself. On the basisof this recommendation it would be possible to explain that, while we had voted for the admission of Communist China to the general assembly, our view had not prevailed and we therefore accepted for the time being that her membership of other organs of the united nations would be undesirable. He had suggested in the Annex tothe paper a possible form of words which the United kingdom representative in the United Nations might use if occasion arose.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to inform the UnitedStates Secretary of State that, in the event of a proposalto seat Communist China in any competent organisationof the United Nations, the United Kingdom Government,while reaffirming publicly their view that the chinese communist Government should be seated in the united nations, would oppose their membership of any subordinateorganisation, under the terms of the General Assemblyresolution of 14th December, 1950, so long as they were still excluded from membership of the General Assembly.incomes policy(previous reference:C.C. (62) 33rdConclusions,Minute 4)5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in the discussion at the Economic Policy Committee on the previous day there hadbeen general agreement on the need for early action to reinforce theGovernment^ incomes policy. Preliminary consideration had beengiven to a number of possible steps, which were being further examined by officials and would be considered again by theCommittee at a meeting during the following week. These included the making of a general direction or directions empowering theappropriate Ministers to call in, for their prior approval, wage settlements proposed in the nationalised industries; discouragementof breaches of the incomes policy in private industry by the impositionC.C. 34 (62)Education Ministers and by the Lord President as set outin the Annex to C. (62) 71.
of discriminatory taxation or by price control; strengthening of themachinery at the Governments disposal for defeating strikes; andrevaluing the pay of particular groups of work-people, possibly bythe establishment of a form of standing Royal Commission.In discussion the following points were raised:(a) The public looked to the Government for a lead on the incomes policy to be adopted in the period before the national economic Development Council could be expected to put forwardconsidered recommendations. The urgency of giving such a lead hadbeen increased by the growing tendency to assume that economicconditions were improving and by the imminence of a further claim for increased wages on the railways.(b) The issues involved in giving a general direction to the nationalised industries would require careful consideration. It couldbe argued, on the one hand, that these industries were generally regarded as being almost as much within the control of theGovernment as the public services and that, in view of their deficits,public opinion would welcome Government intervention in wage claims in those industries. Such intervention would broaden the effective base for the incomes policy and might indeed make it easier to provide exceptional treatment for groups of workers, such asnurses and probation officers, whose present remuneration was insufficient. The effect on the private sector should be the greatersince employment in the nationalised industries was more comparable with employment in private industry. On the other hand, a general direction would tend to involve the Government itself in wage negotiations and might provoke sharp resentment both by the managements and by the unions in the nationalised industries; andany strike in protest against a wage award would, in effect, be astrike against the Government. Negotiations would become morerigid and might more readily break down; and it could not in anycase be guaranteed that the influence which the Government sought to exercise over settlements in private industry would in practice beany greater if the area of direct control were extended. Examinationof these issues would be assisted if the Cabinet were provided witha draft of the sort of direction which might be given.(c) Some part of the difficulty experienced in influencing private employers was due to the fact that the opportunity of exercisinginfluence often did not arise until negotiations had reached an advanced stage and concessions had been made. It might be useful if the departmental Ministers concerned with particular industriescould arrange to obtain earlier information about pendingnegotiations and could enter into general discussions with theemployers on the question of wage restraint.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to bring beforethem as soon as possible the draft of a general directionempowering the Ministers concerned with the nationalised industries to require proposed wage settlements in those industries to be submitted for their prior approval.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Ministers concerned, to consider how best tostrengthen the Governments ability to deal with extendedstrikes.(3) Agreed to resume their consideration of incomes policy inthe light of further discussions to be held by the economic policy Committee during the following week.
