The Prime Minister of Belgium,M. Spaak, was at present discussing the position with the United states authorities.   M. Spaak believed that in two respects the present views1. The Foreign Secretary said that the United StatesGovernment clearly intended to recognise the republican regime inthe Yemen before long. Their original intention had been to obtain,as a prior condition of recognition, statements from the Governmentsof Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Republic (U.A.R.)pledging themselves to a policy of non-intervention in Yemeni affairs as well as specific undertakings from the U.A.R. to withdraw its forces from the Yemen. They had also intended to secure from BrigadierSallal, the head of the republican regime in the Yemen itself,assurances of his readiness to seek and maintain good neighbourlyrelations with the surrounding territories. It now appeared that,while the President of the U.A.R., President Nasser, and BrigadierSallal might be prepared to accede to the request of the United StatesGovernment, it was improbable that the Governments of either SaudiArabia or Jordan would do so. Nevertheless, it was likely that theUnited States would proceed to recognition. There was increasingevidence of dissatisfaction with the present royalist regime in SaudiArabia and the United States Government might well have calculated that, with the possibility of revolutionary republican government inSaudi Arabia it would be to their advantage to establish as soon aspossible a working relationship with the republican regime in the yemen. In spite of reports of continued royalist successes in the yemen, there was as yet no evidence of any serious threat to the republican control of the more settled and populated parts of thecountry.Our own position was still complicated by the probability that recognition of the republican regime in the Yemen would have aseriously depressing effect on the morale of our supporters in AdenColony and the Aden Protectorate. Nevertheless, if the United StatesGovernment recognised the new regime, it would be almost inevitable that we should follow suit; preferably not simultaneously, but after ashort interval. Much would depend on the precise terms of the statements to be made by President Nasser and Brigadier Sallal. the texts were expected shortly and would be carefully studied inconsultation with the Governor of Aden. It was helpful that theUnited States Government, in their negotiations with President Nasserand with the Yemeni authorities, had been fully mindful of our special interests. It should not be assumed too readily that the new regime in the Yemen or President Nasser would seek to undermine ourposition in Aden by all means in their power. The Yemeniauthorities, quite apart from the harassment from the tribes to whichthey would be likely to be subject for a long period ahead, had an immense task facing them in improving the administration and the domestic economy of the Yemen itself; and the Egyptian authorities had recently declared that they would wish to see the British positionin Aden maintained, partly because of their interest in stableconditions in this area and partly because of their present differenceswith the Government of Iraq.
East-west relations(previous references:CC. (62) 57thConclusions,Minute 1, and cc (62) 59thConclusions,Minute 1)of the United States authorities were unrealistic; they appeared tothink it would be possible for the Union Miniere to divert a substantial part of their revenue to the Central Government of the Congo withoutprovoking a strong reaction from the Prime Minister of Katanga,Mr. Tshombe; they also seemed to have lost sight of the fact that important constitutional issues between Katanga and the CentralGovernment still remained for settlement.The Foreign Secretary said that, for his part, he had reminded the United States authorities that a solution of the present difficultiesin the Congo still depended on two main issues; an equitable divisionof revenue between Katanga and the Central Government and agreement on a constitution. He had further suggested that agreement on a division of the revenue might be the more readilysecured if the determination of the proportions to be paid to Katangaand the Central Government respectively were to be left to the judgment of some independent international body such as theInternational Monetary Fund. Following the same line of thoughtit might be acceptable both to Katanga and to the Central government if the settlement of the outstanding constitutional issues were to beentrusted to some African leader of standing and independence. ThePresident of Senegal or the Prime Minister of Nigeria might be acceptable to both parties concerned in the Congo and had bothindicated that they would be willing to undertake the task if it wereentrusted to them. It was however to be expected that the situation would deteriorate and that the question of applying sanctions toKatanga would be raised again. He would continue to do all he could to secure a reasonable compromise settlement.In discussion it was agreed that the Government could not commit themselves to support any military operations by the united nations which might follow an attempt to impose sanctions onKatanga; and that it might at some stage be necessary to make ourposition in this respect clear to the Acting Secretary-General. It wasalso noted that the recent discussions which were reported to havetaken place between Mr. Tshombe and the leader of the UnitedNational Independence Party in Northern Rhodesia, Mr. Kaunda,were more likely to have been concerned with financial support fortheir respective political Parties than with the possibility of some political or federal relationship between Northern Rhodesia andKatanga.The Cabinet (2) Took note of this statement and of the points made in their discussion.The Foreign Secretary said that, following the settlement of the cuban crisis, it was possible that the Soviet Government would welcome a period of detente in their relations with the West. Therewere two fields in particular in which a genuine willingness on thepart of the Soviet Government to reach agreement might lead to earlyresults; the negotiation of a ban on nuclear testing, and Berlin.On the question of a nuclear test ban, Mr. Khrushchev had beenshowing interest in the proposal that the detection and identificationof nuclear explosions might be entrusted to automatic recordingdevices, referred to in the current discussions as &quot; black boxes &quot;.Mr. Khrushchev had appeared to accept that a network of &quot; blackboxes &quot; would have to be backed up by arrangements for their regularmaintenance and inspection under international supervision.Reliance on &quot; black boxes &quot; by themselves would probably be foundinadequate. There would have to be a large number of them andthere were continuing doubts about the reliability of the information to be obtained from them. What might be of greater significance wasthat under cover of the &quot; black boxes &quot; Mr. Khrushchev seemed forthe first time to have accepted the idea of some kind of internationalaccess to Soviet territory
On Berlin, Mr. Khrushchev had referred in general terms to thepossibility of a solution under which contingents of Western troops would remain in the city under United Nations auspices. the implications of this proposal were still far from clear. If what was intended was that Western troops should be placed under united nations command there could be no prospect of agreement. If, onthe other hand, Mr. Khrushchev had in mind the provision of a united Nations &quot; presence &quot; in Berlin in order to make it possiblefor the Soviet Government to accept the continued presence of western troops, the idea might be worth pursuing. In general theadvice from Moscow was that it would be undesirable at this stagefor us, or our Allies, to take the initiative in putting pressure on mr. Khrushchev to reach agreement on these or other issues.Mr. Khrushchev had probably strengthened his position with theRussian people by his handling of the Cuban crisis; but his action had given rise to further dissension within the Communist hierarchyand had encouraged his critics. Nor should the current ideologicaldispute between the Soviet and Chinese Governments be overlooked.At a time when it was more than ever important to Mr. Khrushchevto maintain the Soviet leadership of the world Communist movement,it would be unrealistic to expect him to move too openly or too quicklytowards a settlement with the West which could be represented bythe Chinese as a further concession to the forces of imperialism andreaction.The Prime Minister said that a further and important factor inthe situation was the outlook of the other major Western Powers,particularly the United States and France. The attitude of theGerman Government was perhaps of less importance, since they hadtended over the past year or two to take their lead from the French.General de Gaulle&apos;s position and prestige would have been strengthened by the results of the recent elections; and he would regard the outcome of the Cuban crisis as further confirmation ofthe view which he had consistently held that it would be as wrongas it would be unnecessary to make any concessions to the SovietGovernment in order to secure a settlement of the Berlin question.The Prime Minister said that he thought that such a conclusion wouldbe a mis-reading of the Cuban episode. The fact that the SovietGovernment had agreed to withdraw their missiles and their aircraft from Cuba was not evidence of weakness but of realism.Mr. Khrushchev had made an opportunist move in an area not of critical importance to the general strategy of the Soviet Government.The move had failed in its purpose and Mr. Khruschchev had withdrawn; he had rightly been unwilling to run grave risks for an object of less than vital importance to him. But Berlin was anentirely different question; not only was it of vital importance to theSoviet Government but the Russians had overwhelming conventionalsuperiority in the area, with the result that conventional action by russian forces could be countered only by a resort to nuclear attack by the Western Powers.   In Cuba the situation had been the reverse.The Prime Minister said that he would discuss the situation withGeneral de Gaulle and with President Kennedy during the courseof his visits to them in December. He intended to sound out general de Gaulle&apos;s present opinions without committing himself in advance to a declared line of policy. It was not impossible that, in spite ofGeneral de Gaulle&apos;s previous reluctance to contemplate seriousnegotiations with the Soviet Government, he might alter that viewif he himself could take or appear to be taking the initiative, perhaps in the context of discussions covering a wider area of possibleagreement than Berlin alone.The Cabinet-(3) Took note of these statements.
CPost OfficeTariffs(previous references:C.C. (61) 41stConclusions,Minute 3 andC.C. (62) 18thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster-General (C. (62) 187) proposing increases in the changes made for a number of Post Office services.The Postmaster-General said that the financial target of thePost Office for 1963-64 was to secure a return of 8 per cent on netassets. The return had been 8 per cent or more in the three yearsprior to 1961-62 but the finances of the Post Office had been adversely affected by wage awards and by the general state of business. Inconsequence the return in the previous year had been 6 - 5 per cent andin the current year it was likely to be less; for 1963-64 it might beexpected to fall to about 6 per cent. The proposals put forward in annex A of C. (62) 187 would result in an increased income of  24million in a full year, equivalent to a 2 per cent return on the netassets. If effect were not given to increases of this order, therewould be difficulty in maintaining the large capital investment programme of the Post Office without raising unduly the amountborrowed from the Exchequer.In discussion the following points were raised:(a) There was a strong argument in general principle for maintaining the return from capital at the agreed target figure. Apartfrom increasing tariffs there was no way of financing the Post Office&apos;scapital investment programme except by authorising additionalborrowing from the Exchequer; if no increases were made, theadditional borrowing below the line might amount to as much as 40 million for the next financial year. This would make seriousinroads on the capital available for other investment programmes and it would be especially unfortunate if the Post Office, which wasthe one nationalised industry under direct Government control andenjoying a virtual monopoly, were relieved of the obligation imposed on all nationalised industries to secure an agreed return on capital.If, on the other hand, Post Office capital investment were cut back,services would deteriorate, waiting lists for telephones would lengthenand the volume of complaint might be no less than would result from increased charges.(h) Wage awards accounted for almost half of the additional expenditure which the Post Office would face in the next financialyear. While it would be wrong that this outlay should appear to be financed by additional borrowing from the Exchequer, theGovernment would be equally open to criticism if the immediate result of the awards were substantial increases in charges to the public.(c) It had been assumed in the calculations made by thePostmaster-General that the existing level of business activity would continue during the next financial year. If there were some improvement in the level of activity (even if the improvement were accompanied by some increase in costs) Post Office revenues wouldbe bound to improve and the need for increased charges would bereduced.(d) It would be reasonable to consider the return on capitalover a period of years. The fact that a return of at least 8 per centhad been secured in certain years might justify acceptance of a lower rate for the immediate future. It would, moreover,&quot;be in accordancewith normal business practice not to look for immediate maximumreturns on new capital investment and it was a little unrealistic to expect the same level of return whether business was slack or active.(e) There would be advantage in examining how the capital ofthe Post Office had been calculated since, in relation to the returnobtained, the capital invested in the past few years could be held tobe more important than the capital spent many years ago.(f) It seemed likely that, if it were decided to increase charges,the proposals in C. (62) 187 would produce the maximum incomewhilst avoiding increases on those services, such as the letter rate and telephone rentals, which would attract special complaint. Butincreases in the charges for local and trunk calls and for parcels
Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference:CC. (62) 70thConclusions,Minute 1)3. The First Secretary of State informed the Cabinet that the nyasaland Constitutional Conference had been satisfactorilyconcluded and a White Paper on the Conference would be published that afternoon. The Conference had agreed on the grant toNyasaland of a normal type of self-governing Constitution, including a Bill of Rights for European residents. The leader of the MalawiCongress Party, Dr. Banda, had also agreed to the appointment ofa European Minister of Finance. There would be no mention inthe White Paper of independence for Nyasaland but, in the light ofthe Cabinefs previous discussion of this question, Dr. Banda hadbeen given a private assurance that a programme for the attainment of independence by Nyasaland would be reviewed during 1963.The First Secretary of State said that a sharp reaction from theFederal Prime Minister, Sir Roy Welensky, was to be expected whenthe statement acknowledging Nyasaland&apos;s right to withdraw fromthe Federation was made in Parliament about the middle of December.The Cabinet would recall that Dr. Banda had been promised thatsuch a statement would be made at that time and there could be noquestion of any further delay. Another complicating factor was thatthe leaders of the two African Nationalist Parties in northern rhodesia, Mr. Kaunda of the United National Independence party and Mr. Nkumbula of the African National Congress, had announcedthat they would shortly be visiting London; and their intention nodoubt would be to press for an undertaking that their parties wouldCC. 71 (62)would be generally unpopular and might be criticised, particularly by the business community. The proposed increases in theCommonwealth Press rate and in the Canadian magazine post wouldin any case have to be deferred to allow time for adequate consultationwith the Governments affected.(g) The terms and timing of the statement to be made if increased charges were approved would require careful consideration. As inthe case of the statement made in July 1961, on the occasion of theprevious increases, it would be inexpedient to refer specifically toan 8 per cent return on capital and it would be better to avoid the suggested reference to the general state of business activity.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that, althoughthe total amount to be obtained by the proposed increases was notlarge, they raised important questions of financial policy. It wouldbe generally agreed that the Post Office should, so far as possible,be self-financing but various views could be held about the appropriatecourse to take if this proved to be impracticable. It could be argued,on the one hand, that the proper criterion for the Post Office as a business organisation would be that its borrowings should be strictlyrelated to its earning power. On the other hand, it might be right that in a period calling for expansion in investment less weight should be given to profitability as the main criterion and thatExchequer lending should be governed by broader considerations.The Cabinet should consider these problems and resume their discussion at an early meeting when the Chancellor of the exchequer could be present.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Postmaster-General to set out for their informationhow the capital of the Post Office had been assessedfor purposes of calculating its financial return.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of Post Office tariffs at anearly meeting.
HousingPolicyLeaseholdReform(previous references:CC. (62) 38thConclusions,Minute 3 and cc. (62) 59thConclusions,Minute 2)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Housing and Local Government (C. (62) 191) about leasehold reform.The Minister of Housing recalled that, at their meeting on29th May, the Cabinet had invited his predecessor to prepare a schemefor giving leaseholders in certain circumstances a right, in the absenceof proposals for re-development, to extension of their leases onmarket value terms. A scheme of this kind had been worked out but,after careful consideration, he had reached the conclusion that no scheme based on market value, whether for extension of leases orfor complete enfranchisement, would meet the grievances of thelessees. The only course that would fully meet those grievanceswould be enfranchisement on confiscatory terms. Butenfranchisement on any terms would involve interference with goodestate management and orderly re-development, and some erosionof the law of contract; and on confiscatory terms it would involveabandoning declared Government policy and could not be reconciledwith the free market basis for decontrolled rents.It would be necessary to give some indication of government policy in the debate which would take place on 7th December onthe Second Reading of the Bill introduced by Mr. Denis Howell,M.P., who had been successful in the ballot for Private Members&apos;Bills. The Bill had not yet been published but it was likely that itwould provide for enfranchisement at some level short of market value. He suggested that the Government should seek rejection ofthe Bill on the basis of a promise to produce a White Paper whichwould examine the arguments for and against various measuresof leasehold reform and would give the Governments conclusions.If a White Paper were prepared it might be appropriate to include in it some reference to a possible scheme for giving lessees the rightto surrender leases which had less than, say, 20 years to run.In discussion there was general agreement in the Cabinet that itwould be desirable to avoid promising a fully reasoned statement onleasehold reform, since this would be likely to amount to a lengthyargument for doing little or nothing at the present time. The better course in the debate would be to draw attention to the defects ofMr. HowelTs Bill and to vote against giving it a Second Reading.In further discussion the following points were raised:(a) The agitation for leasehold reform was largely based on thepractice of Western Ground Rents, who owned much residential property in Cardiff. In spite of representations which had beenmade to them they showed little consideration for their lessees andit was believed that the prices they asked- for freehold reversionswere much too high. If the Government took no action there wouldbe strong local criticism, but there appeared to be no basis on whichthe Government could encourage drastic action, such as compulsory acquisition by the local authority. It would, however, be usefulboth in dealing with this criticism and as a guide to general policyif independent valuations could be obtained both of the surrendervalue of particular leasehold interests, and of the value of the freeholdreversions in those cases.be invited to form the Government in Northern Rhodesia. TheFirst Secretary of State said that he would be unable to give anysuch undertaking. In the first place, the elections in northern rhodesia had not yet been finished and in the second place thedecision would properly fall to the Governor of Northern Rhodesia.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.
Industrial 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterTraining 0f Labour (C. (62) 192) about arrangements for industrial training,covering the draft of a White Paper setting out the Governmentsnew proposals.After a short discussion, the Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Labour to bring the draft white paper before the Home Affairs Committee forconsideration.(2) Authorised the First Secretary of State, as Chairman of theHome Affairs Committee, to approve the subsequentpublication of the White Paper.Parliament 6.   The Cabinet were informed of Questions, to be answeredParliamentary that day in the House of Lords and on 29th November in the HousePrivilege of Commons, arising out of a case affecting Lord Mowbray, in whichthe privileges attaching to his status as a member of the House ofLords had been held to prevent him from being arrested under awrit of attachment. Lady Summerskill would ask the government whether they would &quot; consider examining the law in order to eliminateany provisions which confer exceptional privileges upon Membersof both Houses of Parliament&quot;; and it was proposed to answer thisQuestion on the basis that, since the privileges of the House ofCommons were also affected, the answer to the further Question inthe House of Commons should be awaited. That Question, in thename of Mr. Richard Marsh, M.P., asked the Prime Minister if hewould &quot; move the motions necessary to set up a Joint Committeeof both Houses to examine the law in so far as it confers exceptionalprivileges upon Members of both Houses which exempt them fromthe normal processes of the courts &quot;.In discussion it was suggested that, although freedom of Membersof both Houses from arrest in civil proceedings had been important in the distant past, it had now become something of an anachronism.The circumstances of Lord Mowbray&apos;s case could arise only in a strictly limited field, but the issues which might be raised by theQuestions went very wide. The privilege of freedom from arrestfor contempt of court extended in certain circumstances to witnessesand to members of the legal profession as well as to Members ofboth Houses; and it might be necessary to consider the extent ofimmunity from arrest in pursuance of injunctions and in connexionwith subpoenas. Legislation would probably be required to bringabout any change in the law of privilege, certainly so far as it restedon the common law.(b) The principle underlying the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1954,and the various suggestions which were canvassed for enfranchisementand renewal of leases, was that the lessee&apos;s stake in his house shouldbe enlarged. Compulsory surrender of leases would be breaking newground; and if the idea were pursued it would be important to makeit clear that its application would be confined to small residential property.The Cabinet Agreed that, in opposing the Second Reading of Mr. DenisHowell&apos;s Bill on leasehold reform, the Governmentsspokesman should not promise to present a White paper on this subject. -
In these circumstances it would be desirable that the PrimeMinister, in dealing with the Question in the House of commons on 29th November, should indicate willingness to consider, inconsultation with the Leader of the Opposition, the appropriateprocedure for examining the question of freedom from arrest arisingdirectly out of the case of Lord Mowbray. Although there might be advantage in extending the terms of reference of the Joint SelectCommittee which was at present sitting, it would be necessary toconsider whether it would be proper that the privileges of either house should come under review by a body which includedrepresentatives of the other. The better course might be to establishCommittees of each House, sitting in parallel and working on similarterms of reference.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Chancellor, in the light of their discussion,to provide the Prime Minister with a draft answer to Mr.Richard Marsffs Question about the establishment of aJoint Committee to examine the law in relation to the privileges of Members of Parliament.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,27th November, 1962.
