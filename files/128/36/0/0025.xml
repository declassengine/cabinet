Meeting ofCommonwealthPrimeMinisters,19621. The Prime Minister said that special procedures had beenadopted to keep other Commonwealth Governments informed ofthe course of our negotiations with the European economic community; but he was satisfied that, in addition, it would benecessary at the appropriate stage to give the other commonwealth governments an opportunity for collective discussion at a meetingof Prime Ministers. He had been considering, with the ministers directly concerned, the timing of such a meeting. It should bepossible, by the end of July, to discern the general pattern ofarrangements emerging from the Brussels negotiations; and the interruption of the negotiations in August would provide anopportunity for all Governments to survey the situation reached.He had therefore decided to propose that a Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers should be held in the early weeks of September. Messages in this sense were being sent to the other commonwealth capitals.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement.Indonesia 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that the discussions between(Previous        representatives of the Dutch and Indonesian Governments on the reference:       future of West Irian had started well.   The Dutch had beenC.C.

The Dutchwere now sending destroyers to the area to locate these forces and toneutralise them.  They might ask us to provide refuelling facilitiesfor these vessels; and, if the fighting became more serious, this request might be extended to cover general logistic support.   TheUnited States Government had intimated to us that they would findgreat difficulty in refusing such requests, if made to them.In discussion it was noted that the United States had facilitiesfor refuelling at sea, which would be open to less political objectionthan the refuelling of Dutch naval vessels in our Far Eastern ports,particularly Singapore. In view of the large British investments inIndonesia, which would b- - jeopardised by any overt action hostile tothe interests of the Indonesian Government, it would be preferable that in present circumstances any Dutch request for assistance should be turned aside with the suggestion that their requirementscould be more expeditiously met by the United States Government.The Cabinet Took note that the Foreign Secretary would seek for thepresent to divert any Dutch request for refuelling facilities in connexion with current operations in West Irian.South-East 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that, notwithstanding pressuresAsia Treaty from the United States Government and the Thai Government,Organisation General Phoumi was still refusing to co-operate in the formation ofLaos a neutral Government under Prince Souvanna Phouma.   It seemed(Previous likely that, with the help of the Soviet Ambassador in Vientiane,Reference: the cease-fire arrangements could be maintained for a time, but theC.C.

congo republic(previous reference:CC. (62) 19thConclusions,Minute 1)4. The Foreign Secretary said that discussions were proceeding between the Prime Ministers of the Central Congo Government andof Katanga, but no rapid progress was being made towardsagreement. The local representative of the United Nations in the congo was showing signs of impatience, and seemed to be thinkingagain in terms of coercing Katanga by force. This would be inconsistent with the policy hitherto followed by the Acting Secretary-General.  We for our part should continue to counsel patience.germany berlin(previous reference:CC. (62) 21stConclusions,Minute 5)5. The Foreign Secretary said that the Disarmament Conferenceat Geneva had provided an opportunity for Ministers and officials ofthe Governments of the United Kingdom, the United States and theSoviet Union to hold a number of informal discussions on theproblem of Berlin. The Americans and the Russians, in particular,had held many meetings, at various levels, on this subject. Afterinitial statements designed to establish positions on either side, therehad been a good deal of objective discussion in which some interestingpossibilities had been canvassed. The records of these interchangeswere now being studied.DisarmamentNuclear Tests(previous reference:CC. (62) 23rdConclusions,Minute 2)6. The Prime Minister said that, since the Cabinefs last discussion on 22nd March, he and the Foreign Secretary had continued their search for some international formula, on the cessation of nuclear tests, which would enable the United StatesGovernment to postpone the further series of atmospheric testswhich they were planning to make at Christmas Island and elsewhere.It was now clear that the United States Government would not beprepared to revive their earlier offer to conclude a test-ban agreementconfined to tests in the atmosphere. The attitude of Congress hadhardened, and it now seemed likely that the Administration had decided to go forward with their plans for a further series of tests.If so, it would be all the more important that the Western powers should be in a position to demonstrate to world opinion that it wasthe Soviet Government which was responsible for the failure to reach an international agreement for the cessation of tests.In discussion it was agreed that most people in this country were now satisfied that the Western Powers had done their utmost to secure such an agreement, and that the responsibility for failurerested with the Russians. They were already expecting that in thesecircumstances the United States Government would carry out theirprojected series of tests. The Cabinet also confirmed their earlierview that little was likely to be gained by a meeting of Heads of governments on this subject, and that it would be preferable to reserve the possibility of such a meeting for a discussion on Berlin,on which there might be more room for negotiation.The cabinet took note of the Prime Ministers statement and of thepoints raised in the Cabinefs discussion.increase their pressure on General Phoumi by withdrawing altogetherthe help they had been affording to him. This might involve the disintegration of his army; and there would then be a serious risk that the Pathet Lao might seize control. It would be unfortunate ifthe obstinacy of General Phoumi frustrated the work done by the geneva Conference on Laos, which had secured agreement among14 nations on the establishment of an International control commission and of an internal security force and on the disbandment of the armies of General Phoumi and the Pathet Lao.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,30th March, 1962.Kenya 7.   The Colonial Secretary said that the Kenya ConstitutionalConstitutional   Conference would end some time in the week beginning 2nd April.Conference      It was still uncertain whether the conference would reach agreement(Previous       on a programme of constitutional advance or whether it would endReference:       in a breakdown.   His proposals for the formation of a coalitionC.C. (62) 22nd   Government to work out the details of a new Constitution had initiallyConclusions,    been well received, but difficulties had now arisen.  The two mainMinute 4)       parties had been unable to agree, either on the provision to be made forthe future disposition of farmland in the White Highlands or on thecontrol of the police.   There was still a reasonable prospect thatsome compromise solution could be reached on both these issues.In addition, however, Mr. Kenyatta was now demanding that a firmdate should be set for Kenya&apos;s independence.   This demand mustbe refused and it was possible that Mr. Kenyatta might then withdraw his co-operation.   It was also possible that Mr. Kenyatta would insist that Mr. Oginga Odinga should be included in the coalition government.  It would be impossible to agree to this, as Mr. OgingaOdinga was known to be in touch with the Soviet Government.The Colonial Secretary said that, if the conference were tobreak up without agreement, it would be preferable that it shouldbe seen to have done so because of Mr. Kenyatta&apos;s insistence on what would be generally regarded as unreasonable demands.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Colonial Secretary.
