Federationof rhodesia and Nyasaland(previous reference :C.C. (62) 68thConclusions,Minute 1)C.C. 761. The First Secretary of State said that during the NyasalandConstitutional Conference he had been under strong pressure fromthe Leader of the Malawi Congress Party, Dr. Banda, to announce a firm date March 1964 had been suggested for the attainment of full independence by Nyasaland. He had resisted this pressurebecause an early announcement about Nyasaland&apos;s independence would not only produce a sharp reaction from the federal government but might also be expected to have unwelcomerepercussions in Northern Rhodesia. The projected statement aboutthe withdrawal of Nyasaland from the Federation would in any caseinvolve the Government in dispute and recrimination with the federal prime Minister, and he did not want to exacerbate the situation. Sofar as Northern Rhodesia was concerned, while the outcome couldnot be decided until the elections had been finally completed, it was likely that the United National Independence Party and the AfricanNational Congress would combine forces, thus producing a workingAfrican nationalist majority early in 1963. The important thing wasto gain time, to allow for further study both of the difficult economicissues involved in all three territories and of the future relationship between Northern and Southern Rhodesia. If the Northern RhodesianParties were encouraged by the example of Nyasaland to make an issue of early independence, the chances of finding a reasonable solution would be prejudiced.The First Secretary of State said that it would nevertheless benecessary to make some concession to Dr. Banda&apos;s point of view.Dr. Banda had adopted a constructive and helpful attitude in thenegotiations and there was no doubt that independence had a very strong emotional appeal to his supporters. In these circumstances the First Secretary of State said that he proposed to announce at theend of the Conference that the Government would review before theend of 1963 the question of a programme for independence forNyasaland.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It would be difficult to separate independence for Nyasalandfrom independence for Northern and Southern Rhodesia. So far asthe latter territories were concerned the ideal solution would be togrant independence to a single State consisting of the two territories in some kind of continuing federal relationship. But even if it were practicable, such a solution would take a long time to plan and tobring into being. The success of any such operation would be prejudiced if any statement were now to be made by the Governmentwhich could be construed as an undertaking to grant independence to Nyasaland in the next year or so.(b) In default of the development of a close relationship between northern and Southern Rhodesia it was probably inevitable that inthe course of time the two territories would achieve independenceseparately. This would at once raise the awkward question ofSouthern Rhodesia&apos;s membership of the Commonwealth. Here again the best hope of a satisfactory solution would lie in the steady and progressive development of more liberal tendencies in the southern rhodesian Administration.(c) There were many degrees of constitutional developmentbetween self-government and full independence. The arrangements now proposed for Nyasaland fell short of full self-government;ultimate power over the police forces, for example, was being reserved to the Governor. Nevertheless, it was improbable that Dr. Bandawould be prepared to accept a reference to further constitutional advance as an alternative to a reference to independence.Summing up the Prime Minister said that there would be clear and manifest advantage in delaying if at all possible any direct or
AircraftIndustrySupersonicAirliner(previous reference :C.C. (62) 66thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Aviation (C. (62) 184) reporting the outcome of his meeting withM. Dusseaulx, the French Minister of Transport, at which he had stated that the proposal for the joint development of an Anglo-Frenchsupersonic airliner was in principle acceptable to the United KingdomGovernment, subject to certain assurances.The Minister of Aviation said that M. Dusseaulx had assuredhim that Air France would participate in the project as intendingoperators of the medium-range version of the airliner and probablyof the long-range version also. M. Dusseaulx had been confident that other members of Air Union would also buy the aircraft in viewof the influence which Air France would have with them. Ourestimate of the number of aircraft that could be sold, assuming thata United States competitor came into the field early, had been about170; the corresponding French estimate was 150-160. A larger number would be sold if the United States competitor did not come in until later, as would happen if, for instance, the United Statespreferred an airliner with three times the speed of sound. He hadpersuaded the French authorities that the aircraft should not be called the &quot; Super-Caravelle &quot;. Other names had been discussed, of which&quot; Concorde &quot; (with and without the final &quot; e &quot;) seemed to be the best.He had discussed with M. Dusseaulx the draft of a proposed agreement on the lines already reported to the Cabinet. M. Dusseaulxhad since indicated that he had now obtained the approval of theFrench Government and that he was ready to visit London to sign the agreement in the near future if the United Kingdom government also approved the proposal.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that now that it had beenestablished that Air France, and probably other European airlinesalso, would participate in the project it was right that we should proceed to sign the agreement with the French Government, subjectto a final examination of its terms. But this should be without commitment on the arrangements to be made between the UnitedKingdom Government and the United Kingdom firms.  He was notimplied commitment to Dr. Banda about the attainment of independence for Nyasaland. The Government had already madea substantial concession to him about Nyasaland&apos;s right to withdraw from the Federation. Nevertheless, the Cabinet clearly appreciated the difficulties facing the First Secretary of State, the very realpressures from his own supporters with which Dr. Banda had to deal,and the importance of continuing to carry with us an African leaderwho had shown himself ready to take a moderate and constructiveline. He still hoped that it might be possible for the First Secretaryof State to negotiate with Dr. Banda some statement which would commit the Government to doing no more than reviewing the positionin the course of 1963, in the light of developments by that date. Butif such a statement could not be agreed he felt that it would be rightto leave the First Secretary of State discretion to fall back on some such statement as that which he had first suggested. The first secretary of State would no doubt continue to keep his colleaguesinformed of developments in the Constitutional Conference and inthe African territories concerned.The Cabinet Invited the First Secretary of State, in the course of further discussion with the Leader of the Malawi Congress Party,Dr. Banda, to be guided by the points made by the PrimeMinister in summing up the discussion.
satisfied that an arrangement under which the United KingdomGovernment would finance the whole of the pre-production costs,except some  2 million on building and plant and  14 million onthe learning costs in producing the new aircraft, was satisfactoryeither in itself or as a matter of presentation to the public. Moreover,there should be an understanding that, if the companies made a profit on the sales of the aircraft, there should be some return fromthe proceeds of the sales to the Exchequer.In discussion the following points were made:(a) Further discussions had been held to explore the possibilityof associating Rolls Royce with the project. It had been found that,not only were the United Kingdom companies opposed to this, butthat there was strong resistance from the French side apparentlybecause SNECMA, the French firm that would be engaged on the engines, was partly owned by Pratt and Whitney of America, whoregarded Rolls Royce as one of their main competitors.(b) Shipping and shipbuilding interests in the United kingdom were inclined to criticise the extent to which the Government weresupporting both the aircraft construction industry and the airlines.This should be borne in mind in framing the announcement of the signature of the agreement with France.(c) A decision to proceed with the airliner would indirectlyimprove the prospects of employment in Short Brothers and Harlandin Belfast, and an indication in this sense would be helpful to theGovernments handling of a debate in Parliament on the economy ofNorthern Ireland within the next few days.Summing up the Prime Minister said that it was generally accepted that the agreement with the French should be signed as early as convenient. The aircraft should be called the &quot; Concord &quot;.The details of the agreement and of the public statement to be made when it was signed should be settled by the Minister of Aviationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Foreign Secretary.The Minister of Transport should be consulted. The Minister of aviation and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation with thePresident of the Board of Trade, should also consider further thedetails of the financial arrangements between the United KingdomGovernment and the United Kingdom companies engaged in the project in the light of the points made in discussion.&apos;The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the project for the joint Anglo-Frenchdevelopment of a supersonic airliner, under the name&quot; Concord &quot;.(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Foreign Secretary andthe Minister of Transport, to settle the terms of theagreement between the United Kingdom and french governments and of the announcement of the signature of the agreement.(3) Subject to Conclusion (2) above, invited the Minister of aviation to arrange with M. Dusseaulx for the signature of the agreement.(4) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the minister\of Aviation, to settle the terms of a statement on the relationship of this project to employment prospects at short Brothers and Harland.(5) Invited the Minister of Aviation, in consultation with thePresident Of the Board of Trade and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, to consider further the terms of the development
RestrictivePracticesMonopoliesCommission(previous reference :CC. (59) 11thConclusions,Minute 7)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (62) 182) inviting the Cabinet todecide what further references, if any, should be made to the monopolies Commission.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this subject had beendiscussed by the Economic Policy Committee, who had been unableto reach agreement. The Monopolies Commission was currentlyengaged on three enquiries, on electrical accessories for motor cars,on &quot; solus sites &quot; arrangements for petrol and on wallpaper. Thepreliminary enquiries by officials had largely been completed, and themembers of the Commission would be completing their work on thereports on these items in the course of 1963. There were disadvantages in letting it appear that the Commission was running down, but, onthe other hand, it would be undesirable to make references to theCommission merely to keep it occupied.The President of the Board of Trade said that he advocatedfurther references to the Commission because it was the policy of theGovernment to refer to it cases where there was positive reason tobelieve that monopoly conditions were being exploited to the detriment of the public. He favoured selecting tied houses anddetergents and soaps. There was considerable public feeling thatpublicans, whether tenants or managers, were unduly restricted inthe brands of alcoholic and soft drinks which they were allowed tosell in tied houses. Two-thirds of the manufacture of soap wascontrolled by one company, two-thirds of the manufacture ofdetergents was controlled by another; and this brought them both within the statutory definition of monopoly conditions. While therewas intense advertising activity by the makers of both soap anddetergents, suggesting intense competition, the competition was infact imperfect, and a reduction in the expenditure on advertisingwould reduce the price of the product. The Government had been criticised in recent months for inaction in the case of the take-overbid by Imperial Chemical Industries for Courtaulds, and again in not pressing for the implementation of one of the recommendationsof the Monopolies Commission dealing with tobacco. While it was true that there were no powers to enforce recommendations of theCommission it had proved possible in practice to secure the implementation of important recommendations of the Commissioneven without powers of enforcement. He intended in due course to bring forward proposals for improving the working of theCommission and possibly also for machinery for the investigation of mergers, but he hoped that in the meantime the Governmentwould not risk attracting criticism by allowing the monopolies commission to appear inactive.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It was doubted whether there was sufficient public feelingto justify referring tied houses to the Commission, and it was not clear that the practice of tying houses was harmful to the publicinterest.(b) It seemed illogical to refer soaps and detergents to theCommission on the ground that, because of the intense competition between the various brands, high expenditure was incurred inadvertising. On the other hand, it was suggested that competition in soaps and detergents was an elaborate facade, since, while therewere several products sold under different trade names, there were only two manufacturers.  One manufacturer had marketed a brandcontracts between the Government and the participatingcompanies, within the framework of the agreementbetween the French and United Kingdom Governments.
4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Housing and Local Government (C. (62) 183) and the chief secretary, Treasury (C. (62) 186) about the basis on which the general grant for England and Wales for 1963-64 and 1964-65 should besettled.The Minister of Housing recalled that, at their meeting on 8th November, the Cabinet had invited him to report the outcome of the statutory consultation with representatives of the localauthorities about the amount of general grant in the next two financial years. In the course of the consultation, which had taken place on15th November, the local authority representatives had not brought forward any new arguments against the limitation in the amount ofgeneral grant proposed in the paper (C. (62) 171) which the cabinet had considered at their earlier meeting. He had, however, been impressed by the vigour with which the local authority representatives had pressed their objections to the limitation, and he now believedthat if the Government insisted on it the repercussions would bedisproportionate to the financial saving. It would, in his view, be preferable to leave the basis of calculation unaltered. But he had warned the local authority representatives that if the government did take this course they might also seek changes in the rate deficiencygrant system; and it had been accepted that this would be reasonable.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that even on the basis ofthe limitation the amount of general grant for 1963-64 would exceedby over  60 million the amount for the current financial year. Theadditional net amount of  13 million, which would be carried by theExchequer if no change were made, would be a substantial sum fromthe point of view of the general level of public expenditure but wouldbe only a minor addition to the total of  1,800 million spent by localauthorities. It should be brought home to the local authorities thatthe Exchequer commitment to rate deficiency grant could not beallowed to continue on the present open-ended basis. It would benecessary to introduce legislation to prevent increases in rate deficiencygrant which were attributable to increases in the disparity in resourcesbetween the poorer and the better off local authorities; and hesuggested that the authorities should at once be told of theGovernments intention to alter the system. There would, in his view,be advantage in telling the authorities at the same time that thegeneral grant order, which would have to be presented in parliament before the Christmas recess, would be on the limited basis but that,when the legislation to alter rate deficiency grant had been enacted,LocalGovernmentGeneral Grants1963-64 and1964-65(previous reference :CC. (62) 67thConclusions,Minute 4)CC. 70 (62)which was not extensively advertised, and it was being sold at18 per cent less than the price of the advertised products.(c) It was difficult to judge whether further references to the monopolies Commission would be well advised until it was known whether the United Kingdom would join the Common Market,since, if she did, her industries might find themselves without tariff protection and in competition with industrial organisations larger than the units now operating in the United Kingdom market.(d) Several other possible cases for references to the commission were considered. There was general agreement that colour filmwould merit such an investigation.The Cabinet Invited the President of the Board of Trade to refer for examination to the Monopolies Commission colour filmand detergents and soaps.
an additional order would be made to increase the amount of general grant for 1963-64 but not, of course, for 1964-65 to take accountof the savings resulting from amendment of the law.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The local authorities would expect to be consulted on theterms of the proposed legislation to alter the system of rate deficiencygrants and they would take it amiss if the Government appeared tobe assuming from the outset that the consultations, when theyeventually took place, would result in adjustments of a precise amount in both types of grant. Tactically, therefore, there might be more tobe lost than gained by making the initial order on the limited basis,and undertaking to increase the amount for 1963-64 later.(b) More generally, there was much logic in the desire of thelocal authorities to settle, within the rate deficiency grant system,problems to which that system gave rise. If the general grant were used as a regulator, the Government would be criticised at the least for not trusting the authorities and possibly also for breach of thegeneral understandings on which general grant had in the past been settled; and it would be pointed out that if re-rating and revaluationhad resulted in a reduction in rate deficiency grant instead of anincrease there was no likelihood that the Government would have proposed an upward adjustment in the general grant.(c) The policy of general, as opposed to specific, grant had beenestablished in the face of much opposition. An adjustment at thisstage would be widely regarded as confirmation of the objections togeneral grant which had been strongly held in the educational world,by the Governments own supporters as well as by others. the relevant expenditure for educational purposes i.e., the educationalexpenditure which attracted grant had already been the subject ofdifficult discussions with the local authorities.(d) Any reopening of the argument in principle for general grant would be unfortunate. In particular, it would prejudice proposalswhich were already under consideration for extension of the general grant to cover highway expenditure on all except major roads.(e) During the spring of 1963, when rates would be determined on the basis of the law as it stood, it would be peculiarly unfortunateto give local authorities any excuse for suggesting that increases werethe fault of the Government. At that time, moreover, it would be important to secure a favourable reception for the governments plans for expenditure on the health and welfare services. Disputesabout the amount of general grant might lead many authorities torepresent these plans as a further attempt to shift responsibility fromtaxes to rates.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that theCabinet should keep in view the need to contain wherever possiblethe rising level of public expenditure. But a reopening of oldarguments about the principle of general grant should be avoided,and the best course would be to make the general grant order forthe next two financial years on the basis which had been adoptedin the past. A statement should be made, in terms to be agreed inadvance with the representatives of the local authorities, about theneed for legislation to alter the system of rate deficiency grants and about the general objective to be achieved by the alteration.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the general grants for England and Wales for1963-64 and 1964-65 should not be reduced to take account of increases in rate deficiency grant due tore-rating and revaluation.(2) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government, afterconsultation with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to seek
the agreement of representatives of the local authoritiesto the terms of a statement to be made in Parliament onthe Governments intention to alter the system of ratedeficiency grants for the future.*) J. iiBetting andGamingPool BettingDuty(previous reference :C.C. (62) 69thConclusions,Minute 5)5. The Prime Minister said that in the light of the cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion he had given further thought to this question andhad had the benefit of advice from the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Attorney-General. In broad summary the position was asfollows. The defence of mistake of law could be pleaded against theclaim by the Birmingham City and Aston Villa Football Clubs for repayment of duty and, if pleaded, would succeed. It had, however,been announced in 1949 by the then Lord Chancellor that, as amatter of policy, this defence would not be used by the Governmentexcept where certain defined conditions had been met. A specificduty had been laid on the Law Officers to ensure consistency ofpolicy in this respect. It had also to be remembered that in 1961the then Solicitor-General had announced that in these particular cases of the claims by the Football Clubs the policy of consistencywould be maintained. He had that day received from the Attorney-General a letter setting out the Law Officers&apos; view that, unless certainenquiries had first been made of the Football Clubs and it had beenestablished that repayment of duty could not be made to theprizewinners, the defence of mistake of law could not be pleadedwithout a breach in the policy of consistency. But, as he saw it, theCabinet had a different duty from that which had been laid on theLaw Officers. It was their duty to look at these cases, not exclusivelyin terms of their legal implications, but in terms of the widerpractical and moral issues involved. It might be that on occasion the Cabinet would consider it right not to accept the Law Officers&apos;advice and to defend the breach with consistency on grounds of publicinterest.The Prime Minister said that he felt that this was the issue towhich the Cabinet should now address themselves, namely whether in spite of the advice which the Law Officers had tendered they would nevertheless feel it right to enter a plea of mistake of law and to avoioin this way any question of repayment of duty. If this course were tobe followed it would be necessary, not only to make it clear in bothHouses of Parliament that the advice of the Law Officers had not inthis instance been followed, but to justify the departure from their advice on broad political grounds. It would fall either to himself orthe Chancellor of the Exchequer to speak in this sense in the Houseof Commons and to the Lord President to do so in the House of Lords.In discussion the following points were made:(a) Much emphasis had been laid in earlier discussion on thefact that between 1954 and 1960, which was the period to which thepresent claims related, the Football Clubs if they had not been engaged in betting activities which were properly taxable, had been running lotteries which were not taxable but were illegal. Therenow appeared to be some doubt on this point. The Law Officersadvised that the Football Clubs had been engaged in transactions which were legal but not taxable. Other Ministers, however, were still inclined to the view that, in so far as the Clubs had not been running betting systems, they must have been running illegal lotteries.This point would warrant further examination.(h) The policy of consistency as it had been defined meant thatthe plea of mistake of law would only be sanctioned if the LawOfficers could be satisfied that the money, if repaid, would not go back into the hands of those who had borne the burden of paying
it. It was still open to argument who had borne this burden in thepresent case. The Law Officers maintained that it was theprizewinners, because the incidence of duty affected the amount ofprizes. But a reasonable case could be made out for suggesting that it was the individual punters who had borne the burden of theduty. If this could be accepted there would be no problem, since it would be manifestly impossible for the Football Clubs to identifyand repay duty to the millions of individual punters involved. Itwould be difficult, but it might be by no means impossible, to identifyprizewinners. And even if all prizewinners could not be identifiedthose who could be identified, or who would identify themselves,would assume that they had a valid claim to repayment.(c) It might not be easy for the Government to defend therestriction of repayment to cases where a proper legal claim hadbeen submitted. If the Government once accepted that there was an obligation to refund duty to prizewinners, they would be expectedto make repayment to all who could be identified. The sum thatwould then be in question might not reach the very large figuresmentioned in earlier papers  7 or  8 million but it might stillbe substantial.(d) The political repercussions of a successful plea of a mistakeof law should not be overlooked. It might be argued that theGovernment were deliberately evading the repayment of duty whichhad been illegally collected; if it could be held that the repaymentwas rightly due to the individual prizewinners there might beresentment and criticism out of all proportion to the sums at stake.There was in any case no question of repayment to the FootballClubs as such, although they might be expected to appeal to their supporters to pay into Club funds any sums repaid by theGovernment.(e) It would be necessary for the Government to enter theirplea during the course of the week. It was, however, unlikely thatthe cases would actually be heard for about a year. This would allow time for further consideration of the issues involved; the advisability of retrospective or declaratory legislation to put thematter beyond doubt should also be considered.After further discussion the Cabinet (1) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to plead mistakeof law as the Governments defence against the claims byAston Villa and Birmingham City Football Clubs for repayment of duty.(2) Invited the Attorney-General, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Home Secretary,to give further thought to the legality or illegality of thepools conducted by the Football Clubs in question inthe period between 1954 and 1960.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Law Officers, to give further consideration tothe points raised in their discussion and in particular toconsider the advisability of introducing retrospective anddeclaratory legislation to put the matter beyond doubt.
