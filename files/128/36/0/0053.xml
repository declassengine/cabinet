The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that a writtenbrief had been prepared for the Lord Privy Seal on the lines agreed at their meeting on 31st July. The Lord Privy Seal had now beenjoined in Brussels by the Commonwealth Secretary and discussions with the Six on Commonwealth agricultural interests would betaking place on that and the following days. United Kingdomamendments to the terms of the proposed arrangements had nowbeen communicated to the Six.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.MalayaGreaterMalaysia(previous reference:CC. (62) 44thConclusions,Minute 7)2. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the substance of the discussions which he and the Commonwealth Secretary had had with the Prime Minister of Malaya during the previous weekendon the project for a Greater Malaysia. While the eventualagreement conformed with the essential principles of the report ofthe Commission headed by Lord Cobbold, the timing of the inauguration of Greater Malaysia would be found, when the reportof the Commission was published, to differ from the recommenda-tions by the United Kingdom members of the Commission. Thisdiscrepancy in timing, while it might well be criticised, did not inany way affect the substance of the principal recommendations ofthe Commission.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement.congo republic(previous reference:CC. (62) 50thConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Foreign Secretary said that the United StatesGovernment, with some support from Belgium, were still seekinginternational agreement to a policy of economic sanctions againstKatanga. One proposal that had been made was that other countries should voluntarily boycott imports of Katangan copper. While onlya small proportion of the total exports from Katanga was ordinarilybought in this country, the output of copper from this source washandled in the main through the London Metal Exchange. In theview of the Foreign Secretary and the President of the Board of trade the proposed boycott would be dangerous, and particularly damaging to our commercial interests; and on this ground alone it seemedright that we should refuse to be associated with the application ofsuch a measure.The Cabinet-Agreed that the United Kingdom Government should notbe party to an embargo on imports of Katangan copper.defence programme(previous reference:CC (62) 13thConclusions,Minute 7)*4. The Prime Minister said that consideration of the broadissues of defence policy which would need to be settled before theEstimates for the forthcoming financial year were prepared had revealed points of such importance as to require the attention of theCabinet. The most important of these concerned the future of theAjrniy&apos;s nuclear weapon BLUE WATER.The original intention behind the development of these so-calledtactical nuclear weapons had been to interpose a stage betweensmall-scale military aggression and the outbreak of strategic nuclear
war. The British contribution to the Western strategic nuclear deterrent was assured, since the cancellation on military grounds of blue STREAK, by the deployment of BLUE STEEL, andsubsequently SKYBOLT, with the V-bombers of the R.A.F. TheBritish Army of the Rhine had been equipped with the tactical nuclear weapons HONEST JOHN and CORPORAL, both of United Statesorigin - the next generation of weapons was to consist of the UnitedStates SERGEANT and the United Kingdom BLUE WATER,which although it would come into service later than SERGEANTwas certainly a better weapon.It was becoming increasingly clear that the concept of a war of movement on the European front v/ith the employment of modernnuclear weapons, but without the exchange of strategic nuclear weapons, was untenable. The scale of devastation which would be caused by the use of the thousands of so-called tactical nuclear weapons already at the disposal of Allied Command, Europe, wouldbe comparable with the effects of strategic nuclear bombardment. Ifnuclear weapons were to be used for the purpose of enforcing a pausein hostilities and thus allowing time for negotiations even after war had broken out, this seemed to require no more than the provisionof limited numbers of nuclear weapons under the direct control ofthe Supreme Commander. The President of the United States was known to be concerned at the possible consequences of his predecessor^ policy of disseminating large numbers of tactical nuclear weapons in Allied Command, Europe, and of delegatingauthority for their use to subordinate commanders.The first question for this country was whether we ought toproceed with the policy of arming United Kingdom formations withweapons of this sort, seeing that we doubted the validity of themilitary case for them and could expect that our allies would cometo share these doubts before the weapons themselves came into service.The second question was how best to present the case fordispensing with tactical nuclear weapons in view of the fact that mostof our allies were already committed to them and that the british army stood in line with other armies which expected to be equipped with SERGEANTS.The Minister of Defence said that the Chancellor of theExchequer and he had reached complete agreement on the defence programme to be adopted. The financial and other resources of thecountry were in danger of being so seriously overstrained by the attempt to fulfil our existing defence policy that our forces wouldnot be adequate to give effect to it in any theatre. Apart from theneed to re-examine future defence policy, there was an urgent needfor substantial economies. In regard to BLUE WATER, it seemedincreasingly doubtful whether the sort of campaign in which BLUEWATER would be used could ever take place. This was not to saythat opinion in military circles in the United States and in the north atlantic Alliance would easily be brought to accept our conclusions.It was essential to provide a replacement for the Canberrabombers in the shape of the TSR 2. In his view and in the view ofthe Air Staff the TSR 2 would be capable of satisfactorily dischargingthe role planned for BLUE WATER on the European front. On theother hand, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff could not accept this view, which had not been accepted by any other army in the alliance and would result in depriving the Army of control of whatthey still regarded as their own heavy artillery.The Minister said that, in his judgment, the importance of achieving finality on a number of extremely important defenceprojects depending on the proposed economies in tactical nuclear weapons was such as to outweigh these objections. But the presentation of the decision to cancel BLUE WATER would requireextremely careful handling.
CC. (53) 62The Secretary of State for War said that the origin of theproposals now before the Cabinet had been a financial review ofthe cost of defence programmes: the proposals as they stoodamounted to no less than a reversal of the defence policy embodied in the White Paper of 1957, which had been based on small all-regular forces adequately equipped with the most modern weapons, includingnuclear weapons. The credibility of the defensive strategy of theNorth Atlantic Alliance depended on the threat of the use of tactical nuclear weapons with its implication of escalation to strategic nuclear exchange. The Army were unconvinced that any aircraft could replace missile launchers under Army control. The latter would be mobile and could be relied upon to operate in all conditionsof weather with extreme precision. Aircraft on the other hand were likely to be lost in fulfilling other missions and might well be put outof action by the destruction of their airfields. This was also the viewof the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, whose requirementsincluded for the whole European front the provision of missilelaunchers as well as strike aircraft. If all other sectors of theEuropean front were equipped with SERGEANT and the Britishsector had no missile launchers, this would invite a concentratedattack on British troops. Even if it were possible to deviseconventional artillery which would prove to be an effective substitute for BLUE WATER, this alternative seemed impracticable since itwould require more men and would take more time. The damage to the morale of the Army would be enhanced if, as seemed probable,the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, felt obliged to dissentpublicly from the view that aircraft could be accepted as a substitute for BLUE WATER.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The main deterrent to Russian aggression was the strategic nuclear striking force of the United States and the United Kingdom.It was not clear that any supplementary nuclear deterrent was required that could not be provided by the great number of nuclear weapons already deployed in Europe, with the addition of theTSR 2.(b) It might be possible to find ways of saving nearly as much money in the Defence Estimates by curtailing the production ofother weapons such as THUNDERBIRD II and providing fewerBLUE WATER missiles, as by the cancellation of BLUE WATER;this however, would mean dangerously weakening the conventionalarmament of the land forces, whereas policy required increasingconventional strength.(c) The industrial consequences of cancelling BLUE WATERwould be serious. The Government were in some sense morallycommitted to maintain the strength of the aircraft industry by theallocation of contracts for guided missiles. On the other hand, givenappropriate redundancy arrangements, there should be no greatdifficulty in ensuring the re-employment of the workers affected atStevenage.(d) The probability of continued disturbances outside europe which would call for British military intervention was much greaterthan the likelihood of any war in Europe. If the balance ofexpenditure of resources were not shortly altered, it might become impossible to fulfil requirements in other parts of the world becauseof the excessive demands for support of the European front. It was an important feature of the agreement between the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister of Defence that projects which were vitalfor the fulfilment of our requirements in the rest of the world couldbe assured if the economies in the nuclear armoury were made.(e) The Foreign Secretary said that, while the conception of anEuropean battle lasting some weeks and involving the use of nuclear weapons on a large scale was rightly being challenged, the theoryof the limited use of nuclear weapons to dictate a pause in military
operations which might have begun through miscalculation on theenemy&apos;s part probably remained valid. For this purpose, the weapons in question ought to be under the control of a tactical nuclear weapons command, directly subordinate to the supreme allied Commander, Europe. It would be desirable, if possible, tofind time to discuss this conception with the United States and therest of the Alliance (though not necessarily to submit to their judgment) before we were committed to depriving the Army of whatthey regarded as their essential weapon.(/) The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that an approach to our allies might be on the basis that we were satisfied that therewas no valid military requirement for large numbers of tactical nuclear weapons under the control of forward Army units, and thatwe had therefore decided to expend no more resources upon thedevelopment of BLUE WATER. We could also state publicly thatin the event of our failure to persuade our allies of the justice ofthis view by the date on which BLUE WATER might be expectedto come into service, we could rely upon the availability ofSERGEANTS: while this might serve to alleviate the damage tothe morale of the Army we should of course continue to work fora change in the strategy of the North Atlantic Alliance which wouldmake such a course unnecessary.(g) The Minister of Defence said that it would be difficult to pursue at the same time a policy of trying to persuade our allies ofthe uselessness of BLUE WATER and a continuance ofexpenditure at the rate of  25,000 a day on the development of thatweapon: this difficulty was greatly exacerbated by the detailedpublicity which had been given in the Press to the position whichhe himself had felt obliged to adopt in discussion with his colleagues.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that any public announcement of the cancellation of BLUE WATER at thepresent time must at least cast some doubt on the validity of thepresent strategy of the Alliance. It would however be unwise to announce that we should propose to acquire SERGEANTS in theevent of our failure to persuade our allies of the lightness of our strategic concepts, because this would greatly strengthen the handsof those in the United States who were concerned to increase the sales of SERGEANT. It would be better to insist on the capability of the TSR 2 aircraft to discharge whatever role might remain tobe performed by nuclear weapons in the front line. Any public announcement should include confirmation of the government&apos;s decision to proceed with the TSR 2, the third nuclear-poweredsubmarine and the other important and expensive items in thedefence programme which could be justified on wider considerationsthan applied to BLUE WATER. Ministers would wish to have further time for reflection on these matters before reaching final decisions: in the meanwhile drafts should be prepared of a public announcement on these lines and of a communication which he might make to the President of the United States, informing him ofthe Governments decision and of the reasons for it.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for thepreparation of a draft of a public announcementexplaining the cancellation of BLUE WATER togetherwith the draft of a message which he might send to thePresident of the United States.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a further meeting tobe held later that day.
