congo republic(previous reference:CC. (62) 47thConclusions,Minute 4)Parliament 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Employment 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous        President of the Board of Trade (C. (62) 122) about the disposal ofReference:       an aircraft factory at Christchurch which was owned by the MinistryCC. (60) 6th    of Aviation.Conclusions,Minute 6) The President of the Board of Trade said that the British OxygenSale of Company had been in negotiation with his Department for theChristchurch lease of a factory at Dumbarton to accommodate the Company&apos;s lightAircraft engineering production, which was at present carried on at Edmonton.Factory The factory would cost about  2 million and, on the advice of theBoard of Trade Advisory Committee, the Company had been offered a grant of  300,000 under the Local Employment Act, 1960.Unemployment in the Dumbarton area was high and the plans forthe factory, which had already received wide publicity, had beenwarmly welcomed in Scotland. The Company had, however, now decided that they would in no circumstances go to Dumbarton andthere was ground for supposing that they had taken this decisiononly after they had reached agreement to buy from the Ministry of aviation a vacant aircraft factory at Christchurch. The Board ofTrade had already refused to issue an industrial developmentcertificate for expansion by the Company in the south of England,but each of the Departments had been unaware of the Company&apos;s negotiations with the other. The contract for the sale of theChristchurch factory had not yet been signed and the question forconsideration was whether the transaction should be allowed toproceed.CC. 49 (62)1. The Cabinet were informed that there was still a serious riskof international disagreement over the Congo. If no further progress could be made towards an agreement between the central Governmentand Katanga, there would be increasing pressure for a discussion in the Security Council, and 10th August had been mentioned asa possible date for such a debate. Efforts were now being madeto convince the Prime Minister of Katanga, Mr. Tshombe, that sucha discussion was likely to result in a resolution supporting theapplication of economic sanctions to Katanga. At the same time,consultations were being held with the United States Governmentwith a view to enlisting their support for a milder form of resolution;but it must be recognise&apos;1 that in Washington there was a good dealof sympathy with the view that the Government of Katanga couldbe induced by economic pressures to come to terms with the centralGovernment.In discussion the point was made that, if this matter came to an issue before the summer recess, doubts would be publicly expressed about the expediency of continuing our financial contribution towardsthe cost of the United Nations operations in the Congo. parliament would be reluctant to endorse continued financial support of theUnited Nations if the Government had felt obliged to dissociatethemselves from the policy which the Organisation were pursuingin the Congo.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a later meeting.
There was some unemployment in the Christchurch area andthe use of the factory by the British Oxygen Company would be welcomed locally. The sale would also be financially advantageous to the Ministry of Aviation, since the next best offer which had beenreceived was  200,000 less than the British Oxygen offer. But, ifthe sale were allowed to proceed, the Government would appear tobe undermining their own policy on the location of industry. Itwas true that there was no means of preventing this Company frombuying and using another factory in the south of England, but itwould be particularly unfortunate that the Company should frustrateGovernment policy by taking over a factory which was within theGovernments own control. The President recommended that thesale should not be allowed to proceed.In discussion the following points were raised :(a) At a time when the Governments economic policiesinvolved contraction in coal mining and the railways and there wassubstantial unemployment in some of the development districts,everything possible should be done to support rather than weaken the arrangements for the proper distribution of industry. Theworsening employment situation in Scotland, which was attractingmuch public attention, would not be eased by refusal to complete the sale of the Christchurch factory, since the Company were evidently determined not to go to Scotland in any event. But refusalwould demonstrate the Governments willingness to suffer some financial disadvantage rather than abandon their general policy.(b) Although there would be economic advantages for theCompany in using the Christchurch factory, which would enablethem to reach full production two years earlier than if they had tomove to Scotland, it seemed unlikely that they would be substantiallosers if they did not obtain that particular factory.(c) The Government might be made to look foolish if refusal to complete the sale at Christchurch were soon followed by theestablishment of the Company at some other factory in the south ofEngland. But this would have to be faced. It would be inexpedient to allow the sale to proceed and to explain the Governments action by reference to the Company&apos;s stated decision against going to scotland. In the prevailing climate of opinion any such explanationwould be unconvincing.(d) The Company&apos;s behaviour in the parallel negotiations withthe Board of Trade and the Ministry of Aviation had beenreprehensible and it would be salutary that their attempts tocircumvent established Government policy should fail, and be seen to fail. But there would be criticism of the Government on a numberof points, which should be taken into account in the presentation of the decision. The Company would probably explain theirabandonment of Dumbarton as partly due to the inadequacy of thegrant they had been offered. The Government would also be criticised for failing to deal effectively with unemployment in theChristchurch area, which was attributable to their own policy of concentration in the aircraft industry, and for frustrating the most efficient production by the British Oxygen Company. Some increasemust also be expected in pressures for the building of advancefactories in the development districts.(e) This episode illustrated a weakness of present distributionof industry arrangements, namely that the Government had no powerto prevent existing privately-owned industrial premises from being sold for industrial use. Legislation would be required to remedythis, and effective measures of control a night be expensive in termsof compensation to property owners. The general policy should befurther examined by the appropriate Ministers, who should considerinter alia how far it was right to maintain the decision taken inOctober 1961 to dispose of surplus Government property at thehighest price it would fetch on the open market.
C.C. 49 (62)(/) Steps should be taken to set up a procedure amongDepartments which would ensure that a firm could not frustrateGovernment policy on the distribution of industry by carrying onsimultaneous negotiations with more than one Department.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the sale of the aircraft factory at Christchurchto the British Oxygen Company should not proceed.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Minister without Portfolio and the Minister of aviation, to arrange for the Company to be informed ofthis decision; and to consider, in the light of their discussion, how it could best be presented publicly.(3) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the other Ministers concerned, to review theprocedure adopted among Departments on the sale of Crown land for industrial purposes.(4) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrange fora general review of distribution of industry policy to beput before the appropriate Ministerial Committee.incomes policy(previous reference:C.C. (62) 46thConclusions.Minute 3)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (C. (62) 124) on the presentation of the governments incomes policy to Parliament.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in the light of furtherconfidential discussions it was now clear that the Trades UnionCongress would not welcome the establishment of a National IncomesCommission: they were unlikely to do more than acquiescereluctantly in its appointment. If the Commission were given powersto review claims with the consent of only one of the parties concerned,the Congress would be likely to come out in open opposition to it.He therefore supported the proposal, in paragraph 4 of the PrimeMinister&apos;s memorandum, that the idea of unilateral reference to theCommission should be mentioned as a point of importance on which further consultation would be required with both sides of industrybefore a decision was reached.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet with this proposal. The absence of unilateral referencewould however weaken the Commissions power to influence claims under discussion in the private sector and would put more weighton the deterrent effect of ex post facto enquiries. Until experience had been gained, the degree to which the prospect of an ex post factoenquiry would induce the parties to a dispute to bring their-case tothe Commission for review must remain a matter of judgment; much would depend on the timing, and if the Commission could producetheir reports quickly their effect would be correspondingly enhanced.Past experience with courts of enquiry appointed by the Minister ofLabour was encouraging in this respect.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the relations betweenthe Burnham Committee and the Commission should involve little difficulty. In the event of disagreement in the Committee, bothsides might be prepared to agree to reference to the Commission.The Commissions views would not be binding on either party andit would be possible in this way to introduce a greater measure of
flexibility into the negotiating procedure. There would, however,be more difficulty about the relations with the review committeesunder Lord Kindersley and Lord Franks. On balance he supported the course proposed by the Prime Minister in paragraph 6 of his memorandum. It would be unfortunate if the impression werecreated that doctors, dentists and senior civil servants would be exempted from the Governments incomes policy. The need toestablish some association between these review committees and theCommission should therefore be recognised, with the proviso thatthe precise nature of the association would need to be discussedboth with the committees themselves and with representatives of the professions concerned. It should also be implied that the association would be developed over a period of time. The position of theKindersley Committee would certainly be raised in debate in theabsence of any statement of the Governments intention, and itwould be desirable that the Prime Minister should deal with thispoint in his opening speech.The Minister of Health said that, while a reference to theKindersley Committee on the lines proposed would be likely to arouse less hostility from the doctors and dentists, he must warn theCabinet that a sharp reaction must be expected. The representativesof these professions had been induced to accept the establishmentof a review body on the understanding that it would operateindependently and would not be committed to the Governmentspoint of view. The Kindersley Committee had started its first review and to say at this stage that it was to be brought into association withthe new Commission would be represented as a breach of faith andas an attempt to interfere with the Committee&apos;s current review. Hewould prefer for this reason that no reference should be made tothe Kindersley Committee at all in presenting the governments proposals.In discussion there was general agreement that it would not bepossible to avoid any reference to the relations between theCommission and the standing review committees of which the franks Committee, the Kindersley Committee and the burnham committee were the most important. The reference could, however,be in general terms and could emphasise the Governments intentionto do no more at this stage than to consider, in consultation withthe parties concerned, the form that such association might mostusefully take. It could also be made clear, in order to avoid any suggestion that the Government were intervening in current negotiations, that the association would be developed over a periodof time.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the possibility of empowering the national incomes Commission to review wage or salary claimswith the agreement of only one of the parties concerned should be mentioned in the Governments presentation of the powers and functions of the Commission as being a point on which full consultation would be requiredwith both sides of industry before a final decision wasreached.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to include in the speech in whichhe would be presenting the Governments new incomes policy to Parliament a reference to the governments intention to consider, in association with the parties concerned, what form of association between theNational Incomes Commission and standing reviewcommittees, particularly the Kindersley Committee, could most usefully be developed in the future.
ColonialDevelopmentCorporation(previous reference:CC. (60) 39thConclusions.Minute 6)Shipping(previous reference:CC. (62) 39thConclusions,Minute 7)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Transport (C. (62) 120) on the future of the british shipping industry.The Minister of Transport said that the British merchant marinetotalling 20^- million tons was still the largest in the world, with agreater carrying capacity than it had before the war. The averageage of our ships was less than 10 years; we were carryingabout 60 per cent of our total exports and 50 per cent of our imports.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (62) 123) proposing legislation to widen the terms of reference of the Colonial Development Corporation.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the activities of theCorporation were at present confined to dependent territories. it seemed desirable to widen its terms of reference (without, however,increasing the statutory ceiling of Exchequer lending) to enable itto undertake new projects in any former British colonial or mandated territory which after 1948 had achieved or might achieve independence within the Commonwealth. Legislation for this purpose would be generally welcomed, and he sought authority to announce toParliament before the summer recess that such legislation would beintroduced in the following session.In discussion there was general agreement that the Corporation^terms of reference should be widened. The following points were raised:(a) Although the Bill was not likely to be controversial, it wouldtake up time on the floor of the House. Its place in the legislative programme should be considered at a meeting of the future legislation Committee which would be held later that week.(b) An announcement might be better made in The QueemsSpeech on the Opening of Parliament than in the last few days beforethe summer recess. It was, however, understood that the staff ofthe Corporation had been unsettled about their future and that anearly announcement would help to reassure them. The Chairmanof the Corporation should be asked whether sufficient reassurancewould be given if the staff concerned were privately informed of theGovernments intentions.(c) The proposed extension of the Corporation^ scope had been based on the assumption that India, Pakistan and Ceylon shouldnot be included, since there were already adequate means of assistingthese territories. But further thought might be given to the questionwhether the extension of its scope should in form be limited toterritories whose independence had been achieved since 1948.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposal in C. (62) 123 forextension of the terms of reference of the colonial development Corporation.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to bring before anearly meeting of the Future Legislation Committee theproposal to include a Bill for this purpose in the legislative programme for 1962-63.(3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to consider further,in consultation with the Chairman of the Corporation,the need for an early announcement of the government&apos;s decision.
Nevertheless, the present state of the industry gave rise to serious concern. In terms of the balance of payments, its earnings had fallen from a surplus of about  150 million to a deficit of over 60 million. Shipping companies were barely covering depreciationand their difficulties had been increased by substantial increases in wages. Shipping rates were in general low, in some cases lower thanat any time since the war.The general state of the shipping industry also affectedshipbuilding. British shipowners were ordering new shipping at a rate which represented only one-third of the rate required to maintainthe British merchant marine at its present strength. This would maintain only about half the present shipbuilding industry and, ifthe rate of ordering did not improve, serious contraction wouldbe inevitable. The total world capacity for building ships was abouttwice the highest likely level of demand. The state of the docks and ports of the United Kingdom had been under study by an advisorycommittee. Their report would be published in the autumn andits recommendations would be radical. There was undoubtedly scope for considerable improvement, but the report would be unpopular with the interests concerned.The Minister said that for the time being he sought the authorityof the Cabinet to proceed on the lines set out in his memorandum.This would involve the appointment of a shipping advisory panelincluding, under his chairmanship, representatives of both sides ofthe shipping industry, of other industry and of the Board of Trade;measures to improve the training of engineer officers; theestablishment of a research unit; the encouragement of technicalresearch covering both shipbuilding and the organisation of shipping and cargo handling; and the promotion of measures of standardisation. He attached particular importance to the firstproposal; there was at present far too little contact between the two sides of the shipping industry and no forum in which their commonproblems could be discussed.In discussion there was general support for these proposals.Their financial implications should be discussed with the Treasury,but within the limits of such expenditure as might be agreed theresources of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Researchwould be available to help with the work. Labour relations andlabour practices in docks and shipyards were still causing difficulty,but there had recently been signs of some improvement and it wasto be hoped that this would continue.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Transport to proceed with theestablishment of a shipping advisory panel and with theother measures for training and research set out inC. (62) 120.(2) Took note that action to improve the organisation of docks and ports in the United Kingdom could not be taken until the report of the advisory committee on ports hadbeen received.InternationalMonetaryFund(previous reference:C.C. (61) 74thConclusions,Minute 4)7. The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded the Cabinet thatin August 1961 the Government had negotiated with the international monetary Fund a drawing equivalent of $1,500 million and a one-year stand-by arrangement for a further $500 million. Of thisdrawing about $1,000 million had been repaid. It was now proposedto repay the balance of the drawing amounting to about $500 million,and to negotiate at the same time a renewal of the stand-by arrangement for $1,000 million instead of the $500 million negotiatedin August.

The effect of this transaction would be to show a fall of over 180 million in the published reserves. As against this the reserves would still stand at over  1,000 million and would be reinforced by the new stand-by. In fact we should have converted over  180million of the first-line reserves into a stand-by of an equal amount and acquired in addition a further stand-by for the same amount.It would also be taken as evidence of the general soundness of theUnited Kingdom&apos;s position that we should have repaid in fullwithin one year the largest single drawing ever granted by the Fund.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th July, 1962.
