The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet thathe, together with the Minister of Labour and the Minister ofTransport, had interviewed Dr. Beeching. the Chairman of the british transport Commission, that morning. Dr. Beeching had made itclear that as a matter of good management and good relations he regarded it as incumbent upon him to open the negotiations with therailway unions by offering an increase of 6 per cent in present wagelevels: he hoped that the negotiations might be concluded at that figure but was prepared to go to 7 per cent if necessary. He had made it clear that, if he were to start negotiations at any lower figure than6 per cent, he would need specific direction from the Government.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he felt that in thecircumstances he should now write privately to Dr. Beeching makingthe single point that it was unacceptable to the Government that thenegotiations should start at such a high figure as 6 per cent. The nextstep could be decided in the light of Dr. Beeching&apos;s reply. There was some urgency in the matter, since negotiations with the railway unions were to due to start on 5th November.In discussion the following points were made:(a) While it was probably the case that the Government couldlegally give a direction to Dr. Beeching in a matter which concerned the railway industry as a whole and not merely particular claimswithin that industry, it was unlikely that the legai point would arise in practice. Dr. Beeching was not interested in the legal basisof a direction to him to adopt some other course of action than thatwhich he favoured himself; his concern was to shift the moralresponsibility from himself to the Government, and a letter from the responsible Minister would achieve that object. The letter whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer now proposed to send would not,however, purport to constitute a formal direction: it would be aprivate letter not intended for publication.(b) At the next stage, particularly if Dr. Beeching asked the specific question, it might be necessary to inform him that in theGovernments view the maximum acceptable figure for a settlement was 5 per cent. But there would be advantage in withholding this information for the present, in the hope that Dr. Beeching might takethe initiative in suggesting it. It was important, however, that dr. Beeching should not be left with the impression that any settlement at a figure less than 6 per cent, e.g., at per cent, wouldbe acceptable. The wording of the letter from the Chancellor of theExchequer would need to be looked at from this point of view.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to write to theChairman of the British Transport Commission, in terms tobe agreed with the Minister of Labour and the Minister ofTransport, informing him that his proposal to open negotiations with the railway unions at a figure of 6 per centwas unacceptable to the Government.Federationof RhodesiaandNyasaland(previous references:CC. (62) 39thConclusions,Minute 6, and cc. (62) 44thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Cabinet had before them two memoranda bv the first secretary of State (C. (62) 168 and C. (62) 167) setting out his viewson the best way to deal with the problems for Central Africa posedby Nyasaland&apos;s desire to withdraw from the Federation, and hisparticular proposals for handling the Nyasaland constitutional conference due to begin on 12th November.&quot;&quot;Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
The First Secretary of State said that he sought his colleagues&apos;agreement that, before the Nyasaland Conference started work, theGovernment should announce their acceptance in principle thatNyasaland should be allowed to withdraw from the Federation, andtheir intention, in the light of the forthcoming elections in northern and Southern Rhodesia, of initiating bilateral discussions with theFederal and Territorial Governments on the future association of the territories. He had no doubt that Nyasaland must be allowed towithdraw from the Federation, and this view was not only prevalentthroughout Central Africa but was privately accepted by the PrimeMinister of Southern Rhodesia, Sir Edgar Whitehead, and even bythe Federal Prime Minister, Sir Roy Welensky. Although it would inevitably lead in time to the dissolution of the Federation as such,there was really no alternative. It would be impossible to attemptto keep Nyasaland in the Federation by the use of Federal troops.Moreover, it would be difficult to achieve anything of value in theConstitutional Conference unless we had already made public our willingness to accept Nyasaland&apos;s withdrawal front the Federation.Without that the Nyasaland Government would not apply themselvesrationally either to the problems of the country or to its futurerelationship with the Rhcdesias. On the positive side, he believedthat such an announcement would enable him, during the Conference,to avoid any commitment about independence for Nyasaland; andthis was particularly desirable in order to avoid provoking demands for independence from the Rhodesias. In his statement aboutbilateral discussions with the Central African Governments he proposed to be as constructive as he could and to indicate theGovernment^ desire to secure a close and durable future association between the Rhodesias (and if possible Nyasaland). He was,however, sure that it would not be wise at this stage to indicate a firmdate for a conference to discuss such an association. Even bilateraltalks with the Governments concerned could scarcely be profitableuntil the forthcoming elections in Northern and Southern Rhodesiahad taken place. The Northern Rhodesian elections would be heldon 30th October but were likely to result in a stalemate between theUnited Federal Party and the United National Independence Party.Few of the &quot; National&quot; seats would be likely to be filled on the firstround and by-elections would then be necessary, so that the finalresult in Northern Rhodesia would not be apparent until December.The Southern Rhodesian elections were also timed for December.The talks which he contemplated could not therefore be held until about the end of the year. He had asked Sir Edgar Whitehead during their conversation earlier in the day about the effect on the southern rhodesian elections of an announcement about Nyasaland&apos;withdrawal from the Federation and Sir Edgar Whitehead had repliedthat, although his Opposition, who were themselves secessionists,would no doubt try to make capital out of it. he did not think thatthe issue would in itself significantly affect the outcome of theelections.The following were the main points made in discussion:(a) If only to avoid the likely repercussions in the Rhodesias andon the Federal Government, it was desirable in any public announcement to avoid using language which suggested thatNyasaland had a right to secede from the Federation. On the otherhand, although an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament would benecessary to permit Nyasaland&apos;s withdrawal, it was also desirableto avoid the impression that the United Kingdom Government were themselves primarily responsible for this step towards the dissolution of the Federation.(b) The problem of the future association of the territoriespresented a serious dilemma. If our past efforts to create amultiracial society in Central Africa were to break down, theconsequences could be extremely grave leading perhaps to an
The Cabinet (1) Expressed their general agreement with the proposals putforward by the First Secretary of State for dealing withthe problem of Nyasaland&apos;s desire to withdraw from theFederation and with the future of the two Rhodesias.(2) Took note that, shortly before the opening of the NyasalandConstitutional Conference, the First Secretary of state would inform them of any significant developments whichhad meanwhile taken place in Central Africa, and wouldalliance between Southern Rhodesia, South Africa and Angola. Itwas therefore arguable that we should, without delay, formulate firm proposals for the future of the Rhodesias and announce our determination to hold them together, although the effective meansof doing so should be worked out locally. This would not be easy;for if we pressed our views on future relationships between the territories too openly or too early the result might be to destroy all hope of obtaining African agreement to any sort of association at all.On the other hand, if we made little or no attempt to obtain an association with political content and sought no more than a common market, we might precipitate a violent reaction from the federal government as a whole and Sir Roy Welensky in particular, since his minimum demands included some central control of foreign affairs and defence. It was already clear from the most recent correspondence with him that he was reacting badly to the issue of Nyasaland&apos;withdrawal from the Federation; and, while he was unlikely toproceed to extremes over that, he and his colleagues in the federal government would fight to the last for their concept of what thefuture relationship of the Rhodesias should be. On balance it wouldbe better to delay the formulation of final proposals until after the bilateral discussions proposed by the First Secretary of State hadtaken place. Sir Edgar Whitehead had said that he could make nomove in a liberal direction until his elections were over but that itwould then be his intention to take an early initiative of that kind:he also hoped that, after the elections, he might be able to make some progress with the new Northern Rhodesian Government beforeinvolving the United Kingdom.(c) Future defence arrangements required examination. Thepresent forces were considerable in size and of reasonably goodquality, but they were entirely Federal and it would be necessary toconsider new arrangements. The Chiefs of Staff had looked at theproblem some two years ago but the First Secretary of State would now let the Minister of Defence have material enabling him to ask the Chiefs of Staff to look at it again.(d) The withdrawal of Nyasaland from the Federation wouldhave grave financial consequences, not only for her but also for theUnited Kingdom. The Nyasaland budget was at present in deficitby some  1-5 million a year: during the first few years afterwithdrawal the deficit would be about  5 million a year on a budget of  14 million. The Nyasaland Government believed they could go some way to close the gap but it looked as though the United kingdom would be called upon to supply at least  2-5 million a year for anumber of years. The First Secretary of State would go into this problem in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Ifthe Nyasaland Government could be persuaded to exercisemoderation e.g., by refraining from the erection of a customs barrieragainst Southern Rhodesia the two Rhodesias, either in associationor separately, might be prepared to give Nyasaland a substantial measure of assistance.
bring before them a draft of his proposed statement onNyasaland&apos;s withdrawal and on subsequent bilateralconversations with the Federal and territorial governments.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with the first secretary of State, to arrange for a review of militaryarrangements in Central Africa.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th October, 1962.
