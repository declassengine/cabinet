i17Bermuda 2.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of his impressionsMeeting. 1961 0f ine discussions which he had held with President Kennedy during their meeting in Bermuda on 21st and 22nd December. This was hisfourth meeting with President Kennedy, and on each occasion he hadbeen increasingly impressed by the President^ ability and candour,it was encouraging to find that, on so many questions of common concern, he and the President were so largely in agreement. It was equally satisfactory that, where their views diverged, they coulddiscuss their differences without embarrassment or risk of misunder-standing. This meeting had confirmed his impression that we had succeeded in establishing with the new Administration in the UnitedStates a sound basis of understanding and co-operation.The Prime Minister said that the particular questions discussed at the Bermuda meeting would be brought forward separately forconsideration by the Cabinet, as might be necessary.3. The Prime Minister said that he had been encouraged to find,in the discussions in Bermuda, that President Kennedy was determined to enter into negotiation with the Soviet Government about Berlin.He would not be deflected by the intransigence of General de Gaulle:he believed that if the United States, the United Kingdom andGermany agreed that there was a basis for negotiation. France would eventually come into line. American thinking on Berlin was nowmuch closer to ours than it had been six months ago.The Foreign Secretary said that agreement had been reached atBermuda on the instructions to be sent to Mr. Thompson, the UnitedStates Ambassador in Moscow, for his opening talks withMr. Gromyko. the Soviet Foreign Minister. These should giveMr. Thompson enough scope for three or four meetings, extending over some weeks, and should enable him to judge whether the soviet union really wanted to reach a settlement. If these conversationswere successful, it was envisaged that a meeting of Foreign ministers would follow. If they failed, it was President Kennedy&apos;s view that weshould still work for negotiations, possibly culminating in a meeting of heads of Governments, at which we should try to find at least somemodus vivendi.In Berlin itself, the situation in the United States sector remainedsomewhat dangerous. The political adviser to the United StatesCommandant had recently been prevented from entering East Berlinbecause, although wearing civilian clothes, he had refused to producehis identity documents.   The Commandant, wearing uniform, hadSECRET60360-3 a 2GermanyBerlin(previous reference:C.C. (61) 75thConclusions.Minute -1)C.C. 1 (62)Prospect of I.   Welcoming his colleagues to their first meeting in 1962 the1962 Prime Minister said that in the coming year they would have to face a formidable number of difficult problems. The size of the questions for solution whether in foreign affairs, in Commonwealth relationsor in economic policy was a measure of the opportunities for social and political improvement which their solution would open up.Large views were needed, and he hoped that his colleagues would look at their Departmental problems in the context of these broader issues.He looked forward to 1962 as a challenging year, which might turn outbetter in the event than seemed probable at the moment.The Lord Chancellor expressed, on behalf of the Cabinet, theirgratitude to the Prime Minister for his leadership in the past and their loyalty and support in the tasks which lay ahead.
then unsuccessfully attempted to escort him across the boundary. Asa reprisal the Russian Commandant had been refused access to theUnited States sector of Berlin, although the United States authorities had raised no objection to his being allowed access to the Britishsector. Nevertheless these were indications that both president kennedy and the United States Secretary of State had come to appreciate the risks of provocative action in Berlin and were preparedto exercise firmer control over the United States authorities in the city.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Prime Minister and theForeign Secretary.nuclear tests(previous reference:c.c. (6i) 6:Conclusions,Minute 4)*4. The Cabinet had before themMinister (C. (62) 1) on nuclear tests.memorandum bv the PrimerdThe Prime Minister said that during their meeting in Bermuda on21st and 22nd December he and the Foreign Secretary had held a full discussion with President Kennedy and the United States Secretary ofState on the question whether the United States should conduct afurther programme of nuclear tests in the atmosphere. Sir WilliamPenney. Deputy Chairman of the United Kingdom Atomic energy authority, and Dr. Seaborg. Chairman of the United States atomic energy Commission, had submitted a considered assessment of therecent series of Russian tests. This suggested that there was a strongmilitary case for a resumption of testing by the United States if theywere to avoid the risk of falling behind the Soviet Union, especially inthe anti-missile field. If a further programme of tests were to beundertaken by the United States, it would be convenient if part ofit could be mounted at Christmas Island, though certain high altitudetests would be made elsewhere. President Kennedy shared his ownreluctance to authorise further tests in the atmosphere, but he was likely to sanction them in the spring of 1962 unless by then there hadbeen some substantial improvement in East-West relations. ThePresident was therefore anxious that the preliminary preparations should be made so that, when a decision was taken, the tests could beundertaken without delay. He hoped that the United KingdomGovernment would be ready to support a United States decision to resume testing and that they would be willing to make christmas island available for this purpose.The Prime Minister said that he had expressed to the Presidenthis strong view that testing should not be resumed until a further attempt had been made to halt the nuclear arms race. He had therefore suggested that the President and he should jointly considerthe possibility of taking some fresh initiative in the field of disarmament. He had promised to let the President have his detailedthoughts on this as soon as possible. Meanwhile, he could not agreeto the use of Christmas Island for nuclear tests until he had consultedhis Cabinet colleagues, but officials might begin to consider the termsof a formal agreement lor financial and administrative matters withoutprejudice to a final decision. He had also informed the President thathe recognised that if the Cabinet agreed to the use of Christmas Island,it would be unreasonable for the United Kingdom Government loclaim more than a right to be consulted about the final decision.Since his return from Bermuda, he had given further thought tothese questions. Although it was difficult to resist the conclusion thata resumption of tests was justified within the terms of the declaration with  he  and  the  President  had  made  on  31st  October  andPreviously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
1st November, he feared that if these tests were held they would opena new phase in the nuclear arms race. It was by no means certain thata system of defence against missiles would be practicable; thedifficulties were immense and the cost enormous, certainly beyond themeans of this country and probably crippling for either the UnitedStates or the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, ihe advantage which eithercountry would gain from being the first to perfect a missile defence system was such that neither could afford to risk letting the other getahead. It would, however, be far better for both, and for the worldat large, if they were to agree to direct their energies and resources to more productive purposes. Our close collaboration with the UnitedStates in nuclear defence, our important contribution to the strategicdeterrent and our control of Christmas Island gave us a uniqueopportunity, though a fleeting one, for taking the initiative in suggesting that a fresh attempt should be made to secure an effectiveinternational agreement on disarmament. It was possible thatMr. Khrushchev might find such an approach attractive; for he didnot himself accept the Marxist doctrine that war between capitalismand Communism was ultimately inevitable and it seemed likely thathis primary concern was to improve the standard of living of theRussian people.The Prime Minister said that in these circumstances he had prepared a letter to President Kennedy suggesting that, before theWestern Powers resumed nuclear testing, a further attempt should bemade to improve East-West relations, to make progress towardsdisarmament and to break out of the vicious circle of the nuclear armsrace. To this end he and President Kennedy might invite Mr.Khrushchev to concert with them (and perhaps also the French)methods of ensuring that the 18-Power Conference on Disarmament,which was due to begin in the middle of March, would make practicalprogress. It might be desirable to make it clear that the decision whether or not to resume nuclear testing would be taken in the lightof the Soviet response to this initiative. The decision about christmas island might be announced at the same time as the broad lines of sucha disarmament proposal; but, in addition to the public statement, amore detailed private communication should be sent to MrKhrushchev urging him to co-operate in giving impetus to the workof the Disarmament Conference. It would be necessary to inform general de Gaulle and Dr. Adenauer of what we had in mind. Thepublic statement could be on the following lines:(i) That the present technical situation justified and even required a further series of nuclear tests by the West for purely military reasons.On this basis the United Kingdom Government had agreed thatChristmas Island should be made ieady for a further series of tests tobe undertaken by the United States authorities, though the finaldecision to hold this series would not be taken without further Anglo-American consultation in the light of international developments.(ii) That we nevertheless deplored the necessity for tests and wereprofoundly concerned for the future if a hall could not be called in the nuclear arms race.(iii) That we were determined to make a further effort to breakout of this vicious circle and were making proposals to the SovietGovernment on disarmament (of which a short outline could be given)and that the final decision to make the tests would be dependent onthe reception given to this initiative.The Cabinet then considered the draft letter, copies of which were handed round at the meeting. In discussion the following points weremade:(a) There was general agreement that a determined effort shouldbe made to prevent the opening of a new phase in the nuclear armsrace, and that the United States request for the use of Christmas Island
gave us a special opportunity of intervening to this end. There might,however, be difficulties of timing. The President wished the preparations at Christmas Island to be started as soon as possible, andas soon as it was known that this work was in progress it would beassumed that we had agreed in principle that tests should be resumed.It would not therefore be easy for the suggested approach to Mr.Khrushchev to be made in time for him to give it reasonableconsideration, before we had in fact committed ourselves to a resumption of testing. On the other hand, it seemed certain that if the americans decided that they must resume testing, they would do soeven if we refused them the use of Christmas Island; and in that event we should have lost our special status for proposing negotiations withthe Soviet Union.(b) The inclusion of the French in the discussions to concertmeasures for ensuring the success of the 18-Power Conference on disarmament, especially if it led to a request that the Chinese shouldalso take part, would add to the difficulties of reaching agreement.It could not be expected that these difficulties could be overcome by using the resumption of tests by the West as a threat, and it would be advisable to word our proposals so to avoid giving the impression thatthis was our intention.(c) It might prove difficult to reconcile the suggestion that thefinal decision to resume tests should remain with the President andthe statement made by the Prime Minister on 31st October that he must be personally satisfied that tests were necessary. Any announce-ment might therefore have to take the form that there had been jointagreement that tests should take place, but that a further attemptwould be made to reach an international agreement on disarmamentbefore they were finally authorised.(d) It seemed clear that the Russians had made a substantialmove towards changing the balance of nuclear power. It was notequally clear that the tests which the Americans had in mind were those best designed to close the gap; it might well be that they weresimply those which could be mounted most quickly.The Prime Minister said that if at this stage we were to refuse tomake Christmas Island available, we should not thereby prevent the americans from holding tests and we should have lost the opportunityto take a political initiative. It would not, however, be possible forus to dissociate ourselves from American tests held elsewhere than at christmas Island without grave damage to the Anglo-Americanrelationship and in particular to our arrangements for co-operation innuclear defence.The Prime Minister then suggested that the Cabinet shouldresume their discussion of this question at a further meeting that afternoon, when he would arrange for Sir William Penney to beavailable to assist them in their consideration of the technical case forresuming nuclear testing.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at afurther meeting later in the day.Cabinet Office, S.W.J,3rd January, 1962.
