Incomes Policy        2.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that at their services Pay     meeting on 15th February the Cabinet had agreed to award increases(Previous        in pay to the Services equivalent to 5 per cent, for officers and 9\ perReference:      cent, for other ranks calculated on the basis of pay and marriageC.C. (62) 14th   allowance combined.  He had, however, been invited to consider, in conclusions,     consultation with the other Ministers concerned, the timing and minute 4)       method of giving effect to this award.  Three possibilities had beenconsidered; to pay the increases in full from July, 1962, which would cost  21 million during the current year; to pay them in full from october, 1962, which would cost  14 million in the current year; or topay them in two instalments from 1st April, 1962, and 1st April, 1963,respectively which would cost  14 million in the current year.  If the increases were paid in full from October National Servicemen whoseperiod of service had been extended would be deprived of any increase at all and for this reason he did not now recommend this course.Most of the Ministers concerned favoured payment in two instalmentsand this was the course which he himself would favour.In discussion the following points were made:(a) While there was a risk that increases in Service pay either of4f per cent, or cf 9\ per cent, would have some effect on current wage negotiations, previous experience seemed to show that public opinion,especially in the trades unions, regarded Service pay as in a different category from industrial earnings. This factor should be stressedwhen the increases were announced. It would be undesirable toemphasise the extent to which the Governments decision had been influenced by their commitment to base increases in Service pay onmovements of earnings in comparable civilian employment.(b) To delay any award until July would lead to disappointmentand might affect recruiting. On the other hand to make the award intwo instalments could be represented as a breach of faith; for, whilethe Governments undertaking to implement the recommendations ofthe Advisory Committee on Recruiting had not been specific aboutdates, it had been generally understood that increases in Service pay would take effect from 1st April at successive two-year intervals. Ifthe present award were made in two instalments it would have to be argued that in spite of the special position of the Services it was reasonable that they should be called on to make some sacrifice inthe interests of the national economy.The Cabinet Agreed that increases in Service pay equivalent to 5 per cent,for officers and 9\ per cent, for other ranks in terms of pay and marriage allowance combined should be awarded in twoequal instalments from 1st April, 1962, and 1st April, 1963.Public j 3.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he proposed to expenditure make a statement in the House of Commons on 27th February onVote on Account the Vote on Account and would circulate in advance, for the(Previous comments of his Cabinet colleagues, a draft of what he proposed to reference: say. In some quarters in the House and in some sections of theC.C. (62) 14th Press the statement would not be well received, but the publication of conclusions, recent Supplementary Estimates had already indicated that it was minute 3) unlikely that the Estimates for the forthcoming year could be kept within the terms of the pledge which he had give in the previous July.Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
Six items, including in particular agriculture, transport and defence,accounted for about seven-eighths of the increase of  384 million inthe Estimates.In discussion it was agreed that stress could be laid on the factthat defence expenditure would increase by about  100 millionalthough, as a mattter of accounting, some part of this had beentransferred to the civil side. This substantial increase should go someway to meet foreign criticism that the Government were failing tocarry their full share of allied military expenditure. It might also be helpful to allow the Press to have some advanced indication of thegeneral nature of the statement, although they should not be giventhe figures comprised in it. Preparations were being made to provideMinisters not in the Cabinet with material which could be used inspeeches in the country.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.british guiana(previous reference;C.C. (60) 21stConclusions,Minute 5)4. The Colonial Secretary said that the political situation inBritish Guiana reflected the growing racial tension between the indian and the African elements in the population. This had culminatedin violent demonstrations against the Budget recently introduced byDr. Jagan&apos;s Government; and the Governor had been obliged to call for the assistance of British troops in restoring law and order. Navaland military forces had been sent in, and the immediate difficulties had been overcome. It was however more difficult to see how theposition could be stabilised in the longer term; and he would bebringing this question before the Colonial Policy Committee whenhe had received and considered the appreciation from the Governorfor which he had asked. He feared, however, that it would bedifficult to meet the desire of the United States Government that thegrant of independence to British Guiana should be deferred until there was a sure prospect of a more stable Government.The Minister of Defence said that he hoped that it would bepossible so to arrange matters as to enable a substantial proportion ofthe British forces now in British Guiana to be withdrawn in the nearfuture.In discussion the point was made that it was an invidiousresponsibility for the United Kingdom Government to be under an obligation to use British troops to help an unpopular Left-winggovernment to remain in office in a British dependency during aperiod of full self-government before independence.The Cabinet Took note that the Colonial Secretary would present to theColonial Policy Committee his proposals on future constitutional development in British Guiana.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd February, 1962.
