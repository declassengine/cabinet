The Foreign Secretary said that in the last few days theRussians had made no attempt to harass Western aircraft using theair corridors to West Berlin. No notifications had been received offurther operations by Russian aircraft in the corridors.The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Governmenthad brought pressure to bear on President Sukarno to authorise the resumption of the discussions between representatives of the dutch and Indonesian Governments on the future of West Irian. As aresult the Indonesians now seemed willing to consider a phasedprogramme for the transfer of power. The Dutch Government were however showing some resentment at this intervention by the UnitedStates, and were at present reluctant to resume the negotiations.Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference :C.C. (62) 21stConclusions,Minute 1)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (62) 59) on future developments in the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland.The Home Secretary said that the most immediate problem wasto find a means of preventing precipitate action by Dr. Banda, whohad already made clear his determination to demand Nyasaland&apos;right to secede from the Federation. The difficulties were two-fold.Firstly, if Nyasaland were allowed to secede from the Federationbefore the possibility of some other form of association between theCentral African territories had been thoroughly explored, it wouldbe difficult to prevent the secession of Northern Rhodesia at a later stage, and the difficulties of preserving some continuing links betweenthe territories would be greatly increased. Secondly, Dr. Banda had committed himself publicly to the principle of secession, which hadbeen endorsed by the recent National Congress of his supporters; andit would be necessary to make some concession to him as a conditionof further progress. There was, however, some reason to think thathe was becoming aware of the economic advantage to Nyasaland ofsome continued association with the other territories of the federation and would be willing to consider proposals to this end. The problem was to devise a procedure which would make it possible to discuss ina constructive way the possible forms of future association, not only between Nyasaland and the other territories, but between northern and Southern Rhodesia, which would make a sufficient concession to Dr. Banda on the right of Nyasaland to secede to enable him to contain his Nationalist supporters and to gain time, but would not make the secession of Northern Rhodesia inevitable.The Home Secretary said that the proposals in his paper had been framed to meet this situation. It would be necessary for the UnitedKingdom Government to take the lead, especially as the PrimeMinister of the Federation, Sir Roy Welensky, was unwilling to putforward any constructive proposals. He therefore intended to appoint a small mission to consider with the Government of Nyasaland theconsequences which would flow from Nyasaland&apos;s secession fromthe Federation and the possibility of other forms of association;and to consider with the four Governments in the Federation the parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week. It was hoped that the debate on the Budget Resolutions would be completed by the end ofthe week.
parallel question of future relations of Northern and SouthernRhodesia with Nyasaland and with each other. If this mission wereto command the confidence and co-operation of Dr. Banda it wouldbe necessary to recognise before the mission started work that in thelast resort it would be impossible to avoid the withdrawal of Nyasalandfrom the existing Federation if the people so wished. If theseproposals were broadly acceptable, the High Commissioner in salisbury and the Governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland would be authorised to take preparatory soundings without delay.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It would be important to avoid the impression that anotherindependent commission of enquiry was being appointed and also toavoid any commitment to publish the findings of this body. It might therefore be better that the members of the mission should be described as being special advisers to the Home Secretary and that their work should be regarded as an extension of the work of the Central AfricaOffice. It might be better that they should report periodically as their work progressed, rather than submit a final and comprehensivedocument.(b) The economic aspects of the situation were of greatimportance. The mission should therefore include an economist or business man of standing, whose opinions would carry weight withbusiness interests in Central Africa. It should also be made clear to dr. Banda that, if he were to reject the financial advantages toNyasaland of continued association with the other two territories, hecould not expect the United Kingdom Government to finance his budget deficit.(c) Important economic considerations were also involved in thecontinued association of Northern and Southern Rhodesia. Thiswould be a cardinal point in any future arrangements for the area.If no other solution could be found, because-of political difficulties,it might be possible to secure joint economic action and planningthrough the medium of some neutral and independent organisationsuch as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.(d) The terms of reference of the mission should be so drawnthat they were not confined to discussion with official representativesof the Governments concerned.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Home Secretary to appoint a small group ofspecial advisers to discuss with the appropriate authoritiesin Nyasaland, in Northern and Southern Rhodesia andwith the Government of the Federation, possible formsof future association of the three territories concerned,including the economic aspects of such association.(2) Agreed that the United Kingdom High Commissioner in salisbury and the Governors of Northern and SouthernRhodesia should be authorised to take preparatorysoundings to this end.(3) Took note that it would be necessary, before the specialadvisers could start work, to inform Dr. Banda that theUnited Kingdom Government recognised that it wouldbe impossible to avoid the withdrawal of Nyasaland fromthe present Federation if its people so wished.4. The Colonial Secretary said that the outlines of a constitution for self-government in Kenya had now been accepted both by therepresentatives of the Kenya African National Union (KANU) and bythe Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU). It was, however,proving more difficult to form a coalition government to examine thedetails of the constitution and bring it to the point at which elections

Zanzibar 5.   The Colonial Secretary said that the Zanzibar ConstitutionalConstitutional Conference had now come to an end. He had made every effort to development secure a coalition of the two main parties as a necessary condition ofthe attainment of self-government but without success. The partynow in power did not want a coalition at all and did not want electionsbefore independence; and the main party in opposition, while willingto enter a coalition, would do so only on the basis that elections wouldbe held before independence. There appeared to be no means of bringing the two parties together. With the agreement of the colonial policy Committee he had therefore informed the parties represented at the conference that, as they had been unable to come to anagreement among themselves, the Government could not set dateseither for internal self-government or for independence in Zanzibar.-The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Colonial Secretary.national theatre(previous reference:C.C. (61) 34thConclusions,Minute 1)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary, Treasury(C. (62) 57) on the project for a National Theatre.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the Joint Council forthe National Theatre, in response to the invitation given to theirChairman after the Cabinefs previous discussion, had now submitted a scheme for the consideration of the Government and the LondonCounty Council (L.C.C.). The scheme provided for an arena theatreand an opera house on the South Bank and for the repair andrenovation of the Old Vic building in Waterloo Road. At a later date(possibly in 25 years, when the Old Vic building might have to bereplaced) a proscenium theatre would be built on a site adjoining thearena theatre. The opera house would be in substitution for theSadler&apos;s Wells Theatre, which was unsuitable for opera, and wouldbecome the headquarters of the Sadler&apos;s Wells Company. The capitalexpenditure required to implement the scheme would be met from the 1 million already authorised by Parliament, the  1 -3 million offered by the L.C.C. and the proceeds of the sale of the Sadler&apos;s Wellsbuilding. It was understood that the L.C.C. would provide the South Bank sites free of charge.C.C. 26 (62)could be held under it. The KANU representatives had proposedthat Mr. Kenyatta should head the coalition Government and thatfirm dates should be established for self-government and for independence. He had rejected the first proposal; and on the secondhad said that a date for self-government could not be established untilthe details of the Constitution had been worked out and elections hadbeen held and that no date for independence could be discussed until a Government had taken office under the new Constitution. A further difficulty had been caused by the suggestion that Mr. Oginga Odingashould take office in the coalition Government. The colonial secretary said that, while it was arguable that it might be better toallow Mr. Odinga to take office in a coalition Government since he might then be liable to prosecution for financial irregularity, he feltthat in present circumstances there was no practical alternative toinsisting on his exclusion. It was possible therefore that KANU might still refuse to participate in a coalition Government on one or other of these grounds. The outcome was still in doubt, but was likely tobecome clear in the following week.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Colonial Secretary.
In preparing their scheme the Joint Council had consulted the arts Council and the managements of the theatres at Stratford, Sadler&apos;sWells and the Old Vic. The Stratford Theatre did not wish to beincluded in the scheme and a proposal which they had made for anational federation to include the three managements was not supported either by the Joint Council or by the Arts Council. Itwould, however, be prudent to allow for a modest annual subsidy toStratford from the Arts Council. The provinces would benefit fromthe separate assistance which would be given for provincial touringby the National Theatre Company and from the additional  150,000a year, starting in 1962-63, which the Government had already promised the Arts Council for provincial theatres.From informal discussions it appeared that the Arts council would advise the Government to accept the scheme; and the L.C.C.were also likely to accept it. The next step would be for the joint council to publish their scheme so that it could be submitted formally to the Arts Council for advice. The Government could not be committed to the scheme before receiving advice from the Arts Counciland it would be convenient to make this clear before the easter recess in answer to an arranged Question.The Cabinet Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to suggest to theChairman of the Joint Council for the National Theatre thatthe CounciTs scheme should now be published so that itcould be submitted formally to the Arts Council for their advice.Disarmament *7.   The Prime Minister said that the attempt to make progress,Nuclear Tests at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament, towards an international(Previous agreement for the cessation of nuclear tests was frustrated by the reference: refusal of the Soviet Government to accept any provision for on-siteC.C. (62) 25th inspection within Soviet territory. He and the Foreign Secretary had conclusions, therefore continued, in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussions on minute 6) 22nd and 30th March, their consultations with the United StatesGovernment on the best means of making it plain to world opinionthat responsibility for the breakdown of these negotiations and,consequentially, for the continuance of nuclear testing rested whollywith the Soviet Government. It was common ground that a joint statement should be issued during the following week, on behalf of theUnited States and United Kingdom Governments, defining the areaof disagreement in such a way as to make it plain that the SovietGovernment were refusing to accept any arrangement for objectiveinternational verification; and there would be no difficulty in reaching agreement on the text of such a statement. The outstanding question for decision was whether, before this joint statement was issued, a finalpersonal request should be made to Mr. Khrushchev urging him toaccept the principle of international verification by on-site inspection.President Kennedy had said that he would not be prepared to join in making such a request to Mr. Khrushchev, but he had indicated that, if the Prime Minister wished to do so, he would raise no objectionand could even see some advantage in this course from the point ofview of the West as a whole. The Prime Minister invited the viewsof his colleagues on the question whether he should take anindependent initiative in addressing such a request to Mr. Khrushchev.Discussion showed that there was some difference of opinionwithin the Cabinet on this question.In favour of making this final request to Mr. Khrushchev it was argued that this would effectively demonstrate that the UnitedKingdom Government had persisted up to the last moment in their* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
CC. 26 (62)efforts to secure international agreement for the cessation of nuclear tests. They would be seen to have taken every initiative towards thisend which was open to them. This would be reassuring to publicopinion in this country. If he returned a negative reply Mr.Khrushchev would be personally identified with the intransigentattitude which the Soviet representatives had taken up in thenegotiations at Geneva. A negative response need not be damaging to United Kingdom prestige; for the letter could be framed as a request, not an appeal, and it could be couched in such terms that the rejection of its request would appear to flout the wishes, not of theUnited Kingdom alone, but of all those countries which wished to end the dangers of a nuclear arms race.On the other side it was argued that, by taking an independentinitiative at this stage, we might appear to world opinion to be dividingourselves from the United States on this issue. This action, thoughtaken with the knowledge and concurrence of President Kennedy,might have a bad effect on public opinion in the United States andmight impair our relations with our other Allies, thus weakening theposition of the West as a whole. Moreover, it would provideMr. Khrushchev with an opportunity to send a reply embarrassing to the United States Government, who now seemed to have decidedthat they must for military reasons proceed with their further seriesof nuclear tests. If Mr. Khrushchev should say, in reply, that he was now willing to accept the principle of international verification, agreat prize would be won though difficult negotiations of detailwould have to be faced. But, if his reply took the form of proposing that this question should be further discussed at a meeting of Headsof Governments, we should be in a position of great embarrassment.For on this subject, without any acceptance in advance of the principleof international verification, no progress was likely to be made at ameeting of Heads of Governments, and the Cabinet had already agreedthat it would be preferable to reserve the possibility of such a meetingfor a discussion on Berlin, on which there might be more room for negotiation. Finally, it was argued that such an initiative was not necessary on account of public opinion in this country; for theCabinet had already agreed that the British public were satisfied thatthe Western Powers had done their utmost to secure international agreement on the cessation of nuclear tests and that the responsibilityfor failure rested with the Soviet Government.The balance of opinion in the Cabinet was that the Prime minister should take the initiative of sending a personal message toMr. Khrushchev on the lines which he had indicated if president kennedy, after considering the objections to this course which hadbeen developed in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion, still adhered to his earlieropinion that this initiative would have some advantage from the pointof view of the West as a whole.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would send to president kennedy a draft of the letter which he might address toMr. Khrushchev; would invite the Presidents comments onthe terms of that draft; and would ask him to considerwhether the despatch of such a letter would have advantage from the general Western point of view despite the dangers to which attention had been drawn in the cabinets discussion.
