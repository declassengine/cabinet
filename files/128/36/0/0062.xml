IncomesPolicyRailwaymen&apos;sWages(previous reference:C.C. (62) 58thConclusions,Minute 1)1. The Minister of Transport said that the Chairman of theBritish Transport Commission, Dr. Beeching, had now discussed withthe trade unions his proposals for reducing the labour force in therailway workshops, and with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theMinister of Labour and himself his proposals for settling the currentclaims of the railway unions for increases in pay. The Commissionand the unions would meet to discuss the pay claims early inNovember.The discussions on redundancy had produced a better atmospherefor Dr. Beeching&apos;s dealings with the unions; he had admitted thatthe manner in which he had presented his proposals for redundancyin the railway workshops had produced difficulties for the unions and had indicated that he would adopt a different procedure for theredundancies which would follow from the closure of railway lines.Negotiations were proceeding and the unions had been given theopportunity to suggest modifications of the plans for the workshopredundancies. The threat of immediate strike action on this hadreceded.On the pay claim, Dr. Beeching&apos;s attitude had been that heshould seek a settlement on the terms which he thought the goodmanagement and reorganisation of the railways required. TheNational Union of Railwaymen had claimed 11-5 per cent for the lowest paid railwaymen and 5 - 65 per cent for the salaried staff whom they represented. The Associated Society of Locomotive engineers and Firemen had claimed 7 per cent, and the Transport SalariedStaffs&apos; Association 6-4 per cent. Dr. Beeching had agreed that itwould be desirable to open negotiations with the unions at a figurelower than that at which he intended to reach a settlement; and,while he saw the attraction of linking negotiations on redundancywith those on pay, he felt that this would be unacceptable to theunions, who would think it wrong to seek a good bargain on pay formen who continued in the industry at the expense of a poor bargainfor men declared redundant, or vice versa. Dr. Beeching had indicated that he wanted guidance on the limit to which he could go in settling the pay claims, and he appeared to envisage negotiationsopening with 6 per cent and going to 7 per cent. If the Governmentsought to impose on him a limit which conflicted with his ideas ofthe requirements of good management he would not acquiesce except under direction. It was not clear whether the powers of the Ministerof Transport to issue general directions to the Commission would cover the issue of a direction on a specific point such as an increasein wages. But a letter from the Government would suffice for thepurpose. The effect, however, would be that the unions wouldthenceforth regard themselves as dealing with the Government and,if they were to resort to strike action, this would be against theGovernment. The unions had a strong case on grounds of comparability. Railway wages had risen by 7-9 per cent, includingthe 3 per cent granted in April 1962, since the rates recommendedby Professor Guillebaud were introduced. In the same period wages in engineering had risen by 13-1 per cent; in the gas industry by15 per cent, and a further 2-7 per cent would become payable earlyin January next; for local authorities&apos; employees by 7-5 per cent;for Government employees on the M-rate and for National health service employees by 17-9 per cent; and there were instances of even higher increases in the transport industry itself. Dr. Beechingwas not proposing the full application of the Guillebaud principles,and an increase of 7 per cent would still leave railwaymen at the back of the queue. Railway workers had in the past been preparedto accept relatively low wages in return for the security which their employment had afforded; but this situation had been changed bythe reorganisation of the railways, with its accompanyingredundancies.
The Minister of Labour said that Dr. Beeching wasunderstandably anxious to maintain the position of an enlightenedemployer, but there was some risk that he was paying too littleattention to the implications of a railway settlement for government policy and for private industry. A 7 per cent increase would raisethe total increases for the railwaymen in the current year to 10 percent. He believed that Dr. Beeching felt that a settlement at a lower figure, such as 5 per cent, might be achieved, but only after longand bitter argument. Five per cent had been Dr. Beeching&apos;s ownsuggestion when the current claims were first considered, though itwas only fair to say that increases had since been granted in other employments. On the other hand, private soundings which he had made in highly responsible quarters on both sides of industrysuggested that the expectation was still of negotiation opening at about 3 per cent and settling at about 4 per cent, and that higherfigures would have serious repercussions elsewhere.In discussion the Cabinet first considered the maximum increasethat should be accepted. Various views were expressed. AlthoughDr. Beeching had said that a final settlement at 7 per cent would berequired, it was conceivable that he might be persuaded to accept6 per cent, or even perhaps 5-i- per cent. It seemed to some ministers that, notwithstanding his acceptance of the need to open negotiations at a lower figure than he envisaged for final settlement, he was still not taking sufficient account of the traditional bargaining methodsof the railway unions, who were likely to react favourably if theycould negotiate a substantial improvement on a relatively low figure,but would not give him credit for opening at a relatively high figure;and there was therefore a danger that, if he were to open at, say,5 per cent, he would be unable to finish at much less than 8 per cent.When the settlement of April 1962 was being negotiated he had apparently doubted whether the conditional 3 per cent would be acceptable to the unions, but it had proved to be so. Some Ministersconsidered that the public would add the 3 per cent settlement ofApril 1962 to whatever&apos;was granted now, and on this basis felt thatthe upper limit should be 4 per cent. Other Ministers, basing theirviews partly on the amounts claimed by the unions and partly onthe increases obtained in other industries since the Guillebaud rates were introduced in the railways, considered that the upper limitmight be put at 5 per cent. Five per cent would bring the total increase in railwaymen&apos;s wage rates since the implementation of the guillebaud recommendations almost up to the level of those granted in the engineering industry in that period.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) It was particularly important that the Government should support Dr. Beeching in carrying through the reorganisation of therailways, which could secure large savings of public money withimportant advantages to the economy. There might be advantage inconcentrating the Governments assistance on redundancy paymentsdirectly related to reorganisation, and this might be done in a manner which would enable the unions to take credit for improved redundancyterms. The same argument might, however, be used to justifyincreases in pay somewhat larger than would generally be expected.(b) Whatever settlement of the pay negotiations was reached,the Government should be prepared to present it in such a way thatit would not damage incomes policy generally. Care should be taken that, if the upper limit was fixed at a figure lower than the Commissionwanted, they should not make their own figure known.Summing up, the Prime Minister said that senior ministers should see Dr. Beeching again and indicate that the Governmentwould support him in his redundancy plans and, if necessary, consider sympathetically slight improvements in the redundancy terms. on pay, however, they should take the line that 5 per cent must be
accepted as the outside limit for a settlement. They should indicatethat negotiations should open with an offer of about 3\ per cent;that the Government would hope for a settlement at about 4-J,- percent; but that some small increase above this figure might be grantedif this were absolutely necessary, after fresh reference to Ministers.He would be prepared to help personally in these talks if developmentsshowed this to be desirable.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Transport,to inform the Chairman of the British transport commission that in the Governments view the currentclaims of the railway unions should be settled within anupper limit of 5 per cent.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would take part in discussion with the Chairman of the British transport commission if developments showed this to be desirable.incomes policy(previous reference:CC. (62) 59thConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (62) 169) covering the draft of a white Paper announcing the membership and terms of reference ofthe National Incomes Commission.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in addition to theappointment of Mr. Geoffrey Lawrence, Q.C., as Chairman of theCommission, Professor Kirkcalday, Professor of Industrial relations at Cambridge, had accepted a full-time appointment to theCommission, and some part-time members of appropriate standingwere also available. The time had come to make public the termsof reference of the Commission and he proposed to publish a white paper for this purpose. The draft described the circumstances inwhich matters relating to pay or other conditions of service or employment might be referred to the Commission. Unilateralreference by one side in a disputed case would not be included; itwould be difficult in any important case for either party to refusereference where the Government indicated that they thought itnecessary. He had had discussions with the Chairman about the role of the Commission in relation to profits. The Chairmanconsidered that the White Paper should refer to this point, and thedraft had been prepared on the basis of the reference made to thismatter in the Prime Minister^ speech in Parliament on 26th July.It would make it clear that the Commission were expected to reportfrom time to time on the need, if any, for Government action byfiscal or other appropriate means to restrain any undue growth in aggregate profits that might result from restraint in earned incomes.The trade unions had not withdrawn their objections to theCommission, but he doubted whether they would mount a seriousoampaign against it.In discussion it was pointed out that paragraph 4 (ii) of the draft white Paper, which provided for reference to the Commission of matters relating to pay and other conditions of service or employmentwhere the cost was met in whole or in part by the Exchequer, mightbe interpreted as replacing existing arrangements for arbitration inthe public services, where arbitration was accessible at the instanceof one party, by reference \&quot;) the Commission at the instance of theGovernment. It was in fact the intention that such a reference should not remove the right to subsequent arbitration if this was
4f5&quot;Cuba(previous reference:CC. (62) 61stConclusions,Minute 3)3. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the latest developments in the situation arising from the imposition by theUnited States Government of a partial blockade of Cuba designedto prevent the transport to the island of offensive military equipment.A number of Russian ships believed or known to have been carryingmilitary supplies had been diverted or had been ordered to return home. Others, believed to be carrying grain, oil and other civiliansupplies were still on course. The United States naval commanderswere under orders to intercept them, using minimum force, but nointerception had taken place so far. In the Security Council the debate on a United States resolution calling for the withdrawal of offensive missiles from Cuba and the dismantling of missile sitesunder United Nations supervision had been adjourned in consequenceof an intervention by the Acting Secretary-General, who had called on President Kennedy. Mr. Khrushchev and the Prime Minister ofCuba, Dr. Castro, to accept a truce for two or three weeks so that discussions could take place. No replies to this appeal had yet beenreceived.The Foreign Secretary said that in his view it was necessary atthe present juncture to secure three things as a minimum prerequisiteto further progress by discussion, viz., the dismantling of the missilesites in Cuba, the stationing of United Nations observers in Cubato witness this dismantling and the stationing of United Nationsobservers in Havana to scrutinise incoming cargoes. Unless theseconditions could be met it would be impossible for President Kennedyin the present atmosphere to withdraw the United States blockade,and so long as the blockade remained in force it was hard to see howprogress could be made. It did not seem that there was any action that the Prime Minister could usefully take at the present juncture;an early visit to Washington, for example, could easily be misinterpreted as a mission of appeasement. He had had ocoasionto discuss the position that day with the Egyptian Ambassador inLondon whose Government, in concert with the Government of ghana, were sponsoring a resolution in the United Nations designedto lead to negotiations. The Egyptian Ambassador had said thathis Government had appreciated the difficulty of expecting president kennedy to make any conciliatory moves until it could be shown thatthe direct danger to the United States from Cuba had been removed;they found it, however, very much more difficult to see how, insuch a process, Mr. Khrushchev could avoid or could be broughtto accept a considerable loss of prestige.The Foreign Secretary said that he had also received the SovietCharge d&apos;Affaires in London, whose object had been to suggestthat the United Kingdom Government should intervene. It had been explained to him in reply that, while the Government were ready and willing to do so, it would be necessary for the Soviet Governmentto create a suitable opportunity by making it possible for president kennedy to agree to the holding of a conference. The foreign secretary added that he had told the Soviet Charge d&apos;Affaires thatdesired. On the other hand, it was desirable that the drafting of thisparagraph should cover a case where the teachers&apos; unions and their employers had agreed on proposals for changes in teachers&apos; pay which the Minister of Education might wish to modify, in the lightof advice from the Commission, in the interests of the education service.The Cabinet Approved the draft White Paper, subject to amendment tomeet the points made in their discussion.
it would in his view be essential to remove offensive weapons fromCuba, which he had defined as weapons which could reach the mainland of the United States; he had also told him that the SovietGovernment had already lost a great deal of support in SouthAmerica and would lose more in the world at large in the course ofthe next day or two unless they made some move to meet the UnitedStates. He hoped that these representations might have some effect in Moscow: the Soviet Government had in the past shown themselvessensitive to pressures of world opinion, and did not like beingunpopular with uncommitted countries.In discussion the following points were made:(fir) The blockade which President Kennedy had instituted wouldbe limited in its effect to preventing further military supplies reachingCuba. He ought at this stage to be prepared to accept united nations action which would have the same effect as the blockade and might, for example, be limited to the scrutiny of cargoes arriving in Cuba. As against this, however, President Kennedy had declaredthat he would not be prepared to lift the blockade until the missileshad been withdrawn and their sites dismantled; and it would bedifficult for him to accept, as an alternative to the blockade, united nations action which did not cover missiles and missile sites as wellas cargoes.(b) It was to be expected that the existence of United Statesmissile bases in Europe would feature increasingly in the case whichthe Soviet Government would present in defence of their action inCuba. It was unfortunate that at this moment United states representatives in Europe were urging on European governments the desirability of increasing the medium-range missile forces at thedisposal of the North Atlantic Alliance.(c) A conference confined to the Cuba situation would be theleast desirable from the point of view of the cohesion of the north atlantic Alliance, since it was inevitable that the Soviet Governmentwould seek to extract specific concessions in Europe, e.g., on Berlinor on United States forces or weapons, as the price for concessionsover Cuba. A conference should if possible deal with the problem in a broad context and perhaps as part of the first stage of a general disarment plan.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that he had discussed the situation with President Kennedy in the evening of23rd October. He had suggested that the Acting Secretary-Generafsproposal for a standstill might be accepted provided that work onthe missile sites in Cuba ceased, under United Nations inspection,and that United Nations observers were stationed in Cuban ports to examine incoming cargoes. He had also suggested the need toset any conference in as wide a context as possible. In general, thesituation remained extremely serious. He would himself be readyto take any opportunity of intervening if he felt that by doing so the prospect of a settlement could be advanced, but it would benecessary to avoid at all costs the temptation of reaching a settlement by lowering the resistance of the free world to aggression. It was equally necessary to avoid driving those who felt that they had beenthe victims of aggression to desperation. It must be the object of all those who had any influence on the present pattern of events tofind a middle course. The situation was still developing rapidly and it might be necessary for him to call a meeting of Ministers at short notice.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.
PopulationandEmploymentDistribution ofindustry(previous reference:C.C. (62) 49thConclusions,Minute 3)4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the HomeSecretary (C. (62) 157 and 158) reporting on the work so far done bythe Committee on Population and Employment and discussingproposals for checking the growth of offices in big cities.The Home Secretary said that, in his first paper (C. (62) 157), hehad set out the first views of the Committee which under his chairmanship had been examining major questions of population andemployment in Great Britain. The Committee had reviewed andwere now co-ordinating work which was in progress in departments on these questions; and specific proposals would be brought beforethe Cabinet at a later stage. But it would be helpful if at thepresent stage the Committee could have the Cabinet&apos;s guidance on whether to press on urgently with the formulation of measures toincrease the effectiveness of existing policies.The population of Great Britain was rising rapidly. By 1981there would be over six million more people in the country than there were now and if present trends continued three-quarters of theaddition would be in the Midlands, the South-East and the South-West, and only a quarter in the North, Scotland and Wales. Theadditional population would call for social expenditure of the orderof  6,000 million. Partly because of the attractions of living in thesouth and south-east of England and partly because of the increasingconcentration of employment in these areas and in the Midlands,internal migration was drawing people from other parts of thecountry. There was, and it was likely that there would continue tobe, a relative glut of employment in the Midlands and the South anda relative scarcity elsewhere; and there would be pockets of seriousunemployment. Ample employment and thriving industry wereusually accompanied by bad housing and travelling conditions. Theshortage of land for new house-building was most marked in London,where the growth of office employment was likely by 1980 to addabout half a million people to the \\ million people who alreadytravelled daily, in much discomfort, to central London. Expensivecapital works would be required to increase the capacity of thetransport system; there would be increased pressure to build in the green Belt around London and the pressure on housing would increase the number of homeless families.The Government had been criticised for not taking action tosecure more effective control over the distribution of industry, butexisting policies had (in favourable conditions) succeeded in steeringa substantial amount of industry to development districts. On theother hand, local boom conditions had at times caused theGovernment to adopt measures of disinflation which damaged the poorer areas both by aggravating their existing state and by cutting off the expansion of activity from which relief might have come. it did not appear that within the next three years much could be done to alter this situation, even though during that period projects suchas advance factories could be started which would mature later.The Committee had agreed on the need to secure the fullest useof the country&apos;s economic resources but had been in difficulty indevising means of doing this without interfering with industry&apos;s ownpreferences and risking damage to the process of growth, on whichthe success even of present policies depended. One view of thesituation was that nothing should be done which might impair the ability of industry to compete isn world markets and that, if theconsequences were further development in the South-Bast andMidlands, these consequences should be accepted. Most of theCommittee had felt, however, that new policies ought to be adopted for attracting population and industry to &quot; growing points &quot;, i.e., to areas which were especially suitable for industrial development.Some growing points might be located with an eye to increasingtrade with Common Market countries. If new policies were not putin hand at an early date, there was a danger of the country beingsplit between a prosperous South and a relatively stagnant North.
Growth of offices in BigCities(previous reference:CC. (62) 43rdConclusions,Minute 5)In discussion the following points were raised:(a) In a free society there was a limit to the amount of pressure which could be put on industrialists or work-people to move toplaces which were unattractive to them. The forces which determined the location of industry and made for the abandonment of the countryside in favour of the towns in certain parts of the countryappeared to be very strong and it would be expensive and ineffectualto seek to counter them. The better course would be to accept thesesocial trends and let development take place wherever those responsible for it wanted to put it. It would be a mistake to bedaunted by the loss of social capital which might result in the lessprosperous parts of the country; it could be argued that most ofthat capital had been written off already. On the other hand, itwas strongly argued that unrestrained development would involvemuch waste of manpower as well as social capital and that no government would be able to face the scale of unemployment insome areas and congested conditions in others which would result.(b) The technological revolution of the past generation hadtended to by-pass Scotland and the north of England and it did notappear that the situation in these parts of the country could be materially eased within the limits of existing policies. Skilledmanpower was steadily draining away to the South and during thecoming winter the rate of unemployment in Scotland was likely tobe about 5 per cent.(c) Although it was easy enough to attribute current movements of population and employment in general terms to affluence, therewas a need for research into the more deep-seated causes.Appropriate measures of relief could not be devised without greaterknowledge, which could be obtained only through a deliberateencouragement of research in the social sciences. This should covernot only factors determining distribution of employment but also those making for the creation of suburban areas around decayingtown centres.(d) Much of the industry which it would be desirable to locatein the less favoured areas was already linked with established concernsin the Midlands and the South-East and there were undoubteddifficulties in increasing the proportion of industry which could be persuaded to move. But a policy based on growing points could be supported by adjustment in capital investment programmes and bypressing forward with arrangements for training skilled work-people.It was possible also that the existing controls could be stiffened;and the Government should be prepared to give maximum weight to social considerations in settling the location of major enterprises,such as new steelworks, for which they had some responsibility.The Home Secretary said that the purpose of his second paper(C. (62) 158) was to bring to the Cabinefs notice two specific proposalswhich the Committee had considered for bringing the growth of office employment under closer control. These were that some formof levy should be imposed on office buildings or on the occupationof offices in big cities, and that there should be an amendment ofthe Third Schedule to the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947,to enable the local planning authorities, without fear of compensation,to exercise firmer control over rebuilding which involved an additionto the office floor space in an existing building. Some Ministersbelieved that, in spite of the rapid growth of offices in recent yearsand the scope for further growth, market forces would correct thesituation and bring about a break in the boom. They saw graveobjection to a tax on offices and to a tightening of the planning law,which might be regarded as a undue erosion of property owners&apos;existing rights. Other Ministers, however, felt that unless theGovernment intervened strongly conditions in big cities, andparticularly in London, would grow worse; and in answer to thesocial, economic and political problems which would arise it would
not be sufficient to rely on measures which fell short of the proposalsfor a levy and an amendment of the planning law. There had been general agreement on some minor measures, viz., the further dispersal of Government offices from London, the creation of a special agency to encourage office development outside London and another driveon staggered hours. It would in any event be necessary soon toallow some building development in the London green belt.In discussion the following points were made:(e) More than half the employment in London was in offices and from experience in the new towns around London it seemed likely that a great deal of office work could be done just as efficientlyoutside London. The object of policy should be to oblige officeemployers to weigh the advantages of moving elsewhere and forthis purpose it might not be necessary that the level of tax should be high.(/) On the other hand, it could be assumed, from the wide gap between rents paid for office space in London and outside London,that a high rate of tax would be necessary in order to produce a worthwhile result. Some Ministers felt that there were generalobjections to the use of taxation in the manner proposed and thatit would be difficult to defend discrimination against offices.(g) Many of the offices recently built in London had been builton new sites, where the tolerance given by the law in its present form (which could result in a 40 per cent addition to the floor spaceof the building) did not apply. Removal of the entitlement to expandgiven by the existing law would not be very effective and wouldcertainly be strongly criticised. It was pointed out, however, thata levy and an amendment of the planning law could be defendedon grounds of the heavy public expenditure on roads and other services which resulted from the concentration of employment in central areas.(h) The suggestion was made that the policy of green belts wasoutmoded and should be reconsidered. It would in any case be useful if the Cabinet could have a description of the size and general character of the London green belt and those modifications in it which were believed to be inescapable.(/) The First Secretary of State said that he did not consider apolicy of laisser-faire to be adequate. The drift to the South-east would have serious effects on agriculture and in other ways, andconditions for commuters to London were becoming intolerable.The Government would be failing in their duty if they did not pressforward with active measures to improve the situation. He would himself favour amendment of the planning law and would like tosee the proposal for a levy on offices or office occupation further examined.The Prime Minister said he thought it important that theGovernment should adopt a constructive policy to deal not only with the problems which had been discussed, but with nationaldevelopment as a whole. He would like to outline his own ideas ata further meeting of the Cabinet as soon as possible.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to resume their discussion of C. (62) 157 and 158 atan early meeting.(2) Invited the Minister of Housing to circulate for their information a memorandum describing the extent and character of the London green belt and of the proposedmodifications to it.
