CC. 50 (62)Works of Art 1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ChiefLeonardo Secretary, Treasury (C. (62) 116), reporting the outcome of discussionsCartoon with representatives of the National Gallery and the National(Previous       Arts-Collection Fund about the purchase of the Leonardo Cartoon.Reference:CC. (62) 48th The Chief Secretary, Treasury, recalled that at their meeting on conclusions, 19th July the Cabinet had invited him to negotiate with the objectMinute 5) of securing the Cartoon for the nation at a direct cost to theExchequer not exceeding  250,000. It now appeared that the NationalArts-Collection Fund would be prepared to ensure, if necessary by making further calls on their own resources, that the appeal would produce  450,000, which would fall short, by  350,000, of the amount required by the Royal Academy. The Trustees of the national gallery had rejected the suggestion that they should contribute afurther  100,000 in addition to the  50,000 they had alreadycontributed, and had said that they would be most reluctant to adoptany arrangement whereby  100,000 of the possible contribution fromthe Government would be repaid from fees to be charged by theGallery for admission to the room in which the Cartoon would beexhibited. In these circumstances the Cabinet might think it best that the Government should make an unconditional contribution of 350,000.In discussion there was general agreement that the Governmentshould make a contribution of  350,000 without conditions.Consideration should be given to means of limiting the right of public or semi-public bodies in possession of major national treasures to sellthese on the international market with the likely consequence thatthey would have to be allowed to leave the country if they were notacquired for the nation. But it would be inappropriate to include any reference to this matter in the announcement of theGovernments decision about the Cartoon. The terms of theannouncement, which should be made in both Houses of parliament on 31st July, should stress the wide interest which had been taken inthe future of the Cartoon and the large number of contributions tothe appeal which had come from members of the public.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Government should contribute  350,000towards the purchase of the Leonardo Cartoon for thenation.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Lord President and the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster, to arrange for this decision to be announced in Parliament on 31st July.(3) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to arrange for an examination of means of limiting the right of bodiespossessing major national art treasures to offer them forsale on the international market.Congo 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that there was still no sign ofRepublic        any disposition on the part of either Mr. Adoula, the Prime Minister(Previous       of the Central Government of the Congo, or of Mr. Tshombe, the reference:      Prime Minister of Katanga, to resume negotiation for a settlement.CC (62) 49th The United States and Belgian Governments now agreed that it conclusions,    would be undesirable to hold an early discussion on the Congo in the minute 1)       Security Council.   Nevertheless, it was still possible that a meeting might be held in August; and we should be faced with a difficult situation if a resolution were put forward invoking the applicationof economic sanctions to Katanga.   In practice this would involve an attempt to control by force the export of copper from Katanga
to Northern Rhodesia. This would provoke the outbreak of guerrillawarfare and would have the result of destroying Katanga&apos;s economic resources. It would also set a precedent for similar action by theUnited Nations against South Africa, against the Portuguese colonial possessions and possibly against Southern Rhodesia. If the UnitedKingdom were to veto a resolution in this sense by the security council, the debate would be transferred to the General Assemblywhere we should find ourselves in a small minority. The use of theveto would, however, demonstrate conclusively the strength ofUnited Kingdom feeling on the subject, both to public opinion inthis country and internationally. On the other hand, if we merelydissociated ourselves from such a resolution this might be interpreted in this country as a sign of weakness and indecision.If a meeting of the Security Council were held it might be toour advantage to put forward a resolution of our own advocating asolution for the Congo, based on a proper federal Constitution, afair division of the revenues, and an international plan for reconstruction and development. While the United StatesGovernment agreed that any solution for the Congo must includethese three elements, they wanted in addition to secure rights of movement for Central Government forces throughout the territory.They were also prepared to contemplate a settlement reached by force, and had indicated that, if the United Nations were notprepared to use force, the United States would do so on their own.The immediate problem was to induce Mr. Adoula andMr. Tshombe to resume negotiations. Although Mr. Tshombe had said that he would withdraw into the jungle and conduct guerrillaoperations from there rather than submit to dictation from theUnited Nations it might still be possible, given a corresponding move on Mr. Adoula&apos;s part, to make progress. Some gesture of conciliation was needed: it might for example be possible to induceMr. Tshombe to deposit a sum of money in a neutral bank as an earnest of good intention and to say that if agreement could bereached on a federal Constitution he would be prepared to increasethe percentage of Katanga&apos;s revenue to be diverted to the CentralGovernment. The influence of the Prime Minister of the Federationof Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Sir Roy Welensky, might be helpful in bringing Mr. Tshombe to accept the need for some move of thiskind.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It now seemed less likely that this question would be raised at an early meeting of the Security Council. If, however, such a discussion took place, the balance of advantage would lie in favourof dissociating ourselves from an unacceptable resolution rather thanusing the veto. The use of the veto would have a deplorable effectinternationally, particularly in Africa and Asia, would align theUnited Kingdom with countries such as Portugal and South Africa,and would encourage extreme opinion in this country to demandstill stronger measures of disapproval of United Nations action even to the extent of withdrawing from the Organisation. Nevertheless,a final decision could only be taken in the light of the situation at thetime.(b) It had been assumed that if the United Nations passed aresolution, whether in the Security Council or in the general assembly, which led to further operations in the Congo, the UnitedKingdom would still be bound to contribute to the cost, particularlyin the light of the recent judgment of the International Court atThe Hague. The judgment of the International Court had not,however, been studied in detail and might prove to be more restrictive in its effect, particularly on the powers of the general assembly, than now appeared. The judgment would, however, haveto be debated in the General Assembly; and a decision on the
Germany 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that during his recent visit to berlin Geneva he had had some private discussions on Berlin with the(Previous        Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko.   He had also seen the reference:      United States Secretary of State, Mr. Rusk, and the ForeignC.C. (62) 47th Ministers of France and Germany; Mr. Rusk had held severalConclusions,    discussions with Mr. Gromyko.   There had been no sign that minute 3)       ]y[r Gromyko was interested in any solution save the ending of theoccupation status of West Berlin and the withdrawal of Westerntroops from the city.   It had not been possible to pursue with himeither the positive suggestions which at different times had been made from the Western side (for example, for introducing token Russiancontinuance of our financial contribution to the cost of the operations in the Congo should, if possible, be deferred until this debate hadtaken place. It should, however, be possible for us to refrain from taking up our subscription to the United Nations Bond issue if wehad dissociated ourselves from an extreme resolution on the Congo.(c) If any attempt were made to impose economic sanctions onKatanga there would be a strong reaction from Sir Roy Welensky.This was a further reason for asking him to intervene withMr. Tshombe in an effort to reach a negotiated settlement.Summing up, the Prime Minister said that we must be preparedto take quick decisions in the event. We should have a resolution of our own ready for submission. If this were not accepted and aresolution to which we could not subscribe were seen to commandmajority support it seemed to be the present feeling of the Cabinetthat we should dissociate ourselves from it rather than veto it. if further operations were undertaken by the United Nations it mightbe necessary for us to continue to subscribe to their cost, although we should certainly not take up our subscription to the Bond issue.Nor should we provide weapons, particularly aircraft and bombs,for use by the United Nations forces, although we might have tocontinue to provide repair facilities, e.g., for Indian aircraft.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that in the event of a meeting of the Security Councilto discuss further United Nations action in the Congo, itwould be desirable to present a resolution of our ownurging the parties to reach a settlement by negotiation and indicating the form which such a settlement might take.(2) Agreed that, if a resolution on these lines found no support,it would probably be preferable that the United KingdomGovernment should dissociate themselves from analternative resolution which we could not support; but afinal decision on this point should be deferred until thecircumstances were known.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the first secretary of State, to consider further the possibility of using the good offices of the Prime Minister of theFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland to persuadeMr. Tshombe of the need to continue negotiations withMr. Adoula.(4) Invited the Lord Chancellor to examine the recent judgment of the International Court on the obligations of member countries of the United Nations, with particular referenceto the powers of the General Assembly and to the needfor the United Kingdom to continue to subscribe to thecost of United Nations operations in the Congo.
nuclear tests(previous reference:CC. (62) 20thConclusions,Minute 3)4. The Foreign Secretary said that the United States were about to put forward at Geneva new proposals for an international agreement on the cessation of tests of nuclear weapons. These would go far towards matching the proposals previously submitted by theneutral powers represented at the Conference. They would involvethe maintenance of a much smaller number of detection posts outsideSoviet territory to identify underground tests and the minimumamount of international inspection of seismic disturbances withinthe Soviet Union itself. The Soviet Government had however made it clear, in earlier discussion, that they were not prepared to accept any degree of international inspection, however small; and it was likely that they would reject the new United States proposals. Theymight be prepared to offer as an alternative the internationalinspection of events in their territory at their invitation; but thiswould not be acceptable to the Americans. Nor were the Americansat this stage prepared to revive the project for a ban on tests in the atmosphere.The Prime Minister said that, although the American plan was likely to be rejected, the fact that it was to be put forward showed aconsiderable advance on the position which the United StatesGovernment had adopted earlier.  It might in the end be necessaryforces or for setting up an international access authority) or wider questions affecting the security of Russia&apos;s western frontiers.Mr. Gromyko had made it clear that, while he was for the time being prepared to go on talking without insisting on immediate signature of a peace treaty with East Germany, the talks could not be allowedto continue indefinitely. Discussions on Berlin would, in fact, be resumed in Washington between President Kennedy and Mr. Ruskand the Soviet Ambassador.There was as yet no concrete sign that the conclusion of a peace treaty was imminent. The East German economy was in serious difficulties, and Mr. Khrushchev was probably reluctant to see inthe hands of the East German President powers which, if clumsilyexercised, could result in major incidents or even war. A further move towards the conclusion of a treaty might be made early in theautumn and this might be linked with international action on a wider front. Some warning might be expected from increased Sovietdiplomatic activity, since the Soviet Government would wish to securethe participation of as many countries as possible. Meanwhile theWest German Government were endeavouring, by the use of credits,to strengthen their economic ties with East Germany.In discussion it was noted that the Soviet Government were fully aware that progress could be made, if they so wished, on variouspractical suggestions affecting the allied position in Berlin. It wouldbe inexpedient to press these suggestions at the present time, since this might have an adverse effect on the attitude of the French and west German Governments in the negotiations for our entry to theEuropean Communities. They might be considered further by theCabinet during August with a view to bringing them forward laterfor international consideration. The conclusion of a treaty betweenthe Soviet Government and East Germany was not necessarily initself a serious matter; the danger lay rather in the incidents whichmight then take place in the land and air corridors. If the treatyled to effective East-West discussions on major issues, either underthe auspices of the United Nations or otherwise, the long-term result might be some easing of international tension.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement and of thepoints raised in their discussion.
)5. The Foreign Secretary said that during his recent visit to geneva he had signed, on behalf of the United KingdomGovernment, the international agreement designed to assure the unity and neutrality of Laos. He had been favourably impressed by thepresent attitude of the Asian representatives who had taken part inthese protracted discussions in Geneva. The atmosphere was very different from that which had prevailed when the conference hadopened 14 months previously. There was now, among the Asianrepresentatives, a much greater understanding of the Western pointof view. This was largely due to the efforts of the British and american representatives, Mr. Malcolm MacDonald and Mr. AverellHarriman. But it also illustrated the advantages to be gained, interms of mutual understanding between East and West, by the patient exploration of practical plans for resolving specificinternational problems. There would have been little prospect of resolving this particular problem in the overcharged atmosphere ofthe United Nations. It would be worth considering whether this method of resolving differences could be applied to some other areaof disagreement between East and West.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,27th July, 1962.South-east asia treaty organisation laos(previous reference:C.C. (62) 47thConclusions,Minute 2)C.C. 50 (62)to fall back on a treaty abolishing nuclear tests which would containno safeguards but would simply reserve to participating countries the right to denounce the treaty in the event of infringement orsuspected infringement by any other participating country. even this the Soviet Government would be unlikely to accept unless itcould be seen to form part of some larger settlement of outstandinginternational issues. For the same reason he would be unwilling to urge the United States Government at the present stage to revisetheir new proposals in a sense more favourable to the SovietGovernment^ own point of view; he did not feel that further progress would be possible in this field except in the context of a broaderdiscussion of East-West relations as a whole. An opportunity forsuch a discussion might present itself after the end of the next seriesof Russian tests.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Foreign Secretary andby the Prime Minister.
