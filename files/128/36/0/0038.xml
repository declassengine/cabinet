(62) 28thConclusions,Minute 1)CC. 38 (62)1. The Foreign Secretary said that no progress was being madein the Geneva discussions on disarmament. The Conference wouldprobably adjourn in June. We should then need to consider, inconsultation with the United States Government, what line we shouldtake on its resumption.The Foreign Secretary said that the Netherlands Governmentwere now prepared to resume negotiations on West Irian on the basisof the proposals put forward by the United States Assistant Secretaryfor Defense, Mr. Bunker. The Indonesians might now, however,be unwilling to negotiate. They were continuing to infiltrate smallbodies of parachute troops into the territory. If these operations were challenged in the United Nations, we should be obliged tocondemn them as amounting to armed aggression against Dutchterritory.The Prime Minister recalled that in the early months of 1961 theUnited States Government had been ready to consider the possibilityof using land forces to maintain Western access to West Berlin, ifthe Russians had transferred control over the access routes to east german authorities. It was a matter for satisfaction that, by patientdiplomacy, we had persuaded them to abandon these plans and torecognise that the existence of the East German Government mustbe accepted as a fact. It was interesting that the Federal GermanGovernment, though still refusing to recognise the East GermanGovernment for many purposes, were now proposing to make asubstantial loan to them.housing policy(previous reference:CC. (61) 46thConclusions,Minute 6)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Housing (C. (62) 84) on housing policy.The Minister of Housing said that the number of housescompleted annually had been dropping in recent years and the time taken in building them had been lengthening. In view of the growth in the number of separate households, it was clear that future needswould not be met by continuance of present policies. If no policy changes were made, the number of houses completed in 1963 would fall well short of 300,000. Local authorities in England and wales would contribute towards that total no more than 108,000. their contribution should be increased to 120,000-125,000. This increase could not be secured immediately but should be regarded as the objective to be reached over the next two or three years, and investment policy should be so adjusted as to enable this to be done.He did not propose any increase in the level of Exchequer subsidies,but high interest rates were a continuing deterrent to many localauthorities. On an average three-bedroom house, allowing forreasonable rents and current subsidies, the rates had to carry 20s.to 25s. per week; and a fall of \ per cent, in the interest rate would reduce this burden by about 4s.Many people who did not wish to live in subsidised houses founddifficulty in raising the deposit money for house purchase. he therefore wished to explore the possibilities of Government assistance towards the provision of deposit money by cash or guarantee. Hewould also like to encourage building of houses for letting ateconomic rents and to develop co-operative housing on Scandinavianlines. A practicable scheme for co-operative housing might be founded on loans advanced at fixed rates, though not necessarilyconcessionary rates, over a period of 60 years; such loans would besecured on the house rather than on the life of the occupant.
In discussion there was general recognition that in the past fewyears housing had had too low a priority and that it would bedesirable to increase the scale both of local authority building andof private building, particularly for letting. It could now be expectedthat there might be a favourable movement in long-term interest rates; and, since there had recently been a slackening in the pressure of industrial and commercial projects on the building industry, thepresent time was favourable for an increase in the housing programme.In further discussion the following points were raised:(a) In Scotland the recent record in house building was worse than in England and Wales and it would be necessary, during thecoming summer, to stimulate the local authorities to greater efforts.(b) Departmental claims for public service expenditure in1963-64 would, if granted, result in an increase of 11 per cent., insteadof the 6 per cent, which had been intended. An analysis showinghow the major spending programmes contributed to this increase would shortly be brought before the Cabinet.(c) Examination of standardisation and other methods of improving productivity and reducing costs in the building industry had been put in hand under the aegis of a sub-committee of theEconomic Policy Committee. This examination should be pressed forward rapidly and consideration should be given to the appointmentof a single individual with authority to ensure that effective steps were taken to improve performance in the industry.(d) Encouragement should be provided for housing associations,if necessary by extending the existing scheme which provided for expenditure of up to  25 million as a pump-priming operation; andthe Minister of Housing should prepare and submit a scheme for developing co-operative housing projects.(e) An examination was already being made of the considerations affecting the movement of industry to centres of industrial growth.Officials were also examining means of checking the growth of office building, which in some areas diverted resources from housing andimposed heavy demands on the public services. Proposals on thesematters should be submitted to Ministers as soon as practicable.(/) The building of new towns was a specially effective means ofsecuring increased house building. The existing new towns were beginning to return a surplus to the Exchequer. The decision to go ahead with a new town for Birmingham at Dawley would be announced that day, and it was likely that further new town proposals would be put forward later.(g) In view of the need to make the most of the existing stock of houses, every effort should be made to encourage applicationsfor improvement grants in appropriate cases; and there should beno hesitation to use compulsory powers against landlords who didnot discharge their responsibilities to keep property in good repairor sought to over-charge their tenants.(h) It would be useful to have information about the proportionof contracts let by housing associations on varying rates of interestand on fixed rates, and to know what were the ruling rates.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Housing to aim at increasing theprogramme of local authority housing over the nexf two to three years to an annual rate of 120,000-125,000.(2) Invited the Minister of Housing to bring before themproposals for Government participation in house purchase, in building of houses for letting by housing associations and in building by co-operative housingorganisations on the basis of long-term loans on fixedrates of interest.
Housing 3,   &quot;The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterPohcy of Housing and Local Government (C. (62) 83) on leasehold reform.Reform The Minister of Housing said that he would shortly have to publish the reports by the various professional bodies which hadbeen asked for their views on the practice of landlords in dealingwith leasehold properties, and he would be expected to add astatement on the Governments views. The reports showed that much of the complaint made on behalf of leaseholders was due toa misunderstanding of the leasehold system. Explanation of thesystem would not, however, reconcile leaseholders to the substantial increases of rent which would generally be required on renewal of leases or to the payment of capital sums for purchase of the reversion.Compulsory enfranchisement would not be justifiable; but there wasa case for giving the leaseholder in certain circumstances a right, inthe absence of proposals for redevelopment, to an extension of the lease at a market value rent; and in that event the landlord shouldbe given the option of selling the freehold to the leaseholder, if he so preferred. A statement accompanying publication of the reportsmight indicate that the possibilities of giving such rights were being examined.In discussion there was general agreement that the time had come to re-examine the leasehold system as it applied to smallresidential properties. Many difficulties would have to be faced, butthere was no doubt that the arrangements for statutory tenanciesprovided by Part I of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1954, had not proved sufficient to reassure leaseholders. The scale of the problem was tending to increase, partly because so many 99-year leases granted in the latter half of the last century were now falling in and partly because a number of leasehold estates were now in the hands ofcommercial enterprises, whose attitude to their leaseholders was farfrom considerate. It should be recognised that a basis of market value for extension of leases, while fair to landlords and the only practicable basis, would not be popular with leaseholders. Thenecessary legislation would be controversial. For these reasons any statement made in connexion with the reports of the professionalbodies should not go beyond indicating that the problems affectingsmall residential leasehold property were being examined in the lightof the reports.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Housing to arrange for publicationof the reports from professional bodies on the practiceof ground landlords and to announce that the problems affecting leaseholders of small residential property werebeing examined.(2) Invited the Minister of Housing, in consultation with theLord Chancellor and the Law Officers, to prepare and submit to the Home Affairs Committee a scheme forgiving leaseholders in certain circumstances a right, inthe absence of proposals for redevelopment, to extensionof their leases on market value terms.C.C. 38 (62)(3) Invited the Minister of Housing to submit to the PrimeMinister information about the proportion of contractslet by housing associations on varying and fixed rates ofinterest; and about the ruling rates.(4) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to bring before them as soon as practicable the results of work being done by officials on the control of office building.
DiplomaticImmunitiesand PrivilegesCommonwealthOrganisations(previous reference:CC. (61) 75thConclusions,Minute 7)4. The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda onthe extension of diplomatic immunities and privileges to international organisations:C. (62) 80:  by the Lord Chancellor, reviewing the general question and submitting proposals for future policy;C. (62) 79: by the Secretary of the Cabinet, covering a report by officials on points raised in the Cabinet&apos;s earlier discussionof the proposal that these immunities should be extended to commonwealth organisations.The Lord Chancellor said that, in considering the extension ofthese privileges, the Cabinet should bear in mind the large numbersof persons who would benefit from them in the United Kingdom.The number of individuals concerned already exceeded 4,700; and,if account were taken of their dependents and of the extensions now envisaged, the total might soon rise to about 10,000. This involved asubstantial encroachment on the principle that all persons resident in the country should be equal before the law. It was not surprising,therefore, that proposals for extending these privileges should giverise to controversy in Parliament; and Ministers should realise that,if all the extensions now envisaged were made, parliamentary discussion would have to be faced on two Orders in Council in thecurrent session and, in the next session, on two or three Bills andten or more Orders in Council. This was a formidable prospect.He had therefore put forward for consideration proposals for limiting the extension of these privileges to international organisations.While he contemplated that Commonwealth organisations should forthis purpose be put on the same footing as other international organisations, he suggested that all alike should be subjected to the limitations proposed in paragraph 15 of his memorandum. he contemplated that each application would be considered on itsindividual merits, by reference to the criteria there suggested. Finally,he suggested that greater care should be taken in future, byinterdepartmental consultation, to ensure that any restrictions whichwe desired to secure in new international conventions on this subject should be put forward at a sufficiently early stage in the negotiations.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The Commonwealth Secretary welcomed the LordChancellor&apos;s support for his proposal that legislation should beintroduced to enable immunities and privileges to be conferred on commonwealth organisations, and their staffs, established in London.(b) The Attorney-General suggested that further thought shouldbe given to the disparities which would arise if stricter standardswere now applied to future applications of this kind. Immunitieshad already been granted to some international organisations whichwould fail to qualify under the criteria now suggested in C. (62) 80.(c) Due weight should be given to the possibility that international organisations would establish their headquarterselsewhere, if they had no assurance that they would be able to securefull immunities and privileges in this country.(d) The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that, before thegeneral principles set out in paragraph 15 of C. (62) 80 were adopted,the Cabinet should have some estimate of the practical consequences which might be expected to follow. He believed that the consequences to the revenue might be serious.The Cabinet (1) Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrange for acommittee of officials to prepare an estimate of thepractical results which might follow from the adoptionof the proposals in paragraph 15 of C. (62) 80 for determing the extension of diplomatic immunities and privileges to international and commonwealth organisaitons established in this country.
National 5.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theAssistance Minister of Pensions and National Insurance (C. (62) 85) setting out(Previous the arguments in support of proposals which the Chairman of the reference: National Assistance Board wished shortly to make for increases in C.C. (59) 33rd the scales of National Assistance, to come into operation aboutConclusions, September 1962; and a memorandum by the Chief Secretary,Minute 2) Treasury (C. (62) 89) showing the total cost of these proposals andputting forward arguments in favour of smaller increases.After discussion the Cabinet agreed that, on balance, it wouldbe more satisfactory if the Chairman of the Board were to proposeincreases in the scales of 3s. 6d. a week (single) and 5s. 6d. (married),to come into effect on 1st October, 1962.CC. 38 (62)Vienna The Cabinet also had before them memoranda by the ForeignConvention      Secretary (C. (62) 76) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (62) 65)on the effects of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations.The Cabinet were informed that the Vienna Conference of 1961,at which 81 nations had been represented, had drawn up a comprehensive Convention regulating the conduct of diplomatic relations. The Convention had been signed on behalf of the UnitedKingdom, with the concurrence of all Departments concerned.Before it could be ratified United Kingdom law would need to be amended on a number of points which were now under discussionamong Departments. On two particular points (that diplomatsshould be exempt from excise duty, and that the salaries of privateservants of all diplomats should be exempt from taxation) theTreasury were unwilling to contemplate amendment of the UnitedKingdom law and proposed that reservations on these points shouldbe entered on ratification of the Convention.In discussion it was argued that the whole purpose of negotiating this Convention was to standardise internationalprocedure in these matters, and that this purpose would be frustratedif in ratifying it individual countries made unilateral reservations on particular points. On the two particular points now at issue theTreasury case had been fully argued at the Conference, but theUnited Kingdom representatives had been out-voted on both.On the other hand it was argued that it would not be easy to persuade Parliament to amend United Kingdom law to accord withthe Convention on these points. Indeed, the legislation required toenable the United Kingdom Government to ratify this Conventionmight be difficult and controversial in many respects. It wassuggested in C. (62) 76 that this legislation might take the form ofa comprehensive Bill replacing all the existing statutes passed since1708 on the subject of diplomatic immunity and privilege. Thiswould represent a heavy addition to the legislative programme forthe forthcoming session. It was for consideration whether a smalleramending Bill would not in any event be preferable.The Cabinefs conclusion was that the two particular points raised in C. (62) 65 and 76 could not be determined without furtherconsideration of the form of the legislation required to enable theUnited Kingdom to ratify this Convention.The Cabinet-(2) Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrange for officials to prepare, for consideration by the Cabinet, areport on the legislation required to enable the UnitedKingdom to ratify the Vienna Convention of 1961 ondiplomatic relations.
The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance tosuggest to the Chairman of the National Assistance board that the increases to be proposed by the Board should be within the limits of 3s. 6d. a week (single) and 5s. 6d. a week(married) with effect from 1st October, 1962.AircraftIndustrySupersonicAirliner(previous references:C.C. (62) 23rdConclusions,Minute 3 andC.C. (60) 44thConclusions,Minute 2)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Aviation (C. (62) 82) on the possibility of a joint Anglo-Frenchproject for the development of an airliner designed to carry about100 passengers with a cruising speed of about Mach 2-2. Thememorandum proposed that this project should be referred forconsideration by the Committee on Civil Scientific Research andDevelopment.The Cabinet Agreed that the proposal for Anglo-French collaboration in the development of a supersonic airliner should, in thefirst instance, be referred for consideration by theCommittee on Civil Scientific Research and Development.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th May, 1962.
