West Indies(previous reference:C.C. (62) 11thConclusions.Minute 3)Jamaica1. The Colonial Secretary said that the current Conference onthe Jamaican Constitution had made good progress. The only majorquestion now outstanding was the date by which the island should become independent. The representatives of both the Jamaicanpolitical parties were prepared to accept 6th August, 1962, as thedate for independence. He sought authority to accept this date onbehalf of the United Kingdom Government.The Colonial Secretary said that an independent Jamaica was likely to remain within the Commonwealth and to retain amonarchical form of constitution.The Cabinet Agreed that the Conference on the Jamaican constitution should be concluded on the basis that the island wouldattain independence on 6th August, 1962.nuclear tests(previous reference:C.C. (62) 10thConclusions.Minute 2)2. The Prime Minister said that the French Government hadnot been willing to join in the new initiative which the Governmentsof the United Kingdom and the United States had decided to take inthe hope of expediting progress towards an effective international agreement on disarmament. An Anglo-American approach wastherefore being made to the Soviet Government, and a jointannouncement would be issued that day, in London and in washington. This would also cover the possibility that christmas island might be used for a further series of nuclear tests. The termsof the joint announcement would be incorporated in a full statement which he would make in the House of Commons that afternoon.The Cabinet were informed that this statement might provoke an opposition demand for an immediate debate. They agreed that, ifthis were conceded by the Speaker, the Government spokesmen inthe debate should be the Minister of Defence and the Prime Minister.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Prime Minister.Parliament 3.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.IncomesPolicyRailwaymen&apos;sWages(previous reference:C.C. (62) 10thConclusions,Minute 4)4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Chairman ofthe British Transport Commission had at his last meeting with the railwaymen&apos;s unions raised his offer of a wage increase from 2\ to3 per cent, with effect from the beginning of April. He had, however,made it clear that neither the Commission nor the Government couldbe regarded as committed to a further increase later in the year. Theunions had now asked for an interview with the Prime Minister.Discussion showed that there was general support in the cabinet for the view that representatives of the unions should be seen by thePrime Minister. There would be no question of increasing the offer made by the Chairman of the Commission. Before the meeting tookplace the Prime Minister would consider with the Ministers directly concerned what line he should take. Points of particular importancewould be the possibility of arbitration and the prospect of re-opening
negotiations later in the year. It would be important that theGovernments position should be stated clearly in an agreed statement issued to the Press at the end of the meeting. If the meeting were heldon 14th February, the Cabinet would have an opportunity to considerthe matter further at their meeting on 13th February.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would discuss with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Transport andthe Minister of Labour the terms of a statement of theGovernments position for his use at his forthcoming meeting with representatives of the railwaymen&apos;s tradeunions.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (C. (62) 22) on constitutional development in kenya.The Colonial Secretary said that the Kenya constitutional conference would open in London on 14th February. Its object wasto settle a Constitution for Kenya during the period of internal self-government. In the light of precedents in other territories it wouldbe generally assumed that the transition to full independence wouldtake place about a year or 18 months after the attainment of self-government. Refusal to accept an early date for independence would probably lead to further outbreaks of violence, which would further reduce confidence in the country&apos;s future and intensify its economic problems. On the other hand, the early grant of independence might leave Kenya with an unstable and inefficientgovernment, which would be equally disastrous to the economic prospects of the country. The first task was, however, to seek agreement on a Constitution with strong safeguards for Africanminorities and for the European settlers. It would then be a matter for judgment how far such a Constitution was likely in the event to beoverthrown by unconstitutional means. Much would depend on the encouragement of moderate African opinion. The colonial secretary said that he intended to do all he could to isolate the extremists in the Kenya African National Union and to persuade itsmore moderate members to make common cause with the KenyaAfrican Democratic Union.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, outlined the financial prospects of Kenya. On the best assumptions Kenya would need economic aidat the rate of about  30 million a year for many years ahead. unless some confidence in the country&apos;s stability could be restored, it would decline into complete bankruptcy. The cost of compensatingEuropean settlers for their land alone would amount to about 140 million. It was therefore important that the gravity of thesituation and the need to restore confidence should be impressed fromthe outset on those attending the Constitutional Conference and thatno promise should be given or implied that the United KingdomGovernment would compensate displaced European settlers orincrease the level of economic aid. We would continue to accept theobligations which flowed from our responsibility as a Colonial power;but we could not accept responsibility for additional aid which mightbe called for as the result of mismanagement by an independent state.In discussion the following points were made :(a) The question of safeguards was vital in the framing of a constitution for self-government. So far as possible such safeguardsshould be independent of the legislature, particularly where the rightsof African minorities were concerned. It would be difficult to devisestronger safeguards for the European settlers than a Bill of Rights
and an independent judiciary, but the possibility might be consideredof conferring on the European members of the legislature some rightof veto on measures affecting the vital interests of the Europeansettlers. It must, however, be recognised that any Constitution nowdevised might break down during the period of self-government, thusrequiring us to resort to direct rule. Even if it survived into the periodof independence, it might be overthrown by revolution. It should beremembered, however, that predictions of political breakdownfollowing the grant of independence to other territories mostrecently, for example, the Cameroons had not been borne out bythe event; and in terms of administration, of public services, and oftraining Africans for the duties of government we had laid in Kenyaa stronger foundation than in African territories administered by-other Powers. Kenya was, for this reason less likely to relapse into thekind of chaos which had followed the grant of independence to the congo. It would not be possible to form a proper view of theprospects until the Conference had started and had made some progress; much would depend on the emergence of a moderateAfrican leadership.(b) The grant of early independence to Kenya would be dangerous in the extreme. Responsible local opinion was unanimousthat the advance of independence was too fast but there was almostequal agreement on the dangers of trying to slow it down. from every point of view it would be preferable to lengthen the period ofself-government to something of the order of five years if means couldbe found of doing this without provoking a violent African reactionwhich would have the effect of further weakening confidence in kenya and accelerating its economic collapse. It might be possible to devisesome form of trusteeship under international, Commonwealth or united Nations auspices which would be acceptable to african opinion. Short of this, it might be possible to associate some othercountries, in an advisory capacity, with our continuing administrationof Kenya. These possibilities should be examined.(c) The threat to Kenya&apos;s economic stability was of paramount importance. It put Kenya into a different category from other territories whose independence had already been granted or promised.The Government would be justified in withholding independencefrom territories which were not economically viable and had no reasonable prospect of becoming so. It was for consideration whethera frank explanation of Kenya&apos;s economic difficulties would not beaccepted by world opinion and even by the Afro-Asian group in theUnited Nations as justifying delay. There was, however, a real danger that this might cause the Soviet Government or the ChineseGovernment, which was known to be taking an increasing interest inAfrican affairs, to offer such economic aid as was needed to supportthe economy of an independent Kenya. We might then find ourselvesobliged to grant early independence to Kenya in circumstances whichwould draw the country into the Communist camp. Even so, therewould be advantage in obtaining a more general recognition of theeconomic difficulties facing Kenya and to this end it might be helpful if some independent authority, possibly the World Bank, could beinvited to make an objective survey of Kenya&apos;s economy and prospects.(d) During the period of self-government it would be possibleto use British troops to maintain law and order. It would be moredifficult to arrange for a British military presence after independence.But, if we made it plain that we were not proposing to retain a militarybase in Kenya after independence, it might be possible to arrange fora number of British troops to be stationed in the area, particularly for training puposes. Even so, the main burden of maintaining lawand order in an independent Kenya would fall on the King&apos;s AfricanRifles. By the middle of 1963 only half the officers of this force would be African and it might be necessary for the Government to
second British officers at United Kingdom expense to maintain its efficiency. Tt would be in our interest to do this: the consequences of failing to maintain organised forces at the disposal of governmenthad been shown only too clearly in the Congo.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Colonial Secretary, at the outset of the kenya Constitutional Conference, would emphasise theeconomic difficulties facing Kenya and would seek to concentrate discussion on the problem of a constitution for the period of internal self-government.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to consider whether some formof trusteeship for Kenya during the period of self-government could be devised and whether it would be toour advantage to invite some international authority to review Kenya&apos;s economy and prospects.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting in thelight of developments at the Conference.Cabinet Office, S.W.J.8th February, 1962.
