The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.(2) Agreed that arrangements might be made to carry out enginerepairs in the United Kingdom on the Canberra aircraft which the Indian Government had made available for use by United Nations forces in the Congo.Foreign 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that some progress was beingAffairs made in the discussions on Laos at the Geneva Conference.   TheLaos Soviet representatives had raised the question whether Western forces(Previous should not now be withdrawn from Thailand, but they had shown no reference: disposition to press this point. It seemed likely that the outstandingC.C. (62) 44th problems would be resolved in the course of the next few weeks.Conclusions, Meanwhile, in Laos itself the Coalition Government seemed to be minute 3)       working smoothly.Congo The Foreign Secretary said that a new crisis seemed to beRepublic developing in the Congo. At a late stage in the contacts between(Previous Mr. Adoula, the Prime Minister of the Central Congo Government,Reference: and Mr. Tshombe, the Prime Minister of Katanga, it had becomeC.C. (62) 35th apparent that they were not in agreement on some of the fundamentalConclusions, constitutional problems and that, until he could see the shape of them mute 2) federal structure more clearly, Mr. Tshombe preferred to rest on thede facto autonomy which Katanga now enjoyed. The United Nationsrepresentative had completed the draft of a new constitution, and itwas possible that the contacts might be resumed on the basis of this document. Meanwhile, however, the Central Government were already in serious financial difficulties and, if their operations in the congo continued on the same scale, the United Nations would be in similar difficulties by the beginning of 1963. The Acting Secretary-General was therefore anxious that the position should be resolvedwithin the next six months and for this purpose wished to secure afresh mandate from the Security Council, preferably during Augustwhen the Irish representative would be in the Chair. The foreign secretary felt that, if this question came to the Security Council at thisstage, there was a grave risk that the Afro-Asian countries would bring forward a resolution authorising the forceful coercion of katanga by United Nations forces. He was therefore exploring, withthe French and Belgian Governments, the possibility of framing somefresh initiative not involving the further use of force. Some of our allies were inclined to think that economic pressure could be broughtto bear on Mr. Tshombe through the Union Miniere. He himselfdoubted whether this would be practicable: he also feared that, if itwere attempted, there might be a violent reaction by Mr. Tshombewhich would, in turn, provoke the use of force by the United Nations.He was continuing his consultations and hoped to be able to putdefinite proposals to the Cabinet at an early meeting.Meanwhile, the Indian Government had asked if the UnitedKingdom Government could arrange for the repair of the engines ofthe Canberra aircraft which their forces were operating in the Congoon behalf of the United Nations. It would be difficult to withholdthese facilities; but, in considering this application, the Cabinet should bear in mind the political criticisms which had been aroused in thiscountry by the earlier request for the supply of bombs for use by these aircraft.In discussion it was argued that the objections which had been raised to the supply of bombs could not properly extend to theservicing of the aircraft which were, after all, used in the Congo formany purposes to which no legitimate objection could be raised.
EuropeCommonMarketNegotiations(previous reference:CC. (62) 44thConclusions,Minute 5)The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to prepare,in consultation with the Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip,a draft statement on these lines, to be used in reply to a parliamentary Question if required, and to submit the draft frr the Prime Ministers approval.Pensions(previous reference:CC (60) 54thConclusions,Minute 5)Public Service3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (C. (62) 108) proposing certain increases in publicservice pensions.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the Government were committed to an early announcement on the increase of public service pensions. The purpose of his present paper was to explain the natureof the increases which he had in mind and to obtain authority to putin hand the drafting of the necessary legislation. The firstannouncement of the Governments intentions would be in general terms and would not go into details. His proposals fell under fourheads:(i) A general increase in public service pensions on the lines ofthe increases made in 1959. Pensions awarded before april 1956 would be increased by 12 per cent., and theincrease in pensions subsequently awarded would taperoff by 2 per cent, a year with the result that pensionsawarded since April 1961 would receive no increase.(ii) A flat-rate increase of  20 a year for pensioners over 70 whohad retired before April 1956. A proportionately smallerfiat-rate increase would be awarded to pensioners over 70who had retired since 1956.(hi) A working party to examine the practicability of providingsome relief for former members of oversea services, wherethe Government by which they had been employed had failed to award pension increases on the scale adopted inthe United Kingdom itself. In these cases some subventionwould have to be made by the United KingdomGovernment to supplement the existing rates: the preciseamounts would depend on the recommendations of theworking party.(iv) An announcement that in due course the Government would deal with the anomaly that some public service pensionerswere drawing combined retirement allowances whichmight exceed their earnings while in employment.2. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said thatspeculation was growing about the possibility that Parliament wouldbe recalled during the summer recess to debate the results of thenegotiations in Brussels on the United Kingdom&apos;s application to join the European Economic Community. This could be checked if theGovernment were to take the initiative in making an early statement in Parliament.In discussion it was argued that such an initiative would have theeffect of increasing tension rather than reducing it. It would be preferable to leave the Opposition to raise the matter, by parliamentary question; and, if they did, to answer by referring to the uncertainty of the time-table of the negotiations and making it plain that it wouldbe open to the Government to ask for the recall of Parliament at anytime during the recess if the development of the negotiations made itexpedient to do so.
SECRET 5CC. 45 (62)These proposals would cost about  20 million in a full year, ofwhich  14 million represented the pensions increases as such and  million the flat rate supplement. Of this  20 million,  15 million would fall on the Exchequer and  5 million on local authorities. Thelocal authorities should therefore be consulted before details of theproposals were disclosed.In discussion the following points were made:(a) Once the Government had announced their intention tointroduce legislation for pensions increases there would be strong pressure for the increases to take effect before Christmas. Everyeffort should be made to meet such a time-table, and the Bill shouldbe given high priority in the legislative programme. It was important that the Government should retain the initiative in this matter.(b) A particularly difficult point of timing might arise inconnexion with Service pensioners and Service widows. their position should be specially considered in framing the terms of any announcement.(c) Some doubt was expressed about the proposal to announceat this stage an intention to deal with the problem created by excessiveretirement benefits for certain classes of public service pensioner.This problem would not become acute for some time to come, unlesslegislation were introduced to set aside the pledges about&quot; abatement &quot; which had been given to those who entered the publicservice before 1949. The issue was a complex one and theGovernment must be careful to avoid charges of bad faith. It wouldbe preferable to defer any announcement on this aspect of the matteruntil the Government had decided exactly what steps they proposedto take to deal with it.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to proceed withthe drafting of the legislation necessary to give effect to thepensions increases proposed in C. (62) 108.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to consult the Ministerof Defence about the position of Service pensioners and service widows in relation both to the announcement ofthe Governments intentions and to the timing of subsequent action.(3) Agreed that the legislative programme should, if possible, beso framed that the new increases could come into effectbefore Christmas 1962.(4) Agreed that no reference should be made at this stage to theGovernments intention to deal, at some later date, withthe problem of excessive retirement benefits for certainclasses of public service pensioner.Commercial 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePolicy President of the Board of Trade (C. (62) 113) outlining the main pointsJapan which would arise in the negotiation of a commercial treaty with(Previous        Japan.ReferenceCC. (62) 40th The President of the Board of Trade recalled that on 7th JuneConclusions, the Cabinet had invited him to hold further discussions with the minute 3) &apos; Ministers concerned on a number of points which had been raised inthe consideration of his earlier paper (C. (62) 92) on the restrictions tobe retained on imports of certain types of Japanese goods after theconclusion of a commercial treaty with Japan. In these discussions ithad now been agreed that plastic toys should be retained on the&quot;sensitive&quot; list until 1st January, 1965, and that he should do his
ResalePriceMaintenance(previous reference:C.C. (62) 33rdConclusions,Minute 5)5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C. (62) 112) and the Lord President (C. (62) 114)on the abolition of resale price maintenance.The President of the Board of Trade said that it could be argued that, in the light of experience in the grocery trade, the abolition ofresale price maintenance would produce a significant reduction in thecost of living. There had been a reduction of nearly 5 per cent, in theaverage price of branded grocery goods under the conditions of freecompetition which now prevailed, and there was no reason to thinkthat the same results would not follow in other trades. On the other side it could be argued that abolition would adversely affect smallshopkeepers, who were well organised and would bring their caseforcibly to public notice; and that this might affect the success of theGovernments incomes policy, which would depend largely on publicacceptance of its aims and its methods. It should not however be forgotten that the support for abolition, although it would be lesspublicised, might be more widespread : younger people, in particular,regarded the existing system with suspicion as tending to keep priceshigh. He himself would favour abolition, both on economic considerations and on broader grounds of public interest, and he proposed that resale price maintenance should be made illegal.The Lord President said that he could see strong arguments infavour of making resale price maintenance unenforceable, bydepriving manufacturers of the right to uphold resale price maintenance contracts in the courts, but he saw grave objections to making it illegal. This would have the effect of making the whole ofany contract illegal if it contained a resale price maintenance clause.This would inevitably give rise to sharp practice and to subterfuge:it would lead to a repetition of the abuses which had attended theapplication of the building regulations in force after the end of thewar.utmost to avoid accepting a date earlier than 1965 for liberalisingimports of sewing machines. His proposal on radio goods had beenthat some equipment should be removed from the &quot; sensitive &quot; listaltogether and that the rest should be retained until 1st January, 1965.He had now withdrawn these proposals, except that transistorisedgramophones would be deleted from the list; but it might be necessary at a later date to seek authority for concessions on imports of thoseradio goods which would for the time being be retained on the list.He had originally proposed to free wool cloths and yarns but to try to obtain a wide definition of wool cloth for retention on the list. but these proposals on wool textiles had given rise to difficulty in yorkshire, and the Prime Minister had undertaken to receive adeputation from the wool industry on the following day. It was important to proceed with the negotiations without further delay, andhe sought authority to send immediate instructions to the UnitedKingdom delegation on all the points on which agreement had nowbeen reached with his colleagues, with an indication that instructionsabout wool textiles would be sent as soon as possible after the PrimeMinisters meeting with representatives of the industry. It was hopedthat the treaty could be signed in November, when the Japanese PrimeMinister was expected to visit this country.The Cabinet Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to issue instructions for negotiation of a commercial treaty with japan on the basis of the proposals outlined in C. (62) 92and C. (62) 113, subject to the adjustments to be made inC. (62) 92 on account of the agreements subsequently reached on plastic toys and radio goods and to the further instructions on wool textiles to be sent after the Prime Ministersmeeting with representatives of the industry on 11th July.
CC. 45 (62)In discussion the following points were made:(a) The economic advantages of the abolition of resale price maintenance had not been conclusively established. There was, inparticular, need for further study of experience in other countries where it had been abolished. It was at least possible that the abolitionof maintained prices might lead to higher &quot; suggested &quot; prices in orderto enable the shopkeeper to present his customers with what wouldappear to be a better bargain. There was also some evidence tosuggest that uneconomic reductions in the prices of certain goods were offered by shopkeepers in order to attract custom. This not onlycaused difficulties for the manufacturers, but enabled the shopkeeperto maintain higher prices for other ranges of goods.(b) Although there might be some doubt about the strength ofthe economic argument and therefore of the appeal which the abolitionof resale price maintenance would have for the consumer, there couldbe no doubt about the strength of the opposition to be expected from small shopkeepers and from garage proprietors. This would be well organised and would have strong backing among government supporters in the country and in Parliament.(c) If resale price maintenance were to be abolished, this shouldbe done as part of a coherent economic plan and should be seen to be only one element in a broad and imaginative approach to the country&apos;economic problems. If abolition were presented in this way, the forceof the opposition would be weakened. Conversely, it was to beexpected that a general plan for economic expansion which did not include a proposal to abolish resale price maintenance would command less support.(d) Even though it might be decided that this was not a propitiousmoment at which to go forward with the abolition of resale price maintenance, it would be wrong to imply that the government intended to support its indefinite continuance.(e) It was noted that, when the Government had taken steps in1956 to prevent enforcement of collective price maintenanceagreements, they had at the same time strengthened the power of manufacturers to enforce individual price maintenance agreements by bringing third parties within the ambit of the law.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that it was evident that the Cabinet would not favour an early announcement thatresale price maintenance should be made illegal. There was, on theother hand, general agreement that it would be wrong to support the indefinite continuance of the present system. A further analysisshould be made of the experience of other countries, both in europe and in the United States, where retail price maintenance had been abolished. Further thought should also be given to the possibility ofmaking individual price maintenance contracts unenforceable, ratherthan illegal, or at the least of restoring the position which had existed before 1956.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no announcement should be made for the present about the Governments attitude towards resale price maintenance.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to bring beforethem at a later meeting a further analysis of the practical effect of the abolition of resale price maintenance in othercountries.(3) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to re-examine thepossibility of dealing with this situation by making it lesseasy to enforce resale price maintenance agreements orcontracts.
Works of Art 6.   The Chief Secretary,  Treasury, said that he had beenLeonardo informed by Lord Crawford, the Chairman of the National ArtCartoon Collections Fund, that the appeal which had been organised by the(Previous        Fund had so far yielded about  375,000 towards the  800,000 for reference:       which the Royal Academy had agreed to sell the Leonardo da VinciCC. (62) 21st   Cartoon for his picture of the Virgin and Child with St. John theConclusions,     Baptist and St. Anne. If the appeal had to be abandoned because the minute 4)       requisite sum could not be raised by the end of July, contributionscould be returned to some 14,000 people who could be identified;but the remaining 170,000 or more people who had contributed couldnot be identified and the sums obtained from them would accrue tothe Fund. It would be difficult for the Fund to keep the appeal openbeyond the end of July, partly because the administrative staff werevolunteers and partly because some contributions had been made onthe express understanding that they could be withdrawn if the appealwere not successful by the due date.  Money was still being received,and a total of  400,000 might be reached by the end of July; butLord Crawford thought that, even if the Government now promised tocontribute up to  200,000 of the remainder on a pound-for-poundbasis, the amount raised by the end of July would still fall short of 800,000.   It had been suggested on behalf of the Fund that theGovernment might instead make a larger contribution, say of  350,000,and leave the Fund to raise the remainder.In discussion the following points were raised:(a) Numbers of people were doubtful whether the picture was worth the substantial sum of money which might have to becontributed on the tax-payers&apos; behalf in order to prevent it being soldat auction and taken out of the country. Some doubt was also feltabout the efficiency with which the Fund had set about raising themoney required. It would, however, be unfortunate if the appeal hadto be abandoned, and the Government should be seen to be doing allthat could reasonably be expected to assist it.(b) One reason for the comparatively small public response wasthat the organisers had not had enough time to make effectivepreparations. Given more time and the adoption of more active measures to arouse interest e.g., by the fuller use of television, bypublicity in the provinces and by the development of collections in schools more subscriptions would be obtainable. The further time required might, however, be substantial. In view of the approach ofthe holiday season not less than a further six months would be needed.(c) There were two main ways in which the Government might help by promising matching contributions or by making a directcontribution forthwith. Either of these courses might have adiscouraging effect on further private subscription and might place the Government under a moral obligation to bridge whatever gapremained when the appeal was closed. If a direct contribution weremade, it could not be of the order of  350,000, as had been suggestedon behalf of the Fund. But even a smaller contribution might beregarded as committing the Government to rescuing the Fund in theend, and it could be argued that it would be inexpedient for theGovernment to take any action until the last possible moment.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that the first step should be to ascertain whether the Royal Academy would accepta substantial extension of the appeal period. He would discuss this with the Academy authorities. It would then be necessary to consider further the form of any financial assistance by the Government andto discuss with Lord Crawford means of strengthening the Fund&apos;s appeal organisation. The results of these enquiries would be reportedto the Cabinet in due course.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for further enquiries to be made in the light of their discussion.(2) Agreed to resume their consideration of this question at alater meeting.
Office 8.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Home AffairsBuilding Committee and the Economic Policy Committee had given some consideration to the problem of controlling office-building in thecentral areas of London and other large cities, but further work wouldhave to be done on the subject before firm conclusions could bereached. He had consulted the Home Secretary and now suggestedthat this further work could most appropriately be done by the new committee on Population and Employment.The Cabinet Agreed that the Committee on Population and employment should consider the problem of controlling office-building in the central area of London and other large cities.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,10th July, 1962.C.C. 45 (62)Committees 7   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chiefof Enquiry      Secretary, Treasury (C. (62) 109) suggesting that greater cautionshould be exercised in appointing independent committees to examine and report on aspects of public policy.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the appointment of committees and the publication of their reports tended, not only to restrict the Governments freedom of action, but to commit theGovernment to increased expenditure. There was a natural tendency for a committee, examining some limited field, to recommendincreased expenditure as an essential element in their proposals.At the suggestion of the Prime Minister the Cabinet (1) Invited Ministers to inform the Chancellor of the Exchequerbefore appointing any independent committee of enquiry into any aspect of public policy.(2) Agreed that the Prime Minister^ decision should be sought in any case of doubt.
