nuclear tests(previous reference:C.C. (62) 6thConclusions.Minute 2)*2. The Prime Minister said that, since the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 18th January, there had been a further exchange of messagesbetween himself and President Kennedy about the use of christmas island for a further series of nuclear tests and a related initiative on disarmament. Agreement had now been reached on the terms inwhich these decisions should be announced The announcement hadbeen delayed in the hope that the French Government could be persuaded to join in the disarmament initiative. Their reply had notyet been received, but it was hoped that the announcement would bemade in the course of the following week.The Prime Minister recalled that the Cabinet had been speciallydisturbed by the political difficulty of having to admit that the finaldecision to conduct atmospheric tests at Christmas Island would rest with the United States Government. A satisfactory formula hadbeen devised, in consultation with the United States authorities, fordealing with this point. It had been agreed that, if enquiries on this were pressed, each Government would say that consultation would continue between them on both the scientific and the political aspects;that disagreement seemed unlikely, in view of their joint statement and continuing consultation; but that, having both reached agreement in principle on the moral justification for making further tests, neitherGovernment would stand in the way of the other if. in the end. onefelt that further tests were militarily necessary.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement by the PrimeMinister.3. The Lord Privy Seal said that reports published in some british newspapers that morning would give the impression that our negotiations with the European Economic Community were beingdelayed because of the Community&apos;s desire that its own agricultural policy should first be settled and that the Government were reconciledto this delay. In fact we had now secured agreement on means of accelerating the discussions between officials. Nor had we acceptedthe position that the agricultural policy of the Six should be finally settled before our own agricultural interests came under discussion.These news reports were reflecting difficulties which had already been overcome. Guidance in this sense was being given to the Pressgenerally. It would be useful if any Ministers who were separatelyquestioned on this could take the line that these reports were out of date.It was suggested in discussion that it would be useful if theCabinet could have further information of the provisional agreement on agricultural policy which had now been reached by theCommunity.The Cabinet (1) Took note of this statement by the Lord Privy Seal.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to circulate, for their information, a paper on the agricultural policy of theEuropean Economic Community.* Previously recorded in a Confidential AnnexSECRET60620-1 a 2EuropeCommonMarket(previous reference:C.C.

4. The Cabinet were informed that at a meeting with the railway unions on the previous day Dr. Beeching, the Chairman of the british transport Commission, appeared to have indicated that some modestincrease in wages of the order of 2\ per cent, might be agreed uponwith effect from the beginning of April and to have hinted that negotiations for a further increase might be opened within a fewmonths. It seemed necessary to ascertain from Dr. Beeching what he had in fact said and to establish clearly with him that he should hold out no hope of any increase during 1962 which would involvepayment at a level above that indicated by the Governments incomes policy. Before considering any increase going beyond what mightbe appropriate at the beginning of April, the Government would want to review the financial position of the railways and the economicsituation of the country during 1962. The unions were expected toask for a further meeting with Dr. Beeching during the following week.In discussion die following points were made:(a) Dr. Beeching should not be left with the impression that theGovernment would accept an interim increase of 2^ per cent, to befollowed by a further increase later in 1962. It would be important to know whether negotiations on a further claim might be expectedto extend over a period of many months.(b) If the Governments position were set out in a letter to dr. Beeching he would have no excuse for any furthermisunderstanding. On the other hand, if such a letter were passed on to the unions, the probability of strike action would be enhancedand the Government would appear to be entering into wage negotiations themselves. It would be preferable that Dr. Beechingshould be seen by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Transport, who could ascertain v/hat he had said and make theGovernments position clear to him. The situation could beconsidered further in the light of that interview.(c) The effect of a railway strike would be serious both for thefinancial position of the railways and for the country&apos;s industrial production. It was believed that the union leaders would wish toavoid a strike, but any sign of weakness on the Governments part would encourage the more extreme elements in the unions.Dr. Beeching&apos;s resignation would increase the risk of a strike, andwould also increase the Governments difficulties in handling it.(d) Publication later in the month of the Supplementary Estimaterequired to meet the deficit of the Commission would draw public attention to the serious scale of the Commission^ losses and would help to convince public opinion of the need to limit wage increases forrailwaymen.The Cabinet Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Transport would speak to the Chairman of theBritish Transport Commission on the lines agreed in the cabinets discussion.IncomesPolicyRailwaymen&apos;sWages(previous reference:C.C.

(62) 20) covering a draft White Paper on incomes policy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in the debate in theHouse of Commons on 29th January a statement of government policy on incomes had been promised. Much of the substance of thedraft White Paper had already been approved by the Cabinet. It was desirable that it should be published as soon as possible; forGovernment supporters, both in Parliament and in the country, were anxious to have an authoritative statement of Government policy forthe phase following the end of the pay pause.
London 6.   The Home Secretary said that the one-day unofficial strikeTransport 0f workers on the London underground railways and the suburbanToken Strike services of the Southern Region of British Railways had produced on 29th January a serious dislocation of London traffic. the ministerial Committee on Emergencies were meeting that afternoon to consider, in the light of that experience, what measures could betaken to mitigate the consequences of the further token strike whichhad been called for 5th February. One point on which he would welcome the views of his colleagues was whether London firms shouldbe advised to arrange for some or all of their employees to stay away from work on that day.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat it would be inexpedient for the Government to advise employers in this sense. This might be taken as conceding a victory to the strikers.   Most people would prefer to try to get to their place ofIn discussion it was pointed out that the proposed White paper would have an important effect on those engaged in wage negotiations.Its impact might be the stronger if some phrases in the draft which appeared to strike an unduly gloomy note could be further considered and if more stress could be laid on the importance of securing growth in the economy. A rate of growth in national production evenmarginally greater than the 2\ per cent, which had been forecastwould transform the situation; and, if public opinion could be convinced of the rewards to be gained from more effective work, thepresent difficulty in restraining the growth of personal incomes mightbe reduced.There was general agreement that, in the broad presentation ofthe Governments economic policy, it would be valuable to emphasise that a great deal had been achieved in the improvement of living standards since the end of the war and that the restraint in incomeswhich the Government felt obliged to enjoin was directed to ensuring that the satisfactory position which had been reached should not be lost. This message could best be conveyed by a sustained campaign of speeches in the country, for which material was already in preparation. The campaign might be associated with the beginningof the work of the National Economic Development Council, in whichthe Trades Union Congress had recently agreed to join. For theimmediate purpose of clearing the public mind on the government&apos;s policy in the period following the pay pause it would be advisable to issue the White Paper substantially as drafted. This would not preclude amendments of the text which would place greater emphasis on growth and the significance of expanding exports, and would avoidtoo much reference to restraint and to the interim character of thepolicy described. Various amendments for this purpose were suggested and approved. It was also agreed that, in the light of a discussion which the Chancellor of the Exchequer had held on theprevious evening with the General Secretary of the Trades UnionCongress, it would be expedient to delete the paragraph in the draft which dealt with the position of the lowest paid workers.The Cabinet (1) Subject to the amendments approved in their discussion,authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to present toParliament a White Paper on. incomes policy in the termsof the draft annexed to C. (62) 20.(2) Took note that Ministers would be provided with materialshowing the substantial success of the pay pause andwould be invited to use in their speeches that and otherbackground material which was being prepared.
work, despite the difficulties. There was, however no reason why thePolice should not advise people to avoid travelling into London on 5th February unless they had necessary business there on that day.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the ministerial committee on Emergencies to be guided, in their consideration of this problem, by the views expressed in the cabinets discussion.Federationof RSiodesiaandNyasalandNorthernRhodesia(previous reference:C.C. (61) 35thConclusions,Minute 2)7. The Prime Minister said that in their last discussion on22nd June, 1961, the Cabinet had accepted certain changes in theproposals for a Northern Rhodesian constitution contained in theWhite Paper of February 1961 (Cmnd. 1295). These changes hadevoked an unexpectedly violent African reaction and widespreadrioting. On 13th September the Government had stated that whenviolence and disorder had ceased they would be ready to considerreasonable representations for a modification of their proposalswithin the area where divergencies of view persisted. The cabinet had now to consider in the light of developments since June and moreparticularly since the statement in September what changes if anyshould be made in the June proposals. Two broad factors must beborne in mind in reaching a decision; in the first place, the federal prime Minister regarded the June settlement as an agreement binding on the Government and he was likely to represent that any departure from it would be a breach of faith. Secondly, the Governmentspower to impose a decision was limited; they must rely mainly onpersuasion.The original concept of the constitutional proposals was thatthere would be fifteen seats from the upper roll, fifteen seats from thelower roll and fifteen national seats. The upper roll and lower Roll seats would in practice be filled by Europeans and by Africansrespectively. Candidates for the national seats would have been expected to attract support from both Europeans and Africans, and ithad been thought that this could be secured by requiring candidatesto obtain 10 or 12 per cent, of the votes of both rolls. In June, understrong pressure from the Federal Prime Minister, these proposals hadbeen modified in four ways. First, instead of requiring candidatesto obtain a certain percentage of both rolls, it had been agreed thatthey should obtain a certain percentage from the electors of bothraces; this was because the upper roll contained a growing numberof African voters. Secondly, it had been agreed that instead of a straight percentage qualification there should be a numericalalternative. Candidates would be required to obtain either 12^ percent, of the racial vote or 400 votes, whichever were the less. Thisfavoured the European candidates, since 400 votes represented only about 4 per cent, of the total African vote whereas it representedabout \2\ per cent, of the European vote. Thirdly, a further hurdlehad been introduced, requiring a candidate to obtain at least 20 percent, of either the upper or the lower roll vote; this was designed toprevent the emergence of candidates who could just commandminimal support from both races but had no appeal to the electorateas a whole. Fourthly, an Asian seat had been introduced which hadthe effect of removing Asian voters from the general franchise, and asa corollary 500 African voters had been added to the upper roll.The Prime Minister said that after discussion with the ministers most closely concerned he wished to put forward for the Cabinetsconsideration the following modifications of the June proposals:(i) While the principle of a racial vote would be maintained the numerical alternative would be abolished.
(ii) The Federal Prime Minister would be offered the alternative of either a 4 per cent, or a 12-V per cent, racial qualifying vote.(iii) On the basis of a 4 per cent, vote the Asian seat would beretained. On the basis of a 124- per cent, vote it would be in theinterests of the Federal Government to accept the abolition of the asian seat, since with a higher qualifying vote it was unlikely thatany African candidates would be elected and the Asian seat would merely result in the return of an unopposed opposition member. Ifthe Asian seat disappeared it was for consideration whether it shouldbe replaced by a reserved seat for a representative from Barotseland.The Prime Minister said that, before discussing the details ofthese modifications and the questions of procedure associated withthem, the Cabinet would first wish to take a view on the proprietyof departing from the agreement reached with the Federal PrimeMinister in June.In discussion of this point the Cabinet took the view that, whileany departure from the June agreement would expose them to a charge of bad faith, it would be inconsistent with their responsibilities to refrain from making such changes as seemed necessary to avoid further violence and bloodshed in Northern Rhodesia and to reach a solution which stood some chance of acceptance by both parties.The case would stand differently if the changes now proposed hadinvolved a radical alteration in the principles on which the earlier proposals had been framed. But in fact the Government statement in September had already made it clear that the Government hadbeen prepared to consider changes in the areas in which differences ofview persisted the racial qualification and the Asian seat and thiswas all that was now in question.In discussion of the detailed constitutional changes proposed thefollowing points were made:(a) A 4 per cent, racial qualification might lead to the emergence of a large African majority which would be most unwelcome to theFederal Prime Minister. It therefore seemed more likely that hewould choose the 124- per cent, qualifying percentage. This had the disadvantage of making it probable that very few of the national seatswould be filled and would thus work against the emergence of the moderate African candidates whom it was in our long-term interest toencourage. As against this, however, the African objection to the june proposals had centred on the existence of the numericalalternative; their first requirement was for an equal percentage for both races and this requirement would be met. The precise level atwhich the percentage might be set was of secondary importance tothem.(b) Agreement to a 124 per cent, qualifying vote necessarilycarried with it the abolition &quot;of&quot; the Asian seat. It could be argued,however, that on presentational grounds it would be better to bringthe Federal Prime Minister to see the advantage from his point ofview of abolishing the Asian seat if the qualifying racial vote was setas high as 124- per cent, than to ask him to agree to its abolition fromthe outset.(c) A quick settlement of these outstanding constitutional issuesv/as of great importance. The longer the delay, the greater the likelihood of further outbreaks of violence and the greater thedifficulty, not only of keeping the situation in Northern Rhodesiaunder control, but also of holding the Federation together.The Commonwealth Secretary said that it was in his viewnecessary to look at constitutional development in Northern Rhodesiaagainst the wider background of the future of the Federation; thiswould affect both the timing and the procedure to be adopted inputting these new proposals forward. He was convinced that theFederation could mot survive in its present form.   If it were to survive
at all the Federal Prime Minister would have to modify his present policies so as to secure a far greater measure of African support.Time was running short; he might well be faced with the secessionof Nyasaland in a few months&apos; time if matters continued in theirpresent course. Against this background the acceptance of the changes proposed in the Northern Rhodesian constitution could beseen as no more than a small and necessary move in the right directionin the context of the radical changes which were needed to improve the prospects for the Federation as a whole. He intended to visit theFederal Prime Minister in the following week. He could present thenew proposals for Northern Rhodesia to him in the course of his visit and could discuss them with him in the context of longer-termpolitical developments. If the proposals for Northern Rhodesiawere presented to him in advance of their meeting it was more likely ,that he would insist on visiting London; this would be undesirablepolitically and would create an unfavourable atmosphere for theforthcoming discussions on the future of the Federation.In discussion of the procedure for handling the constitutional changes the following points were made:(r/) The first reaction of the Federal Prime Minister to the new proposals would be unfavourable; and from this point of view therewould be advantage in delaying their presentation until theCommonwealth Secretary had arrived in Salisbury. As against this it must be recognised that the African leaders would regardwith suspicion any proposals which appeared to have resulted from discussions between the Federal Prime Minister and theCommonwealth Secretary.(e) To avoid the possibility of later misunderstanding it wouldbe essential to convey the Governments proposals at some stage tothe Federal Prime Minister in writing in terms which made it clearthat they had been put forward as a decision by the Governmentand not as a basis for negotiation.(/) While it would be right to present the proposals for northern rhodesia in the context of future developments in the Federationitself, it was important not to regard them as a final solution. If theFederation were to survive it could only do so on the basis of a looserassociation of States and on the emergence of a moderate Africanleadership. The proposals in their present form would do little toencourage this and the possibility of further developments to this end should be studied and discussed in due course with the federal government.The Cabinet-(!) Agreed that the Commonwealth Secretary should convey tothe Federal Prime Minister during the course of his visit to Salisbury the decision of the Government that theracial qualifying vote for the national seats in northern rhodesia should be set either at 4 per cent, or at 12L percent. If the qualifying vote were set at 124- per cent, thiswould entail the abolition of the Asian seat.(2) Agreed that the Governments decision should be embodied in a memorandum which would be handed to the federal prime Minister before the Commonwealth Secretary leftSalisbury.(3) Took note that .the Commonwealth Secretary would also be discussing with the Federal Prime Minister the future ofthe Federation itself and in particular the need for someradical move on his part to obtain a greater measure of african support.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,1st February, 1962.
