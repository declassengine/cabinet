(57) 10thConclusions,Minute 9)1. The Foreign Secretary said that the Soviet Government had now accepted the view that the Governments participating in theDisarmament Conference should be represented by their foreign ministers. They had also agreed that the Foreign Ministers of theUnited States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union should meet in Geneva before the opening of the Conference. This would provide an opportunity to explore the possibility of an agreement on the cessation of nuclear tests. It now seemed more likely that a meetingof Heads of Governments might be held in the early summer.The Foreign Secretary said that there were indications that thePrime Minister of the Central Congo Government was again thinkingin terms of coercing Katanga by force. This made it even more urgentto secure some voluntary agreement between him and the PrimeMinister of Katanga. Unfortunately, however, the difficulties of promoting a meeting between them seemed to have increased.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (62) 37) covering a memorandum by the Minister of housing and Local Government and the Minister of Transport onOxford roads.The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet that the PrimeMinister, in view of his position as Chancellor of Oxford University,had thought it inappropriate that he should be present during the cabinet&apos;s discussion of this question.The Minister of Housing said that on traffic grounds there couldbe no doubt that the line of the road through Christ Church Meadow,which had been proposed by Oxford City Council, was to be preferred to the line further south which had been proposed by the OxfordPreservation Trust. Research had shown that the southern route,which was substantially longer, would not be used by the large volumeof traffic seeking to go to the centre of the city unless severe restrictions were imposed on the use of Magdalen Bridge and The High. the route now proposed by the City Council was more than a quarter of a mile from Christ Church and would not be open to the objections raised to the line originally proposed several years ago. If, as seemed likely to be practicable (though at some additional cost), the road were built in a cutting, the damage to the peace and amenities of theMeadow would be reduced. It was essential, in order to protect the amenities of the central area of the University from further damage and to relieve traffic in The High and at Carfax, that one or other ofthese two roads should be constructed. The question for consideration was whether the damage which would be done to amenity by a roadacross the Meadow outweighed the advantages which it would have,as compared with the southern route, in diverting traffic from thecentre of the University.In discussion the following points were made:(a) If a road were built across the Meadow it should be built ina cutting.(b) When the Governments decision in principle had been takenit would be for the City Council, who had undertaken to accept thatdecision, to submit a modification of their development plan to giveeffect to it. This modification would become the subject of a public enquiry and, if the Meadow road were decided upon, this would bethe stage at which the precise line of the road would be settled anda 2
the detailed steps required to protect any cutting against floodingwould be examined.(c) It was not possible to say at present whether parliamentary proceedings would be needed to secure the land for a road across theMeadow. This question turned on whether the Meadow was an open space within the meaning of the Acquisition of Land (authorisation procedure) Act, 1946, and advance enquiries on that point could notbe made without giving rise to the presumption that a decision infavour of that route had already been taken by the Government. Itwould therefore be preferable that a decision of principle should first be taken and announced. This decision should, however, be takenin the knowledge that, if Parliamentary approval were required foran Order authorising the acquisition of land for a road across theMeadow, the House of Lords might well decline to approve such anOrder, and there might then be substantial difficulties over the apparent exercise by the House of Lords of an absolute veto on adecision taken by the Government. In that event, however, theGovernment could, in the last resort, make its view prevail by introducing a Bill and invoking the procedure of the Parliament Act,1911.(d) Some members of the Cabinet felt that the peace and amenityof the Meadow ought not to be disturbed unless all other measuresto improve traffic conditions in the city had first been tried and had failed. The present difficulties might have been avoided if earlieraction had been taken to encourage the growth of Cowley as a separate and self-contained town. This was no longer practicable. Nor would it be practicable simply to close Magdalen Bridge to all traffic.Restrictions on the use of the bridge might be called for even inconjunction with the shorter road, but the time to consider these wouldbe when the road had been built and some experience of actual traffic conditions had been gained.(e) The amenity of the Meadow had been emphasised in discussion, but v/hat was really involved was a balance of amenities.Preserving the peace of the Meadow had to be weighed against theneed to improve conditions in the centre of the University, where thevolume of traffic had already produced serious interference withamenities.(/) The longer road would involve substantial demolition of house property in St. Clements.Summing up the discussion the Home Secretary said that it wasevidently the majority view of the Cabinet that the most important consideration was to secure relief from traffic disturbance in the centre of Oxford and that it would be right for that purpose to face somesacrifice of amenity in the Meadow. This sacrifice could be kept toa minimum by building the road in a cutting and by giving careful attention to landscaping and lighting. Notwithstanding the difficulties to which the decision would give rise in the House of Lords and elsewhere, there appeared to be no practical alternative to a roadacross the Meadow.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentshould invite the Oxford City Council to submit a modification to the development plan for the city toprovide for a road to be built in a cutting across ChristChurch Meadow.(2) Took note that the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment and the Minister of Transport, in examining the design for the road, would give special attention toamenity considerations and in particular would considerwhether street lighting could be dispensed with.
GovernmentOfficesBroadSanctuary(previous reference:C.C.(55) 27thConclusions,Minute 9)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Works (C. (62) 35) about the proposed Government office building in Broad Sanctuary.The Minister of Works said that he had been asked by the PrimeMinister to inform the Cabinet about the progress of the scheme forconstructing Government offices on the site of the old WestminsterHospital. Following a decision of the Home Affairs Committee inNovember 1958, a competition had been held for the design of a building of modest size behind the line of Matthew Parker Street.The result of the competition had been published in the Press andthe winning design, which had been accepted by the London CountyCouncil, had met with general approval. Subject to the comments of the Royal Fine Art Commission, which were likely to be favourable,he proposed to have drawings prepared and to invite tenders. Thearchitect was considering the extent to which stone might be usedin preference to concrete. On such a prominent site it would be important to avoid the cracking and discoloration to which concretemight be subject, and special care would be given to this point.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Works.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (62) 43) on the Governments response to the forthcoming report by the Royal College of Physicians on &quot; Smoking and Flealth &quot;.The Home Secretary said that this report concluded that a causalconnexion had now been established between cigarette smoking andlung cancer. It recommended that the Government should takepositive steps to curb the rising consumption of tobacco and especially of cigarettes. The measures suggested included better education ofthe public, and especially of school-children, about the dangers ofsmoking, restriction of tobacco advertising and increased taxation oncigarettes. There could be little dispute about the need for improvedpublicity, especially for school-children; but the other measures raiseddifficult questions of policy. For this reason the Home AffairsCommittee, which had considered the report, recommended that immediate action should be confined to statements by the ministers of Health and of Education confirming the Governments intentionto use all channels of health education, including the publication anddistribution of special pamphlets, to make the conclusions of thereport known and to discourage smoking on health grounds. Theother measures suggested might be remitted for further study by a group of Ministers.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It would be difficult to persuade the public that theGovernment seriously wished to discourage smoking if action were confined to health education and no positive action were taken bythe Government, e.g., to restrict the advertising of cigarettes. strong representations in this sense were likely to be made by the teachers.It would be suggested that particular attention should be given toadvertising directed to young people.(b) The advantages of a major advertising campaign by theGovernment were doubtful. It might well be ineffective unless at thesame time restrictions were placed on advertising by the tobaccomanufacturers. If this were not done the Government would appearto be entering into an advertising competition with the tobaccocompanies. This would be an expensive, and probably an ineffective,venture.SECRET60900-2 a 3SmokingandHealth(previous reference:C.C. (57) 45thConclusions,Minute 5)
Housing 5.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the MinisterPolicy of Housing, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Chief(Previous        Secretary, Treasury (C.  (62) 33, 45 and 46) on the effect on reference:       householders of revaluation for rates in 1963.C.C. (61) 46thConclusions, The Minister of Housing said that in estimating the revisedMinute 6) burdens which would fall on householders as a result of revaluationValuation for rates in 1963 account had to be taken not only of the increasedfor Rating gross value of their properties but of the increased deduction to bemade from that gross value for repairs and maintenance and, inparticular areas, of changes in rate deficiency grants. It was now clearthat over the country as a whole the burden on householders wouldbe slightly less than under the present rating system; the burden on industry, on the other hand, would be increased by about 43 per cent,overall and in certain areas would rise by over 100 per cent. It was already known that the Federation of British Industries were preparing to mount a campaign to secure some concessions for industry. no power had been taken in the Rating and Revaluation Act, 1961, tode-rate industrial premises; appeals against individual valuations were however permitted and it was to be expected that many firms wouldso appeal. The result of such appeals could affect marginally theburden to be placed on householders in the areas concerned.Although the burden on householders over the country as a whole would not increase, there were ten counties and county boroughswhere the increase was expected to be more than 10 per cent. Thetwo outstanding increases were Bournemouth (27 per cent.) andBlackpool (20 per cent.). De-rating in these ten special cases would,however, have serious disadvantages. First, it would have to apply for the whole of the five-year period irrespective of developments in trade or in industry and this might produce inequity in the longer term. Secondly, the only effect of de-rating householders would be to throw an increased burden elsewhere; in the seaside towns it would fall on boarding houses and hotels, which were already in difficulties;(c) It would be a new departure in policy for the Governmentto take action to check habits which, indulged in to excess, would endanger health. Could such action be limited to smoking?Excessive indulgence in alcohol was similarly dangerous to health.Was it not arguable that in these matters, once the facts were made known, the decision was best left to the judgment of individuals?(d) The present revenue from tobacco amounted to over  800million a year. Any action likely to lead to a sudden and substantial reduction in this figure would need to be considered in its fiscal aswell as in its political and health aspects.(e) It would be desirable for the Minister of Health in dealing withsupplementary Questions in Parliament to indicate that theGovernment were considering urgently the further measures of restriction or control advocated in the report.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Ministers of Health and of Education to makestatements in the terms set out in Annex B of C. (62) 43on the publication of the report of the Royal College ofPhysicians on &quot; Smoking and Health &quot;.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the preparationof a statement to be used by the Minister of Health in answer to supplementary Questions indicating that theGovernment were studying urgently the further measuresof control recommended in the report.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theDepartments concerned to carry out a detailed study ofthe further measures recommended in the report.
in other areas it would fall on industrial firms, which would in anycase be carrying a greatly increased proportion of the rate. Thirdly,once the principle of de-rating had been admitted it would be difficultto resist its extension. There would be pressure from places such asManchester, where the increase was now estimated at only 10 percent., to be included in any measures of de-rating. Moreover definitedecisions would have to be taken to de-rate certain areas before the outcome of appeals by industry could be known. These appealscould well affect the burden on the householders by a factor of 1 percent. It might, therefore, happen that in an area not selected forde-rating householders might in the event be faced with increasesamounting to more than 10 per cent.The Minister of Housing said that he had examined the possibilityof assisting householders in the more difficult areas either throughgeneral grant or through rate deficiency grant but neither course was practicable. He would therefore prefer that no measures of de-ratingshould be applied in any area.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that he was concerned at the degree of political commitment which theGovernment appeared to have accepted to apply de-rating where thecircumstances warranted it. The implication was that de-rating wouldbe applied in order to produced an average result which would be fair to everybody. It could not be argued that increases of over 10 percent, in certain areas constituted a fair average when compared with no increases at all or even small decreases for the country as a whole.It was true that de-rating of householders would put increased burdens on trade and industry; but only in the case of householders did therates fall as a direct burden on the individual; in other cases theyformed part of legitimate business expenses.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that he saw particular difficulty in the proposal to apply de-rating to selected areas only.The original expectation had been that the burden on householderswould increase substantially but that the burden on industry would remain broadly unchanged. It now turned out that the burden onhouseholders would remain broadly unchanged and that very substantial increases would fall on industry. Measures for de-ratingfor householders would greatly increase the difficulty of dealing withdemands from industrial firms, which were likely to be strongly pressed, that special measures of relief should be applied to them.Moreover, once the process of de-rating had started it would bedifficult to bring it under control. The Government would be faced,particularly at the end of each five-year period, with demands forspecial treatment which it might be difficult to resist once the precedenthad been established.In discussion the following further points were made:(a) It appeared from the figures at present available that theburden on shopkeepers would be substantially reduced. This wasmisleading because with the introduction of the new valuations in1963 shopkeepers would lose the special 20 per cent, abatement whichthey were now enjoying.(b) The problem of de-rating in selected areas would be simplifiedif the limit above which de-rating would apply were set at 12-J percent, instead of 10 per cent.(c) It was important to reach and to announce a decision withoutdelay, not only because of the volume of work which would be thrown on the Inland Revenue but to allay the public anxiety which had been caused by speculation in the Press. It would in this context be helpful if the Minister of Housing, in answer to a Parliamentary Question,could say that it was already clear that over the country as\ whole
there would be no material change in the burden falling onhouseholders. Ke should at present avoid implying that theGovernment were considering special measures for de-rating inparticular areas.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Housing to announce inParliament that over the country as a whole there wouldbe no material change in the burden falling onhouseholders.(2) Invited the Minister of Housing to consider the implications of de-rating in counties and county boroughs where theincreased burden on householders was expected to bemore than 124- per cent.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at their next meeting.Farm Price 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the review, Minister of Agriculture (C. (62) 32) about the Farm Price Review1962-63 for 1962.(previous reference: The Minister of Agriculture said that in accordance with theC.C. (62) 11th   views expressed by the Cabinet in their previous discussion he had conclusions,     proposed to the Farmers&apos; Unions that the increase of 0-8d. per gallonMinute 6)       jn trie guaranteed price for milk which had been agreed last year should be withdrawn and that savings of  8 million on other commodities should be secured. The broad effect of these cuts wouldbe to reduce the value of the Governments guarantees to agricultureby about  14 million. The Farmers&apos; Unions had pointed out that theeffect of these proposals would be to cut farm incomes by about  8million as compared with the current year.   They attached greatimportance to the fact that their costs had risen appreciably in thepast year and he felt that, if they were to be reconciled to theconsequences of joining the European Common Market, it would be prudent to modify the Governments proposals.  If the reduction tobe achieved in the Review were set at  11 million rather than  14million, the farmers might refrain from a full-scale attack on theGovernments decisions.  They could not be expected to accept any reduction in the guarantees without protest, but on the basis of areduction of  11 million the protest would be likely to be less violent.Such a reduction could be obtained by withdrawing only half the 0- 8d.per gallon increase in the price of milk. Withdrawal of only half theincrease would be criticised abroad but could be justified on the basis that withdrawal of the whole would be unreasonable at a time whenthe cost of milk production had risen by nearly Id. per gallon.  TheExchequer would still be better off to the extent of the  16 million which had been mentioned in the Cabinets previous discussion,because the burden of increased milk prices would fall on consumersand he was not proposing to alter the decision that the general milksubsidy should be abolished or to abate the savings proposed on other commodities covered by the Review.In discussion it was suggested that, in view of the largeSupplementary Estimate which had recently been presented foragricultural support, there would be public criticism of a review which did not make the maximum permissible reduction inguarantees. On balance, however, the general feeling of the cabinet was that because of the importance of the adjustments called for if wejoined the Common Market some slight concession ought to be madeto the Farmers&apos; Unions, particularly as this could be done without loss to the Treasury. The complaints which would be made on behalfof farmers would help to convince other critics of the Governments
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,6th March, 1962.policies that a reduction of  14 million would have been too stringent.The proposal to raise the standard of eligibility to subsidy for fatstockwould be likely to bring about a reduction in Exchequer payments which would be out of all proportion to the amount of the adjustmentitself. There was a case on social grounds for extending the range ofthe Small Farmer Scheme to cover larger farms, but it would be prudent to hold this adjustment over for consideration in the following year since it seemed likely that this would be one of the forms of adjustment permissible under Common Market arrangements.The Cabinet Decided that in the Farm Price Review for 1962, theGovernment should withhold 0-4d. per gallon of the 0-8d.increase which had been agreed for milk in the previous year&apos;s review and should secure  8 million savings oncommodities other than milk.
