SubjectEuropeCommon Market Negotiations
EuroPe The Lord Privy Seal said that it had always been expected thatCommon the treatment of temperate foodstuffs from Australia, New ZealandMarket and Canada would present the greatest difficulty in the negotiationsNegotiations for the entry of the United Kingdom into the European Economic(Previous Community. In the recent Ministerial meetings in Brussels it had reference: become clear that the Six could not accept the proposals which we hadCC. (62) 48th pUt forward for comparable outlets for these foodstuffs on a conclusions, quantitative basis. For both political and economic reasons the minute 6) French were anxious to avoid quantitative arrangements, and the Sixhad now adopted the thesis that a sound balance between the interestsof exporting and importing countries could be obtained only throughworld-wide commodity arrangements. Such arrangements were notin principle unwelcome to the United Kingdom or to the other commonwealth countries, and in the negotiations much effort hadbeen devoted to examining how far this world-wide approach couldbe adapted to meet Commonwealth requirements. The Six had beenbrought to accept a number of alterations in a document they had prepared setting out principles for world-wide commodity marketingagreements and describing arrangements for an international conference which might be held in 1963 to discuss such agreements.But it had not been possible to obtain from the Six any preciseundertakings about continued access to the Community&apos;s markets fortraditional suppliers, and very little progress had been made in discussion of the complex arrangements for the transitional period before any world-wide agreements could come into effect. For thistransitional period the Six had shown themselves prepared to considera form of continuing preference on those commodities (not includingwheat) which at present enjoyed a preference in the United kingdom market, by allowing imports from the Commonwealth to benefit frompart of the intra-Community preference. (Third countries would not get this concession; Community producers would, of course, get thepreference in full.) We should try to get this extended to cover wheatas well as other commodities.It appeared that the Six were prepared to affirm the intention ofpursuing a reasonable price policy, but on present indications therewas no likelihood that they would commit themselves to more precisedefinitions which would carry conviction in this country or in theCommonwealth. In view of the importance of price policy whichcould be so used as to deny all effective access by Commonwealthproducers to Community markets attempts had been made to persuade the Six to agree that remedial action should be taken if thepolicy of the enlarged Community resulted in damage to the trade oftraditional suppliers, and it had been suggested that no term shouldbe put on these provisions.In the further negotiations, which would start on the following day, it would not be practicable to insist on the indefinite continuanceof remedial measures and it would be reasonable to agree to a termbeing put on them provided that assurances were forthcoming aboutaccess on fair competitive terms. The United Kingdom delegationwould seek to strengthen the transitional arrangements proposed bythe Six and to extend them to cover all the main commodities, andthey would also try to reinforce the principles which it had beensuggested should be the basis of a conference on world-widecommodity agreements. At the moment it was for the Six to respond to the points made in discussion during the previous week, but it seemed unlikely that agreement could be reached within the next fewdays. The Lord Privy Seal said that he would welcome guidance onthe extent to which he should depart from the positions he had so faradopted.In discussion the following points were raised:(a) The negotiations were now being conducted not on the basisof comparable outlets, which had been the subject of consultation with commonwealth countries^ but on a quite different basis world-wide
agreements and transitional arrangements which the Common-wealth Governments concerned had not had any effective opportunityof considering. While this new basis might be acceptable in principle,it appeared (from the rejection by the Six of the reservations whichthe United Kingdom had sought to secure for due regard to be paidto the interests of the Commonwealth and for remedial action) thatany agreement which might emerge within the next few days wouldnot be in terms sufficiently precise to convince opinion in this countryand in the Commonwealth that the vital interests of Commonwealthproducers would be safeguarded. There were signs in a recentmessage from the Prime Minister of Australia that, subject to adequate safeguards, he would be prepared to accept the new basis. But therewould be insufficient time in the next few days for proper consultations with Australia, New Zealand and Canada. It would therefore be expedient to make it the immediate aim to extract from the Six themaximum concessions they could be expected to make and to discussthe situation with the Commonwealth countries before becomingcommitted to a firm agreement.(b) On the other hand, it could be argued that the continuanceof uncertainty was the most damaging factor in the present situation.Bearing in mind that Canadian interests were not very deeply involved,that the Six would probably acknowledge the wholly exceptionalposition of New Zealand, and that it might prove possible to meet theessential requirements of Australia, there was much to be said forreaching an early agreement about temperate foodstuffs. It was thegeneral view of the Cabinet, however, that the terms of any agreement which the Six might be prepared to accept at this stage would be opento effective challenge in Parliament and at the Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers in September.(c) Care had hitherto been taken to avoid seeking a special arrangement for New Zealand, but there might now be advantage in encouraging the Six themselves to put forward proposals to this end.While it was desirable that such an arrangement should eventually besecured, the importance and the hazards of a decision to dealseparately at this stage with one Commonwealth country should berecognised.(d) The basic problem was one of confidence. TheCommonwealth position in the United Kingdom market did not depend on firm agreements so much as on confidence that this positionwould not be damaged needlessly by the United KingdomGovernment. The Six were believed to be sincere in their generalassurances that their price policies would not be so operated as to damage the Commonwealth countries which were in any caseimportant customers for exports from Europe. But there was a great-indeed an almost insuperable-difficulty in translating reasonableexpectations into the language of treaties and protocols. efforts should, however, be made to obtain greater precision than the Six had so far been willing to concede.(e) In the debates which would take place in Parliament on thefollowing day no specific promise should be made about publicationof a White Paper during the recess on the negotiations at large. Itshould be understood that, subject to the way the negotiationsdeveloped, a progress report or reports would be published on thelines of the reports which would have been made to Parliament if ithad been in session.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said he took itto be the general view of the Cabinet that if at all possible a breakdown in the negotiations in Brussels should be avoided. our purpose should be to obtain adequate safeguards on the followingpoints:(i) The operation of the price policy must have due regard to theinterests of those Commonwealth countries which were at presentsubstantial suppliers of temperate foodstuffs to member States.
(ii) Prices should be arranged in such a way as to avoid areduction in consumption or the over-stimulation of production in theCommunity itself; this would have the effect of maintainingreasonable stability in the level of Commonwealth imports.(iii) There should be some clarification and expansion of thepurposes of the proposed International Conference.(iv) The transitional arrangements should be improved.The Six had moved some way to meet us over these safeguards,but not far enough. We could not accept their present proposals andit would be wrong to try to persuade the other commonwealth countries to do so.Our negotiators in Brussels should therefore proceed as follows:If the Six could not be persuaded to make any further move tomeet us, the discussions on this item should be adjourned in the most favourable circumstances possible with the prospect of laterresumption after further reflection on both sides.If the Six accepted our point of view in full, we should say thatin our view the basis of a possible satisfactory agreement had emerged and we hoped that this could be noted by both sides. the six would understand that we could not be more definite than this atthe present time. Given the great importance of the issue and thefact that the arrangements now contemplated derived from a new approach, it was essential that there should be the fullest opportunityfor the United Kingdom Government to discuss the matter further with the other Commonwealth Governments concerned.If the Six moved some but not all the way to meet us, it would bea matter for the delegation^ judgment (and reference to London ifpossible) which of the two foregoing courses should be followed.We should endeavour to press further the idea of a separateprotocol for New Zealand. If possible, the initiative in makingformal proposals for such a protocol should be taken by one of the six and not by ourselves.The Cabinet Agreed that, in the negotiations which would continue in brussels on the following day, the Lord Privy Seal shouldbe guided by the points made by the Prime Minister insumming up the Cabinefs discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.1st August, 1962.
