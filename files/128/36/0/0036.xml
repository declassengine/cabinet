ContentsIncomes Policy
incomes policy(previous reference :C.C. (62) 35thConclusions.Minute 8)The Cabinet resumed their consideration of incomes policy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he doubted whether there was anything to be gained by issue of directions to the nationalised industries. They would distort the Governmentsrelations with the management of the industry or industries selected;they might weaken moderate elements in the trade unions; and theymight jeopardise the work of the National Economic development council. Nor would they increase the Governments influence overthe crucial private sector; they would merely give public expression to the fact that in the last resort the Government already controlledpay in the nationalised industries.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It would help Ministers if they could be provided regularlywith up-to-date statements of wage claims in the nationalised industries.(b) The extension of Government control to pay in the nationalised industries would not necessarily induce private employers to conform to the Governments policies. If the private sectorcontinued in breach of the Governments policy, the result of widerGovernment control would be to multiply the kind of inequity whichhad arisen in the case of nurses, probation officers and others. In the longer term the effect of directions to nationalised industries on paymight be that Ministers would have to assume complete responsibilityfor running those industries.(c) Whatever long-term incomes policy might be formulated, itwould be necessary to establish an early understanding withdraw. Beeching, the Chairman of the British Transport Commission,about the attitude to be adopted to the pay claim which was likely to emerge from union meetings beginning on 14th June. It was possiblethat he would welcome a public instruction from the government about the limit to which he should go in negotiations. This point should be explored with him as soon as possible and his own viewson a settlement should be obtained.(d) If a settlement on railwaymen&apos;s wages could not be reached on an acceptable basis, it would be necessary for the Government to face the consequences of a strike. An over-generous settlement asthe direct result of a strike would be disastrous. Special attention should therefore be given by the Official Committee on Emergenciesto means of maintaining supplies and services and the movement ofgoods; and arrangements to deal with a railway strike and its possiblespread to other sectors of industry should be thoroughly overhauled.The Cabinet then considered measures which might be taken toestablish control over pay in the private sector.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Economic PolicyCommittee had considered the sanctions which might be applied to particular industries or firms which had acted in breach of theGovernments policy. Discriminatory taxation was one possibility.By using the second regulator, on employment, it would be possibleto penalise a particular firm and to withdraw from circulation theamount of money by which the increases granted had exceeded whatseemed proper. Price controls could also be used on a selective basis;or tariff adjustments might be made which would expose offendingindustries or firms to greater competition.In discussion of these possibilities there was general agreement that adjudication on the formidable range of issues which would beraised by discriminatory action would present the Government withan almost impossible task. Tariff adjustments would be a bluntinstrument, which would operate unfairly and would produce no effecton industries not affected by imports.   It was suggested, however,
that the unfairness of this sanction should not be regarded asconclusive against it. The threat to use it. and the actual use of it ina few selected cases, could be a powerful deterrent. There would beacute political difficulties about the regulation of prices but there might be scope for the establishment of a tribunal to examine excessiveprofits and for action to relate tariffs to price increases.The following further points were also made:(e) One danger about the use of sanctions of the sort discussedwas that the penalties might be passed on to consumers in increased prices. It was noted that the effect of imposing tax penalties wouldbe to double the burden carried by the industries or firms penalised,since they would pay the penalty on top of the wage increase whichoccasioned it.(/) Care would have to be taken to avoid making the economymore rigid by discouraging the movement of labour from one industryto another. New industries deserving encouragement could normallysecure their labour only by attracting it from other industries by offers of higher pay.(g) The possibility of legislating for the control of strikes mightbe further examined, and useful lessons might be derived from thearrangements in the United States for imposing delays and requiringsecret ballots before strike action could be taken. It was noted,however, that in those industries in this country in which secret ballotrequirements applied the effect had been that the strikes whichcontinued to take place were unofficial instead of official.(h) Some Ministers felt that the problem facing the Governmentwas largely one of convincing public opinion of the success so farachieved and persuading the public, and especially employers (who,in their representative bodies, had been co-operative) of theimportance of restraint in the general interest. No useful progress would be made without the consent of both sides of industry, and itwould be imprudent to jeopardise by the use of compulsory powers the results already obtained.The Prime Minister, in concluding the discussion, said that itmight be necessary to accept that a free society and a controlledeconomy were incompatible. If this were so and if economic growthwas to be maintained, there might be no alternative to a measure of inflation. Internally this would produce grave inequities, particularly for those living on fixed incomes, but in relation to other countries theimportant consideration was that this country should not lead aninflationary movement. There were indications that in this latterrespect the Governments policy had had considerable success. Hewould consider the points which had been raised in the cabinets discussion and would discuss at a further meeting the steps which hethought it might now be appropriate to take.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for circulation of regular statements of wage claims whichwere pending in the nationalised industries.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Ministers concerned, to ascertain and report theattitude of the Chairman of the British transport commission to the claim likely to be made for an increasein railwaymenS wages and to the possibility of a direction to him to submit any proposed increase to the Minister ofTransport for approval.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion of incomes policy at anearly meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,25th May, 1962.
