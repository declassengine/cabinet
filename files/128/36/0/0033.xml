Aid toOverseasCountriesEgypt(previous reference:C.C. (62) 32ndConclusions,Minute 4)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (62) 74) on the grant of economic aid to Egypt.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Egyptian economy was likely to be in deficit to the extent of $60 or $70 million in 1962.The Egyptian Government professed to be anxious to reduce theirdependence on the Soviet bloc and were seeking to negotiate loans from the West. The United States Government had already agreedto make a loan of $20 million and to lend up to a further $10 million to match any loans by other Governments in excess of $20 million.The Egyptian Government were hoping to secure loans amountingin all to another $60 or $70 million from the United Kingdom,Germany and Italy. Our own position was complicated byoutstanding difficulties under the Anglo-Egyptian financial agreement.The Egyptian Government had not completed the de-sequestrationof British property in Egypt and even on properties which had alreadybeen dealt with had failed to fulfil their obligation to allow sterlingtransfers up to  5,000 per head in respect of the assets in Egypt ofUnited Kingdom nationals. It was estimated that outstanding claims under the financial agreement might amount to some $8 million.It would be politically impossible to make a loan to Egypt unless wehad either secured a settlement of these outstanding claims in advanceor made their settlement a first charge on the loan. This would mean in practice that of a loan of $10 million only $2 million could beregarded as free aid and even that would be tied to the purchase ofBritish goods.There were two other factors to be taken into account. First,a loan which merely enabled the Egyptian Government to clearoutstanding claims would not be without its value to them.   TheC.C. 33 (62)Laos 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that Pathet Lao forces, after(Previous       routing the Royal troops at Nam Tha, had advanced to within 30Reference:      miles of the frontier of Thailand.   If they chose to exploit this c.C. (62) 32nd  situation, they could over-run northern Laos and threaten the securityConclusions,    0f Thailand.  The United States Government had therefore decidedMinute 2)       that the forces which they already had in Thailand should be movedforward to the Mekong River and reinforced by Marines from the seventh Fleet.   They had taken this unilateral action, in agreementwith the Government of Thailand, with the deliberate purpose of avoiding an appeal for multilateral intervention in Laos by theSouth-East Asia Treaty Organisation.  They had no present intentionof sending troops into Laos. In parallel with these military movementsthey had intensified their diplomatic pressure for the formation of anational Government in Laos.  As a result Prince Souvanna Phoumahad indicated his intention to return to Laos from Paris; and it wasalso understood that General Phoumi was now willing to agree thatin a national Government the portfolios of defence and internal affairs should be held by Ministers of moderate political views. Thus,there was still some hope that the situation in Laos might be resolved by peaceful means.The Prime Minister said that it was important that the australian government should be kept fully informed of the nature and purposeof these American initiatives.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement and invited him to arrange for the Australian High Commissioner inLondon to be informed of these developments.
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (I.B.R.D.)had indicated that they would be prepared to consider setting up a consortium for long-term aid to the Egyptian economy, but had made it a prior condition that the Egyptian Government should first have honoured their international obligations. A settlement oftheir outstanding claims would therefore be of direct help to themin getting this consortium established. Secondly, free aid by theUnited Kingdom at the present stage, even though limited in amount,would be of help to the Egyptian Government in persuading theGerman and Italian Governments to follow suit. On the other hand,if any aid were given to Egypt it would be difficult to reject claims from Turkey, Iran and probably Greece, although it was likely thatwe should have to give some aid to those countries in any event.The Foreign Secretary said that the grant of economic aid to egypt might prove to be a turning point in Anglo-Egyptian relations.He believed that the Egyptians were genuinely anxious to reduce theirdependence on the Soviet bloc. He hoped that a loan of the orderof $ 12 million could be made; for, on the assumption that $8 million would be applied towards the payment of United Kingdom claims,this would leave $4 million as free aid. A loan of $10 million would leave only $2 million as free aid and this could hardly be represented as a generous gesture to Egypt in her present difficulties.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It would be unfortunate if the grant of aid to Egypt had theeffect of reducing the amounts available for Commonwealth countries,who had a greater claim on our available resources. It v/ould,however, be unrealistic to impart too much rigidity into the collationof our aid programmes. Each case had to be dealt with on its merits and the Commonwealth countries were already absorbing a very largeshare of the total.(b) There was a risk that the Egyptian economy might continueto decline unless the Egyptian Government were prepared to change the whole basis of their present planning, particularly in the defencefield and the purchase of arms. The provision of economic aid mightmerely encourage them in their present course and we should thenbe faced with demands for further loans later. As against this itcould be argued that most of the present troubles of the egyptian government stemmed from the failure of the cotton crop in 1961.They had already accepted the need for drastic measures to redressthe balance of Egypt&apos;s economy: many of these had been proposedby the International Fund as conditions of aid from the Fund.(c) The professions of greater goodwill towards us which theEgyptian Government were now making were not matched by their actions. A constant stream of anti-British propaganda was still being put out on Cairo Radio, and they were spending large sums of money in subventions to extreme nationalist and anti-colonial leaders and movements in Africa and the Middle East. If their professions ofgood intent were genuine, it would be not unreasonable to ask forsome earnest of those intentions, e.g., by a cessation of anti-british propaganda, before any loan was granted.(d) There would be advantages in restricting the amount of theloan to $8 million. This would avert the danger that outstandingUnited Kingdom claims on Egypt would once again become a livepolitical issue; it would have advantages to Egypt in respect of theInternational Bank; and it would be less likely than a larger loan to stimulate demands from other countries. There could be noquestion of any loan being granted at concessionary rates of interest.(e) It was difficult to see why the Egyptian Government shouldattach so much importance to a Government loan which would be tied to the purchase of British goods, since they had already negotiateda commercial line of credit of  20 million which had hardly been used.   The most probable explanation was either that they had
CC. 33 (62)refrained from using the commercial credit in the hope of gettingbetter interest rates out of the Government or that they attachedparticular importance to a loan from the Government in the hopeof using it as a lever with which to extract loans from otherGovernments. It would at some stage be necessary to determine whether the United States Government would regard a loan of S8million as qualifying towards the $20 million above which they had undertaken to make a further loan on a dollar-for-dollar basis.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that thegeneral sense of the Cabinet seemed to be in favour of making a loan to the Egyptian Government of at least $8 million which wouldbe used to settle outstanding United Kingdom claims. the presentation of such a decision would need to be carefully considered.It would be necessary to make it clear to public opinion in this country that the loan had been made conditional on a settlement of claims,but at the same time it would be necessary to avoid giving offence to public opinion in Egypt since one of the main objects of making a loan was to improve Anglo-Egyptian relations. So far as concerned the provision of aid over and above $8 million, it would be necessaryto discuss with the Egyptian Government what we might look tothem to provide in return; we should clearly be the more inclined tomake extra aid available if the tone of their propaganda improved and if in other ways they adopted a more helpful attitude. here again the method and manner of presentation to the egyptian government would need further study.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the foreign secretary to consider in the light of their discussion theform of the instructions which might now be sent to her majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo and to make a further reportto the Cabinet.3. The Cabinet were informed of the circumstances in whichthe port employers had settled the wage claim by the dockers andhad thus averted the national dock strike which would otherwise have begun at midnight on 13th May.Until mid-day on 12th May, when the Government had decided not to propose the appointment of a Court of Inquiry and to movetroops into dock areas on 14th May, the information available to ministers was that the port employers were prepared, contrary totheir earlier intention, to concede an increase of Is. per day to dockerspaid on time rates and also to concede with effect, from 1st January,1963, a reduction in working hours from 44 to 42 hours per week.In private discussions with union representatives, the employers had indicated that they mght advance their offer on pay to Is. 2d. per day, but this suggestion had not in fact been put to the delegate conference of union representatives which had met on 11th May.The conference had been asked to agree to a postponement of thestrike for seven days but had rejected the suggestion. During thelatter part of 12th May, however, the employers, after being repeatedlywarned that a settlement even on the basis of an increase of Is. per day would not be in accord with the Governments incomes policy,had indicated their intention of offering Is. 4d. per day and bringing forward the effective date for a reduction in hours to 1st October.In his references to the Governments incomes policy the Ministerof Labour, with the authority of the Prime Minister, had been moreexplicit than the Cabinets discussion on 10th May would havewarranted.   In the event, talks between the employers and union
4. In the light of the discussion recorded in the preceding minute the Cabinet reviewed the position of the governments incomes policy.The Cabinet recognised that the action taken by the port employers would be a further blow to this policy. Restraint hadbeen exercised over pay increases in the public services in the hopethat employers in private industry would follow this example, buta sharp contrast was now emerging between the strict control overremuneration in the public sector and the Governments inability to restrain wage increases in private industry. The debate inParliament on the previous day on the pay of nurses had shownthat many Government supporters were disturbed by this contrast,and the Governments policy would be likely to be further underminedunless early steps could be taken both to formulate means of providingfor a new evaluation of the pay appropriate to various public serviceand professional employments and also to secure more effective control over pay settlements in private industry. There was no doubtthat the incomes policy adopted in July 1961 and developed in theWhite Paper on Incomes Policy published in February 1962(Cmnd. 1626) had been broadly successful in its main aim of preparing a base for economic expansion and improving the competitive powerof the national economy in relation to other countries. But thepolicy had not carried sufficient conviction with the public at large and in particular with employers in private industry. There had beena general failure to understand that substantial increases in pay couldbe given to deserving groups of work-people only if there weresafeguards to prevent other groups from pressing consequentialclaims; and employers had not grasped the vital importance ofsecuring a sound base for expanding the rate of growth in the economy.In summing up the discussion the Prime Minister reminded theCabinet of the difficulty of operating an effective incomes policy in a free society. In seeking solutions to the problem, it should be kept in mind that the reasons why employers did not follow theGovernments advice varied from industry to industry. In some industries the consequences of a stoppage could be so disastrousthat employers were under strong pressure to concede the wage increases necessary to avert it; in other industries this situationvaried from firm to firm; on other occasions wage increases had beenconceded through unskilful handling of negotiations. It would be useful to have a statement showing the wage settlements made since junly 1961 and an estimate of the extent to which wages would have risen if the Governments incomes policy had not been introduced.It would also be useful if a comparison could be made of the movementof wages and prices, and the progress of inflation, in the UnitedKingdom and in other countries in Western Europe during this period.It would also be important to examine the implications for incomes policy of the assumption recently made by the National EconomicIncomesPolicy(previous reference:C.C. (62) 32ndConclusions,Minute 6)representatives which took place late on Saturday in the Ministry ofLabour building (though without the participation of the Minister or his advisers) had resulted in the withdrawal of strike notices on thebasis of a Is. 6d. per day increase in pay and a reduction in hours to42 per week with effect from 27th August. In their announcementthe employers had made it clear that this settlement could not beregarded as falling within the scope of the incomes policy but hadjustified it on the basis of special circumstances in the dock industry.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.
ResalePriceMaintenance(previous reference:C.C. (60) 13thConclusions,Minute 5)5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the lord president (C. (62) 62) and the President of the Board of Trade(C. (62) 61) on the action to be taken by the Government in thelight of the report of an inquiry by the Board of Trade into resale price maintenance.The Lord President said that discussion in the Economic PolicyCommittee had disclosed differences of view on this question. Onthe whole there had been support for the conclusion that the economic arguments for prohibiting resale price maintenance were strong, butopinions had been divided on the question whether the Governmentshould announce their intention to introduce legislation in due course to abolish it. He did not wish to express a personal view on the merits of the economic argument, but he desired to make the legal position plain to the Cabinet. By Section 25 of the Restrictive trade practices Act, 1956, the Government had extended the protection given by the law to resale price maintenance. Before the passing ofthat Act contracts of sale had been enforceable only between theoriginal parties to the contract; the Act of 1956 had made it possibleto enforce such contracts in respect of third parties. What was nowproposed was not merely to remove the right of enforcement onthird parties, but to make it impossible to enforce as between theoriginal parties those parts of a contract which related to resale price maintenance. This might be criticised as involving a completechange of policy in a comparatively short period of time.The President of the Board of Trade said that he had found himself unable to recommend any compromise between the total abolition of resale price maintenance and a continuation of present arrangements. For the reasons given in his memorandum any provisionfor exemptions from a general rule prohibiting resale price maintenance would increase the complexity of the legislation required,would sharpen controversy and would lead to constant pressure force.C. 33 (62)Development Council that 4 per cent, per annum should be the rateof growth in the gross domestic product to be adopted in the Councilsstudy of the economy.The Prime Minister said that on the following day the economic policy Committee would be considering proposals for a new methodof evaluating employments in which increases appeared to be called for at levels above those implied in the White Paper on incomes policy. The Cabinefs discussion should be resumed as soon aspossible after that meeting and the work which was already in handby officials in preparation for the next phase of the incomes policy should be pressed forward urgently.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Labour to circulate a paper setting out the significant facts in the evolution of incomes policy since July 1961, together with an estimate of what thewages and prices situation would have been in the absenceof that policy; and to inform them of the wage and price levels obtaining in other countries in Western Europe.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate a paper on the effect upon incomes policy of the assumptionrecently made by the National Economic development council about a rate of growth in the gross domestic product of 4 per cent, per annum.(3) Agreed to resume their consideration of incomes policy inthe light of the discussion to be held by the economic policy Committee on the following day.
the extension of the range of exemptions. He had formed the viewthat political opinion in the country, particularly among the youngergeneration, was opposed to resale price maintenance in its present form. There would of course be strong opposition from smallshopkeepers, but the public in general regarded resale price maintenance as a device to keep prices high and to support business interests against the interests of the consumer.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The economic case for the abolition of resale price maintenance had not been accepted by all Ministers: it could be argued that its abolition would lead to a decline in quality and in standards of service as well as being unfair to the small trader.(b) It was unlikely that room could be found for legislation onthis subject in next year&apos;s programme; and it would be politicallydamaging to announce an intention to legislate far in advance of theintroduction of a Bill. This would give time for commercial oppositionto organise and mount a campaign against the Government, while those who might be expected to welcome the legislation would be unlikely to support the Government until the legislation had actually been enacted and its benefits had made themselves felt.(c) It might be better to confine action for the time being to the repeal of Section 25 of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1956.This might perhaps be done as part of some larger measure affectingthe Board of Trade.(d) In.view of the impossibility of promoting early legislation,the difficulty of timing which this would cause, and the continuingdifference of view between Ministers about the economic advantages of abolition, it might be preferable to postpone a decision. It would,however, be necessary for the President of the Board of Trade to make an early announcement about the Governments views on the reportof the recent inquiry. The terms of this announcement could best beconsidered by the Economic Policy Committee.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theEconomic Policy Committee to consider further, in the lightof their discussion, the terms of an announcement of theGovernments attitude towards the report of the inquiry into resale price maintenance.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (C. (62) 67)by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary, Treasury,on the project for a National Theatre.This memorandum explained that the Arts Council had advisedCMcmsionT&quot;   the Government to accept the scheme put forward by the Joint CouncilMinute 6)       and to arrange for it to be put into effect.  The first steps would bethe appointment of a National Theatre Board and of a separateSouth Bank Theatre Board to supervise the building of the national theatre and the new Opera House on the South Bank.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C.
