The Foreign Secretary said that the Soviet Government hadBerlin declared their willingness to defer discussions on the future status of(Previous Berlin until after the Congressional Elections in the United States.Reference: This suggested that they were still reluctant to conclude a separateCC. (62) 55th treaty of peace with East Germany.   The Foreign Secretary hopedConclusions, that during the General Assembly of the United Nations he would minute 4) be able to have further talks with the United States Secretary of Stateand the Soviet Foreign Minister.Owing to difficulty in controlling crowds and preventing are currence of incidents when the Soviet War Memorial guard used the crossing-point in the Friedrichstrasse, the Western Commandantshad arranged for the guard to use instead the Sandkruk Bridge, whichwas in the British sector and much closer to the War Memorial.During the few days since this route had been in use the soviet authorities had sent in the guard in armoured vehicles and theCommandants feared that if this practice, which was forbidden(except under escort) by quadripartite regulations, were permitted tocontinue it would be the prelude to excursions by Russian armouredvehicles into other parts of the city. They had therefore, after duewarning to the commander of the guard, informed the commander of Soviet troops that if the next relief of the guard on 15th Septemberarrived in an armoured vehicle it would not be allowed to proceed.In discussion it was suggested that it was reasonable that theRussian soldiers should travel to the War Memorial in an armouredvehicle to protect themselves against stoning; and it might be prudent to wait and see whether any attempt was made to extend the use ofsuch vehicles before taking preventive action. It was, however, thegeneral view of the Cabinet that, in the light of past experience of soviet tactics and the provocation to the people of West Berlin whichwould result from any extension of the practice, it would on the wholebe preferable to enforce the regulations from the outset. It waspossible that the vehicles used on 15th September would, in fact,conform with the requirements laid down by the Commandants.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.1. The Foreign Secretary said that the United Nationsproposals for securing a political settlement in the Congo, which hadbeen drawn up in agreement with the Governments of the UnitedStates, the United Kingdom and Belgium and with the acquiescenceof the French Government, had now been accepted in general termsby Mr. Tshombe, the Prime Minister of Katanga, and by Mr. Adoula,the Prime Minister of the Central Government of the Congo. Theplan was essentially reasonable and there was a fair prospect that itwould bring about a reconciliation between the Central Governmentand the provincial governments, including Katanga. But there was some risk that incidents due to mishandling by local representativesof the United Nations would provide Mr. Tshombe with furthergrounds for delay. On the previous day a clash between his forces and Indian troops at a road block had led him to claim that it wasthe object of the United Nations to destroy Katanga.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.
3. The First Secretary of State made a report to the Cabinet onthe course of the discussions at the Meeting of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters on the question of the United kingdom&apos;s joining theEuropean Economic Community.The general attitude of other Commonwealth Governments had,so far, been more critical than had been expected. It was natural that they should be preoccupied with the economic effects on theirown countries of the United Kingdom&apos;s membership of theCommunity, and that they should be more concerned with theconsequences in the short term than with the advantages which theymight ultimately derive from the resulting increase in the economic strength of the United Kingdom. What was more surprising was their failure to recognise the political disadvantages which were likelyto follow, both for ourselves and for the rest of the Commonwealth,if we remained outside the Community. There was also a widespreadapprehension that, if we joined the Community, our links with theCommonwealth would be seriously weakened. It was feared that theCommunity would develop into a close political federation; and thePrime Minister of Australia, in an analysis of the history of earlierfederations, had argued that, if federations were not to disintegrate,their central authority was bound to grow. The Prime Minister ofIndia had also suggested that the emergence of a strong european community might increase tension between East and West. Theneeds of developing countries had been another recurring theme inthe discussion: strong emphasis had been laid on the importance of finding outlets for the products of the manufacturing industries whichwere being established in those countries. It was mainly on this ground that the Nigerian Government had declined to contemplateassociation with an enlarged European Community: they realised that the Asian countries of the Commonwealth had not been offeredassociation partly because they were already exporters of manufactured goods, and they feared that, if Nigeria accepted thestatus of an associated territory, she would lose it as soon as herindustrial capacity began to be developed. Ghana, and some of theother African countries, were unwilling for political reasons to acceptthe status of an associated territory: they were not prepared to enterinto any kind of political association with the countries of Europe.Each of the Commonwealth Governments had stated their views in a general debate. More detailed consideration was now being given to particular aspects of the subject in separate groups of thecountries specially concerned with each aspect. In the discussion onassociation it was difficult to see what progress could be made, though some of the smaller Commonwealth countries recognised theadvantages of this status and were prepared to accept it. The asian countries might perhaps be brought to accept the arrangementsworked out in the Brussels negotiations, especially if an assurance could be obtained that trade agreements between the Community andthose countries would be concluded at an early date. On temperatefoodstuffs, nothing could be done for Canada, who had in reality verylittle to fear. It would be some comfort to Australia if an assurance could be obtained that an early attempt would be made to conclude a world agreement (or, failing that, a limited agreement) on wheat.For New Zealand, it was clear, some special arrangements wouldhave to be made covering, at least, butter and cheese.The prospects for an acceptable outcome of the Meeting werenot good. After the end of the group discussions which were now proceeding, the aim of the United Kingdom Government would beto secure agreement on a number of general statements of intention,e.g., in relation to world commodity agreements and assistance forless developed countries; and to combine these with an undertaking to seek somewhat better terms on certain points when the negotiationswith the Community were resumed in October. It would be inexpedient to contemplate any further meeting of representatives ofall Commonwealth Governments at a later stage in those negotiations;
but it might be necessary to hold further personal consultations withsenior Ministers of some of the other Commonwealth countries before final decisions were taken.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It would be helpful if the enlarged European economic community could give some small preference to manufactured goods from less developed countries. Similarly, in relation to the asian countries of the Commonwealth, it would be helpful if the impositionof the common tariff could be delayed until the trade agreements hadbeen concluded.(b) In the discussions so far other Commonwealth governments had not taken sufficient account of the fact that the european community was already in existence and that its strength wouldgrow. In considering the impact on their own economy they were atpresent inclined to compare what they had now with what they might expect if the United Kingdom joined the Community. the comparison which they should be making was between what theymight expect if we joined the Community and the position in whichthey would find themselves in 1970 if we remained outside it. Theother Commonwealth Governments would bear a heavy responsibilityif, by their public statements at this stage, they made it impossible forthe United Kingdom to join the Community.(c) The weight of public opinion against joining the Communitywas continuing to grow. This swing in opinion would be acceleratedby the accounts published in the Press of the views expressed by other commonwealth Governments at this Meeting. Confidence in theGovernments policy was being eroded by the delay and the consequent appearance of indecision. The Government had been seriously handicapped by the fact that, while the negotiations v/erestill proceeding, they were precluded from stating their full case.(d) For these reasons it was suggested that, soon after the end ofthe Commonwealth Meeting, the Government should announce their determination to join the Community. This would help to rallysupport throughout the country. As against this it was pointed outthat, once such an announcement was made, it would be more difficultto secure further concessions in negotiations with the Six. In any event it would be impossible for the Government to take such adecision until they were satisfied that special arrangements could bemade to protect the economic interests of New Zealand. It was,however, the general feeling of the Cabinet that, after theCommonwealth Meeting, further steps would have to be taken topresent more clearly to the public the case for joining the Community,and the political and economic disadvantages of remaining outside it,even at the cost of some risk to our negotiating position in Brussels.(e) It should be borne in mind that, on many of the commodities which were of special concern to the older Commonwealth countries and to United Kingdom agriculture, no conclusions had yet beenreached in the Brussels negotiations. Until it was known what arrangements could be made for these commodities, it would in any event be impossible for the Government to decide finally whether theterms were such as to warrant a decision to join the Community.(/) There was general agreement that it would be inexpedient togive any public encouragement to the idea that a further full Meetingof Commonwealth Prime Ministers would be held at a later stage inthe negotiations with the Community.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statement by the First Secretary of Stateand of the points raised in the discussion.(2) Took note that the Cabinet might need to hold a further discussion on this subject before the end of theCommonwealth Meeting.
4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that during thefollowing week he would be taking part in discussions in Washingtonunder the auspices of the International Bank and the international monetary Fund. In the Bank discussions he would be mainly concerned to secure that the continuance of the United Kingdom&apos;contribution to the International Development Association should be accompanied by an increase in contributions from certain other member countries. The Fund&apos;s discussions would cover both the short-term and long-term problems of liquidity. In the short term the recent improvement in the position of the United States dollarwould be a stabilising influence, but attention would have to be givento the danger that deflationary forces might bring about a contractionin world trade. The long-term problems for the United Kingdomarose from the gold exchange system and the use of sterling as areserve currency. Examination of these matters would be particularlydelicate because of the attitude of some Governments and central banks and because of the effect upon markets of statements made inthe Washington discussions. The main object would be, not topropound solutions, but to get the consideration of the problemproperly started.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that representatives ofthe railway unions were that day meeting Dr. Beeching, the Chairmanof the British Transport Commission, to discuss claims for increasedpay which had been presented in general terms in June 1962.Dr. Beeching would have to reply about the middle of October.When the railwaymen had been granted an increase of 3 per cent(from 1st April, 1962), their unions had been told that it would beopen to them to start discussions with Dr. Beeching again later in1962, by which time it would be possible to see how the railways hadfared and what improvement had taken place in the general economicsituation. The unions were now expecting a further increase, andthe Wages Committee considered that some increase was inevitable.Dr. Beeching wanted authority to offer 6 per cent; and he was disposed to offer the full amount at the outset and to refuse tonegotiate on it. Flis main concern was to facilitate the reorganisation of the railways, and to this extent his proposals must command somesympathy; but most members of the Wages Committee had felt thatan increase of 6 per cent following upon one of 3 per cent was too much; and they thought that if 6 per cent were the initial offer therewould be no chance of avoiding ultimate settlement at an even higher figure. The general view had been that an initial offer of 3 per centmight be reasonable, but there had been a difference of opinion onthe question whether it should be allowed to rise in negotiation to4 per cent or to some higher figure. Anything less than an initialoffer of 6 per cent would not, however, be readily accepted byDr. Beeching and might have to be imposed. Further discussions would have to be held with him in good time before his reply to theunions was due.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The Minister of Transport said that substantial relief to theExchequer would be obtained if the reorganisation of the railways were carried through and the plans were implemented for reducingthe number of employees in railway workshops by 20,000 and on therailways themselves by some 100,000-150,000. Care should,moreover, be taken to avoid undue interference with the manner inwhich Dr. Beeching carried on the negotiations.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1.13th September, 1962.(b) Although the Chairman of the Transport Commission was responsible for the conduct of its affairs, including pay negotiations,the whole of the proposed pay increase would have to be found bythe Exchequer. A 6 per cent increase would cost over  21 million and the Government would be criticised for adding so considerably to the burden on public funds for the purpose of enabling a particulargroup of employees to receive an aggregate increase of 9 per centwithin the space of 12 months.(c) Dr. Beeching&apos;s proposals rested on arguments of com-parability, and it was one of the objectives of Government policy that less weight should be given to such arguments.(d) The first repercussions from an increase in railwaymen&apos;swages would be felt in the railway workshops, and thence in theengineering industry. The engineers had recently received a 3 percent increase after long negotiations. The Government would be held to be giving an irresponsible lead to the private sector if they were nowto acquiesce in an increase as large as 6 per cent from public funds.(e) There was no advantage in seeking to postpone the date ofimplementation of an increase until 1963; the prospect of animmediate increase might tend to reconcile the unions to a smalleramount.(/) An increase in pay might have the effect of increasingseverance pay also. It would be an advantage if the amounts of anywage increases and of redundancy payments could be negotiatedtogether. The Government might well say that the plannedredundancies had been a decisive factor in their assessment of the payclaim.Summing up the discussion, the First Secretary of State said that dr. Beeching should be invited to promise the railway unions his replyto their claim at a meeting not earlier than the week beginning15th October. The Wages Committee should meanwhile continue their consideration of the terms on which a settlement should besought.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theWages Committee to consider further, in the light of their discussion, the terms on which a settlement of the railwaymen&apos;s pay claims should be sought.
