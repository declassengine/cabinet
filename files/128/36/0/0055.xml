EuropeCommonMarketNegotiations:CommonwealthImplications(previous reference:CC. (62) 53rdConclusions,Minute 1)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theLord Privy Seal (subsequently circulated as C. (62) 136) reviewing thestate of the negotiations on the United Kingdom&apos;s application to join the European Economic Community and setting out the main questions for consideration at the forthcoming Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers.The First Secretary of State said that the Common MarketNegotiations Committee had discussed this memorandum at their meeting on 20th August and endorsed its conclusions. For the african and Asian members of the Commonwealth it had beenpossible to negotiate arrangements which would enable us to claim that we had fully discharged our obligation to see that their essential interests were safeguarded. For manufactured goods from the developed countries of the Commonwealth arrangements had been worked out which were as favourable as could be expected. Thenegotiations on raw materials had still to be completed, and it seemed possible that for lead and zinc we might only get duty quotas and foraluminium a small reduction in the common external tariff.Similarly, on processed agricultural foodstuffs, we might have to settlefor delayed application of the common external tariff together withduty quotas and tariff reductions for the more important items. Theproblems presented by the raw materials and the processedagricultural products were practical ones on which we should haveto negotiate the best terms possible.The central problem was, however, the treatment of temperateagricultural products from the older Commonwealth countries. Thiswould turn mainly on the price policy to be adopted by the enlarged community. The Six had been brought to state their intention ofpursuing a price policy which would offer reasonable opportunities for imports of temperate foodstuffs with a special reference to commonwealth suppliers. This, together with the assurances aboutworld-wide agreements and about more limited agreements whereworld-wide agreements were not negotiable, was what we had to offerCanada, Australia and New Zealand as the long-term solution, and itwas clear that the Six were not going to agree to any substantial changes in these proposals. The Common Market NegotiationsCommittee had considered the possibility of negotiating separatearrangements for New Zealand and had agreed that we should, inthe first place, attempt to turn the Six&apos;s recognition of New Zealand&apos;special position to advantage in obtaining better general arrangementsfor temperate foodstuffs and leave to a later stage the possibility ofsecuring additional safeguards confined to New Zealand. Theattitude adopted by the Prime Ministers of Australia and NewZealand would be all-important to the success of the commonwealth meeting; and it was to be hoped that they would be able to agreethat the arrangements which now seemed likely to emerge fromthe Brussels negotiations represented a fair settlement. TheCommonwealth Prime Ministers should be urged to view their particular problems against the background of the strong economicand political arguments in favour of our joining the european economic Community.The Lord Privy Seal made a full report on the Ministerial sessionof the Brussels negotiations which had adjourned on the morning of sunday, 5th August.In discussion the following points were made on the various sections of the memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal:Association(a) The question whether the Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland should be associated as an independent country or adependent territory had been left open.   If neither of these forms
of association proved practicable, a Morocco-type protocol shouldbe negotiable, although the Government of the Federation were atpresent disinclined to consider this possibility. It would be preferable to avoid any formal discussion of this question at the forthcoming meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers: the position should be explored further in private talks with the Federal Prime Minister.(b) Some of the Commonwealth countries concerned had already indicated their intention of accepting association. No special pressureshould be applied to induce the others to make up their minds duringthe Commonwealth Meeting. It could be shown that they wouldbe better off economically if they accepted association, but we shouldnot risk the expression of differences which would follow if some ofthem were brought to declare that, for political reasons, they were unable to accept this status. The fact that the institutionalarrangements had not yet been settled was a sufficient reason for notpressing them to reach final decisions at this stage.India, Pakistan and Ceylon(c) In the Brussels negotiations we had obtained substantialbenefits for these countries both in the short and the long term. the indians had asked that tariffs should not be imposed pending the comprehensive trade agreements which the enlarged Community had undertaken to negotiate; and both they and the Pakistanis seemedto be under-estimating what we had been able to secure. It wasuntrue that more attention had been paid in the negotiations to theinterests of the older Commonwealth countries: in fact, the remedial action secured for the Asian members and the rate at which thecommon external tariff would be applied to them were on morefavourable terms than we had been able to obtain for the developed countries of the Commonwealth. Moreover, the nil tariff on teagave the Asian members a valuable opportunity to expand their sales to the enlarged Community, in addition to its protection of theirmarket in the United Kingdom.Temperate agricultural products(d) The Lord Privy Seal said that in his opening statement in thenegotiations he had used the expression &quot; the opportunity of comparable outlets&quot; without defining it further. We had laterdefined it as meaning access without quantitative restrictions up totraditional quantities on fair terms of competition. At first we had said that the traditional quantities should be based on Commonwealthexports to the Community as a whole, although we had not expectedthis to be accepted. The Brussels conference paper which had emerged from the Ministerial meeting on 5th August provided thatthere would be no quantitative restrictions, except in the event ofdisruption of the market, not only in the United Kingdom but alsoin the whole of the Community: and to this extent it was animprovement on the comparable outlets concept. The terms of competition were more difficult to assess. We had, however, secured the advantage of the intra-Community preference, although on areducing basis, for commodities where Commonwealth countriesenjoyed a preference in the United Kingdom, and provision forremedial action if the application of the intra-Community preferencewere to cause a sudden decline in Commonwealth trade. We had also obtained, through the declaration on price policy, an undertakingabout reasonable opportunities, not only in the United kingdom market but in the Community as a whole and not limited in time.The importance of this could be seen when considering the level of present Commonwealth exports of temperate foodstuffs to theCommunity: for example, Canada at present exported  70-1 million of cereals to the United Kingdom and  42-6 million to theCommunity; and the corresponding figures for Australia were 19-5 million to the United Kingdom and  19-4 million to theCommunity.
Europe 2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommon Minister of Agriculture (subsequently circulated as C.

Similarly, &quot; reasonable&quot; in the undertakings about a &quot; reasonable price policy &quot; and &quot; reasonableopportunities &quot; in its markets for exports meant more in French thanin English.(g) The provisions of the conference text on temperate foodstuffswere complicated, difficult to understand and difficult to present to public opinion, which would be more interested in knowing whetherthey appeared acceptable, or at least tolerable, to Australia andNew Zealand.(h) The Six had not worked out their idea of a special arrangement for New Zealand and the French had even been reluctant to see it put forward. We should certainly try to take advantageof this move to get the best possible general solution for temperateagricultural products and then to obtain something extra for NewZealand, possibly on the lines of better and prompter remedial measures.(/) The arrangements for butter might well be a test case for&apos;judging the intentions of the Community towards Commonwealthexporters. There was a great disparity between New Zealand andFrench sales of butter to the United Kingdom, but the French had alarge surplus production and wanted a larger share of the UnitedKingdom market, which could be expected to contract when prices were raised.Summing up, the Prime Minister said that the provisionalarrangements reached on association and for India, Pakistan and ceylon could be considered advantageous. Public anxiety wouldbe concentrated on the arrangements for the older commonwealth countries, especially Australia and New Zealand. At the forthcomingCommonwealth Meeting a great responsibility would rest with thePrime Minister of Australia. But the proposals which had emergedso far in the Brussels negotiations could be put forward as fair and reasonable protection for Commonwealth economic interests. Thereshould be less difficulty in dealing with any fears that might be expressed about the political implications for the Commonwealthof joining the European Communities.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the memorandum by theLord Privy Seal and agreed that it provided a satisfactory-basis for the discussions at the forthcoming Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers.
Community and be taken only with Community agreement. this might or might not produce a satisfactory answer for our farmerson any particular occasion; but it would certainly be difficult topresent to them as a substantial safeguard.In general the present course of the negotiations would involvehigher prices for cereals but lower prices for most other products.Since the increased price of cereals would increase the cost offeedingstuffs, the farmers would lose on both counts.One continuing difficulty was that for many products for whichthe Six had not yet settled their own policy they would, in all probability, have reached agreement before we joined the Community.This inhibited our freedom of action in two ways: until we were members of the Community we could not protect our own interestsby the use of the veto; and, while in theory we should have equalrights of negotiation once we had become members, we should thenbe faced with a united front which the Six would probably havereached as a result of hard or difficult bargaining and which theywould not lightly modify. It was however possible to envisage an interim stage in which we had shown so clearly our intention to join the Community that the Six would be prepared to admit us as partiesto negotiations; and this would be of great practical help in securing a more favourable decision on some of the outstanding points.The First Secretary of State said that under any possiblesettlement of the issues which directly affected United Kingdomfarmers there would be strong criticism of the Government andpossibly some genuine hardship. The Government would have toaccept the impossibility of finding a solution which would command general approval. Against this background, he considered that theGovernments course of action should be developed along two lines.In the first place, it would be necessary to defer final decisions until agreement had been reached on the treatment of those commoditieson which negotiations were still in progress, and to give more precisionto the criteria under which, and the means by which, the community would undertake to intervene to support agricultural interests in caseswhere the application of Community policy had led, or seemed likelyto lead: to serious loss of income. Secondly, it would be necessaryto present the Governments policy to the farming community interms of the economic realities of our present position. In presentcircumstances our domestic agriculture was supported by large directgrants which depended in turn on our general prosperity. There werepowerful arguments to show that our ability to maintain our overallprosperity would be seriously jeopardised if we failed to join theCommunity, and for this reason the risks which the farming community would be called upon to accept were in their ownlong-term interest. It was not, in other words, a straight choice between joining the Community or continuing the present state ofaffairs : the Community existed and, if we failed to join it, our generalindustrial position would decline; and the last state of UnitedKingdom agriculture would then be far worse.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The position both in Northern Ireland and in Scotland, wheremutton was of particular importance, would need to be kept in mindin the course of the current negotiations.(b) It must be accepted that on agriculture the Governmentscase could not be argued in general terms, but would have to be presented in terms of its effect on particular commodities and particular interests.(c) Horticulture presented special problems which would take time to solve. It would for this reason be necessary to negotiate the longest possible transitional period. We had originally thought interms of a five-year stand-still period to be followed by a five-year
3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (C. (62) 132)by the Foreign Secretary describing the proposals for securing apolitical settlement in the Congo which had now been agreed withthe Governments of the United States. Belgium and France, and seeking the Cabinefs authority to offer $2 million in short-termfinancial aid to the Congo and to indicate that we should be preparedto contribute about $10 million a year over a period ofabout four years as a contribution to a long-term internationalreconstruction plan.The Foreign Secretary said that the plan for nationalreconciliation in the Congo had now been put to Mr. Adoula, thePrime Minister of the Central Government of the Congo, and toMr. Tshombe, the Prime Minister of Katanga. This envisagedinterim arrangements for an equal division of revenue betweenthe provinces and the Central Government, agreement by theCentral Government to a federal form of Constitution, andan international plan for the reconstruction of the Congounder the general supervision of the United Nations and theInternational Monetary Fund. Mr. Adoula had already acceptedthe plan and Mr. Tshombe was under pressure to do so. If theplan were not in the event accepted and put into force it was likely that economic sanctions would be applied to Katanga with the threat of military action to follow. Such a development was to be avoided at all costs. The likelihood of the plan being accepted was bound to be affected by the scope and effectiveness of the internationalplan for reconstruction which formed an important part of it; andfor this reason he thought it would be in our interest to make clearour intention to support the plan from the outset to the extent set outin his paper. The sums involved were inconsiderable by comparisonwith those which would be at stake if fighting in the Congo were tobreak out again on any considerable scale.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that our approvedcommitments for oversea aid already exceeded by some  20 million a year the figure of  180 million which had hitherto been taken asa ceiling. Further demands were on the way, in particular from kenya, Southern Rhodesia, Malta and Laos. It was open to doubt whether the claims of the Congo should be given so high a priority in the allocation of our over-strained resources as the present proposals would imply. Our commercial stake in the Congo wasnot substantial; total United Kingdom assets amounted to somethingless than  30 million, and exports were running at an annual levelof about  4 million. He would have no objection to a grant of$2 million as short-term emergency aid: but he considered that nofirm offer of long-term aid should be made at the present stage.transitional period. Over such a period, the situation in the mainhorticultural areas might well be affected by other developments,e.g., by population movements and the building of new towns.(d) It would probably be possible to arrange for the debate onthe Common Market at the forthcoming Conservative party conference to be short if it were understood that a special conferenceon this subject would be held at a later date. It would be desirablethat such a special conference should not be held until after there hadbeen a further debate in the new session of Parliament.The Cabinet Took note of the position described by the Minister ofAgriculture and of the points made in their discussion.
In discussion it was the general view of the Cabinet that it would at this stage be unjustifiable to enter into a firm commitment to grantlong-term aid of any specified amount, and that it should be sufficientto offer to discuss with the other countries concerned the amount and nature of the aid which it might be reasonable to offer in supportof a settlement. It was also agreed that in the event of the impositionof economic sanctions involving proposals for an embargo onpurchases of Katangan copper, we should maintain our purchases of copper at their present level. While we could not be a party to theimposition of an embargo we should not seek to take advantage ofthe fact that other countries might see fit to impose one.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to offer $2 million in short-term aid to the Congo and to seek a commercialcredit of similar size from business firms.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to continue discussions with the other countries concerned about a long-terminternational reconstruction plan for the Congo and toindicate in terms to be agreed in consultation with theChief Secretary, Treasury, our willingness in principle tocontribute to such a plan.(3) Agreed that if attempts were made to place an embargo onpurchases of Katangan copper United Kingdom purchasesshould continue at their present level.germany berlin(previous reference:C.C. (62) 50thConclusions,Minute 3)4. The Foreign Secretary said that a dangerous situation had arisen in Berlin as a result of the action of the East German police in leaving a young man to die, within sight of the people of West Berlin,after he had been shot when attempting to escape from the easternsector. This had provoked angry demonstrations, including thestoning of the &apos;bus which each day carried Russian soldiers to theSoviet War Memorial in the western sector. The Mayor of west berlin had, however, done his utmost to steady the population, andit seemed likely that the situation would be kept under control. it seemed best to leave it to the local Commandants to consider whether any further precautions could usefully be taken.In the diplomatic exchanges on the future of Berlin there hadbeen no fresh developments. The Soviet Government, though theyhad rejected every proposal put forward by the Western Powers, stillseemed to be in no hurry to conclude a separate peace ti-treaty withEast Germany. It was possible that they might have it in mind, asa next step, to raise the problem in the United Nations.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,23rd August, 1962.
