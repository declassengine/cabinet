Prime MinistersVisit to canada and the UnitedStates, April1962CanadaThe Prime Minister gave the Cabinet an account of the impressions he had formed during his recent discussions in canada and the United States.In Canada the Government were facing both economic andpolitical difficulties. During the boom industrialists had tended toover-invest at the top of the market, and this had increased theirpresent difficulties. The devaluation of the Canadian dollar, whichhad been announced that day, was not unexpected. Canadian ministers were inclined to be resentful of Britain&apos;s application for entry to the Common Market; they seemed unwilling to consider itdispassionately; and it might become an issue in the forthcomingelection. Suggestions were likely to be heard, during the campaign,that the interests of other Commonwealth countries were beingsacrificed to the European policies of the United KingdomGovernment. Canadian Ministers seemed to be particularlysuspicious of the encouragement given by the United states administration to Britairfs application: they saw this as nothing more than a manifestation of America&apos;s desire to terminateCommonwealth preferences. But in business circles in Canada therewas a greater readiness to consider this question on its merits andto see the value, both to other Commonwealth countries and to under-developed countries generally, of the influence which theUnited Kingdom would be able to exercise in a prosperous european community.United States The United States Administration were  also facing someeconomic difficulties. Substantial unemployment continued in spiteof the large programmes of public expenditure which had been undertaken. There was some danger that relations between theadministration and the business community might deteriorate:President Kennedy&apos;s policies had attracted some of the unpopularityassociated with President Roosevelt&apos;s New Deal.The Prime Minister said that in his discussions with president kennedy on defence matters it had become evident that the Presidentshared his own disappointment that it had proved impossible to avert a further Western series of nuclear tests. But the president was hopeful that, after the current series of Western tests and theRussian series which was likely to follow it, there might be anopportunity to renew the attempt to conclude an international agreement for the cessation of tests. There was a growing realisationin the administration that the destructive power of the two opposingblocs was now so great that the credibility of the nuclear deterrentmight soon be called in question. It was for this reason that theadministration were stressing the importance of conventional arms,and in due time they might consider favourably a thorough-goingmeasure of nuclear disarmament. The prospect of suchdisarmament would be increased if, as seemed likely, the Sovietleadership was becoming seriously concerned to improve social andeconomic conditions in countries of the Eastern bloc and to reducethe heavy burden imposed on them by nuclear armaments.The Prime Minister said that this renewal of his personal contact with President Kennedy had been valuable. He had, however,formed the impression that it would not be profitable at this stage to move towards a Summit meeting. It would be prudent to deferuntil towards the end of the year any further initiative for thispurpose, whether on Berlin or other themes. In the meantime theGovernment should concentrate on securing entry to the common market on acceptable terms. There was no sign that the close relations established with the United States Administration wouldbe prejudiced by British membership of the Common Market andthere were good grounds for hoping that the friction which at presentpersisted on a number of commercial matters, such as shipping policy
and protective tariffs on carpets and glass, could be reduced.Protectionism in the United States was, however, a strong force andits influence was spreading to the southern States. He had undertaken to send to the President a full statement of our case against the administrations discriminatory policy on shipping.In the Cabinets discussion the following points were raised:(a) The reports of the Prime Ministers speeches and discussions in the United States and Canada had been well received in thiscountry and in other parts of the Commonwealth. Many people were, however, uneasy about the attitude of the United StatesGovernment to United Kingdom membership of the common market. The fact that they supported it on political grounds, despiteits economic disadvantage to them, was increasing the suspicion withwhich the latest proposals for political unity in Europe were viewedby public opinion in this country and by our partners in the european free Trade Area. This made it the more important that the implications of these proposals for political co-operation in europe should be carefully examined by the Cabinet and fully explained inthe country.(b) The attitude of the United States Administration towardsthe Common Market negotiations was coloured by the fear that britain&apos;s efforts to protect the interests of other commonwealth countries might have the effect of worsening the position of third countries, including especially the countries of South and central america, where anything which increased the risk of Communistpenetration would be particularly unwelcome to the United States.It was to be expected also that the arrangements which might haveto be made to protect Commonwealth producers of temperatefoodstuffs e.g., Australian wheat would be regarded as introducingnew forms of protection. But the general tenor of the PrimeMinister&apos;s discussions suggested that the administration would beready to consider such cases individually on their merits.(c) There was a noticeable gap between the formulation ofpolicy by the United States Administration and its effectiveimplementation on the ground. This had been evident in Laos andSouth Vietnam and in United Nations discussions on colonialism aswell as in relation to the Common Market. On colonialism it was satisfactory that President Kennedy should have asked for moreadvance information of British policies and intentions, and indicated that he intended to improve the machinery for co-ordination betweenthe various United States agencies concerned, both in washington and at the United Nations.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Ministers statement and of thepoints made in discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,4th May, 1962.
