ParliamentMethod ofAppointmentof Serjeantat Arms1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inParliament in the following week.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that some difficulty was likely to be caused by two Questions addressed to thePrime Minister by Mr. Charles Pannell, M.P., about the appointmentof the Serjeant at Arms. Mr. Pannell had also put a motion on theOrder Paper which in effect amounted to a motion of censure onthe Sovereign. The Chancellor of the Duchy said that, if he were asked that afternoon about finding time for the motion, he wouldadvise the House to await the answers to the Questions. There was however a point of substance involved. It appeared that the Serjeantat Arms was appointed by The Queen without any formal advice from any source. Although this had been the practice since at least the time of the Long Parliament it had given rise to criticism in thepast and would be likely to give rise to more in the future. Thereport of the Select Committee under Mr. Stokes had recommended the appointment of a commission of the House of Commons to give advice on this and other matters: this recommendation was for various reasons unacceptable, but some procedure allowing for formal consultation on the occasion of the appointment of a newSerjeant at Arms might be advisable in order to protect the Sovereignfrom unfair criticism.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat it might be necessary to ask The Queen to consider a change ofprocedure on the occasion of future appointments. While it was believed that on this, and on earlier occasions, there had been someinformal correspondence between The Queen&apos;s Private Secretary andMr. Speaker, this did not entirely meet the need. There could,however, be no question of casting any doubt on the validity orTightness of the appointment which had recently been made.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would consider thisquestion further, in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion,consulting The Queen&apos;s Private Secretary as necessary.Incomes Policy *2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that as agreed at the railwaymen&apos;s Cabinet&apos;s last meeting he had written to the Chairman of the BritishWages Transport Commission,  Dr.  Beeching, informing him that the(Previous        Government could not accept his proposal to make an initial offerReference :      to the railway unions of a 6 per cent increase in railway wages.   InC.C. (62) 64th   reply, Dr. Beeching had reiterated his earlier view that any lowerConclusions,     opening offer would be inconsistent with the demands of equity and minute 1)        good management; and he had also taken occasion to criticise theGovernments wages policy.   If a formal letter were now to beaddressed to Dr. Beeching saying that the Government were notprepared to accept a settlement at a final figure of more than 5 percent, there was no doubt that Dr. Beeching would immediately show the letter to the railway unions.  The Government would then haveto negotiate directly, not only with the unions, but with the unions and Dr. Beeching together.  A possible alternative which the wages committee had discussed on the previous day would be to give Dr.Beeching not a percentage limit but a total sum of money to cover the increases; a figure of  16 million, for example, would be equivalentto a 4 per cent increase.  If this were done, Dr. Beeching would belikely to open with an offer of 5 per cent; he would propose to make

The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that as agreed at the railwaymen&apos;s Cabinet&apos;s last meeting he had written to the Chairman of the BritishWages Transport  Commission, Dr. Beeching, informing him that the(Previous        Government could not accept his proposal to make an initial offerReference :      to the railway unions of a 6 per cent increase in railway wages.   in C.C. (62) 64th   reply, Dr. Beeching had reiterated his earlier view that any lowerConclusions,     opening offer would be inconsistent with the demands of equity and minute 1)        good management; and he had also taken occasion to criticise theGovernments wages policy.

The Government would then haveto negotiate directly, not only with the unions, but with the unions and Dr. Beeching together.  A possible alternative which the wages committee had discussed on the previous day would be to give Dr.Beeching not a percentage limit but a total sum of money to cover the increases; a figure of  16 million, for example, would be equivalentto a 4 per cent increase.  If this were done, Dr. Beeching would belikely to open with an offer of 5 per cent; he would propose to make
up the difference between the  16 million increase authorised by theGovernment and the cost of the eventual settlement by drawing onthe savings thrown up by his measures of reorganisation, and onincreased revenue.The Minister of Labour said that if the Government proceededon these lines it should be realised that the final settlement would belikely to be 6 per cent. There would be repercussions elsewhere,particularly in the nationalised industries, on motormen in the london transport system, on bus drivers and on certain engineering workers.A settlement at 6 per cent would also be regarded as showing weaknesson the Governments part in maintaining their incomes policy.The Minister of Transport said that from his most recentconversation with Dr. Beeching he thought that an offer of  16 million for wage increases would be acceptable and that Dr. Beeching wouldthen open negotiations at 5 per cent, settling at 5j per cent or 6 percent. A settlement at this level ought not in fairness to have repercussions elsewhere; for it was still not sufficiently appreciated that the railwaymen were not in any sense leading the next round of wage increases.In discussion the following points were made :(a) On balance it appeared that a formal intimation to Dr.Beeching that the Government would be prepared to accept increasesamounting to not more than  16 million in all would be the bestcompromise. The Government as bankers to the British transport commission had a right and duty to determine financial limits ofthis kind; and they also had the right to ask that the commission should take account of the Governments general wages policy. Itwas most undesirable that the Government should find themselves indirect negotiation with the railway unions and with Dr. Beechingabout the details of the wage increases now in question.(b) The public presentation of Government action on the lines proposed would need careful thought. It was important to avoid theimpression that the Government had obliged the Commission to sacrifice redundant workers in the interest of those still in employment.It would also be necessary to drive home the point that an increase for railway workers of even as much as 6 per cent gave no justification for increases elsewhere; this would present particular difficulty in the teaching professions.(c) The formal letter conveying the Governments decision to Dr.Beeching should be designed for publication. Even though it wasnot intended to publish it at the outset, its contents would be likely tobecome known. It would also be advisable to inform the Chairmanof the National Coal Board in confidence of what was proposed, ashe had been particularly helpful to the Government in the developmentof their wages policy.(d) There would be no question of any increase in fares resultingdirectly from the forthcoming negotiations. Increases in fares mightbe necessary at a later stage in the London region, but the lapse oftime would be such that no direct connexion should be seen betweenthe two.The Cabinet Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forthe despatch of a formal letter to the Chairman of the british transport Commission informing him that the Governmentwould be prepared to regard a sum of  16 million as being available for railway wage increases at the present stage,and that the forthcoming negotiations should be conducted on that basis.
CommercialPolicyJapan(previous reference :CC. (62) 48thConclusions,Minute 4)Sports 4.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the ChiefDevelopment Secretary, Treasury (C. (62) 163) proposing that a statement shouldCouncil be macje in Parliament, in the terms of the draft which was annexed,about the Government^  attitude to a proposal for a  SportsDevelopment Council.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that a. Committee set up under the Chairmanship of Sir John Wolfenden by the central council of Physical Recreation had recommended that a SportsDevelopment Council should be established to distribute public funds for the development of sports facilities.  The general view taken in. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (62) 172) describing the main features of the Commercial Treaty with Japan which would be ready for signature later in November.The President of the Board of Trade said that negotiations forthe treaty with Japan, which had been in progress since 1956, had now been completed. If finally approved by the two Governments,the treaty would be signed during the visit which would be paid tothis country by the Japanese Prime Minister in mid-November. Theterms of the treaty, which followed the normal form for commercial treaties, were in general very satisfactory. Much of the discussion which had taken place, both with Japanese and with British industrial interests, had concerned safeguards for particular industries and itwas to be expected that there would be continuing complaints fromthose who feared that the general safeguards against disruptivecompetition might not be put into effect quickly enough to protect them. Protective action could and would be taken at short notice and in explaining the treaty to the public and to business interests,stress would be laid on the unusually precise nature of the safeguardprovisions. It would also be important to secure general unstanding of the Japanese desire not to indulge in disruptive competition andto stress the substantial advantages which would accrue to UnitedKingdom exports. The Japanese had agreed that from the date of signature they would increase their imports of such goods as motorcars, and there would shortly be a substantial demand for aero-engines.He would press the Japanese to accept that the duration of the treaty should, in the first place, be for six years but he thought he mighthave to agree to a duration of five years. They had also promised to withdraw the tax rebate which had been allowed on the exportprofits of Japanese companies and to subscribe to the Declarationunder the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade forbidding theuse of this and other forms of export subsidy.In discussion there was general agreement in the Cabinet on theadvantages which the treaty would bring. Care should be taken atthe time of signature to ensure that full publicity was given tothese advantages and to the safeguards provided for in the treaty.The Cabinet (1) Approved the draft Commercial Treaty with Japan and theprovisions and arrangements relating to it described inC. (62) 172, and authorised signature of the treaty andother necessary documents during the forthcoming visit of the Japanese Prime Minister to London.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Minister without Portfolio, to arrange for suitablepublicity to be given to the provisions of the treaty andto the advantages which would be secured under it.
discussion in the Home Affairs Committee had been that such a council would be expensive and unnecessary. There was implicit in the recommendation the unrealistic view that expenditure on sportcould and should be treated as a separate item in the Governmentsinvestment programme and should be given some form of priority over other items. In fact, expenditure on sport was a feature of several programmes in some cases a substantial feature and itwould be impracticable to alter the machinery of government toprovide for separate treatment. The Home Affairs Committee had felt, however, that there might be some presentational advantage insetting up an Advisory Committee, which would be a non-executivesubstitute for the proposed Council. In subsequent discussion withthe Ministers directly concerned he had come to the view that an advisory Committee would have no real job to do and would in theend please no one. He also thought that, in view of the conflictinginterests involved, there would be difficulties in selecting the chairman and members of an advisory body. These views were reflected in thedraft of a written Answer annexed to C. (62) 163.In discussion the following points were raised:(a) It could be argued that a Sports Development Council wouldhave a function analogous to that of the Arts Council. The activitiesof the Arts Council necessarily cut across departmental responsibilities and there did not appear to be any inherent reason why a comparablebody should not be entrusted with the disbursement of public funds for sport. It was pointed out, however, that the real difficulty wasthe pressure to spend money which would arise from the creation ofan independent body. A sum of perhaps  1 million a year would belikely to be demanded and the Government would have little controlover the purposes for which it would be used.(b) The case against an Advisory Committee was less strong.It would not carry conviction to say, as the draft statement did, thatthe Government proposed to improve the existing administrative arrangements by securing closer co-operation between GovernmentDepartments and by arranging for regular consultation between theDepartments and the voluntary and local authority interests concerned. An Advisory Committee might serve as a useful source of intelligence about the precise needs and desires of those who would benefit from further provision, and a committee set on imaginativelines would help to show the Governments concern to provide adequate games facilities for the large number of people who hadno such facilities at present.(c) Some Ministers felt, however, that even an AdvisoryCommittee would become a channel for embarrassing demands for money which could not at present be afforded. Those people whoseprimary interest was in international athletics would expect heavysubsidies for the provision of training facilities to enable athletes fromthis country to compete on equal terms with athletes from othercountries with much larger populations and a different outlook onthe value of international competitions. There was no lack ofinformation or advice about the way in which money ought to be spent, if it were available, on the more modest facilities which young people generally could enjoy, and which they ought to be encouraged to use.\d) It was appropriate that the statement should take full credit for what was already being done by the Government. Account might also be taken of the substantial provision of sports facilities whichwas frequently made by commercial firms.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that thedraft statement should now be revised in the light of the points whichhad been made. It would be right to reject the recommendation fora Sports Development Council and it might also be right to make
no move towards establishing an Advisory Committee. But the aim should be to strike a positive and practical note. Consideration shouldbe given to the possibility that the Lord President might be asked totake responsibility for co-ordinating action among Departments, withthe help of some outside advice.The Cabinet Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Lord President and other Ministers directly concerned,to consider further, in the light of the Cabinefs discussion,the terms of the statement to be made about the proposalfor a Sports Development Council; and to bring a revised draft before them at a later meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,1st November, 1962.
