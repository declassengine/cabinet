BahamasMeeting,December1962(previous reference:CC. (62) 75thConclusions,Minute 1)nuclear weapons(previous reference:CC (60) 35thConclusions)*The Cabinet had before them four telegrams from the PrimeMinister (Nassau telegrams Nos. Codel 16, 17, 18 and 24 of20th December, 1962) on the action to be taken following the decisionof the President of the United States to cancel plans for thedevelopment of the airborne ballistic missile SKYBOLT for use bythe United States. The action proposed included the provision ofPOLARIS missiles to be carried in United Kingdom submarines.The Prime Minister had asked for the advice of the Cabinet on thequestion whether the terms of a proposed joint statement in his ownname and that of the President were acceptable.The First Secretary of State drew attention to the principaldifferences between the United States draft in telegram No. Codel 16and the subsequent joint draft in telegram No. Codel 18 which hadbeen elaborated in further discussion on 20th December and onwhich the advice of the Cabinet was now sought. It was clear thata great deal had been achieved by the Prime Minister and hiscolleagues in Nassau in persuading the President to move away fromthe original United States positions. Whereas the United Statesdraft would have committed the United Kingdom Government to&quot; an agreement to meet their NATO non-nuclear force goals at the agreed NATO standards&quot;, the latest draft referred only to&quot; agreement on the importance of increasing the effectiveness of theirconventional forces&quot;. Again, the latest draft included a newprovision that our strategic nuclear forces would be used for &quot; theinternational defence of the Western Alliance in all circumstancesexcept where Her Majesty&apos;s Government may decide that thesupreme national interests are at stake &quot;. The Prime Minister hadparticularly directed attention (in telegram No. Codel 24) to these words, which had the effect of giving us the sole right of decision onthe use of our strategic nuclear forces, and had asked whether theCabinet endorsed the view, which he shared with the foreign secretary, the Commonwealth Secretary and the Minister of Defence,that these words could be publicly defended as maintaining anindependent United Kingdom contribution to the nuclear deterrent.The Cabinet accordingly considered first the wording of thispassage in the statement. There was some doubt whether, as it stood, the exception would be generally interpreted as allowing her majesty&apos;s Government to use United Kingdom strategic forces in circumstances not involving the defence of the Western Alliance, orwhether it would be taken to mean only that the Government coulddecline to use those forces in particular circumstances involving theinterests of the Alliance. It was clear that the Prime Ministerintended the exception to cover both cases. If he were free to make this interpretation public, with the consent of the President, thiswould safeguard the principle of independence; but there would be advantage in clarifying the terms of the statement and removing theambiguity, if this could be done without jeopardising United Statesagreement to the other features of the arrangement proposed. Thiswas especially important in view of Western European opinion. we might easily suffer from the growth of a suspicion that our militaryindependnce was, or might be, less secure than, for example, that ofthe French. Again, as no early opportunity could be found for parliamentary discussion of the joint statement, this was anadditional reason for seeking to ensure that the terms of thestatement itself were free from doubt. In any case some publicexplanation would be called for before Parliament reassembled. Analternative form of words was suggested, emphasising first the right ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government to act in accordance with the supremenational interest, subject to which United Kingdom strategic nuclearforces would only be used in defence of the Alliance.
While Ministers were agreed upon the value to this country ofan arrangement by which we should eventually have within our owncontrol a virtually indestructible second-strike deterrent weapon ofproven capability, and with prospects of a long life, it was recognisedthat the conditions which the United States Government werestipulating represented a heavy price in money and otherwise.The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the Cabinet that a force of POLARIS-firing nuclear submarines could be built for theRoyal Navy in either of two ways. Four submarines each equipped with 16 missiles could be completed between early 1968 and 1970,providing a full deterrent during 1969; this was estimated to cost 220 million over a period of seven years, including the necessarymissiles, but excluding the cost of research and development of a united Kingdom warhead. Alternatively, seven submarines eachequipped with eight missiles could be completed over a period of11 years, providing a full deterrent in the course of 1971, at a totalcost of  290 million. In both cases it might be reasonable toreckon a saving of  100 million on SKYBOLT as offsetting the costof the submarines: in the latter alternative of eight-missilesubmarines, these vessels would be able to perform the full militaryrole of seven nuclear-powered submarines in the conventional fleet,in addition to their deterrent function. On this basis, the extra costof the missile-firing capability of the seven submarines would be 95 million.There was no mention in the telegrams under examination ofany arrangement for hiring United States submarines, or otherwisebridging the gap which would occur in our deterrent forces after theV-bomber force armed with BLUE STEEL began to diminish ineffectiveness in the latter half of the current decade. It thus appeared that expenditure on the V-bomber force might continue unabatedduring the period of construction of United Kingdom POLARIS-firing submarines. Furthermore, United States pressure for improvement in the effectiveness of conventional forces was likely to lead to increased United Kingdom expenditure.In the absence of any reliable estimate of the total financial andeconomic consequences involved, the Chancellor of the exchequer said that he must reserve his position about the implications for defence expenditure as a whole of a decision to accept a UnitedKingdom deterrent based on POLARIS.In the course of further discussion, reference was made to the likelihood of public criticism of the Governments acceptance of aperiod of some years during which the possibility of effective action by United Kingdom strategic nuclear forces would be seriouslydiminished. Responsible opinion was also likely to take the point that the proposed arrangement included our acceptance of the ideaof a multilateral strategic nuclear force for the North atlantic alliance, which was a new and untried concept. Coupled withinsistence on the need to improve the effectiveness, which would betaken to mean the size, of our conventional forces in Europe, therewas at least a possible risk that, before the time came when we were ready to accept POLARIS missiles for our submarines, the UnitedStates Administration would make use of alleged shortcomings inour policy towards the North Atlantic Alliance as an excuse fordefaulting on their offer.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, invited attention to the fact thatthe proposed joint statement appeared to exclude any considerationof the fitting of POLARIS missiles in surface ships. While this method would not have the advantages of submarine operation, andalthough any technical effort expended in this direction would mean a delay in the fulfilment of the submarine programme, surface ships could probably be made ready earlier and cheaper than submarines.
While the wording of the passage about conventional forces in telegram No. Codel 18 represented a very great improvement on the wording earlier proposed by the United States in telegram No.Codel 16, it could be further improved if the idea were introducedthat the effectiveness of our conventional forces ought to be increased&quot; on a world-wide basis &quot;: without some such addition it would be widely misunderstood as necessarily implying an increase in thestrength of the British Army of the Rhine, which would be verydifficult to achieve. This passage of the proposed joint statement was also unsatisfactory in that it gave currency to a new (andprobably unsound) United States strategic doctrine of a &quot; nuclearshield &quot; and a &quot; non-nuclear sword &quot;.Summing up the discussion the First Secretary of State said thatthere seemed to be general agreement in the Cabinet that the PrimeMinister and his colleagues deserved their full support for the largelysuccessful efforts that they had made to evolve a satisfactory agreement with the United States Government. In conveying the sense of this feeling to the Prime Minister it would however be rightto emphasise their view that the Government were being asked topay a heavy price and that for this reason the independent role ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government in the use of nuclear forces must be clearly and unambiguously expressed. The wording of the relevantpassage in the joint statement could in their view be improved inorder to make the Prime Ministers own interpretation of it plainer.On conventional forces, while the substance of the proposed joint statement was unexceptionable, certain changes of wording mightbe recommended to avoid subsequent difficulty in application. Itwould be necessary to inform the Prime Minister of the reservationwhich the Chancellor of the Exchequer had made. As there wouldbe no opportunity to explain the new arrangement in Parliament fora month, it would be right to inform the Prime Minister of the views which had been expressed about the form which criticism of thearrangements might take in responsible quarters, and of the needfor some earlier and fuller exposition of the Governments policythan would be conveyed by the statement itself.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Prime Minister should be assured of their full support in his endeavours to secure a satisfactorystatement.(2) Agreed that the draft in telegram No. Codel 18, if interpretedon the lines of telegram No. Codel 24, safeguarded theessential principle of an independent United kingdom contribution to the Western strategic nuclear deterrent,but that the wording as it stood was open tomisinterpretation.(3) Took note that the First Secretary of State would arrangefor the Prime Minister to be advised of their views onthis point, and of the other points made in their discussion.
