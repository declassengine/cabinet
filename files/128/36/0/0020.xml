SmokingandHealth(previous reference:C.C. (62) 19thConclusions,Minute 4)2. The Cabinet were informed that, since their discussion on 6th March, the Chancellor of the Exchequer had developed misgivingsabout the terms of the replies (set out in Annex J3 of C. (62) 43) to begiven on 12th March to Parliamentary Questions on the Report ofthe Royal College of Physicians on &quot; Smoking and Health &quot;. he feared that, if the Government publicly committed themselves to apolicy of &quot; discouraging &quot; adults from smoking, this might prejudice the consideration, which the Cabinet had agreed to be necessary, ofthe further measures contemplated in the Report. In this connexionhe had been impressed by the statement, in paragraph 11 of the noteby officials annexed to C. (62) 43, that a publicity campaign designedto discourage smoking was unlikely to be successful unless theGovernment were seen to be taking in addition such other measures as lay in their power to reduce smoking.After discussion it was agreed that it would be preferable thatthe Government should not at this stage appear to be assuming a responsibility for &quot; discouraging&quot; adults from smoking. the communication to be addressed to local health authorities should therefore invite them to use all channels of health education &quot; tomake the conclusions of the Report known and to make clear to thepublic the dangers to health of smoking, particularly cigarette-smoking &quot;. The reply to be given by the Minister of Health to parliamentary Questions on 12th March should be phrasedaccordingly.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Government should not at this stage appearto be assuming a responsibility for &quot; discouraging&quot;adults from smoking.(2) Agreed that the advice to be given to local health authorities on the Report by the Royal College of Physicians, andthe reply to be given by the Minister of Health to parliamentary Questions on this subject on 12th March,should be in terms of making the conclusions of theReport known and making clear to the public the dangers to health of smoking, particularly cigarette-smoking.Disarmament(previous reference:C.C. (62) 19thConclusions,Minute 1)General3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Foreign Secretary(C. (62) 48) covering a memorandum by the Minister of State forForeign Affairs on the forthcoming meeting of the 18-PowerDisarmament Committee in Geneva.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the conference would begin with a general debate, which might continue for abouta fortnight. This would be followed by the discussion of specific proposals. It was hoped that the United States Government wouldbe prepared to put forward a substantial set of proposals. They hadnot yet disclosed the nature of these, but they were expected toinclude proposals for a reduction of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles and of major items of conventional armament, positive proposals onverification, the cessation of production of fissile material for military purposes, the transfer or destruction of stockpiles of fissile material and safeguards against the transfer between nations of fissile material for military purposes. Additional proposals might be included,partly for presentational purposes, on measures to reduce the dangerof surprise attack and on non-aggression declarations.   There wasSECRET 3C.C. 20 (62)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
some prospect that progress might be made on the basis of a schemefor random-sample inspections of zones in each country. If such ascheme were not accepted by the Soviet Union it might still bepossible to reach understandings based on the inspection of definedcategories of weapons or on an offer to secure destruction of weaponson a one-for-one or a percentage basis. Proposals on these lines hadin the past been made by Soviet representatives and they might therefore find it difficult to reject them. In the preliminary discussions among Western Foreign Ministers, which would open on11th March, an attempt would be made to discuss not only a nucleartest treaty but also other points which might be put to the soviet foreign Minister on the following day and later to the Conferenceitself. These might cover inter alia the prohibition of transfer of nuclear weapons to States not possessing them.In discussion of the general pattern of the Conference thefollowing points were made:(a) The Foreign Secretary should feel free to express firm support for the widest measure of disarmament. Until he was aware of the specific proposals to be put forward by the United States government it was difficult to assess how far it would be prudent to go in thegeneral debate, but we should make it clear that our long-term objective was complete disarmament and should seek to ensure, by stating our principles without undue qualification, that the SovietGovernment did not score a propaganda success by representingthemselves as the only Government which was prepared to supportcomplete disarmament.(b) Even if there were general and complete disarmament, itwould still be permissible to retain national forces for internal securitypurposes, including the internal security of dependencies overseas.External security would then be protected by a strong international force. In this connexion it should be kept in mind that the forces which could be retained by the Soviet Government for internal security purposes would be strong enough to threaten aggression against neighbouring countries.(c) The idea of random-sample inspections should be vigorouslypursued.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement made by the Minister of Statefor Foreign Affairs.The Prime Minister said that he did not think it would necessarily be in our best interests to support without qualification a declarationdesigned to prevent the transfer of nuclear weapons to States not already possessing them. The object of such a declaration was, nodoubt, to show that Western Germany would not be given nuclear weapons. But it might also prevent any transfer between this countryand France; and such a transfer, though not in immediate prospect,might become desirable as discussions evolved about the EuropeanCommon Market. The French Government might regard such adeclaration as aimed at them and, as there was no obvious advantage in making it there was, for example, no likelihood that the soviet union would transfer nuclear weapons to the Chinese PeopledRepublic he wondered whether we should associate ourselves withthe proposal. It would be useful to have an appraisal of the probableFrench attitude on this point.The Prime Minister said that he hoped the United states authorities would feel able to accept the conclusion now reached byBritish scientists, that national systems of detection would suffice to identify nuclear test.; explosions, whether in the atmosphere orNuclearWeaponsThe Cabinet then considered the implications of proposals relating particularly to nuclear weapons.

If these could be combined with an international organisation responsible for inspection, and for verification of reports submitted by the national detection systems, the substance of theSoviet objections to inspection on grounds of espionage might be met.In discussion it was noted that the United States authorities hadnot yet accepted the conclusion of British scientists on this point andit would be difficult to convince them. They were now thinking interms of requiring inspection not only of test explosions but also of preparations for tests; and the prospect of agreement on detectionand inspection arrangements might be receding. The SovietGovernment had rejected inspection proposals of a similar kind sometime ago.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to submit an appraisal of theattitude of the French Government to a declarationagainst the transfer of nuclear weapons to States not already possessing them.4. The Colonial Secretary said that in the Kenya constitutional conference little progress had yet been made in resolving the widelydiffering views held by the Kenya African National Union (KANU)and the Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU). KANUfavoured a centralised form of government: their detailed proposalsincluded a Bill of Rights and safeguards for tribal and regionalinterests, but provided no effective safeguards for the Europeansettlers. KADU on the other hand started from the proposition thatthe only acceptable solution would be a decentralised or federal formof government. Their proposals involved substantial delegation of power to regional administrations and an upper chamber in thecentral legislature elected in such a way that it would be representativeof regions rather than of political parties. Up to the present it hadnot been possible to bring the two parties to combine their efforts inthe search for a compromise acceptable to both. KADU, inparticular, had been unwilling to consider any variation of their proposals. There were, however, signs that both parties were coming to realise that, if constitutional advance in Kenya was to be achieved,some means must be found of breaking the deadlock between them.The next week of the Conference might bring some progress, but itwas too early to forecast the form which any final proposals might take.In a more general context there were signs of some divisionwithin KANU. The fears which had been expressed at an earlier stage about the danger of domination by the Kikuyu were increasingand the moderate group led by Mr. Mboya seemed to be strengtheningits position. It was conceivable that some agreement might bereached between this moderate group and the KADU delegation;and, if this happened, the extreme group under Mr. Kenyatta wouldbe isolated. It was also significant that neither of the main Africanparties to the Conference had yet made an issue of the date forKenya&apos;s independence. It could perhaps be deduced from this thatthey were beginning to realise the immense difficulties which would face them in getting any new constitution to work and that they hadtacitly accepted the need for a rather longer period of self-government before independence.In discussion the following points were made:(a) Although every effort had been made to impress on all partiesto the Conference the critical economic situation of Kenya and the urgent need to re-establish confidence in its future, in order to
SB \Valuationfor Rating(previous reference:C.C. (62) 19thConclusions,Minute 5)5. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the possiblede-rating of areas where the increased burden on householders in1963 was expected to be substantially above the national average.The Minister of Housing said that to raise the level above whichde-rating might be applied from 10 per cent, to 124; per cent, would reduce the number of areas affected to eight, excluding the Isles ofScilly to which special considerations applied. This would not,however, remove the objections of principle which he still saw tode-rating in any area. De-rating would merely transfer the burdenfrom householders to other categories, particularly to hotels andboarding-houses, which had been badly hit by a depression in trade,and to industrial firms, which were already facing an average increaseof 43 per cent, in their proportion of the rates. Moreover, oncespecial measures had been applied to householders in any area, itwould be more difficult to resist appeals from industry for specialencourage investment, there was no sign that these considerations were carrying any weight with the African delegations. their attention was focused entirely on constitutional, political and racialissues and they seemed to assume that in the event the necessaryeconomic aid would be forthcoming.(b) The resettlement of landless Africans on the smallerEuropean farms was a main objective for both KANU and KADU.It would be prudent to assume that the United Kingdom government might be obliged to finance a reasonable programme of landtransfer in this sector if any constitution was to command Africanacquiescence. The Africans did not, however, seem to attach thesame importance to a transfer of the larger estates to Africanownership; they recognised the contribution which efficient management of these estates was making to the economy of thecountry.(c) In general the most acceptable outcome for the conference would be the largest degree of regional devolution compatible withKenya&apos;s resources. It must, however, be recognised that regional government would be more expensive and that Kenya would in anycase be inheriting an administration more elaborate and more costlythan its economy could hope to support unaided.(d) If the period of self-government in Kenya were extended, as now seemed probable, it would be necessary to retain British troopsin the territory for longer than had been assumed and account shouldbe taken of this in current deployment plans.(e) The most that could be hoped for at this stage was anagreement in the Constitutional Conference on the broad principles on which a detailed constitution could be drawn up. It v/ould benecessary to hold a further conference, or to appoint a special commission, to draft the constitution itself. This would impose afurther delay before the attainment of full independence.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Colonial Secretary to circulate a memorandumindicating the kind of agreement on constitutionalprinciples, acceptable to the United KingdomGovernment, which the Constitutional Conference mightbe brought to adopt.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to circulate a memorandumshowing how the European land interests in Kenya were divided between the larger commercial estates and thesmaller mixed farms whose transfer to African ownershipwas likely to be demanded.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,8th March, 1962.treatment. The percentage increase in the burden to be borne byhouseholders was not a true measure of their contribution to therates. It should not be overlooked that in some of the areas forwhich de-rating was now proposed the rates were only 14s. or 15s. inthe pound as compared with a national average of over 20s.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It could be argued that the Government had committed themselves to apply de-rating if the results of the 1963 valuationshowed a very marked increase. As against this it had been generallyassumed at the time when the undertaking was given that the burden on householders generally would rise substantially and it had beensuggested, against this background, that de-rating would beconsidered if the increase exceeded 33% per cent. The presentsituation was quite different; the burden on householders generally would not be increasing and even in the particular areas now underdiscussion the maximum increase was only 27 per cent, and that in an area where rates were low. In these circumstances it could be argued that the Government had no obligation to afford special relief tohouseholders in these areas.(b) Strong representations against the new valuations were to beexpected from industry, and by making even a small number ofexceptions for householders the Government would make it moredifficult to argue that no exceptions at all should be made for industry.The fact that no power had been taken in the Rating and ValuationAct, 1961, to de-rate industrial premises would not be accepted asa conclusive argument.(c) The object of the new valuation had been to produce a fairerredistribution of the burden of rates. It was only to be expected thatin moving over to the new basis there should be substantial variationbetween districts. To alter arbitrarily the results produced in certain areas would be to reintroduce that element of unfairness which it hadbeen the object of the new system of valuation to remove.The Prime Minister said that the issues were nicely balanced andhe would wish to consider them further with some of his colleaguesbefore inviting the Cabinet to take a final decision.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theHome Secretary, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Housing, would consider this question further before inviting the Cabinet totake a final decision.
