Aden(previous reference :C.C. (61) 29thConclusions,Minute 8)1. The Commonwealth Secretary said that there were two major questions of policy to be faced in the negotiations for constitutional development in Aden the political implications of theproposed merger of Aden Colony with the Federation, and the safeguarding of the military bases and installations. On the first point it was known that a majority of the population of the Colonywas opposed to the merger. The fact that it commanded support inthe Aden Legislature was due to the fact that the elections had beenheld on a limited franchise and had been widely boycotted on that account, even by those entitled to vote. It must therefore be assumed that the merger would lead to unrest and possibly to disorder, whichwould have serious political repercussions in this country and in theUnited Nations. Nevertheless, the Government had now beforethem a request from the Aden Legislature that the merger should proceed and it had long since been decided that this would bestserve, not only the interests of this country, but the interests of thepopulation of Aden Colony itself and of the territories of theFederation. While he considered that the merger should go forward,he thought it right to warn the Cabinet that this might lead to serious political difficulties.So far as the military base was concerned it was contemplated that after the merger Britain would retain sovereignty over AdenColony and remain responsible for defence, foreign affairs and internal security in the territory as a whole. But it was not to beexpected that this situation could long continue. Pressures would develop for the transfer of sovereignty and full responsibility to thenew Federation, and on a favourable estimate it was unlikely that wecould maintain our position in the Colony beyond the late 1960s.If the Colony was not merged with the Federation the process wouldbe more rapid and independence for the Colony could probably notbe delayed much beyond 1965.Against this background there were two possible ways of preserving our defence interest. The first would be to retain, onthe analogy of the sovereign base areas in Cyprus, British sovereignty over those limited areas of the Colony in which our defenceinstallations were concentrated. The second would be to rely on a defence treaty with an independent Federation or to introduce intothe instrument under which independence would be granted some form of words recognising the continuing interest of the UnitedKingdom Government in the defence installations. There were, inhis view, strong arguments in favour of the first course; the retentionof sovereignty would secure to us a clear legal right to the unrestricteduse of the military installations. All recent experience suggested thatreliance on a defence treaty or some alternative arrangement on thesame lines would be less effective and that our position under sucha treaty would be progressively weakened by political action. It wasnoteworthy that the President of Cyprus had welcomed the fact thatthe existence of the sovereign base areas made it possible for him torefuse to accept any responsibility for British activities within these areas.The Minister of Defence said that, while he accepted the critical importance of maintaining the viability of our defence installations in Aden, he doubted whether that object would best be met by seeking to retain British sovereignty over limited areas of the Colonyon the lines proposed. In the first place, there would be the greatestpractical difficulty in so doing. Aden Colony was small and densely populated, and the military installations did not form a compactwhole. To retain sovereignty over the airfield at Khormaksar forexample would produce immediate difficulties about the civil use ofKhormaksar and about such matters as access and services, e.g.,water supplies and fuel storage. Another area over which it wouldbe necessary to retain sovereignty lay across the trunk road linking
the two main centres of population in the Colony. Quite apart fromthese serious practica1 difficulties, for which experience in Cyprusprovided no parallel, there would also be political objections. Allthe advice he had received was; to the effect that a proposal at thisstage to retain British sovereignty over defined military areas wouldmake negotiations for a merger very much more difficult and wouldlessen rather than imp.ove the prospects of a satisfactory settlement.In discussion it was agreed that, in spite of the political consequences, negotiations for a merger of the Aden Colony withthe Aden Federation should proceed on the lines already authorised.The Prime Minister said that he would wish to discuss further with the Ministers concerned the question of retaining sovereignty over the military areas. It would be helpful to him if theCommonwealth Secretary, together with the Lord Chancellor andthe Minister of Defence, could give further thought to the issues involved and to the relative advantages and disadvantages of thevarious courses open to us.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to proceed with negotiations for a merger of Aden Colony with the AdenFederation.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Minister of Defence and the Lord Chancellor, to give further thought to the maintenance of United kingdom control over our present defence facilities in Aden andto report their conclusions to the Prime Minister.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (62) 131) about Dr. Robert Soblen, a United Statescitizen who had been convicted in the United States of espionage onbehalf of Russia and sentenced to imprisonment for life. Pendinghis appeal, which was eventually dismissed, he had been released onbail and had made his way to Israel. He had been expelled from there as an illegal immigrant and placed on an aircraft bound for new York. He had arrived at London Airport in transit and in theordinary course he would have been refused leave to land in thiscountry; but, shortly before his aircraft landed, he had contrivedto wound himself so seriously that it became necessary to removehim to hospital. Subsequently, a formal notice of refusal of leave to land was served on him and, when he had recovered from hisinjuries, he was removed to Brixton Prison until arrangements couldbe made for his departure. An application for habeas corpus wasmade on his behalf, but was rejected by the Divisional Court andby the Court of Appeal. Representations were now being made onhis behalf by Members of Parliament, who had urged that, insteadof being sent to the United States, he should be allowed to go to czechoslovakia, which would be willing to receive him.The Home Secretary said that Dr. Soblen&apos;s advisers had now decided not to try to obtain leav to appeal to the House of lords on the habeas corpus issue, but to rely instead on political pressuresfor permission for him to proceed to Czechoslovakia. These pressureswould be based cn the argument that, apart from the self-inflictedwounds from which he had now recovered, Dr. Soblen was in an advanced stage of leukaemia and that it would be inhuman to compela dying man to return to face imprisonment in the United States. Itwas in fact impossible to predict for how long Dr. Soblen would live,and there were no grounds for suggesting that he was unfit to travel.There were, however, other difficulties. Espionage was not anextraditable offence; and, if a man were refused leave to land underthe Aliens Order, there was no obligation to send him to his country
C.C. 52 (62)of origin. It could therefore be represented as unnecessarily harshto take steps to ensure his return to the United States, instead of allowing him to go to Czechoslovakia. The Home Secretary saidthat, even so, on a balance of all the considerations, he recommendedthat Dr. Soblen should be sent to the United States.Discussion showed that there was general support in the cabinet for the course recommended by the Home Secretary. Dr. Soblenhad been convicted of espionage on behalf of Russia, and hisoffence had been sufficiently serious to warrant a sentence of lifeimprisonment; and it would be offensive to public opinion, both inthe United States and in this country, if he were now allowed to seekrefuge in a country within the Soviet bloc. If he had not contrivedto wound himself on arrival at London Airport, he would not havebeen allowed to remain here at all and would have continued on hisjourney to the United States. Now that he had recovered from theseself-inflicted wounds, it was right that he should be required to resume his interrupted journey.Further discussion followed on the method and timing ofanswering the representations made on his behalf by Members ofParliament. The Cabinet finally concluded that the balance ofadvantage was in favour of a statement in the House of commons on 2nd August.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that Dr. Robert Soblen should be placed on an aircraft bound for the United States, and authorised theHome Secretary to make arrangements accordingly.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to announce this decision in astatement in the House of Commons on 2nd August.Cotton(previous reference :C.C. (62) 39thConclusions,Minute 8)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (62) 130) on the import of cotton textiles from Pakistan.The President of the Board of Trade said that, while India and hong Kong had agreed to limit their exports of cotton piece goods and made-up goods and to introduce a new restriction on exports ofyarn, Pakistan had refused to do so. India and Hong Kong had made it clear that their agreement depended on Pakistani acceptance of similar limitations, and in default of any restriction on imports fromPakistan they would feel free to raise the level of their own imports.This would create a most difficult situation for the Government whowere already fully committed, not only to the Lancashire industry butalso to Parliament, to ensure that the existing level of imports wouldbe maintained until the end of 1965. There would also berepercussions on the negotiations in Brussels for the United Kingdom&apos;sentry into the European Economic Community. He had thereforereached the conclusion that it would be necessary to imposequantitative restrictions on import of cotton textiles from Pakistanif she maintained her refusal to accept such restrictions voluntarily.This would be the first occasion on which we had restricted importsof manufactured goods from a sterling Commonwealth country.He had therefore thought it right to seek the Cabinefs authority.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The political consequences of this action would be serious.It would provoke complaint that India was receiving better treatmentthan Pakistan; it would weaken Pakistani support of the CentralTreaty Organisation and of the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation;and  it  would put  a  strain on  Pakistani  relations  with  the
Commonwealth. It would be desirable to consult the HighCommissioner in Pakistan about the terms of any communication tothe Pakistan Government and of any public announcement of our intentions.(b) While it would be essential by one means or another to restrict cotton imports from Pakistan to the agreed levels, it wouldbe desirable to continue for the time being our efforts to achieve thisvoluntarily. The matter could if necessary be left open for discussionwith the President of Pakistan when he came to London for theMeeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers in September. In themeantime the Pakistan Government should be warned again thatwe might in the last resort have to consider the imposition of quantitative restrictions if agreement could not be reached voluntarily.The consequent delay in reaching agreement would involve a slightrisk that imports of yarn from Pakistan might increase above the agreed levels, since the previous voluntary agreement about importsof yarn had expired on 1st July, 1962; but this must be accepted.(c) The Governments of India and Hong Kong could be informed that once that the level of imports of cotton textiles from Pakistanwould continue to be controlled but that a public announcementmight be delayed until the end of September.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, if the Pakistan Government could not be persuaded voluntarily to restrict to the existing levelstheir exports of cotton textiles and yarns to the UnitedKingdom, the United Kingdom Government would themselves have to take steps to ensure, by one meansor another, that imports from Pakistan did not exceed those levels.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to consider, inconsultation with the Commonwealth Secretary, how thisdecision could best be conveyed to the pakistan government and how they could best be induced toaccept it.(3) Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to make it plain to the Governments of India and Hong Kong that,though a formal announcement might have to be delayed,means would be found of maintaining at their existinglevels the import into the United Kingdom of cotton textiles and yarns from Pakistan.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (C. (62) 129) reporting theresult of further consideration by the Future Legislation Committeeof the legislative programme for 1962-63.C.C. (62) 48th The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster recalled that, at their conclusions, meeting on 19th July, the Cabinet had invited him to arrange for the minute 2) Future Legislation Committee to consider further, in consultationwith the Ministers concerned, a number of Bills for which it hadnot seemed practicable to provide an assured place in the legislative programme for 1962-63. He now proposed that the Bill on children and Young Persons should be included in the main programme.Apart from the two small Bills to extend the scope of the colonial development Corporation and to amend provisions relating to commonwealth Scholarships, there would not be room for morethan one additional Bill and he had suggested in C. (62) 129 that thisshould be the Companies (Deposits) Bill. It might, however, bethought advisable to legislate about contracts of service earlier than had been intended. He would consider further with the Secretaryof State for Scotland the scope of the Bill described as the CriminalLegislativeProgramme,1962-63(previous reference :
Public 5.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the ChiefExpenditure Secretary. Treasury (C. (62) 117), on the forecast estimates for(Previous 1963-64 and (C. (62) 121) on the level of public service investmentReference: in 1963-64.  iSLlv The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that on the basis of presentMinute 3) forecasts the estimates for 1963-64 stood at a total of  6,080 million.Forecast This represented an increase of about  500 million, nearly 81 perEstimates cent on the preceding year.   The Departmental programmes on1963-64 &apos; which the present forecasts had been based would be subject toJustice (Scotland) Bill, for which a place had already been reservedin the programme. On this basis the Bills which would have tobe omitted from the programme for the coming session wereAdministration of Justice (Funds in Court), Airports Authority,Public Libraries, Underground Parking and Severn Bridge Tolls.In discussion there was general agreement that the Children and young Persons Bill should be included in the main programme. Itwas suggested that the claims of Companies (Deposits) were stronger than those of Administration of Justice (Funds in Court), but before a decision was taken to include the former further consideration should be given to the possibility of a Bill to deal with contracts ofservice. The Companies (Deposits) Bill had already been draftedand it would be convenient that the Bill on contracts of service and(provided that the problem of funds in court could not be dealt withby means short of legislation) the Administration of Justice (funds in Court) Bill should be drafted. Provisions should also be draftedto deal with legal aid in civil proceedings and further thought shouldbe given to the possibility that these could be included in the sameBill with Scottish provisions on legal aid in criminal cases. It wasnot at present intended that the National Incomes Commission shouldbe established on a statutory basis, but if legislation proved to benecessary for this purpose the programme would have to be adjusted to provide for it.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to include in the legislative programme for 1962-63the Children and Young Persons Bill, the colonial development Corporation Bill and the CommonwealthScholarships (Amendment) Bill.(2) Agreed to consider, when The Queen&apos;s Speech on theOpening of Parliament was in preparation, whether theprogramme should include a Bill on contracts of service or the Companies (Deposits) Bill.(3) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the chief secretary, Treasury, to consider how far the objects ofthe Administration of Justice (Funds in Court) Bill couldbe secured without legislation, and to inform theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster of the conclusion reached.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland,to consider further the scope of the Criminal Justice(Scotland) Bill and in particular whether it should be confined to provisions on legal aid.(5) Took note that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,as Chairman of the Future Legislation Committee, would authorise the drafting of a Bill on contracts of service,and of provisions on the investment of funds in court and legal aid in civil proceedings.
PublicServiceInvestmentdetailed scrutiny in the normal way and some economies might beexpected to result. But if any real impact was to be made on theestimates and if the economic policy of the Government requiredsubstantial reductions, special measures would be required. Amongthe larger increases included in the present forecasts were those for defence and for pay; the latter figure assumed that the recent awardto the Civil Service would be reflected in the months to come incorresponding increases in public service remuneration generally.In discussion it was the general view of the Cabinet that increases of the order now in prospect could only be justified against the background of a general expansion in the economy; it was stilluncertain whether such an expansion could confidently be predicted;the present outlook was not wholly encouraging.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for an examination of the forecast estimates for 1963-64 in thelight of the general development of the economy over theperiod and to bring his conclusions before them fordiscussion at a later meeting.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that, while it had beenpossible to secure large reductions in the proposals for public service investment originally submitted by Departments, the total increaseabove the level of investment for 1962-63 would probably be about9i per cent. He recalled that the then Chancellor of the Exchequer,in a statement in February 1962, had said that under Governmentplans as they then stood the increase would be only about 6 per cent.There had, however, been certain changes in the political andeconomic situation since February which might justify the larger increase now proposed. Much of the increase would be concentrated in local authority housing, in minor works for school building, inthe building of approved schools and remand homes and inmiscellaneous local government expenditure.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that in his own view it wouldbe inadvisable to announce at this stage a decision to increase the levelof public service investment next year. The fact that an increase hadbeen authorised would become known in various ways; but, if his proposal were accepted, the total levels of investment next year wouldnot become known until the publication of the normal White paper in October or November. He should, however, inform the Cabinetthat the Minister of Housing, who had been unable to be present,had expressed the view that it would be of advantage to announceimmediately the decision to increase the level of housing investmentnext year.In discussion there was general agreement that the levels ofpublic service investment set out in the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper shouldbe accepted, but that no public announcement should be made. Thefigures would be published in the normal way at the end of Octoberor November. The fact that so large a proportion of the increases would involve building work made it important to take every possible step to avoid overloading the industry in areas where there was already a large volume of building work in progress and to concentrateit so far as possible in areas of under-employment.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that public service investment for 1963-64 should beat the levels and on the basis set out in C. (62) 121.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theissue of a directive to the Ministers concerned about theallocation to particular areas of the country of theincreased volume of building work which would result from this larger programme.
Education 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Minister(Previous        of Education (C. (62) 128) on the problem of expanding the outputReference:      Qf teacher training colleges.CC. (62) 34thConclusions, The Minister of Education said that, despite the efforts made to minute 3) reduce the size of school classes, there would probably be about twoSupply of million children in over-size classes in primary schools in 1970. ThisTeachers represented a serious worsening of the present position, as contrasted with the improvement which the Government had hoped to achieve.There had been an unexpected increase in the birth-rate, and therewas an increasing tendency toward early marriage among womenteachers. Wastage from the latter cause amounted to about half theoutput of teacher training colleges, and the first means of increasingthe number of teachers should be to encourage women teachers toreturn to the teaching profession after marriage. He proposed to investigate, by social survey, the obstacles which stood in the wayof this. He also believed that, without reversing the decision to baseteacher training on a three-year instead of a two-year course, it wouldbe possible to obtain a larger number of teachers from the presenttraining system. There was scope for concentration of the course and for extended use of the &quot; sandwich &quot; principle by alternatingstudy and a higher proportion of teaching practice. There might also be scope for the employment of some form of sub-professionalgrade of teacher; if so, this would enable more efficient use to bemade of those who were highly qualified. He thought it important,however, not to alienate the teaching profession and the universities and training colleges by reverting to a two-year course.These measures would substantially increase the number of teachers available by 1970 but they would not meet the needs in full.The National Advisory Council on Teacher Supply had recommended the provision of a further 10,000 places in teacher training colleges.An expansion of that order would involve capital expenditure of 8-10 million and additional running costs of some  6 million a year.He would wish to examine further with the Chief Secretary, Treasury,the size and the timing of the expansion. But he believed that, unless he could accept in principle that some expansion of the teacher training colleges should take place, he would not obtain theco-operation of the profession in the other measures which he had outlined.In discussion there was general agreement on the importanceof increasing the supply of teachers. It would not be expedient topress for a reduction of the training period to two years, even for teachers of infant classes; and there seemed to be no escape from an expansion in the number of training college places.In further discussion the following points were raised:(a) The plan for expansion would have to be kept under careful review in the light of movements in the birth-rate.(b) An examination of the obstacles to part-time teaching andto the re-employment of women teachers after marriage should beput in hand; and, since comparable problems arose in the nursingprofession, the Health Ministers should be associated with any surveyundertaken for this purpose.(c) Much of the shortage of teachers affected classes for childrenbetween the ages of five and six. While there would be no advantageat present in proposing an alteration in the provisions governing theminimum age for compulsory education, the possibility of making some change at a more suitable time should be kept under review.It might be possible to make education voluntary below a given age or to provide that compulsory attendance should begin, not at the term immediately following the child&apos;s fifth birthday, but at thenext Michaelmas term.
Covent GardenMarket(previous reference :C.C. (61) 39thConclusions,Minute 7)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Agriculture (C. (62) 127) about a proposal for a Private Bill toenable the Covent Garden Market Authority to rebuild the Marketoutside the Covent Garden area.The Minister of Agriculture said that the Market Authorityestablished by the Covent Garden Market Act, 1961 had nowconcluded that another site should be chosen for the Market andhad asked him to consent to the promotion of a Private Bill in thecoming session to give power to the Minister to designate a new siteby the Special Order Procedure. He felt some sympathy with theAuthority, who were anxious to avoid the loss of time which wouldresult if they could not promote a Bill until a site could be specified.He was committed to giving his consent to a Bill based on proposalswhich had general support, but he did not regard this undertakingas obliging him to consent to a Bill which did not specify a new site.To do so would be inconsistent with previous decisions, which had made it plain that the Government intended Parliament to have a proper opportunity of considering the objections from private interests which any new site was likely to attract. In view of thedifficulties which had arisen in proceedings on the Bill to establish the Authority, he had thought it right to inform the Cabinet of thepossibility that rejection of the Authority&apos;s request might stimulatesome public criticism.In discussion there was general agreement that a decision to giveconsent to a Bill which foreshadowed the compulsory purchase of anunspecified site could not be defended in Parliament.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Agriculture to inform the covent garden Market Authority that he could not consent to the promotion of a Bill which did not specify a site for theMarket.(d) Although problems of teacher training in Scotland were somewhat different, the Secretary of State for Scotland should bekept in close touch with the studies to be put in hand in Englandand Wales.(e) There might be some tactical advantage in ensuring that in discussions with educational authorities the Governments proposals about the expansion of teacher training colleges were linked with proposals about other main items of educational expenditure, suchas the building programme and school meals and milk.The Cabinet (1) Accepted in principle that there should be some expansion in the programme for providing places in teacher training colleges in England and Wales.(2) Invited the Minister of Education, in consultation with theChief Secretary, Treasury, to consider further the numberof places to be provided and the timing of the programme.(3) Authorised the Minister of Education to proceed with theother measures to increase the supply of teachers, and tomake greater use of teaching auxiliaries, set out inC. (62) 128.(4) Invited the Minister of Education, in consultation with theChief Secretary, Treasury, and the Secretary of State forScotland, to consider means of linking, in discussions witheducational interests, the Governments proposals abouttraining college expansion with proposals affecting other major items of educational expenditure.
Shipping(previous reference:C.C. (62) 49thConclusions,Minute 7)Cabinet Office, S.W.1.1st August, 1962.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Transport (C. (62) 125) on the report of the Advisory committee under Lord Rochdale which had been appointed to examine theworking of major docks and harbours in Great Britain.The Minister of Transport said that the conclusions of the report were controversial, and the longer the Government delayed theannouncement of their decisions the more pressure would be exertedby the interests concerned for special treatment and for subsidies.He was for this reason anxious to make rapid progress. Under theproposals summarised in his memorandum official discussions wouldbe pursued during August and September, and would be followedby discussions with outside bodies as soon as the report had been published in the autumn. He would hope that decisions would thenbe taken on some of the recommendations and that a White paper would be published embodying these. There would then be lessscope for the mounting of a campaign against the Committee&apos;conclusions. He also sought the Cabinefs authority to establish aNational Ports Authority on a non-statutory basis: though it wouldhave no power to compel action, it could make a useful preliminarycontribution by collecting information and framing plans for subsequent execution by a statutory body.In discussion it was suggested that after officials had consideredthe report, but before any discussions had taken place with outsideauthorities, the Ministers proposals should be considered in more detail by the Economic Policy Committee. It would also be desirable for the Minister to keep in touch with the Secretary of State forScotland on the implications of the report for Scotland.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals outlined in C. (62) 125 for handling the Rochdale Report on docks and harbours.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to bring more detailed proposals before the Economic Policy Committee forconsideration and approval before any discussions were held with outside authorities.(3) Took note that the Minister of Transport would consult withthe Secretary of State for Scotland on the economic and social implications of those recommendations in thereport which concerned docks and harbours in Scotland.
