C.C. 73 (62)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The House would rise for the Christmas recess on 21st december and would reassemble on 22nd January.Foreign Affairs       2.   The Foreign Secretary said that the pressure for an earlyCongo Republic settlement in the Congo would increase as a result of the decision of(Previous        the Government of India to withdraw their troops during January.Reference:      The Secretary-General of the United Nations, U Thant, and theC.C. (62) 71st   United States Government were prepared to use sanctions againstConclusions,    Katanga either by calling for an embargo on purchases of KatanganMinute 1)       copper or by preventing the passage of copper exports from Katangato Northern Rhodesia.   Sanctions of this kind were likely to lead tofighting of a kind with which the United Nations would be particularlyill-equipped to deal, quite apart from its political effects.   Theimposition of sanctions and still more any proposals involving the deliberate use of force by the United Nations would require a freshresolution from the Security Council.The Foreign Secretary said that he had discussed with the PrimeMinister of Belgium. M. Spaak, and with Mr. McGhee, the UnitedStates special envoy to the Congo, a policy designed to lead to asettlement by negotiation. The essence of this policy was that thetwo major points of difficulty, the division of revenue between theCentral Government and the Government of Katanga, and agreement on a federal type of Constitution containing satisfactory guarantees for Katanga, should be settled by recourse to independent arbitration.The division of revenues would be referred to the international monetary Fund and the constitutional issue to the Prime Minister of nigeria. This plan had been rejected by U Thant, who appearedto believe that recourse to arbitration would be inconsistent with theplan for national reconciliation which he had himself put forward.M. Spaak had now gone to New York to discuss the situation witnU Thant and with the United States Government. As a result, itwas proposed that Mr. Adoula, the Prime Minister of the CentralGovernment of the Congo, should be invited to New York to discussthe outlines of a possible settlement. If Mr. Adoula could be broughtto the point of agreement, Mr. Tshombe, the Prime Minister of katanga, would subsequently be invited to New York and would be presented with a settlement which he would be invited to acceptwithout argument. If he refused, there would probably be a resort to sanctions of one kind or another.The Foreign Secretary said that it would be necessary for theGovernment to settle their policy on the Congo in the light of theserecent developments, and to announce it publicly. In his view theproper course would be to continue to press for a negotiated settlement, if necessary with recourse to arbitration on the lines hehad suggested. There could be no question of the Governmentssupporting the use of sanctions; not only because of the probability that they would lead to fighting, but because of political reactions inthis country and because the United Nations might be moved at some later stage to consider the imposition of sanctions against SouthernRhodesia and South Africa. He had been asked by M. Spaak totake part in the current discussions in New York and in those whichit was proposed to hold with Mr. Adoula. He saw considerabledifficulty in accepting this invitation.   Apart from the fact that
Mr. Adoula might not agree to come to New York, the negotiations would be on a basis which he felt the Government could not approve;and if he became involved in them it would be more difficult for theGovernment to dissociate themselves from subsequent developments.In discussion the following points were made:(a) If sanctions took the form of calling for an embargo onpurchases of Katangan copper, the Governments best course ofaction might be to maintain British purchases of Katangan copper atthe average level of the past few years, which was insignificant inrelation to total output. It would however be helpful to the Cabinetto have before them some more detailed statement of the effect of an embargo on Katangan copper on the world market for copper as awhole, including the effect on Northern Rhodesia and the extent towhich shortages caused by the withdrawal of Katangan copper fromthe market could be made good from other sources, includingstockpiles.(b) Although the recent discussions between Mr. Tshombe andthe leaders of the two African Nationalist Parties in northern rhodesia were believed to have been largely political in content, itwould be almost inevitable that fighting in Katanga, once it had broken out, would to some extent involve Northern Rhodesia as well.(c) It was difficult to avoid the conclusion that the United StatesGovernment and U Thant were putting more pressure on mr. Tshombe than on Mr. Adoula and that the settlement which they appeared to have in mind was more favourable to the CentralGovernment than to Katanga. One reason for this partiality was nodoubt the extreme weakness of Mr. Adoula&apos;s political position andthe fear that if he were to fall from power the Congo would once again relapse into chaos or would be open to Soviet penetration.Nevertheless, it would be easier to contemplate the use of sanctionsif their object was to secure a settlement manifestly fair to both sides.In Mr. Adoula&apos;s case sanctions would present little difficulty; it would merely be necessary to withdraw the financial support which he was at present receiving.(e) It would be helpful to have a closer and more reasonedanalysis of the effects of a total withdrawal of the United Nationsfrom the Congo. Too much emphasis could be placed on the dangers of Russian infiltration. They would be taking on, as the united nations had found to their cost, an immense economic andadministrative burden, which would be more likely to be a liability to them than an asset. Their earlier experience in the Congo could hardly have been encouraging to them.Summing up the Prime Minister said that it would be necessary forthe Cabinet to give further thought to the Governments policy in the congo. It would be helpful if the Foreign Secretary would circulate a paper for their consideration. There were, broadly speaking, three possible courses of action. It would be possible to continue tosupport the resolution under which the United Nations were atpresent acting in the Congo, calling for a settlement by negotiation and for the use of United Nations troops solely in the interests of preventing civil war. Alternatively, it would be open to theGovernment to say that, in view of the continuing delay in reaching a negotiated settlement, more vigorous measures were called for.These could take the form of agreement between the major Powersand in the United Nations on the terms of a settlement which couldbe presented to world opinion as being fair and reasonable to bothsides. The idea of arbitration to which the Foreign Secretary had referred might well form an element in such a settlement. Once thelines of a settlement had been agreed, Mr. Tshombe and Mr. Adoulacould be invited to accept it. If they refused so to do there was then a further choice of action -either a recourse to sanctions or the
withdrawal of the United Nations presence from the Congo. in reaching a decision it would be important to look carefully at thereasons which had led the United States Government to take adifferent view from our own about the results of the imposition of sanctions.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to bring before them, forconsideration at a later meeting, a paper setting out the implications of the various courses open to theGovernment in relation to the Congo, including an assessment of the effect of a total withdrawal of the united nations from the Congo.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to circulate, fortheir information, a memorandum describing the probable effects on the world copper market if supplies of copperfrom Katanga were to be cut off either by an embargo orby physical means.The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Governmenthad still not recognised the republican regime in the Yemen; theterms of the statements to be made as a condition of United Statesrecognition by President Nasser of Egypt, and Brigadier Sallal, the leader of the new regime in the Yemen, were still under negotiation.It was hoped that the latter would include a specific undertaking to preserve friendly relations with Aden Colony and the aden protectorate. It was not necessary for the Government to take animmediate decision about recognition, but it would not, in his view,be possible, once the United States Government had decided torecognise the new regime, to delay doing so ourselves for more thana limited period of time.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the discussions whichhe had recently held in Aden had strongly confirmed the view that united Kingdom recognition of the new regime in the Yemen wouldhave a damaging effect on our position in the area. If the republicanauthorities in the Yemen were not, even at this stage, prepared torecognise the existence of British interests in Aden and to undertaketo maintain friendly relations with the Colony and Protectorate, itwas impossible not to conclude that their intentions were hostile. Inthese circumstances it would be far better to lose diplomatic representation in the Yemen than to weaken in any way our supporters in Aden and our power to maintain our vital defence interests. The position of the United States Government was not comparable; they had no direct interests in the area.The Prime Minister said that two separate issues were involved.Up to the present we had sought to persuade the United States to delay recognition of the new regime and in any event to secure asthe price of recognition concessions from the Egyptian Governmentand from the republican authorities in the Yemen which would beof help to us in the context of our interests in Aden. But once theUnited States Government had actually recognised the new regimea new situation would be created and it would be necessary to decideat that stage whether we should follow suit. Such a decision couldnot be easily taken in advance of the event; it would depend not onlyon the precise conditions under which recognition by the United StatesGovernment had in the event taken place, but on current developments in Aden itself.The Cabinet (3) Took note of these statements.
ft V19 rj south-east asia TreatyOrganisa-tion(Previous .Reference:C.C. (62) 50thConclusions,Minute 5)Cambodia3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C. (62) 200) concerning proposals from theGovernment of Cambodia for an international conference to draw upa treaty safeguarding their country.The Foreign Secretary said that, following intrusions over theCambodian border by Thai and South Vietnamese troops, PrinceSihanouk of Cambodia had asked in August 1962 for an international conference to draw up a treaty for his country similar to that for Laos.This had been frustrated because the non-Communist Powers hadnot taken up the proposal for fear of being involved in freshcommitments. Prince Sihanouk had now produced a draft agreement which not only provided for the neutrality and independence ofCambodia, but also asked for guarantees of the frontiers No doubthe hoped to commit the United States to restrain Thai and Vietnameseintrusions, and he had threatened to call in Chinese troops for thepurpose if his proposals were rejected by the West. The FrenchGovernment seemed disposed to accept Prince Sihanouk&apos;s proposals but, from the point of view of the United Kingdom, it seemedundesirable to extend existing commitments by such guarantees.We had certain obligations under the South-East Asia treaty organisation, but the proposed guarantees would go beyond themand might indeed operate against one of the members of theOrganisation itself. In the circumstances the Foreign Secretarysuggested that our object should be to go some way towards meetingPrince Sihanouk&apos;s proposals by seeking arrangements for the delimitation and demarcation of the Cambodian frontiers, and for control of border incidents by Mixed Commissions under international supervision which would obviate the need for frontier guarantees.In discussion there was general agreement with the foreign secretary&apos;s proposals. The differing view of rhe French Government,however, was a major difficulty which, subject to developments mthe meanwhile, might need to be included among the subjects fordiscussion at the next meeting between the Prime Minister andGeneral de Gaulle.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement by the foreign secretary.EgyptFinancialAgreement(previous reference:C.C. (60) 59thConclusions,Minute 6)4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the foreign secretary (C. (62) 196 and 197) proposing additional assistance to thosewho had suffered in various ways from Egyptian actions since the Suezincident.The Foreign Secretary said that there had been criticism of theexisting arrangements for compensation, both in Parliament and outside it. The principal demands had been for an increase in theEgyptian Compensation Fund; for the extension of compensation tocertain claims not covered by the existing arrangements; for additional compensastion to United Kingdom officials dismissed by the egyptian government in 1951; for assistance in paying the fees of agentsemployed to arrange the return of property and transfer of assetsfrom Egypt; and for assistance to those who had property in Egyptwhich was released from sequestration but could not be enjoyed.His proposals were directed to each of these points. He proposedthat the Compensation Fund should be increased to provide 100 percent compensation on the first  10,000 as against 90 per cent on thefirst  5,000 at present, with similar increases in the relatively lowerpercentages of compensation on claims in excess of  10,000. Hesuggested a further  1 million to cover claims which fell outside the
normal terms for compensation but were covered by the provisions for registration of claims. He suggested that  200,000 should beadded to the similar sum already granted to the association of british officials dismissed by the Egyptian Government in 1951. Agents&apos; leesincurred by individual property owners should be met up to  100per head through the Foreign Office at a cost not exceeding  500,000.The total cost of these proposals would be about il\ million.The Foreign Secretary said that he was also proposingexpenditure of a further  2^ million on assistance to people who hadbeen obliged to leave substantial assets in Egypt. They had regainedownership of these assets, but in practice were unable to use themsince they were forbidden to export more than the first  E.5,000.Since many had no resources other than the assets which they had had to abandon, there was an argument on the ground of hardshipfor assisting them. He proposed that this should be done by settingup an independent committee to establish appropriate criteria andto make grants within the total of  24- million.The object of his proposals was to close the whole question ofthe obligations of the Government arising out of the Suez incident.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that, while he had agreedto the other proposals made by the Foreign Secretary, he was concerned that the provision of compensation for assets held in Egyptmight set a precedent for compensation for blocked paymentsgenerally.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It was difficult for many people possessing desequestratedassets to return to Egypt, and there were undoubtedly cases of hardship different in kind from those which occurred when a currencywas blocked.(b) The Government had undertaken to give information toParliament about the payments they intended to make under theForeign Compensation Bill before that Bill proceeded further inParliament. The timetable would therefore necessitate a statement on the proposed payments in both Houses not later than11th December.Summing up the Prime Minister said that the Foreign Secretary&quot;sproposals promised virtually to dispose of the issue of compensationfor property taken over by Egypt. As for desequestrated property which oould not be removed from Egypt, it was desirable that compensation should be payable in deserving cases, and it seemed that it would be possible to do this without creating a precedent forblocked payments generally. The committee which the foreign secretary had proposed should be given appropriate terms ofreference, in the drafting of which the Chancellor of the exchequer should be consulted.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals of the Foreign Secretary for further assistance to people who had suffered loss on account ofaction by Egypt, set out in C. (62) 196 and 197.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consult the Chancellor of theExchequer on the drafting of the terms of reference of acommittee to disburse compensation in cases of hardshipamong those holding desequestrated assets in Egypt.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the appropriateannouncements to be made in both Houses of Parliamentnot later than 11th December.
5. The Cabinet had before them two memoranda by theChancellor of the Exchequer, one (C. (62) 202) suggesting referenceto the National Incomes Commission of a recent settlement in theScottish building industry involving a substantial increase in earnings,and the other (C. (62) 194) relating to a proposal that the Governmentshould increase university teachers&apos; salaries by 10 per cent as from 1st April. 1963. and refer their pay to the National IncomesCommission for review.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the employers andtrade union representatives in the building industry in Scotland had agreed on a settlement which might increase the earnings of 90,000Scottish building workers by over 7 per cent. These workers hadalready received increases totalling about 16 per cent since October1961. The case was a classic example for reference to the national incomes Commission. In view of past increases, the increase nowproposed was unjustifiably large. The industry was almost wholiyprotected from foreign competition; it was prosperous, thanks in part to large-scale public contracts; and the dating of the new concessionfrom November 1963 ensured that the employers would be able topass most of the cost to their customers. The English buildingemployers and the British Employers&apos; Confederation had bothprivately pressed the Government to refer this settlement to theCommission, and the Chairman of the Commission had agreed thatit was a good case with which to launch the Commission^ work. Itwas proposed that the reference should be made by the treasury and announced by publication of the formal reference in the Londonand Edinburgh Gazettes and by release to the Press.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal.It was pointed out that, since workers in the Scottish building industryworked alongside those in the civil engineering industry, themanagement of the latter industry would be pressed to makecorresponding increases and, since that industry was organised on aGreat Britain basis, the effect would then be felt on workers in theEnglish building industry. Moreover, the building and civil engineering industries tended to set the pace in increases in wages.For instance, while the railway workers had received 14 per cent inincreases since January 1960 workers in the building industry hadreceived 22 per cent and, if they were now to receive still more, afurther claim must be expected in respect of railwaymen. It wastherefore important that the Government should keep the employers in the civil engineering and English building industries in touch withtheir intentions.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the recent settlement between the employers andtrade unions in the building industry in Scotland should bereferred to the National Incomes Commission.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange that the reference should be made by the Treasury and announced by publication in the London and Edinburgh Gazettes andin the Press.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that the last general increase in the salaries of university teachers had taken effect from 1st January, 1960, and had itself given rise to some ill-feeling in the universities. The Government had persuaded the University GrantsCommittee to postpone the submission of a further claim so that itcould be synchronised with a claim in respect of other teachers onwhich the Burnham Committee eventually reached provisional agreement in June 1961. This resulted, after modification by theGovernment, in increases of 144 per cent on average for teachers, andas much as 17 per cent for many teachers in colleges of advanced
stechnology, and was announced on 25th July, 1961, the very day when the proposals from the University Grants Committee were received and the pay pause was announced. When the Governmentwere considering what increase could be granted to universities atthe end of the pay pause, Treasury Ministers had favoured an increaseof 8-9 per cent but, because of the requirements of incomes policy atthe time, the Cabinet had decided that the university teachers couldonly have an average of 3 per cent from 1st April, 1962. Since then,the Burnham Committee had begun consideration of a claim tofurther increases for other teachers on which the Wages Committeehad authorised up to 3\ per cent with effect from 1st April, 1963.By then, therefore, unless increases were granted to university teachers in the meanwhile, they would have had an average of only 3 per centsince the beginning of 1960 while other teachers would have had anaverage of 171 per cent. It was therefore clear that the unversity teachers had a claim to revaluation of their pay. The Chairman ofthe National Incomes Commission had indicated that he was willingto accept a reference for a revaluation, but that this would take sixmonths or more. On the other hand, some increase in universitypay was required urgently, as recruitment for the academic year1963-64 would begin early in the New Year. Most members of theWages Committee had favoured an early announcement that theGovernment would provide funds for an average increase in university-teachers&apos; pay of 10 per cent with effect from 1st April, 1963, andwould invite the National Incomes Commission to carry out a fullrevaluation. Some Ministers, however, had felt than an increase of10 per cent could not be reconciled with a reference to theCommission.In discussion the following points were made:(a) An increase of 10 per cent could hardly be justified except inthe context of revaluation; and if such an increase were awarded atonce it would be difficult to ask the National Incomes Commission tocarry out a revaluation because the Government would have prejudgedthe issue. This difficulty would be overcome if the Government wereto offer nothing more than a token increase clearly intended as an interim payment.(b) On the other hand, it was important to restore theGovernments standing in the universities. Bearing in mind thehistory of university pay, there was now a strong moral case for asubstantial increase. The figure of 10 per cent was almost certainlybelow the average figure which the National Incomes commission would eventually recommend, and it could be argued on this groundthat the issue would not have been prejudged.(c) Without such an increase, the programme of expansion ofthe universities to which the Government were publicly committed,and particularly the expansion of the scientific faculties, might wellbe frustrated.(d) A number of influential groups, including the Royal Society,had recently been considering the effects of emigration on thecountry&apos;s resources of scientific manpower and, unless the government took decisive action before these reports were made public, they mighthave a damaging effect.(e) The University Grants Committee had indicated that, while10 per cent was substantially less than they had proposed, they wouldbe prepared to co-operate with the Government in distributing it; butthey regarded 10 per cent as the minimum acceptable figure.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that the Government should provide funds for anaverage increase in university teachers&apos; pay of 10 per cent,
and that university teachers&apos; pay should be referred tothe National Incomes Commission for revaluation.Public The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the timing of theAnnouncements announcements would be important. So far as the reference to theScottish building industry was concerned, there would be advantage in early action. There had been a succession of wage increases invarious employments in the region of 6 per cent; it was known thatcertain Wages Councils were considering increases of the same order,and it was important not to give the impression that 6 per cent had become the standard for wage increases generally. For precisely thesame reason there might be advantage in delaying somewhat theannouncement of the 10 per cent increase in the provision for university salaries. He hoped that the Cabinet would authorise himto discuss this question in the Wages Committee.The Cabinet (4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forthe Wages Committee to discuss the timing of theannouncements giving effect to their decisions.Iron andSteelIndustry(previous reference:C.C. (62) 68thConclusions,Minute 4)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (C. (62) 199) proposing revised arrangements forthe sale of five small steel companies by the Iron and Steel holding and Realisation Agency.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, recalled that in the CabineLsprevious discussion it had been suggested that the Government wouldbe criticised if the sale of the companies to a consortium of steelinterests were at once followed by closure of one of them. Afterconsultation with the Home Secretary and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, and later with the Agency, he had concluded that much of the difficulty would be met if the sale were split He nowproposed that the two hematite companies should be sold, not to the consortium but to the Millom Haematite, Ore and Iron Company,Limited, who had previously made an offer for them. The remainingthree companies would be disposed of to the consortium as originally proposed. It seemed probable that the two transactions togetherwould yield the same return to the Agency as the sale of all companies to the consortium. Early closure of one of the hematite companieswas in any case unavoidable but, on the basis now proposed, thecompany in Barrow would be closed, rather than that inMiddlesbrough. From the local employment point of view, there might not be much to choose between the two possible closures, butclosure of the Barrow works could be represented as a normal commercial action by the new management and, since the works ofthe parent company were not far from Barrow, might provide a somewhat better prospect of alternative employment for those affected.In discussion there was general agreement that the revised arrangements for sale should be adopted. Although other companiesbesides the Barrow firm might have to be closed in due course, the consortium would not, on the basis now proposed, be obliged to embark on immediate closures. It would be desirable that theannouncement to be made should cover the sale of all five companiesbut, in view of the rising level of unemployment, every effort shouldbe made to ensure that the Barrow works did not close before the spring of the coming year. It would have to be accepted that this might in practice be less advantageous to the Agency financially.
7. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretaryof State for Scotland and the Minister of Health (C. (62) 198) and theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (C. (62) 203) about thefluoridation of water supplies.The Minister of Health said that there was no doubt that theaddition of fluoride to drinking water would greatl) reduce decay inthe teeth of children, that it would have no harmful side-effects. TheGovernment were under growing pressure from local health authoritiesand professional bodies to encourage fiuoridation but nothing had sofar been undertaken beyond experiments (which had been successful)in three study areas. He and the Secretary of State for Scotland had concluded that the Government should now invite local health authorities to submit proposals under existing National health service legislation for the addition of fluoride to water supplies.There was some risk that the addition of fluoride would be challengedin the courts, since it could be argued that water undertakers, whowere required to provide a supply of &quot; pure and wholesome &quot; water,had no power to add anything to a supply which already met the requirement. If a challenge were successful, legislation would be needed but such legislation would not lay the Government open tothe criticism, which would be made if they initiated legislation now.that they were seeking to impose fluoridation as a general policy.In discussion the following points were raised:(a) The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that he didnot disagree with the action proposed but he thought the cabinet should be aware of the considerable volume of ill-informed opposition which it would be likely to attract.(b) It could be argued that in the long run it might be better tointroduce legislation straight away than to leave it until a challengesucceeded in the courts. It was the general view of the Cabinet,however, that legislation should not be embarked upon until the needfor it had become clear; a challenge in the courts might well fail.Local health authorities and water undertakers would be given an indemnity in respect of costs, direct or consequential, incurred incourt action.(c) A number of local health authorities would be ready to startadding fluoride as soon as any encouragement was given by theGovernment. The representative bodies in the water industry should,however, be consulted before any announcement was made.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Health to arrange for an announcement, on the linesdescribed in C. (62) 198, about the addition of fluoride to water supplies.Supply ofWaterFluoridationThe Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (62) 199 for sale by the Ironand Steel Holding and Realisation Agency of five smallsteel companies, and invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury,to seek to delay closure of the Barrow Iron Works, Limited,for some months.
3^ 6MachineryofGovernmentModernisationof Britain(previous reference:CC. (62) 63rdConclusions,Minute 4)Meetingsof theCabinet8. The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would now have seen the paper (C. (62) 201) in which he had circulated for their information a copy of the minute which he had addressed to theChancellor of the Exchequer and to the Home Secretary. following the earlier discussion in Cabinet he had given some thought to themachinery for pressing ahead with the formulation of government policy for the modernisation of Britain, for giving proper weight toits short and long-term aspects, and for ensuring consistency of purpose. He had decided that, while it would be right to entrust the bulk of the necessary preparatory work to the Economic PolicyCommittee and to the Population and Employment Committeerespectively, it would be helpful if he himself were to review progressat regular intervals with the Chairmen of these two Committees andwith any other Ministers immediately concerned in proposals underdiscussion. It would of course be necessary to bring major proposals before the Cabinet for decision but, by following the procedure hehad described, he hoped to do so in a more co-ordinated and constructive way than would otherwise have been possible.The Prime Minister said that he had formed the view that itwould in principle be desirable in future to confine Cabinet meetingsto one a week normally on Thursday morning. To make this possible and to secure the relief to Ministers which he hoped might result, it would be necessary to despatch as much government business as possible in the main Cabinet Committees particularly the Home Affairs Committee and the Economic Policy Committee.He hoped that the Chairmen of these Committees would make everyeffort to avoid reference to Cabinet of questions on which theirCommittees had initially failed to reach agreement. He recognisedthat it would not always be possible to despatch in a single meetingeach week all the business that was worthy of the Cabinefs attention,particularly in the periods of greatest pressure immediately before christmas and the summer recess. Nevertheless, if a single weekly meeting for routine Cabinet business could become the rule ratherthan the exception, he felt that it would be of help to Ministers inthe conduct of the business of their own Departments. It would also make time available for occasional special meetings of the Cabinetto discuss a single question of major policy, and thus help to securethe full exchange of views which was always desirable, but was so often difficult to secure when there were many items of business tobe dealt with.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of these statements by the PrimeMinister.9. The Lord Privy Seal said that in the resumed Ministerialdiscussions in which he would take part in Brussels during thefollowing two weeks the main subjects would be domestic agricultureand the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).On domestic agriculture, it had already been made clear to theCC (62)63rd Six that it would not be possible to accept their proposal that theConclusions, United Kingdom system of deficiency payments should be replaced,Minute 3) immediately on our entry into the Community, by a system of consumer or producer subsidies. It was not yet clear what conclusionshad been reached in discussions among the Six on the previous day,but he understood that the Commission, who had previously beenin agreement with the French in refusing to concede continuance of deficiency payments, were showing more flexibility; and the Frenchthemselves might now be expected to be more accommodating.It would be necessary to remove misunderstandings which had arisen about Article 234 of the Treaty of Rome (on obligationsEuropeCommonMarketNegotiations(previous reference:
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,6th December. 1962.incurred prior to membership) and our obligations under the ETTAConvention. The French had sought to interpret the latter as requiring us to give a year&apos;s notice of termination before our entry into the Community. The negotiations for associating the threeneutral members of EFTA with the Community could not be concluded a year before 1st January, 1964, which was the date of entry towards which we had been working. Discussions on thesematters had aroused anxieties among our partners in EFTA. Butthe question of a year&apos;s notice should not arise if it were possible toagree special interim arrangements between the enlarged community and those members of EFTA who had not concluded their negotiations in time to become formally associated with theCommunity at the same time as we entered it.More generally, it had become evident that little progress couldbe expected in the Brussels negotiations until the series of meetings which would begin on 14th January. The French had accepted aproposal made by the Belgian Prime Minister, M. Spaak, that, ifnecessary, there should then be a long Ministerial meeting; and,although they had not accepted his further suggestion that thenegotiations should be concluded in that series of meetings, there was every hope of substantial progress being made. It had always beenaccepted that the issues which presented difficulty would not be resolved until the negotiating Ministers could have the whole range of problems before them.The First Secretary of State said that the Common MarketNegotiations Committee had taken the view at their meeting on theprevious day that any system of consumer subsidies would be unacceptable and that means would have to be found to enable thesystem of deficiency payments to continue at least for some time afterthe United Kingdom joined the Community.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Lord Privy Seal and theFirst Secretary of State.
