South-east asia treaty organisation laos(previous reference:C.C. (62) 2ndConclusions,Minute 4)1. The Foreign Secretary said that, despite the pressuresexercised by the United States Government, General Phoumi was stillunwilling to accept the proposals for a national government of Laoswhich had been formulated by Prince Souvanna Phouma. The threePrinces had therefore been summoned to Geneva. If agreement could not be reached there, an attempt might be made to persuade the King of Laos to exert further pressure on General Phoumi. Itmust, however, be recognised that, if the formation of a national government were delayed much longer, there was a grave risk thatfighting would be resumed in Laos. In that event the question would again arise of armed intervention under the auspices of the South-east asia Treaty Organisation.The Prime Minister recalled that at an earlier stage we had reluctantly accepted a limited commitment to support such anintervention. We must now hold ourselves free to consider thatafresh in the light of the new circumstances.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to submit a memorandum onthe likely course of developments in Laos if the currentefforts to form a national government were unsuccessful.A2CongoRepublic(previous reference:C.C. (62) 2ndConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Foreign Secretary said that there had been some improvement in the situation in the Congo. The central Governmenthad strengthened their position by enforcing Mr. Gizenga&apos;s return toLeopoldville, without active assistance from United Nations troops.They had also concluded an agreement for the exchange of prisonerswith Katanga. There now seemed to be some hope of progress towards conciliation, if the Prime Minister of Katanga could continueto honour the agreement which he had concluded at Kitona and ifthe United Nations authorities refrained from pressing too vigorouslythe policy of hunting down the mercenaries in Katanga.The Lord Privy Seal said that the acting Secretary-General of theUnited Nations had assured him, during his recent visit to New York,that his aim in the Congo was to promote conciliation between thecentral Government and Katanga and to work towards the withdrawalof United Nations forces. There was in fact a greater need in the congo for reinforcements of police, rather than of troops; and thepossibility of borrowing police from Nigeria was now underconsideration.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Indonesia 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that on the previous day Dutch(Previous warships had intercepted a number of Indonesian motor torpedoReference: boats which were in Dutch waters and appeared to be making force.C.

In the light of that review he recommonded that for the time being no fresh licences should begranted for the export of arms to Indonesia.   Where licences had
germany berlin(previous reference:C.C. (62) 1stConclusions,Minute 3)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (62) 12) summarising the impressions which he had formed on his recent visit to West Berlin.The Foreign Secretary said that he had been struck by thethoroughness with which West Berlin had now been sealed off, notonly from East Berlin, but from East Germany. West Berlin was now surrounded by something like a permanent frontier. This might mean that, having dealt in this way with their immediate anxietiesabout East Germany, the Soviet Government might be less concerned to negotiate about the status of West Berlin. They might be moreready to accept continuance of the status quo. If so, this mightexplain the unresponsive attitude which the Soviet Foreign minister had adopted in the opening stages of his conversations with the UnitedStates Ambassador in Moscow. So far, these had not offered any prospect that a basis for further negotiation would be found; and it seemed doubtful whether they would be fruitful so long as the ambassador was precluded from discussing the subjects on which theSoviet Government were seeking concessions from the West. we might soon be faced with a choice between continuing these conversations, with little prospect of progress, or proposing a meetingof Foreign Ministers. Meanwhile, however, serious study would haveto be made of the two documents which the Soviet Foreign Ministeralready been issued, deliveries could be delayed for a time by administrative means; but before long the Government would be pressed to take some public position in respect of these deliveries andit might then be desirable to say that these licences had been temporarily suspended. A decision was also required about the twoGannet aircraft (the last instalment of an order of eighteen) which hadalready been delivered to Indonesian authorities in this country andwere due to be flown out to Indonesia in the course of the next fewdays.After discussion it was agreed that it would not be practicable to prevent the departure of the two Gannet aircraft which were already in the possession of Indonesian authorities in this country.This being so, there was no sufficient reason to prevent the despatchof the two spare Gannet engines forming part of the originalIndonesian order for Gannets. This, however, would make it all themore necessary that the Government should take some public position on the supply of other arms and warlike stores to Indonesia. It wasagreed that it could be publicly stated that, as a temporary measureuntil the situation in West Irian had clarified, the Government had decided that no further licences would be granted for the export ofarms and warlike stores to Indonesia and that, where such licenceshad been granted, delivery would be postponed for the time being.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no action should be taken to prevent the departure of the two Gannet aircraft which were already in the possession of Indonesian authorities in this country,or the delivery of the two spare Gannet engines, which formed part of the original Indonesian order for Gannets.(2) Invited the Minister without Portfolio to arrange for theCommittee on Strategic Exports to delay the delivery ofother arms and warlike stores to Indonesia on the basisagreed in the Cabinefs discussion.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the DutchAmbassador in London to be informed of the substance of the Cabinet&apos;s decision; and to submit for the PrimeMinisters approval a draft of a public statement on theGovernments attitude towards the supply of arms to indonesia in present circumstances.
incomes policy(previous reference:C.C. (62) 3rdConclusions,Minute 1)Arbitration5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (62) 9) on the future of arbitration and by theChief Secretary, Treasury (C. (62) 10) on incomes policy for the public services.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Economic PolicyCommittee had considered three possible ways of ensuring thatGovernment policy on incomes was not undermined by arbitrationawards, particularly in the interim phase following the end of thewages pause. Legislation either to impose an obligation onarbitrators to take account of the national interest or to makearbitration compulsory would have the effect of uniting employersand work-people against the Government. A policy by whicharbitration awards in the public sector were limited by theGovernment to an amount consistent with national incomes policy would be attacked as being in conflict with promises already given that arbitration would be restored at the end of the pause and would materially reduce the prospect of persuading the Trades UnionCongress to co-operate in the National Economic development council. It would also be regarded as inconsistent with the principleof comparability with outside occupations as the basis for pay in thepublic sector. The third possibility would be to restore independentarbitration but to make it clear that progress towards the long-term objective of pay based on fair comparison with outside occupationswould be limited by what the country could afford; and that in anyarbitration proceedings the Government would argue the case notonly on comparability but on the effect of an award upon otherprospective awards and upon the economy generally. It would alsobe made clear that there could be no back-dating of awards into thepresent linancial year. If the Government adopted the third coursethere was, in his view, some prospect of securing the requisite restraint in arbitration awards. It would in any case be desirable to put intoeffect the suggestions made by the Minister of Labour in thememorandum annexed to C. (62) 9 for the publication of factualeconomic information and for strengthening the secretariat ofarbitration bodies.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that he would be asked, at ameeting later that day with representatives of the Staff Side of thenon-industrial Civil Service, whether the Government would fullyrestore recourse to the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal and theIndustrial Court. He believed that an answer on the lines indicated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer would be acceptable to the unions and that they might not be disposed to pursue the further question had handed to the United States Ambassador a draft statute for a free city of West Berlin, and a protocol embodying guarantees forWest Berlin.In discussion it was pointed out that there were serious dangersin delay. First, the local situation in Berlin was explosive; and therewas a continuing risk that some precipitate action might be takenthere which would provoke a crisis. Secondly, there were persistentrumours of a challenge to Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s authority within theSoviet Union; and, if his external policies were discredited, it wouldbecome even more difficult to reach agreement with the Russians over berlin. It was therefore important that the impetus towardsnegotiations on Berlin should be sustained.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement and of thepoints made in their discussion.
Incomes 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePolicy Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (62) 11) on certain outstandingCoal claims for wage increases.industry the Chancellor of The Exchequer said that there was a reasonable prospect that, in dealing with the current claim of the mine-workers,whether fair comparison with outside occupations would continue tobe the basis for determining pay in the Civil Service. It would bedesirable to avoid detailed discussion of the latter question because there could be no doubt that, however valuable the principle of comparability might have been in the past, experience showed thatin times of over-full employment it could result in a sequence ofinflationary settlements.In the Cabinefs discussion attention was drawn to the danger,which had always been foreseen, that the end of the wages pausewould be marked by a series of settlements or awards at levels much higher than would&quot; be consistent with the expected increase in productivity. If this happened the Government would be subjected to serious political criticism. Some risks would have to be faced,however, whichever course were adopted. On balance, the policywhich appeared to involve the least risk and to have the best prospectof success would be to adopt the third course and to seek toestablish in the minds of work-people, employers, arbitrators and thepublic at large the general case for restraint in incomes which hadalready been stated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the TradesUnion Congress.In further discussion the following points were raised :(a) Further consideration should be given to the question whetherincreases in pay in the public services should be kept within an upper limit of the order of, say, 1\ per cent., however long or short theperiod since the last settlement. If account were not taken of thetime which had elapsed since the last review the results would, insome cases, be inequitable. On the other hand, it would be dangerous to encourage the idea that increases of pay should be sought annually.(b) There were some signs that in the private sector the constantstress laid by the Government on the need to relate incomes to national productivity was beginning to have some effect.(c) The Cabinet were informed that the results of the review of pay in the Armed Forces resulting from the Governments acceptanceof the report of the Advisory Committee on Recruiting would normally be announced during February, to take effect on 1st April.It seemed likely that the review would point to increases for officersof about 4 per cent, and for other ranks of about 14 per cent. Itwould be unfortunate if the Government felt unable to make the review effective. They were firmly pledged to this system and anywithdrawal from it would have an adverse effect on recruiting.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Minister of Defence would consultTreasury Ministers when officials had reached agreement on the basis for the review of pay in the Armed Forces.(2) Agreed that in discussion with representatives ofnon-industrial civil servants the Chief Secretary, Treasury,should undertake that in the period following the end ofthe wages pause the existing restriction on arbitrationon Civil Service claims would be withdrawn on the clear understanding that there would be no back-dating of awards into the present financial year and that argumentsbased on the national interest would be advanced by theGovernment, both in negotiation and in arbitrationproceedings.
mRailways The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it would be whollyinconsistent with the Governments intentions for the interim periodfollowing the end of the wages pause if the Chairman of the british transport Commission made the offer of a 6 per cent, increase from 1st April, 1962, which he had wished to make in answer to the unions&apos;claim for 10-11 per cent. There seemed to be two possible courses of action: to make no offer at all, in the knowledge that this would lead to arbitration; or to offer, say, 2 per cent, with the prospect of going to arbitration after an initial round of bargaining. To make nooffer at all would increase the difficulties of the moderate sectionamong the union leaders; and it was also likely that, if this coursewere followed, the Government would be under greater pressure to bind themselves in advance to accept any arbitral award. If a smalloffer were made it might not be necessary to agree in advance toaccept the results of arbitration. The situation had changed in some respects since the earlier discussions with the Chairman of theCommission. The Trades Union Congress were still considering the invitation to join the National Economic Development Council; andthere was some reason to believe that the railway unions were not anxious to strike and might be prepared to settle for a figure withinthe limits acceptable to the Government.In discussion the following points were made:(a) If the unions knew that the Chairman of the Commissionregarded 6 per cent, as a fair offer, they would be well placed to pressC.C. 5 (62)the Chairman of the National Coal Board would be prepared to offersomething under a 4 per cent, increase for day-wage rates but to leaveexisting piece-work contracts unaltered. This would produce anincrease of about 2\ per cent, in the wage bill. If the unions rejectedthis offer, it would be open to the Coal Board to refuse to allow thedispute to go to arbitration; but, if it did go to arbitration, it wouldbe difficult for them to reject any award which might result.The Minister of Power said that the National Coal Board would open negotiations on the basis that any settlement would date from 1st May, 1962; they might be forced back in the course of negotiationto 1st April but would certainly stand firm on that date.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the National Coal Board would seek to settle the current claim of the mine-workers on the basis of anincrease of 2\ per cent, in the wage bill, and to avoidrecourse to abitration.Gas Industry jne Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the claim of the gas-workers for a substantial increase of wages was based on therecent award of a 5 per cent, increase to the electricity workers. Itcould, however, be argued that conditions were different in the gas industry, where no large surplus was being earned on current trading.He intended to urge the Chairman of the Gas Council to take a firmline in the national interest. It would be impossible to refuse recourse to arbitration if the unions rejected any offer made.The Cabinet-(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to urge upon theChairman of the Gas Council the importance in thenational interest of limiting any wage increase offered to workers in the gas industry.(3) Took note that, if the offer were rejected by the unions, itwould be impossible to avoid a reference to arbitration.
LondonBusmen andNursesIncomesPolicyUniversitySalaries7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (62) 8) on university salaries.theThe Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that university staffs hadreceived their last pay increase in January 1960. The university grants Committee had prepared a further recommendation early in1961 but had been persuaded by the Treasury to postpone it in thelight of the discussions then proceeding on teachers&apos; pay. It couldbe argued that but for this their recommendation would have beenconsidered before the beginning of the wage pause. Their presentrecommendation was for a 17 per cent, increase to date from August1961. After detailed discussion he had reached the view that, while there was no case for a 17 per cent, increase, there were good grounds for an increase of 8 or 9 per cent. He could not accept August 1961as the operative date; any award now made should run from August1962. The University Grants Committee maintained that, if theincrease were limited to 8 or 9 per cent., the whole of it would haveto be devoted to improvements in the salary scales of the two lowestgrades.   Discussion in the Economic Policy Committee had revealedtheir case in any arbitration proceedings. The Governments casemight go by default. It was for this reason more than ever important to persuade the Chairman to look at the matter in a broader nationalcontext and to recognise the critical importance of a settlement ofabout 3 per cent.(b) The railway problem would be complicated by any awardmade to the gas industry, which had entered into the Guillebaudcomparison. As compared with a factor of 100 in both industriesafter the Guillebaud award, wage levels in the gas industry alreadystood at 111 and the railways at 104. Any further award to the gas industry would increase the disparity.(c) Although it would not be possible to avoid recourse to arbitration if either party insisted on it, neither side was bound toaccept the award. In the past the employers had usually acceptedawards, but the men had held themselves free to reject them. On thepresent occasion it might be necessary for the Government to say inadvance that they would not accept any award greater than, say,3 per cent. The weakness of this course, which applied with equalforce to a statement by the Government that they would only beprepared to make a given sum of money available, was that if theTransport Commission for their part accepted the award the new rates would have to be paid and the money would have to be found.(d) One of the biggest obstacles in the way of a reasonable was the existence of the national agreement on railway wages. The Chairman of the Commission would himself be glad tobreak away from nation-wide rates but was not prepared to attemptthis in the present context. It might, however, be possible to press the advantages of such a change in argument before an arbitrator.The Cabinet (4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to be guided by theviews expressed in their discussion at his next meeting with the Chairman of the British Transport Commission.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was still a little time before decisions had to be reached on the outstanding claims for wage increases for London busmen and for nurses. He would revert to these at a later meeting of the Cabinet when they could be viewedin relation to developments on other claims.The Cabinet (5) Took note of this statement.
a marked difference of view; some members of the Committee had accepted the case for an 8 or 9 per cent, increase, but others had thought that, in view of the general policy on incomes which theGovernment were proposing to pursue, it should be restricted to something of the order of 3 per cent. He himself felt that so lowan offer would be hard to justify in relation to the 14 per cent, award of teachers and the 17+ per cent, award to the staffs of colleges of advanced technology. The Chairman of the University GrantsCommittee had said that an offer of 3 per cent, would destroy any hope of recruiting enough staff to meet the five-year expansion plan and that this plan would have to be revised, with lasting damage tothe relations between the Government and the universities.In discussion the following points were made:(a) There was some doubt about the strength of the recruitingargument. Even at present salary levels the universities wereattracting qualified candidates away from the administrative class ofthe Civil Service. Two years previously the University GrantsCommittee had prophesied a serious effect on recruiting if the awardthen under discussion were not backdated; but, although backdatinghad in the event been refused, recruiting had not been affected. Asagainst these arguments it was undeniable that the large expansion programme now contemplated would require a 56 per cent, increasein university staffs over a five-year period. Particular difficulties were likely to be met in obtaining scientists and mathematicians, for whom there was a heavy demand in industry. If the expansion programme were to succeed, it must be seen to command the full support of the Government.(b) It was argued that the Government should consider the teaching profession as a whole; and that any award now made touniversity staffs should be regarded in the context of the earlierawards to teachers and to the colleges of advanced technology andfor this reason outside the scope of the wage pause. It might bepossible to present the matter in this light by putting this argumentforward in answer to a Parliamentary Question without naming any specific figure, and reserving the amount of the award for a laterannouncement. As against this it was argued that subtleties of argument would count for little in the present climate of opinionabout incomes generally; the public would be more concerned withthe fact that in a field over which they had complete control theGovernment had elected to award an 8 or 9 per cent, increase. this consideration would have a particular bearing on the outstandingclaim by the nurses.(c) There were some attractions in the possibility of a splitaward, say, 3 per cent, from August 1962, with the promise of two further instalments of 3 per cent, at later dates; but this might bethought to perpetuate the lag between university staffs and the restof the teaching profession, especially as a further Burnham awardfor teachers was in prospect. If it were decided to limit the initialaward to 3 per cent, it might be better to couple this with the offer of a further review in, say, January 1963 than with the promise of afurther specific increase.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that themost important issue facing the Government was the problem of holding the line on incomes generally. In this context the actualsums at stake and the detailed balance of the arguments werecomparatively unimportant; what mattered was the course of themain battle and it was undeniable that a Government award of an or 9 per cent, increase in a field over which they had full controlmight have a serious effect on the general wages policy. On theother hand the programme of university expansion was of greatimportance in the Governmenfs forward planning because of the contribution which it would itself make to the growth of the national
economy. He would like to see more details of the opening salarieswhich graduates could command at present salary levels in the fieldsopen to them in industry, the Civil Service and the teaching professionoutside the universities. The Chancellor of the Exchequer might also discuss the problem with the Chairman of the Committee on higher Education.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a later meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,16th January, 1962.
