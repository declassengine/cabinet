Previously recorded in u Confidential AnneNuclear *1.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memorandumTests by the Prime Minister (C. (62) 1) on nuclear tests.(previous reference: At the Prime Ministers request Sir William Penney, the DeputyC.C. (62) 1st Chairman of the Atomic Energy Authority, gave his assessment of theConclusions. technical reasons which would justify the Western Powers in holdingMinute 4) a further series of nuclear tests in the atmosphere, li no furthernuclear tests were made by either side, the United States would retain a slight advantage in nuclear capacity over the Soviet Union. It couldnot, however, be assumed that the Russians would refrain from furthertesting when they had absorbed the knowledge gained from their recent series of tests. A study of these tests had shown that some ofthem were specifically directed towards the evolution of an anti-missile missile. Although the perfection of such a defence system would be immensely difficult and costly, he could not see how theUnited States could stand aside if the Russians continued theirattempts to develop one and the work of the scientists and techniciansin the United States would be bound to lose momentum if they were unable to test the results of their research. The significance of the100-megaton bomb was that it could destroy its target from a height of 25 miles and the difficulties of intercepting missiles increased withthe distance from the target. Further, a large explosion in the upperatmosphere would produce a very wide area of ionisation which would affect radar and radio communications and thus increase thedifficulties of defence and retaliation; the extent and duration of theseeffects were not yet fully known. The new series of tests which theUnited States authorities wished to make could be divided into fourbroad categories (i) high altitude explosions for measuring ionisationand other effects and for studying the effect of a nuclear explosion ona missile at high altitude; (ii) tests of the warheads now in production for the POLARIS. MINUTEMAN and SKY BOLT missiles, whichhad been conservatively designed and might well be reduced in weightin order to make room for anti-explosion devices; (iii) tests of newwarheads which might increase very significantly the yield to weightratio of warheads in the I kiloton and 1 megaton range: and(iv) experiments directed to verifying certain completely new concepts,still in the theoretical stage, which, if successful, would produce ,\revolutionary improvement in yield to weight ratios. All of these testswould be important first steps towards devising a defence againstmissiles. Preparations for conducting them could be completed in twoor three months, and the tests themselves might occupy a further threemonths. Even if an effective missile defence system was practicable,there was. in his opinion, no possibility that cither the United states or the Soviet Union would produce it in less than 10 years. Neverthe-less, the consequences of falling behind in this development were sograve that, if he had the responsibility of advising President Kennedy,he would feel obliged to recommend that tests should be resumedunless there were some guarantee that no further Russian tests wouldbe held. He thought it certain that American scientists would give thesame advice.Sir William Penney withdrew from the meeting at this point.In the Cabinet&apos;s further discussion the following points weremade:(a) There was general agreement that, failing international agreement to ban all tests, atmospheric tests in the first &quot;three categoriesdescribed by Sir William Penney would be justified. It would not bepossible to form an opinion on the fourth category until its nature and purpose could be more precisely defined
(b) In those circumstances the United Kingdom Governmentwould be obliged to support a United States decision to undertakethose tests, if such a decision were taken. Indeed, there were no grounds on which we could oppose such a decision other than the needfor a new political initiative to secure a detente in East-West relations.(c-) There was reason io believe that President Kennedy wouldlike to seek a better understanding with the Soviet Government on a wide range of outstanding problems. The disarmament plans of theUnited States and Soviet Governments were not widely different. Itwould not in any case be possible for the American tests to be made until after the 18-Power Conference on Disarmament had begun, hwas therefore possible that the President would welcome our proposedinitiative.id) It should be possible to reach agreement with the americans in time for an announcement of the first approach to Mr. Khrushchevto be made at the end of January or the beginning of February.The Prime Minister said that in the light of the discussionhe would revise his draft message to the President. He would makeit clear that any public announcement would take the form that wehad decided that it was necessary to resume tests, and that christmas island would be made available for this purpose, but that we wereresolved meanwhile to make a determined effort to make progress towards an effective international agreement on disarmament whichwould secure a halt in the nuclear arms race.The Cabinet (I) Agreed that a sound military case could be made for conducting the further series of nuclear tests in the atmosphere which the United States authorities were nowcontemplating; and that, if President Kennedy finally decided that this series of tests should be undertaken, itwould be right for the United Kingdom Government tosupport his decision.(2) Agreed that in those circumstances it would be reasonablethat facilities should be given to enable the United states authorities to conduct part of that series of tests at christmas Island.(3) Agreed that, before the Western Powers were finallycommitted to entering on this new phase in the nucleararms race, a fresh initiative should be taken on the lines which the Prime Minister had suggested in their discussion to secure further progress towards an effective inter-national agreement on disarmament which would call ahalt to the nuclear arms race.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would convey the cabinet&apos;s views and conclusions to President Kennedy ina personal message on the lines of the draft circulated tothe Cabinet amended to take account of their discussion.Indonesia(previous reference :C.C. (60) 33rdConclusions.Minute 3)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C. (61) 222) on the Indonesian threat of forcefulaction against West Irian. This recommended that further deliveries of arms to Indonesia should be suspended; that we should offer todiscuss through Service channels what logistic support would berequired by the Netherlands Government in the event of attack onWest Irian; and that we should support any reasonable proposals,including an appeal to the United Nations, designed to prevent the useof force.
The Foreign Secretary said that since his paper was circulated the indonesian Government had declared that West Irian was a province of Indonesia and that their forces were being mobilised to liberate it.On the other hand, the Netherlands Government had said that theywere prepared to negotiate without pre-conditions and by withdrawingtheir earlier insistence on the principle of self-determination had made it easier for the Indonesians to accept a negotiated settlement. It hadbeen suggested that the acting Secretary-General of the united nations should offer his services as a mediator.The two immediate questions were whether to continue thesupply of arms to Indonesia and what answer to give to the request ofthe Netherlands Government for logistic support.In discussion the following points were made :(a) The Government would be open to serious criticism if armscontinued to be supplied from this country to Indonesia when anattack on West Irian was imminent or in progress. On the other hand,some of these arms were required for internal security: firms wouldbe liable for breach of contract unless the Government placed a formalembargo on export; and two of the eight Gannet aircraft ordered byIndonesia had already been delivered to the Indonesian authoritiesin this country and were awaiting delivery under Indonesianarrangements.(b) Difficulties would also arise if we entered into any specificcommitment to give logistic support to the Netherlands Government.The use of Singapore for refuelling or repairing Dutch warshipswould exacerbate local opinion and prejudice the project for a GreaterMalaysia. It would be preferable that no further undertaking shouldbe given to the Dutch until more was known about the prospect of a negotiated settlement.(c) It was suggested that under international law warships of belligerent countries had certain rights of refuelling at neutral ports.If so, it would be preferable that any facilities given to the Dutchshould be based on this than on the undertaking given to them in 1959.The Cabinet (I) Invited the Minister without Portfolio to arrange for theCommittee on Strategic Exports to consider urgently what steps could be taken to curtail the supply of arms to indonesia in present circumstances.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider how far any logisticfacilities that might be desired by Dutch warships couldbe based on the general rules of war.(3) Agreed that a reply to the enquiry by the netherlands government about logistic support should be deferred forthe time being.(4) Took note that, if the Netherlands Government appealed tothe United Nations, we should vote in their support.congo republic(previous reference :C.C. (61) 75thConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Foreign Secretary said that there had been a usefulmeeting between Mr. Tshombe, the Prime Minister of Katanga, andthe leading civil and military representatives of the United Nations inthe Congo. As a result it seemed likely that the Katanga Assembly,which was meeting at Elisabethville that day. would support inprinciple the agreement which Mr. Tshombe had reached at Kitonawith the Prime Minister of the central Congo Government, and wouldgive authority for Katangan representatives to participate in acommission to review the constitution of the Congo. He hoped thatthese efforts towards conciliation would continue to make progress;C.C. 2 (62)
for he was disturbed by the plans which the United Nations authorities were preparing to put military and economic pressure on Katanga ifthey failed.Meanwhile, the acting Secretary-General of the United nations had transmitted, through the United Kingdom Government, a request that the Government of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasalandshould allow United Nations observers to supervise movement acrossthe frontier between Northern Rhodesia and Katanga. The PrimeMinister of the Federation would not comply with this request, butit was hoped to persuade him to invite the acting Secretary-general or one of his senior representatives to visit Northern Rhodesia andsatisfy himself that movement across this frontier was already undereffective control.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.4. The Foreign Secretary said that, owing to the obduracy ofGeneral Phoumi, the Laotian Princes had failed to reach agreement on the composition of a national Government. Prince SouvannaPhouma had however submitted proposals for a national Government,including General Phoumi. These were acceptable to the UnitedStates Government, who were no longer prepared to support GeneralPhoumi in standing out against them and were informing the Kingthat, unless General Phoumi could be induced to co-operate on this basis, they would be obliged to withdraw their financial support. it this threat did not produce the desired effect, it might be necessary forthe two co-Chairmen (the Foreign Secretary and the Soviet ForeignMinister) to summon the three Princes to meet them at Geneva. Ifthe formation of a national Government were delayed much longer,there was a real risk that fighting would break out again in Laos.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Cabinet Office.
