Smoking and health(Previous!Reference:C.C. (62) 20thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (C. (62) 110) reporting the conclusions reached by aCommittee of Ministers which had examined the report of the RoyalCollege of Physicians on Smoking and Health.The Lord President said that, in their consideration of the actionwhich might be taken by the Government, the Committee had felt obliged to accept the conclusions reached in the report of the RoyalCollege of Physicians on the causal connexion between cigarettesmoking and lung cancer. He considered that the further government statement which was expected should indicate serious concern atthe effects of heavy cigarette smoking and should express theGovernments determination to spread knowledge of the facts aswidely as possible. The object of presenting the facts would be to persuade people to alter their habits and it would not be possibleto maintain a clear distinction between factual and persuasivepresentation. The statement should, however, avoid giving theimpression that the Government were adopting a paternalist attitudetowards this question.The Committee of Ministers proposed that there should be a modest campaign of Government publicity involving the supply ofpamphlets and posters, on a co-ordinated theme, to local health and education authorities, and the use of various other channels ofpublic relations available to the Government. There would be no attempt to compete with the advertisements of cigarettemanufacturers; and the campaign, which would have to be sustainedover a long period, would be aimed not at securing a dramatic drop in cigarette smoking but at producing, perhaps over a generation,a gradual change in smoking habits. The cost might be about  40,000or  50,000 a year. The Committee had also considered the possibility that through a differential system of taxation the price of cigarettesmight be raised by about 10 per cent, and the price of pipe tobaccoreduced by 20 per cent. They had, however, reached no firmconclusion on the expediency of such a course: some Ministers had felt that a differential tax would be difficult to justify as bearinghardly on the poor and the old, and that a difference of the orderproposed could be criticised as insufficient to produce any lastingeffect. The Committee had also made suggestions for the encouragement of voluntary restrictions on cigarette advertising bythe manufacturers, for heavier penalties for selling cigarettes to children and for discouraging smoking by the public in Governmentpremises.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that it would be inappropriate to consider at the present stage action on a wider front or more drastic in character than the campaign of Government publicity which was outlined in paragraph 4of C. (62) 110. The emphasis, both in any further statement inParliament and in the action which it would outline, should be on health education: in that context the Government had anacknowledged responsibility to make the facts known, particularly to the young. Although discouragement of smoking in public transport, food shops and elsewhere might be socially desirable,there was no evidence that smoking in such places was harmful to the health of anyone except the smoker and it would be preferable thatthe Government should not intervene in this.SECRET 3C.C. 46 (62)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
incomes policy(Previous!Reference:CC. (62) 41stConclusions,Minute 5)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (C. (62) 111) on the Governments incomes policy.The Prime Minister said that in the light of the Cabinets earlier discussions broad agreement had been reached on the general scopeof the next steps in the development of the Governments incomes policy. It was now necessary to consider whether the measures proposed would be likely, taken as a whole, to be accepted by thecountry as a constructive and effective policy; and whether the RoyalCommission on Incomes, if established on the lines now set out inhis paper, would command the confidence and support which itwould need if it was to be an effective instrument for keeping thegrowth of incomes broadly in line with the increase of production.He had it in mind that in presenting the idea of this Commissionto the public at this early stage, it would not be necessary to go intotoo much detail; this would leave room for later and more formalconsultation with the various interests involved. He would proposeto emphasise, not the precise machinery through which theCommission would work, but the broad objectives which it would seek to achieve. First, it would need to preserve a reasonable balance between incomes and productivity taken over a long period and calculated on a broad average; and it would at intervals issuegeneral reports on this aspect of its work. Secondly, it would havea special responsibility for dealing with the exceptional case whererevaluation might be called for and it would ensure fair treatment for the growing number of industries and employments whosevalue to the community could not be measured in terms of production.Thirdly, it would be made clear that the Commission would not interfere with the work of the Wages Councils or, except with theconsent of both parties, replace formal arbitration agreements.Fourthly, he would emphasise the duty of the Commission to conduct in public ex post facto reviews of wage settlements whichhad been reached without having been brought before it in the firstinstance and appeared to conflict with the national interest. Thestatement which he had in mind would then outline in broad terms the functions of the Commission as summarised in his memorandum.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The main doubt which might be raised about the effectiveness of the proposed Commission would centre on the fact that therewould be no power to bring cases before it without the consent ofboth parties. This might mean, in practice, that no cases would come before it at all and that its activity would be confined, so faras the private sector was concerned, to the holding of ex post factoreviews. It could be argued that one or two critical reviews, exposingto public view bad management or inefficient use of labour in theindustry concerned, would have a salutary effect in inducingemployers and unions alike to bring future cases to it beforesettlements were reached. It would not be difficult to give theCommission greater powers of compulsion in the public sector; butthis would have disadvantages, for it would perpetuate the difficultyin which the Government had found themselves of appearing toThe Cabinet Invited the Lord President, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, to prepare and submit for theconsideration of the Prime Minister the draft of a statement which might be made in Parliament on the basis of therecommendation in paragraph 4 of C. (62) 110 about government publicity on the connexion between cigarettesmoking and lung cancer.
apply a harsher discipline to their own servants than they wereprepared to enforce on workers in the private sector. It would alsobe criticised as illogical; for it was wage movements in the private sector which set the pace, and the public service followed rather thanled. The effect of controlling the public sector while leaving theprivate sector unfettered would be to increase the gap between thetwo.(b) The most effective way of giving the Commission morepower in the private sector might be to empower it to review wage claims when either party could convince it that a point of sufficient importance was at stake. It could be emphasised that theCommission^ findings in such a case would not bind either party,and that the right to strike would be unaffected. Such a strengthening of the Commission^ powers would not necessarily appeal only tothe employers. In informal discussion with the Chancellor of theExchequer, representatives of the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.)had shown themselves to be concerned about settlements in whichthe employers might have successfully negotiated an unreasonablylow increase in wages. The fact that under the proposed change theCommission would at the request of the trades unions concerned have power to review such cases before settlement might be welcome to the T.U.C.  This possibility should be further examined.(c) It would be more difficult to strengthen the Commission^hand by ensuring that, whenever a case was taken to arbitration,the views of the Commission were available to the arbitrators. Inthe first place, the effect of such a change would be confined almost wholly to the public sector since, with the exception of the buildingindustry, there was little in the way of formal arbitration machinery in the private sector. It would thus have all the disadvantagesalready discussed of applying sterner measures to the public than to the private sector. Secondly, such a change had to be viewedagainst probable developments in the private sector as a whole. Ifwage increases in the private sector continued to move ahead without regard to the national interest, it would in practice be impossiblefor arbitrators in the public sector to make their awards on any other basis than a fair comparison with that movement; the views of theCommission would have to be set aside and the prestige of theCommission would suffer. If, on the other hand, the private sectorcould be brought under control there would be no problem.Arbitrators in the public sector would then conform to the sort of guidance which the Commission might have been expected to give.(d) A particular difficulty would arise on the proposal to bringwithin the Commission^ ambit the review body on doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; pay under the Chairmanship of Lord Kindersley. the pilkington Report which had recommended the establishment ofthis review body had specified that it should operate independently of Government policy. To bring it under the Commission wouldbe viewed by the British Medical Association as a breach of faith.Similar considerations might apply, although with less force, to thecommittee for the review of the pay of the higher Civil Service under lord Franks.(e) The success of the proposed Commission would largely depend on its acceptance by public opinion as a body of standing and authority which could make a real contribution to the country&apos;economic development. This in turn would depend, not only on its membership and terms of reference, but on the way in which thedecision to establish it was presented to the country in the first place.It would have to be set in the context of economic growth; it wouldbe necessary to convince the country at large that the commission was not merely another device for dividing up the nation&apos;s wealthto the disadvantage of the individual worker, but that it would contribute to a general increase in prosperity.  It would be helpful,
even if not strictly logical, to put greater emphasis in this contexton the Commission^ duty, in considering cases brought before itor in conducting ex post facto reviews, to examine the level of profits and prices in the industry concerned, as well as the level of wages.It was also for consideration whether in announcing the decisionto establish the Commission the Government should define its terms of reference and its responsibilities in some detail, leavingroom for little more than minor modification as the result of further consultation with the interests concerned, or whether the decision should be announced in broad outline only. It would, in any case,be necessary to make a major statement of the Governmentseconomic policy in Parliament before the recess.The Prime Minister said that in the light of the cabinets discussion he would consider with the Ministers concerned the degree to which it might be right to give further powers to the proposedRoyal Commission on Incomes and the best way of presenting thefinal proposals to Parliament.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theMinisters concerned, would, in the light of their discussion,give further thought to the proposals for the establishmentof a Royal Commission on Incomes and to the manner oftheir presentation.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,12th July, 1962.
