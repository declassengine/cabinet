Europe(previous reference:C.C. (62) 28thConclusions,Minute 2)1. The Lord Privy Seal made a report to the Cabinet on therecent discussions in Paris on political co-operation in Europe andon the present state of the negotiations in Brussels about our entry into the European Common Market.In the Paris discussions it had become clear that the Governmentsof the Six had welcomed the attitude towards political co-operation which he had outlined in his speech at the meeting of the ministerial council of the Western European Union on 10th April. He had atthat stage avoided any detailed comment on the texts on politicalco-operation which were in circulation and had not sought membership of the Commission (formerly the Fouchet Commission) which hadbeen considering them, but he had suggested that it would be useful if representatives of the United Kingdom Government took part inthe detailed discussions. At a meeting of the Six which had beenheld on 17th April on the basis of a document which was broadlyconfederal in character, the French representatives had deferred tothe views of the others on a number of points, such as the relations of the political organisation with the three Economic communities and with the North Atlantic Alliance, but had resisted suggestions made by representatives of the smaller countries which v/ere directed to postponing decisions on political co-operation until the positionof the United Kingdom in relation to the three Economic Communitieshad been determined. The smaller countries plainly feared Franco-German hegemony and wished now to think in terms of sevencountries rather than six.In the further Ministerial meetings which would now takeplace, an important consideration would be the effect which mightbe produced by a settlement on Berlin which was distasteful to theWest German Government. This would tend to encourage neutralistsentiment in West Germany, and the successful conclusion of a treaty on political co-operation in Europe would be a useful counterpoise.Discussion of the treaty should therefore be pressed forward, butthe United Kingdom Government should not appear to becomecommitted to forms of political co-operation in advance of decisions on membership of the Economic Communities. It seemed possiblethat in practice negotiations on the political and economic frontscould be kept reasonably in step and could be brought to an issueby the end of July.The report which had been presented by the Deputies at Brusselson 14th April had contained clear definitions of the main points onwhich difficulty would arise but had not gone far towards resolvingthem. The gaps between the two sides would be examined in detail in Ministerial meetings commencing on 7th May, and it was hopedthat the meetings could be so arranged that the Ministers of the Sixwould become personally committed and effective negotiations wouldbe started. There was no reason to believe that French dissatisfaction with our position on the timing of negotiations for politicalco-operation would be reflected in the Brussels negotiations. In some respects these might be made easier because of the evident desire ofthe smaller countries to secure United Kingdom support.In discussion in the Cabinet it was noted that the Minister ofAgriculture would meet trade interests in this country before theGovernment took up with the Australian Government the questionwhether Australian wheat should be dealt with on the basis of eitherdeficiency payments or bulk purchase. This might become a particularly difficult issue, both with the Australian Government andwith the Six. The Governments negotiating position on industrialproducts from Canada, Australia and New Zealand had been somewhat weakened through the initial reluctance of theCommonwealth Governments to agree that proposals to spread the
EconomicSituation(previous references:C.C. (62) 21stConclusions,Minute 3 andC.C. (62) 28thConclusions,Minute 5)2. The Prime Minister said that the Governments economic policy, both on wages and incomes and on the restriction of demand by fiscal and monetary measures, was now beginning to take effect.The competitive position of the United Kingdom had been strengthened, sterling was strong, and the balance of payments position had markedly improved. There were, however, twoproblems on which it was necessary that the Cabinet should take an early view. First, the Governments incomes policy, which hadevolved from the initial policy of a standstill in wages, still hadabout it some of the marks of improvisation; it had producedanomalies and inequities which could not be allowed to continue indefinitely and it should be replaced as soon as possible by moreconsidered and longer-term proposals. Secondly, the economic measures which it had been necessary to take since the summer of1961 had produced a strong political reaction, and it was desirablethat the Governments longer-term economic policy should beconsidered in the context of other elements of the governments programme. By far the most important element in the Governmentsfuture policy was the prospect of the United Kingdom becoming amember of the European Economic Community (E.E.C.); it wouldnot, however, be possible to develop in public the theme of leadershipin Europe and the challenge and opportunity which membership ofthe E.E.C. would offer until the Brussels negotiations and commonwealth consultation on them had been completed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave the Cabinet a forecast of the probable course of the economic situation. The balance ofpayments on current account had improved from a deficit of  288million in 1960 to a prospective surplus of  150 million in 1962; ifthe movement of capital were included, the correspondingimprovement was from a deficit of  490 million in 1960 to a slightsurplus in 1962. Looking to the future it was expected that thebalance of payments position in the second half of 1963 would beless good than in 1962. The increase in exports was running slightlybehind the forecast ship-building had been particularly disappointing and it was noticeable that the increase had been largely confined to four or five specialised sectors of industry. A less satisfactoryfeature was the rise in the cost of living. Taking January 1956 ata level of 100 this had now increased to 118 and would be likely to stabilise later in 1962 at a figure of about 120. A large proportionof this increase had been caused by the rise in costs which haddirectly resulted from the rise in personal incomes.In general, however, it could be said that the economy,particularly with the reduction in the Bank Rate, was in a buoyantstate. Measures designed to stimulate it further would need to beused with very great caution. It would be very damaging if as aresult of such measures a further inflationary spiral started and theprocess of restraint had to be started all over again. Among the limited measures which might be considered would be some easingof the present restrictions on credit and on hire purchase terms. Inthe incomes field it was clear that, while the wages pause had had aeffect of tariff changes over a period of years should be put beforethe Six. These proposals had now been accepted by theCommonwealth Governments but the discussions would take placeon the basis of less satisfactory proposals which had meanwhile beenput forward by the Six themselves.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to circulate, with an explanatorynote, the texts on political co-operation in Europe whichhad been discussed in Paris.
CC. 30 (62)decisive effect in stabilising the economy, it would now be necessaryto move toward a longer-term policy. General restraint would need to be maintained, but certain injustices (e.g., nurses and unversity teachers) would have to be remedied, and the new policy should be suffiently flexible to make this possible. He hoped&apos; to present proposals in about a month&apos;s time.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It would be important in any reconsideration of theGovernments general policy not to over-emphasise its purely financialand economic aspects. In education, for example, and in such matters as training in industry, including training for management, there was still a great deal to be done which depended as much on new ideasas on the provision of greater resources.(b) It would be necessary to counteract the view that theGovernments present incomes policy would end soon and would befollowed by a return to free collective bargaining and steady wageinflation. A continuing policy for restraint in incomes should be acardinal feature of all long-term planning. The long-term policy would have to be flexible and must allow for exceptional cases. But,in general, increases in wages should continue to be limited by thegrowth of productivity. It might be possible to link a continuation of the policy for restraint in incomes with some indication of thebenefits which such a policy would produce in such matters as the raising of the school-leaving age, a continuing improvement in our competitive position and therefore in our prosperity and a stabilisation of the cost of living. It might also be desirable to link a policy of continued restraint with measures specifically designed to protect theinterests of the consumer.(c) There was some evidence that the presentation of theGovernments policy had been defective and that neither employersnor representatives of the employees had grasped its implicationsor its objects. The National Economic Development Council(N.E.D.C.) might be of help in overcoming this, once it had becomeestablished and had familiarised itself with the general economicsituation, but other measures for presenting the Governments casemight have to be devised. So far as concerned the development ofa longer-term incomes policy, it would be unrealistic to expect anyhelp from the N.E.D.C. for some considerable period; its effortswould be concentrated for the time being on the examination of measures designed to stimulate economic growth.(d) In general it would be undesirable both for economic andpolitical reasons for the Government to relax their efforts to controland restrain inflationary pressures. In economic terms nothing couldbe better calculated to damage our competitive position in Europethan a return to the alternate booms and slumps which hadcharacterised the post-war years. And in political terms this would damage the growing respect for the integrity of the Governmentsfinancial policy.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of these questions at alater meeting.
