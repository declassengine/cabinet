Parliament 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the first week after the Adjournment.Public ^ 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theExpenditure Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary, Treasury(Previous, (C. (62) 206) showing the total amount of Departmental EstimatesReference: fqr 1963-64 and proposing measures for controlling the increase ofCC. (62) 52nd public expenditure.Conclusions,Minute 5) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the increase in thetotal amount of public expenditure, which had been over 8 per cent for 1962-63 and would be over 10 per cent in 1963-64, wasunprecedented. Considered as a percentage of the gross national product, the increase to 23-8 per cent was no less alarming. In viewof the immediate problems caused by the temporarily high level ofunemployment in the country he was not proposing to ask hiscolleagues for drastic reductions in the Estimates for 1963-64, butthis meant that the financial situation of the country in 1964 wouldbe very dangerous. The current rate of increase in public expenditure was entirely out of proportion with any possible increasein the national income.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, drew attention to the centralrecommendation of Lord Plowden&apos;s Committee on the Control ofPublic Expenditure, viz., that major decisions of policy should onlybe taken in the light of the fullest available information of thenational resources and the various competing demands upon them.In accordance with this recommendation, the Defence Budget andthe finances of the National Health Service had already been made subject to a general rule whereby increases in Estimates were judgedagainst a previously approved annual rate of expansion, based upondetailed annual costings of Departmental programmes. It was proposed to extend this form of financial control to cover a wide range of services for which other Ministers were responsible. It wasnot claimed that this technique afforded a water-tight system offinancial control, but it should greatly improve the completeness ofthe criteria upon which such special cases as Ministers might wishto bring before the Cabinet might be judged. If the new system ofcontrol was to be effective in time for the 1964-65 Estimates, it oughtto be introduced now.For the Estimates for 1963-64, it was accepted that majoreconomies could not now be made: he was, however, askingMinisters to agree to accept the highest practicable measure ofcompression, which might be interpreted as implying strict financialrestraint in the application of approved policies and the subjectionof Estimates to the closest possible scrutiny in detail.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster drew attention tothe number of publicly-announced measures of limitation on government expenditure which had in recent years proved to beunenforceable. He considered that the proposals in C. (62) 206tended to increase the restrictive power of the Treasury whiledegrading the function of the Cabinet in the determination of public policy.   While the steadily increasing level of public expenditureBahamas 1.

Iron and 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ChiefSteel industry  Secretary, Treasury (C. (62) 207) about the declared intention of(Previous        Messrs. Stewarts and Lloyds to acquire control of the WhiteheadReference:       Iron and Steel Company.C.C. (62) 73rdConclusions, The Chief Secretary, Treasury, informed the Cabinet that,Minute 6) according to the advice he had received, Messrs. Stewarts and Lloydswould almost certainly succeed in their attempt to take over theWhitehead Iron and Steel Company unless Messrs. Richard Thomascould be justified by reference to accepted social principles, thefailure of the Government to ensure a corresponding increase inrevenues was the more significant aspect of the present situation. Inhis view, public opinion was ready to accept an increase in theproportion of the gross national product taken up by public expenditure, and the consequent high level of taxation.(b) Other Ministers, while expressing sympathy with some of theviews expressed by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,considered that the adoption of the technique recommended by the plowden Committee would be much less dangerous if (as was intended) the predicted annual rates of expansion in the varioussectors of Government expenditure were not announced. Theywere ready to accept the Committee&apos;s recommendation that majordecisions should only be taken in the light of the best availableknowledge of the Governments commitments and resources. the technique had proved its value in application to the Defence budget and to the finances of the National Health Service, and was suitablefor extension to a variety of other services, although in some cases,for instance foreign aid, it would be impossible to lay down inadvance any particular rate of growth. It was essential that the determination of an average annual rate of expansion should take full account of the special factors in each case, and that ministers should remain free to bring before their colleagues the arguments for exceptional expenditure to meet a wide range of unforeseencircumstances.(c) Several Ministers drew attention to the dangers involved inthe process of compressing the Estimates for 1962-63: reductions in the amounts to be made available for small and apparentlyinsignificant services might have disproportionate effects and lead to serious criticism.(d) The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that measuresapproved for the purpose of reflating the economy in presentcircumstances would do more harm than good if their effects were allowed to persist into the period after 1963 when it must beexpected that the economy would again be buoyant. Withoutwishing to insist on the termination of all such expenditure beforethe end of the calendar year 1963, he must stress the importance of ensuring that all such measures were restricted to the short term.Summing up the discussion the First Secretary of State said thatthere appeared to be a wide measure of agreement that the methodsof financial control recommended by Lord Plowden&apos;s Committee onthe Control of Public Expenditure should be applied to Depart-mental Estimates more widely than hitherto. Average annual ratesof expansion should be calculated with the fullest regard to thespecial circumstances of the various Departments and should in no case be made public. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had agreedthat there must be some measure of elasticity in the interpretation ofthe system.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (62) 206.
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that efforts should be made to prevent Messrs.Stewarts and Lloyds from acquiring control of theWhitehead Iron and Steel Company.(2) For this purpose authorised the Chief Secretary, Treasury,and the Minister of Power to empower Messrs. RichardThomas and Baldwins to make a competitive offer forthe Whitehead shares.Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference:C.C. (62) 71stConclusions,Minute 3)5. The First Secretary of State said that as agreed by theCabinet in earlier discussion he had made a statement in the Houseof Commons on the preceding day acknowledging Nyasaland&apos;s rightto withdraw from the present Federation in Central Africa. Asimilar statement had been made in the House of Lords by the LordChancellor. At the same time the Federal Prime Minister, Sir roy welensky, had published a White Paper dealing with thenegotiations which had led up to the present position. In breach ofall precedent and of the normal rules governing relations between governments this White Paper contained what purported to beaccounts of confidential discussions between Sir Roy Welensky andC.C. 75 (62)and Baldwins (R.T.B.) were allowed to make a counter-bid. If theoriginal bid succeeded the financial loss to R.T.B. would be severe,and the Government would be subject to criticism for allowing thispublicly-owned company to lose money. There would also be aconsiderable measure of consequential unemployment amongR.T.B&apos;s. workpeople in West Wales and in North Lincolnshire, whichwould give rise to further criticism. It was possible, though not certain, that some satisfactory compromise could be reached with messrs. Stewarts and Lloyds if R.T.B. were able to make a counter-offer for Whitehead Iron and Steel. Such an offer, if it were accepted, would cost about  5^ million. In this case, besides protect-ing the interests of the nationalised company, the Government wouldhave secured the assets of Whitehead Iron and Steel: the transactioncould on balance be regarded as reasonably profitable. This courseof action would, however, lay the Government open to the criticism that it was re-nationalising Whiteheads, contrary to their generalpolicy of de-nationalising the steel industry.In the course of disussion some Ministers suggested that it might still be possible for R.T.B. and Whiteheads to reach an agreement which would have the effect of safeguarding R.T.B. against the more damaging effects of a takeover of Whiteheads by Stewarts andLloyds. It was also suggested that the broader economic interestsof the industry might be at least as well served by Stewarts andLloyds taking over Whiteheads as by the continuance of the existingrelationship between Whiteheads and R.T.B.Nevertheless, Ministers considered that there could be no justification for denying to R.T.B. the freedom to defend themselvesin the way in which any independent company in their positionwould do, namely, by making a competitive counter-offer for controlof Whiteheads. Once R.T.B. had been empowered to proceed inthis way it seemed likely that Stewarts and Lloyds would eitherwithdraw from the field or agree to compromise.It was certain that a Government decision to support R.T.B. inthis way would quickly become know/n: it would therefore benecessary to defend this course of action even in the event of a compromise solution.
himself both in London and in Salisbury. He had not himself been consulted before the publication of the White Paper nor had his agreement been sought to the disclosures. He would be grateful forthe support of his colleagues in making a strong formal protest tothe Federal Government. This would not, however, dispose of themain problem. In the light of their failure to obtain a last-minutepostponement of the statement about Nyasaland&apos;s right to secedeSir Roy Welensky had alleged, both in his own Parliament and through intermediaries in London, that the United KingdomGovernment had been guilty of a serious breach of faith; specificallythat in the course of the Lancaster House Conference in 1953 theGovernment had undertaken not to allow any territory to secedefrom the Federation without the agreement of all the Governmentsconcerned. The proceedings of the Lancaster House Conference of1953 had been quoted by Sir Roy Welensky and he was himself dueto answer a Question in Parliament that day asking whether theGovernment would publish the relevant documents in full. Hewould be grateful for the advice of the Cabinet on the form of his reply. It would not in the time available be possible to publish a white Paper; on the other hand publication of the documentswithout explanation might tend to confirm the impression that some kind of pledge or undertaking had been given.In discussion the following points were made:(a) There would be some advantage in refusing to con-template publication of any of the documents concerned on theground that this would constitute an intolerable breach of the recognised conventions. It could be said that Sir Roy Welensky had himself been guilty of such a breach by making public confidentialdocuments and discussions out of context and in such a way as tocreate a misleading impression; and that the Government were determined not to make matters worse by following suit.(b) On the other hand such a course might serve to deepensuspicion that the documents were damaging to the Governmentscase. The Government had never given any pledge not to legislate for changes in the structure of the Federation without the consentof the Federal Government. There was a clear distinction to bedrawn between the inalienable right of the Government to takelegislative action, on which no kind of pledge had ever been given and the desirability of agreement on the need to take such action onwhich certain undertakings had been given. It might be desirableto explain this more clearly at some later stage with the support ofthe relevant documents, and it would therefore be advisable to keepopen the possibility of publication at this stage. The consent of theother parties concerned would of course be needed.Summing up, the First Secretary of State said that it would be undesirable to reopen that day the question of the pledge which hehad dealt with on the preceding day. He would prefer to confinehis answer strictly to the terms of the Question put to him, i.e., tothe publication of the relevant documents. In the light of the cabinets discussion he would propose to say in his reply that itwould be important to respect the confidential nature of the documents and that he would also need to consider the position ofthe other parties concerned.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the First Secretary of State to send a formal protest to the Federal Government of Rhodesia and nyasaland about the publication of a White paper containing material confidential to the two Governmentsconcerned without the agreement of the United KingdomGovernment.
6. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs recalled to theCabinet that at their earlier discussion the Foreign Secretary had described the events leading to the mission of M. Dubuisson, theRector of Liege University, to Katanga to persuade the PrimeMinister of Katanga, Mr. Tshombe, to agree voluntarily to someacceptable division of the Katangan revenues. Mr. Tshombe had now offered such an agreement, and in spite of his mistrust of theCongolese Monetary Council had undertaken to pay to the council the whole of the revenues which he was at present receiving, on theunderstanding that the Council would repay to the Union Minieresufficient sums for the conduct of their commercial operations andthat half the balance, within defined limits, would be repaid toKatanga. This offer now presented the only basis on which agreement by negotiation might still be reached. The hope wasslender, because on all evidence relations between Katanga and theCentral Government of the Congo were now close to breakingpoint. The Katangan Government were more than ever determined on de facto secession and the Central Government were equallydetermined to incorporate Katanga in the rest of the Congo. ThePrime Minister of the Central Government, Mr. Adoula, was convinced that before long the United Nations, with the support ofthe United States, would have recourse to sanctions in his support:it was disquieting that the United States Government were taking steps to supply the United Nations forces in the Congo with moretransport aircraft and were prepared to make good deficiencies intheir equipment. The Union Miniere were also being obstructive,and the Belgian Government were bringing pressure to bear on them.Failing agreement on the basis of Mr. Tshombe&apos;s offer the best hopeprobably lay in a protraction of negotiations to the point at whichfinancial pressure would cause the United Nations to withdrawbefore hostilities had actually broken out.The Cabinet (1) Took note of this statement.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the UnitedStates Government had now announced their intention to recognise the Republican Government of the Yemen. Their main reason for doing so had been the fear that continued support to the royalists bythe present Government of Jordan and Saudi Arabia might have ledto popular revolutions in those countries also. The United arab republic had agreed to withdraw their forces from the Yemen ifforeign intervention ceased. It was, however, doubtful if PresidentNasser could afford to withdraw in present circumstances; he wasdeeply committed to ensuring the success of the republicans and present evidence seemed to show that without Egyptian support theywould not be able to maintain their present hold on the more settled and populated parts of the country.Our own attitude was complicated by the effect whichrecognition of the republican regime would have on our supporters in Aden. The Foreign Secretary would wish to review the postionon his return. One possible course would be to defer recognitionuntil such time as the Egyptian forces had actually withdrawn.   In(2) Took note that the First Secretary of State would reply onthe lines indicated in his summing up to a parliamentary question asking whether the Government wouldpublish the documents which had been referred to by theFederal Prime Minister.
the meantime, the Egyptians were bombing undefended villages inthe Yemen with aircraft based on Cairo. In other circumstancessuch conduct would have called forth public denunciation andprotest, and our friends in the Middle East found it difficult to interpret our silence.The Cabinet- (2) Took note of this statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,20th December, 1962.
