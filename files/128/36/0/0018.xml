ParliamentC.C. (18) 621. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet also took note that the Chancellor of the exchequer would open his Budget on Monday, 9th April.Post OfficeGiro System(previous reference :C.C. (61) 62ndConclusions,Minute 4)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster-General (C. (62) 36) proposing the publication of a white paper on a Post Office giro system.The Postmaster-General said that at their previous discussion the Cabinet had invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to obtainthe views of the Bank of England on the proposal to introduce a post Office giro system. These had now been received. The Bankof England had repeated the argument, previously advanced by the clearing banks, that an extension of existing banking facilities for credit transfer could do all that a Post Office giro system could beexpected to do. It was, however, clear that the Bank of Englanditself had some doubt whether the clearing banks would in factextend their facilities in this way without the spur which discussionof a Post Office giro system might be expected to provide. he therefore remained in favour of publishing a White Paper setting out the results of the study made by officials into the possibility ofa Post Office giro system. This would indicate the advantages which such a system would offer to wage-earners, but its publication wouldnot commit the Government to introduce the system.In discussion the following points were made:(a) A wider use of credit transfer facilities would encouragepersonal savings, and would also lessen the dangers inherent in thepresent arrangements by which wage-earners were so largely paid in cash. It seemed unlikely that the clearing banks would move as fast as necessary in this direction unless some pressure was brought tobear on them. The publication of a White Paper on a Post Officegiro system would be useful for this purpose.(b) On the other hand, if such a White Paper were published,there would be a demand for discussion in Parliament; and, if thesubject were debated, it would be difficult for the Government toavoid taking a definite line. It might be better, if the White paper were published, for it to be accompanied by a clear statement thatthe Government did not in present circumstances intend to introduce a Post Office giro system. This, however, might have the effect of reducing the pressure on the clearing banks to improve their presentfacilities.(c) A further possibility would be to publish a more general statement discussing the problem of providing facilities for credittransfers for wage-earners and setting out the various methods of meeting it, including those now in use in Europe. A description ofa Post Office giro system could find its natural place in such a document.(d) If a Post Office giro system were introduced, the clearing banks might feel obliged to introduce a rival system of their own.This would involve duplication of staff and waste of resources; thecapital cost of introducing a Post Office giro system was at present estimated at  4 million spread over five years.The Cabinet-Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Postmaster-General, to consider the publication later in the year of a White Paper dealing with the general problemof credit transfer facilities for wage-earners and describing the various possible methods of providing such facilities,including a Post Office giro system.
Nuclear Tests 3.   The Cabinet had before them telegrams from Washington(Previous (Nos. 630, 631 and 632 of 27th February) reporting that PresidentReference: Kennedy had now been advised by his National Security council.C. (62) 12th that it was desirable on military grounds that the United StatesConclusions, should undertake, at Christmas Island and elsewhere, a series ofMmute 2) nuclear tests in the atmosphere, starting on 15th April. president kennedy, in a personal message to the Prime Minister (washington telegram No. 631), had said that he was now satisfied that it wasnecessary to conduct this test series, for the reasons which they had discussed at their meeting in Bermuda. He had also concluded thatit would be preferable to announce this decision before theDisarmament Conference opened in Geneva. He had therefore proposed to announce, in a broadcast statement on the evening of1st March, that the United States would start this series of atmospherictests on 15th April, unless in the meanwhile an international agreement for the cessation of nuclear tests had been concluded. To this messagethe Prime Minister had sent on the previous evening a reply (ForeignOffice telegram No. 1798 to Washington) asking that no announcement should be made before 2nd or 3rd March; proposing that the start ofthe test series should be deferred until 1st June (the date by whichthe Disarmament Conference was due to report to the united nations) or at least until 3rd May, so as to give more time for the negotiation of an international agreement for the cessation of nuclear tests; and suggesting certain changes in the form of the announcement.In a further message received that morning, the President had saidthat he would defer his announcement until the evening of 2nd March;that, instead of giving the definite date of 15th April, he would saythat the test series would begin in the second half of April; and thathe would consider the points of presentation made in the latter partof the Prime Minister^ message.The Prime Minister suggested that the Cabinet should firstconsider the question of substance whether they were ready tosupport this United States decision to carry out a further series of tests in the atmosphere. He had discussed this at a meeting attended by the Foreign Secretary, the Minister of Defence and scientificadvisers from the Ministry of Defence and the Atomic energy authority and, in the light of the views expressed by the technical advisers, he was himself satisfied that the proposed series of testscould be defended within the terms of the statement which he had made in the House of Commons on 31st October, 1961. The Ministerof Defence said that, while he regretted the necessity of furthertesting, he also considered that this series could be justified on military grounds. There was now no doubt that the Russians were makinggreat efforts to evolve an anti-missile missile, and the Western powers could not afford to be outdistanced in this by the Russians. though there was room for argument on the technical level, a broad politicalcase could be made for this test series. The Foreign Secretaryconcurred in this view.There was general agreement in the Cabinet that in thesecircumstances the United Kingdom could support a United Statesdecision to conduct this further series of nuclear tests.The Cabinet then turned to the question of timing. It was generally agreed that, if these tests were to be held within the nextfew months, the balance of advantage lay in announcing this beforethe opening of the Disarmament Conference. There was, however,some difference of view about the need to state at this stage that the tests would be started before the end of April. Some Ministers feltthat this would prejudice the prospects of making satisfactory progressat the Disarmament Conference. Some also felt that the mention of any date would give the impression of an ultimatum to theRussians, whose reaction might well be that they must decline tonegotiate under threat. On the other hand it was pointed out thatsix months had passed since the Russians began their last series of

(62) 38) on university expansion and the salaries of university teachers.The Home Secretary recalled that, when they had previouslydiscussed university salaries, the Cabinet had been informed that ifapproval could not be given for substantial increases the expansion programme put forward by the University Grants Committee (U.G.C.)might have to be revised. The Committee on Education Policy had subsequently examined both questions. They had concluded, inregard to university expansion, that it would be inadvisable to seek to reduce the number of student places below the 150,000 proposedby the U.G.C. for 1966-67 but that savings could be obtained inother ways which would reduce the total public expenditure on the universities in 1966-67 from  165 million to around  155 million.On salaries, their majority view was that because of the overriding importance of securing restraint in incomes in 1962 the most that could be offered to university teachers was an increase of 3 per cent,effective from 1st April. An undertaking could however be given that university salaries would be reviewed again in the light of allthe circumstances in the spring of 1963.C.C. (18) 62tests and that, if further Western tests were justified on military grounds, these should not be delayed for much longer. Moreover, theRussians had themselves carried out tests while still negotiating on disarmament, and it was known that they were still conducting certainnuclear tests underground. Three years had been spent in elaboratinga draft international agreement for the cessation of nuclear tests; andthere would be no difficulty in concluding this agreement in a matterof weeks, if the Russians were willing to do so. Without some kindof time limit they would not be brought to a point of decision.On this question the Cabinefs conclusion was that, while it wouldbe inexpedient to press President Kennedy to defer the start of thistest series beyond the end of April, he might be asked to phrase his announcement in terms less likely to give the impression of an ultimatum or threat.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Government could support the UnitedStates decision to conduct this further series of nuclear tests in the atmosphere, as falling within the terms of thestatement made by the Prime Minister in the House ofCommons on 3rd October, 1961.(2) Took note that, in communicating this decision to president kennedy, the Prime Minister would suggest that the public announcement should be so framed as to avoid theimpression of presenting an ultimatum to the SovietGovernment.(3) Took note that the United States decision would be announced on the evening of 2nd March, and that thePrime Ministej would arrange for a statement to be issued in London on the morning of 3rd March to- make it plain that this decision had been taken after consultation withthe United Kingdom Government.(4) Invited the Prime Minister to make a formal announcement in the House of Commons on 5th March; and took note that this could be debated in the course of the debate onthe Defence White Paper which was in any event to beheld on 5th and 6th March.
The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that he had reluctantly cometo the conclusion that the Governments incomes policy would be seriously jeopardised if an increase of more than 3 per cent, weremade in this field, which was wholly within the Governments owncontrol. If the increase were so limited, the Government would beopen to attack for inconsistency in their treatment of differentbranches of the teaching profession and for jeopardising the expansionof the universities. He thought,-however, that responsible opinion inthe universities would accept the proposed 3 per cent, increase in thehope that the further review in 1963 would result in larger increases.The Lord President said that he could not accept the arguments on which the proposed 3 per cent, increase was based. unversity teachers would, on that footing, be subjected to a form of selectivecomparison. They would not be given the same treatment as otherteachers, including those in the Colleges of Advanced Technology,who had been awarded substantial increases, but would be held tothe same small increase as had been considered appropriate forrailwaymen. The true comparison ought to be with other branchesof their own profession. He considered that substantial increases were called for, not on compatibility grounds, but because without them there would be no prospect of recruiting teaching staff adequatein number and quality to carry through the university expansion programme required to meet the country?s needs. It would not bedifficult to convince public opinion that an exception from the pay-pause should be made in favour of university teachers, not only because of the importance of university expansion, but because therewas an element of pre-pause commitment for, if the Governmenthad not dissuaded them, the U.G.C. would have presented their claim on behalf of university staffs before the introduction of the wagespause.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that the expansion proposals of the U.G.C. should beaccepted. On the salaries issue, which presented the Governmentwith a difficult choice between endangering their incomes policy andputting at risk the expansion of the universities, it was pointed outthat the universities appeared so far to be obtaining a reasonableshare of trained graduates and that, if salary increases of the orderof 8 or 9 per cent, were offered to university teachers at this stage in the pay pause, there would be great difficulty in dissuadingemployers in the private sector from offering similarly large increases.The review in 1963 would show whether recruitment was in fact beingaffected adversely by the limited increases in salaries. It was also suggested that the universities might find the limitation lessdisagreeable if they could be given slightly more generous treatment in regard to certain non-staff costs on which the Treasury would shortly be in discussion with the U.G.C.The general view of the Cabinet was that, despite the considerations advanced by the Lord President, it would be lessdamaging to the national interest if the increases this year were limited to 3 per cent. The Cabinet recognised that the increase which might be called for in the following year might be large andthat the policy to be adopted at that stage would have to be consideredcarefully in advance.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in C. (62) 38 about universityexpansion and the salaries of university teachers; and took note that the Chief Secretary, Treasury, would arrange fortheir decisions to be announced in Parliament.Cabinet Office, S.W.,1,1st March. 1962.
