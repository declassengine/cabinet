Sir Winston 1.   The Cabinet invited the Prime Minister to send to SirChurchill        Winston Churchill on their behalf a message of congratulation andgood wishes on the occasion of his 88th birthday, which would fallon the following day.ParliamentCompensationfor victims of Crimes ofViolence2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inParliament during the following week.The Lord Chancellor said that on Wednesday, 5th December,it would be necessary for a Government spokesman to reply to a debate on a Motion by Lord Longford, who proposed to call attentionto the Report of the Working Party on Compensation for Victims of crimes of Violence (Cmnd. 1406). The Report had indicated anumber of serious difficulties which would have to be faced indrawing up any satisfactory scheme of compensation; and, although some progress had been made in preparing proposals which mightbe suitable for adoption by the Government, solutions of all theproblems had not yet been found. Lord Longford was believed to favour a scheme which would involve accepting the general principleof State responsibility for providing compensation. But there appearedto be no simple way of limiting the application of such a principle to the victims of crimes of violence. The opportunity presented bythe debate should therefore be used to educate public opinion in thereality of the difficulties. The Government spokesman would accordingly express sympathy with those who suffered from crimesof violence, would draw attention to the defects of the sort of schemesupported by Lord Longford and would say that the search for asatisfactory solution of the problem was continuing. When workon the Governments own scheme had reached an appropriate stage,the Home Secretary would be bringing proposals before the HomeAffairs Committee.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the Lord Chancellors statement.broadcasting policy(previous reference:C.C. (62) 69thConclusions,Minute 3)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster General (C. (62) 193) covering a revised draft of the white paper on Broadcasting and Television.The Postmaster General recalled that, at the CabinetS meetingon 15th November, he had been invited to give further considerationto the passages in the earlier draft which dealt with Press participation in television programme companies, excessive violence in television programmes and the proposed levy on the profits of programme companies. The revised draft circulated under cover of C. (62) 193had been prepared after discussion in the Committee on broadcasting and Television and incorporated amendments on these and a numberof other points.The revised paragraphs on Press participation (paragraphs 21-25)contained an exposition of the recommendations of the Committee on broadcasting under the Chairmanship of Sir Harry Pilkington andthe Royal Commission on the Press under the Chairmanship of LordShawcross, an examination of the implications of controlling Pressinfluence through control of shareholdings and a statement of theGovernments provisional view about the safeguards which could be
applied without seeking to control shareholdings. The safeguardswere in effect in three stages:(i) the Independent Television Authority might take someprecautionary step, such as obtaining the advice of independent people &quot; on any aspect of the conduct of a press interest in a company&quot;;(ii) the Authority should have power, with the approval of thePostmaster General, to suspend or cancel contracts inthe event of abuse,;(iii) the Postmaster General should have a reserve power (to beexercised subject to affirmative resolution) to direct theAuthority to suspend or cancel contracts.In discussion there was general agreement in the Cabinet withthe passages in the draft White Paper dealing with Press participation.Although it could be held that monopoly control of television programmes, whether by a Press or other interest, was in itselfobjectionable, it would be right to accept the view of the ministerial committee that the recommendations made by the PilkingtonCommittee and the Shawcross Commission on the regulation ofshareholdings should be rejected as impracticable. It was suggested,however, that further consideration should be given to the proposalto embody in a statutory instrument any direction about Pressparticipation given by the Postmaster General to the Authority. Tomake the issue of a Ministerial direction to a public authority subjectto Parliamentary scrutiny, even if the instrument were not subject to either of the resolution procedures, might be thought to be a badprecedent. On the other hand, the power proposed to be taken bythe Postmaster General would be specific and its exercise could havea serious effect on private interests; and in these respects it would be different from the general powers of direction which could be exercised by the Ministers responsible for the nationalised industries. Inclusionof a provision for Parliamentary scrutiny might, moreover, go someway to convince those who would criticise the rejection of the pilkington recommendations that the Government intended to dealfirmly with the possible dangers of Press participation in theprogramme companies. The Cabinets conclusion on this point wasthat, on balance, it would be better not to include in the White Paper,or in the Bill as introduced, any specific provision for Parliamentaryscrutiny of directions issued by the Postmaster General. It would besufficient to indicate in the White Paper that the exercise of this power would be subject to suitable Parliamentary safeguards and todetermine in the light of debate precisely what safeguards should beadopted.In further discussion certain minor amendments were approved and the following points were raised:(a) In view of the difficulty of defining &quot; abuse &quot;, the Bill wouldhave to leave it to the Authority, subject to the Postmaster GeneraPsconcurrence, to determine the circumstances in which it would be appropriate to exercise their powers to suspend or cancel contracts.(b) The paragraphs relating to advisory committees(paragraph 18) and excessive violence (paragraph 38) had now beenapproved by the Ministers directly concerned.(c) A sentence had been added to the original paragraph (nowparagraph 27) on the proposed levy to indicate that, in formulatingdetailed arrangements for the levy, account would be taken of thedifference in financial circumstances between the four main companies and some of the smaller companies.(d) Discussions about Party political broadcasts were proceeding with the Leaders of the Parties but it seemed unnecessary to include any reference to this topic in the White Paper.(e) The draft should be examined to check the references inparagraph 17 and elsewhere which suggested that publication of theWhite Paper would precede publication of the Bill.
4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (62) 195) recommending amendmentof the Third Schedule of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947,in order to limit the rebuilding rights of owners of offices to anadditional 10 per cent of floor space.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was in his view a strong case for this amendment. Without it the planning authorities would continue to be handicapped in their efforts to keep office development in central London within reasonable limits. Thereshould, however, be no question of greater Exchequer liabilities for compensation if the amendment were made: there was no real case for this, since land-owners would still have the right to rebuild to alarger floor space than that of their existing premises and could inall cases apply for planning permission to expand still further; and itshould not be assumed that planning permission would always be refused. The object of the amendment was to avoid the unco-ordinated development to which the present right to automaticexpansion up to as much as 40 per cent of the existing floor spacegave rise. He had received a firm assurance from the Minister of housing that claims for compensation as a result of the proposed amendment would be resisted.The Home Secretary said that he strongly supported the proposed amendment. Many other possible methods of controlling office building in London had been considered, but had been found to be unacceptable. The amendment to the Third Schedule of the 1947Act was the only workable solution now open to the Governmentand he considered that it should be adopted. The amendment wouldnot be unexpected; it had long been canvassed by those v/ho tookan interest in the problems of metropolitan development and therewould be a large measure of support for it in both Houses ofParliament. In presenting the amendment it would be important toemphasise that there would be no question of stopping expansion;the object was to give the responsible local authorities greater controlover the scale and nature of the expansion.In discussion the following points were made:(a) Against the amendment it could be argued that it wouldunreasonably penalise land-owners who for one reason or anotherhad not already developed their properties under the existing regulations. It would also revive criticism of the London zoningplan, whose working in practice could have been held to have beenarbitrary and unfair. It would also be thought anomalous that theGovernment should now be seen to be seeking to restrict expansionwhen they had already given permission for office building on avery large scale in areas such as the South Bank and Millbank. Itwas recognised, on the other hand, that Government policy was boundto take account of the situation as it had developed; permission formany major recent developments had been given many years agowhen the implications for housing and transport of the rapidly expanding office population in London had not been fully appreciated.The London zoning plan had been carefully and sensibly worked outThe Cabinet Invited the Postmaster General to amend, in the light oftheir discussion, the draft White Paper annexed to C. (62) 193and to arrange for its presentation to Parliament concurrently with the introduction of the Television Bill, on a date to beagreed with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
and had on the whole served its purpose; even with the right of appealto the Minister, which was always open, there would be bound to becases in which the effects of zoning seemed to operate to the disadvantage of particular land-owners.(b) The Lord Privy Seal said that he opposed the amendment on grounds of general policy. The main argument urged in its favourwas the need to restrict or at least to bring under greater control thegrowth of office building and the office population in central London.This was the wrong perspective. Under such a restrictive policy itwould not be possible for London to become a major Europeancapital. London was already well behind other European capitals inthe scope and modernity of its development and in the resourcesdevoted to the improvement of transport and housing. In terms ofthe Common Market large prizes were at stake. The FrenchGovernment, in particular, were making a strong bid to attract to Parisall the major international organisations, with all that thatwould imply in terms of conferences, business activity and the balanceof payments. The effect of the proposed amendment would be to putLondon still further behind in the race.It was urged against these points that the object of the amendmentwas not necessarily to restrict office development but to bring it undera control which was now lacking; it would give greater and not lessscope for imaginative large-scale development and would reduce thepresent tendency to concentrate development within the limits ofexisting sites.(c) The Minister of Housing said that the proposed amendment should be viewed in the context of the other positive proposals for thedevelopment and rebuilding of London which he would shortly be putting forward. He strongly supported the aim of developingLondon as a modern progressive capital city, both socially andarchitecturally, and the amendment would help him to achieve this aim.(d) The Minister of Health said that refusal of compensation under the amendment might expose the Government to damagingcriticism. In spite of the argument sometimes heard to the contrary,there had never been any doubt about the intention of the 1947 Act;it had clearly conferred on property owners the right to a 10 per cent increase in cubic space and not merely in floor space. All existing schemes of compensation had been based on that assumption andfor the Government to alter the position without at the same timealtering the terms of compensation could be held to amount to a breach of faith.As against this it was argued that the industrial developmentcertificate procedure introduced in 1947 had deprived land-owners of a far greater measure of freedom to develop than the amendmentnow proposed, and there was evidence to show that, even under thelaw as it now stood, land-owners recognised that their right to compensation was not absolute. It was, however, to be expected thatthere would be criticism of the Government under this head.(e) It would be important not to exaggerate the restrictive effectof the amendment. Under planning approval already granted, whichwould not be affected by the amendment, another 10 million square feet of office space would be added to the existing total in London.The amendment would primarily affect the 60 million square feet ofobsolescent office space which would become due for redevelopmentin the next few years. It would be a matter of some difficulty todecide precisely where the amendment would begin to operate; if itapplied in such a way as to allow provisional rebuilding plans toproceed unaltered in respect of buildings not due for redevelopmentfor three or four years it would clearly be ineffective. On the otherhand, it would be inequitable that the amendment should apply to cases in which contracts had already been entered into on the basisof the present law.
Defence(previous reference:C.C. (62) 54thConclusions)ServiceActivitiesin theUniversities5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the chief secretary, Treasury (C. (62) 188) and by the Minister of Defence(C. (62) 189) about the retention of Officer Training Corps (O.T.Cs.)in the Universities.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the main argumentadvanced on earlier occasions in favour of the University O.T.Cs.had been their value in recruiting graduates as regular officers. Theresults achieved in this respect were, however, out of proportion tothe costs involved. The paper by the Minister of Defence showed that only 73 regular officers had been recruited by this means over aperiod of nine years, and even this figure was based on the assumption,which was clearly open to doubt, that the graduates concerned wouldnot have joined the Army if they had not been members of theUniversity O.T.C. The O.T.Cs. were already costing  460,000 a yearand needed an additional  150,000 worth of new equipment. Settingresults against cost it was difficult to avoid the conclusion that theO.T.Cs. were now a waste of public money. He therefore recommended that they should be abolished.The Minister of Defence said that it was not the case thatrecruiting to the regular Army was the only argument in favour ofthe retention of the O.T.Cs. The recruiting argument was in factweaker than his paper suggested, since one of the figures had beenincorrectly stated. The figure for 1962 should have been 16 andnot 22. The real value of the O.T.Cs. lay in the contribution whichthey made to the Army reserves at a time when officers of this qualitywere at a premium and, perhaps more importantly, the fact that they maintained a link between the Universities and the Army. This was more than ever necessary following the disappearance of NationalService. So far as costs were concerned it should not be assumed that the abolition of the O.T.Cs. would save  460,000 a year. the saving would be of the order of  230,000 only, since the regular officers now employed with the O.T.Cs. would be reabsorbed in otherArmy formations. It was unrealistic to suppose that the manpowerceiling of the Army would be affected by the very small numbers hereinvolved.The First Secretary of State said that he had discussed theproblem with the Ministers concerned. He supported the view thatthe maintenance of links between the Army and the Universities was of great and probably increasing importance at a time when pacifistorganisations of various kinds were flourishing, when the steadyingC.C. 72 (62)(/) The Minister of Housing was due to make a major statement on building policy early in the New Year when he would bepresenting in Parliament the positive side of his proposals; and itwould be convenient if the Bill amending the Third Schedule to the1947 Act could be laid at the same time. It would be impracticable to announce an intention to amend the Schedule in advance of theBill; this would merely lead to attempts to evade the effect of theamendment by taking advantage of the present rules for so long asthey remained in force.After further discussion the Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Third Schedule to the Town and country planning Act, 1947, should be amended in such a way as to remove any right to compensation if, on futureapplications for redeveloping existing office space,permission to increase existing floor space by more than10 per cent were refused.(2) Authorised the Minister of Housing to arrange for the drafting of the legislation required to give effect to their decision.
influence of National Service had disappeared, and when all too little was being done to instil into the younger generation a sense ofpatriotism and public service. The University authorities themselves would strongly resent the disappearance of the O.T.Cs. TheGovernment were already subject to criticism for their handling of University problems and that criticism would be bound to increaseif the O.T.Cs. were discontinued.In discussion the following points were made:(a) Not only recruiting but total membership of the O.T.Cs.should be taken into account. Even though a young man did not join the Army as a result of his membership of the O.T.C. it was nevertheless of value that he should have taken part in O.T.C. training and should have been prepared to give time and effort to it. Thepresent membership of the O.T.Cs. amounted to about 2,000 out ofa total University population of something over 130,000.(b) O.T.C. morale, particularly so far as concerned theinstructional staff, had been affected by the knowledge that for thepast two or three years the O.T.Cs. had been under examination andthat their long-term future was hanging in the balance. The absenceof any firm policy had also affected the supply of equipment; withoutreasonably up-to-date equipment to train them it was not to beexpected that undergraduate recruiting would improve.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that it seemed clear that the present situation, in which the squadrons werenot getting the support they needed to make a real success of their work, but had not on the other hand been given a firm decision aboutthe date of their disbandment, could not be allowed to continue. Itwould from many points of view, not least the effect on Universityopinion, be unfortunate if the Government were to wind up theO.T.Cs. in the immediate future. The practical alternatives as he saw them were either to allow the O.T.Cs. to continue on their present unsatisfactory basis for another year or so and wind them up then;or to give them a much firmer undertaking about their future and atthe same time to make a constructive effort in association with theUniversity authorities to make a greater success of them. Thebalance of opinion in the Cabinet semed to be in favour of the second alternative. He would discuss the possibilities further with the first secretary of State and the other Ministers directly concerned.The Cabinet Took note that, in the light of their discussion, the PrimeMinister would give further thought to the future of theUniversity Officer Training Corps, in consultation with theFirst Secretary of State and the other Ministers directly concerned.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th November, 1962.
