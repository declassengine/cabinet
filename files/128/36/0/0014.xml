The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (62) 27) setting out the economic arguments for a reduced rate of growth in public investment, anda memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury (C. (62) 28),summarising the points requiring decision on the Estimates for1962-63 and on public service investment for 1963-64.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the level of public investment expenditure in 1958-59 had been about  1,470 million.On the proposals put forward by Departments it would rise to 2,000 million in 1963-64: an increase of 6 per cent, in 1962-63would be followed by an increase of nearly 10 per cent, in 1963-64.Bearing in mind that much of this investment expenditure involvedsubstantial increases in current expenditure, he believed that theincrease proposed in 1963-64 would overload the economy andresult in a financial crisis in the autumn of 1963. He suggested thatthe rate of increase in 1963-64 should not exceed 6 per cent.The Estimates for 1962-63 had proved to be  111 million abovethe level set by the pledge, given in July 1961, that every effort wouldbe made to ensure that the increase over the Estimates for 1961-62would not exceed 1\ per cent, in real terms. Even if the cabinet approved all the proposals for reduction summarised in paragraph 3of C. (62) 28 there would still be a gap of nearly  70 million. Thiswould become known not later than 27th February, when the vote on Account would be published. Heavy criticism was to be expectedat home and abroad, and it would therefore be the more important to show that the Government were establishing effective controlover public investment in the longer term.In discussion it was pointed out that, even if the forecast ofoverloading in the economy in 1963-64 could be considered undulypessimistic, the Governments failure to fulfil the pledge given inSECRET60620-5 a 2PublicExpenditure(previous references:C.C. (62) 8thConclusions,Minutes 3 and4 andC.C. (62) 11thConclusions,Minute 6)1. The Cabinet were informed that in the last few days theSoviet representative at the Berlin Air Safety Centre had attempted to reserve parts of the air corridors into West Berlin for exclusiveSoviet use. These requests had been rejected, and Western aircraft had continued to make their normal use of the air corridors. Inorder to demonstrate Western intentions a limited number of extraflights had taken place. In the last two days, however, some of our aircraft had been intercepted by Soviet fighter aircraft, which were operating in the air corridors in unusually large numbers. This hadheightened tension on both sides, and there was a risk of an incidentwhich might have serious consequences.The Foreign Secretary said that he had pointed out to the SovietGovernment the risks involved in this apparent challenge to Westernrights of access to Berlin. It was not easy to reconcile this development with the response which the Soviet Government had made to the recent Anglo-American initiative on disarmament.The Prime Minister said that he was concerned at theseindications that the Soviet Government might be intending toincrease their pressure on the Western position in Berlin.The Cabinet took note of these statements.
July would attract serious criticism, not least from their own supporters. Apart, therefore, from the argument about theoverloading of the economy, it was important to counter the politicaland psychological effect of publishing Estimates which failed sosignally to meet the Chancellors pledge. The best way to do this might be to make a strong statement covering the maximum savingspossible in the Estimates themselves and showing determination to limit the growth of investment expenditure. On the other hand, itwas argued that the success of the Governments incomes policy was even more important, in establishing the economy on a sound footing,than the limitation of public expenditure. Any early announcementof cuts in the social services would be badly received by those whowere already dissatisfied with the policy of wage restraint, and theprospect of securing effective restraint in the growth of incomes wouldbe jeopardised. Moreover, the economic growth which theGovernment had declared to be their objective could not, in thelong run, be secured without more expenditure on some public services, e.g., for the purpose of increasing the supply of skilled labour.In further discussion the following points were also made:(a) A reduced rate of growth in investment expenditure would leave room for economic manoeuvre. The absence of flexibility hadin the past made crises difficult to surmount and, if experience inthe next year or two showed that restraint had been carried too far,it would be possible to bring about rapid increases in at least some ofthe public investment programmes.(b) Tt seemed clear from the analysis in C. (62) 27 that shortageof skilled labour was the main obstacle to increased production. Theapprenticeship system often appeared to involve too long a periodof training and some misdirection of effort and, although someimprovements had recently been achieved as a result of discussionwith particular industries, much remained to be done.(c) If that part of national production which was pre-empted bythe &quot; pleasure &quot; industries could be brought under firmer control,the prospects of promoting growth would be much improved. the basic aim in the Governments policies should not be anundiscriminating growth in production but the promotion of nationalefficiency.(d) In explaining reductions in the investment programme itwould not be necessary to describe them as cuts. The level of investment was in fact rising, and the need was to moderate the rateof increase. The public would understand that precision in estimating some years ahead could not be guaranteed.(e) Agreement had been reached between the Chief Secretary,Treasury, and the Ministers concerned on a number of adjustments in their investment programmes. These adjustments were set outin paragraph 6 of C. (62) 28. Agreement had not, however, beenreached on the education programme. As a result of earlier discussion it had been possible to reduce the level of educationalinvestment from an average of  136 million a year over the threeyears 1963-66 to an average of   1311 million. It was now suggestedthat a further reduction could more easily be secured if the yardstickadopted were building starts instead of work done. On this footingthe starts proposed in 1963-64 and 1964-65, which had been reduced from  66 million to  60 million per annum, might be further reducedto  55 million. It could be made clear that if economic conditionsimproved a larger number of starts might be authorised.(/) It would be unfortunate if the only Estimates savings forwhich the Government could claim credit were cuts in the social services, and there would be advantage in deferring for some monthsany announcement of decisions on these points. The Governmenthad in fact secured other economies, for example in defence expenditure, but these would not attract public attention.
incomes policy(previous reference :C.C. (62) 13thConclusions,Minute 3)Services Pay4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence (C. (62) 29) on the results of the review of Service paycarried out under the procedure recommended by the AdvisoryCommittee on Recruiting for the Services.The Minister of Defence said that the outcome of the reviewwould ordinarily be announced in the forthcoming debates inParliament on Defence and on the Service Estimates. The services would expect any increases to take effect from 1st April, 1962.There was no dispute about the figures. Movements in civilianearnings in the period covered by the review justified increases of1\ per cent, for officers and 13 per cent, for other ranks on basic pay, which could be represented as increases of 5 per cent, and9J per cent, respectively on the average level of their emolumentsincluding marriage allowance. It could be argued on two maingrounds that increases of this order would not jeopardise theGovernments efforts to secure restraint in wage increases generally;first, because the movements in civilian earnings covered by the review had taken place in the two-year period ending in July 1961before the introduction of the wages pause; and secondly becausethe Services were in a special position because of the nature of their duties and their contracts of service, and because they had no unionrepresentation.   While he believed for these reasons that the(g) The welfare milk subsidy involved an annual expenditure of 20 million, much of which could be better used in other ways withinthe general limits of health expenditure. Withdrawal of the subsidy would have little impact on those who benefited from it and wouldbe in accordance with the Governments general policy. Moreover,since the powers under which the subsidy was payable would expirein October 1964, legislation for their renewal would be required not later than the 1963-64 Session, and it was desirable that before then the scope of the subsidy should have been reduced to a defensiblelevel.(/?) An increase in the price of school meals would be widelyregarded as more serious than abolition of the welfare milk subsidyand, although such an increase might be the least damaging cutwithin the education services, it would bear hardly on those in rural areas and it would be better that any announcement should at least be deferred for a time. Increases of smaller amounts than 6d. mightbe made gradually over a period.The Cabinet (1) Took note that, in discussions between the Chief Secretary,Treasury, and the Ministers concerned, agreement hadbeen reached to limit the growth in investment expenditure in 1963-64 as described in paragraph 6 ofC. (62) 28.(2) Agreed that building starts in the education investment programme for 1963-64 and subsequent years should belimited to  55 million a year but that local educationauthorities might be told that this figure would beincreased if economic conditions permitted.(3) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministers ofEducation, Health and Pensions and National Insurance,to consider whether changes in the welfare milk subsidyand in the charge for school meals might be announced in the early summer as taking effect in the autumn.
increases proposed were justified in themselves and would notendanger the Governments general wages policy he would be readyto agree that, in view of the special difficulties of the economicsituation, the increases should be awarded in two equal instalmentson 1st April, 1962, and 1st April, 1963.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that an alternativepossibility would be to announce that the full increase would be given from a date later in the year, possibly in October. Under theMinister^ proposal the Services would have to forego some  14million in pay and allowances between April 1962 and April 1963.Under his alternative proposal the loss to them would be no greaterbut would be concentrated in the first half of the year. It had theadvantage from his point of view of making it easier to tide theGovernment over the next few critical months when the major wage claims, on which the success or failure of the Governments wages policy so largely depended, would have to be settled. An award of4f per cent, on 1st April might be interpreted as having some relationto the 2\ per cent, figure which the Government had set as the limit for wage increases in general and might affect outstanding claims;an increase of 9\ per cent, in October could not be so interpreted.In discussion the following points were made:(a) A delayed award would give rise to political difficulty inrespect of National Service men who had been retained in the forces and promised full regular rates of pay. Delay in introducing the pay increases could be represented as an attempt to economise at theexpense of these National Service men.(b) The presentation of any increases would need to be carefully considered. They would in fact take the form of increases in basic pay and would be expressed in terms of daily rates of pay. unless some guidance were given to the contrary they would be interpreted as equivalent to much higher percentage increases than 9\ per cent.It would have to be made clear that Service allowances could notbe left out of the reckoning, and that an increase which could be calculated as showing a rise of, say, 13 per cent, in basic pay was tobe regarded as involving no more than an increase of 94 per cent,in emoluments.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that increases in pay should be awarded to theServices equivalent to increases of 5 per cent, for officersand 9\ per cent, for other ranks calculated in terms of pay and marriage allowance combined.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Defence, in consultation with the Minister of Labourand the Minister of Housing, to decide whether these increases should be awarded in two instalments to take effect from 1st April, 1962, and 1st April, 1963, or shouldbe awarded in full in the later months of 1962.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th February, 1962.
