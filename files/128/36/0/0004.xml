(government expenditure(previous reference:C.C. (61) 71stConclusions,Minute 5)Estimates,1962-632. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (C. (62) 2) on the Estimates for 1962-63.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the forecast total forthe 1962-63 Estimates now stood at  5,610 million. The Chancellorof the Exchequer had pledged himself, both in Parliament and in negotiation with the International Monetary Fund, to keep the1962-63 Estimates to a level of not more than 21 per cent, in real terms above the Estimates for 1961-62. After recalculating the1961-62 Budget Estimates at 1962-63 levels of pay and prices, 5,610 million represented an increase of 41 per cent. Savings of 110 million would be required to limit the increase to 21 per cent.The out-turn for 1961-62 now looked like being about  200million above the Estimates; and, as compared with this out-turn,the present forecast total for the Estimates for 1962-63 would be fairly near the 21 per cent, figure. The Chancellors pledge had.however, related to the Estimates, not to the out-turn.Post office I.   The Postmaster-General informed the Cabinet of the effectWage on Post Office services of the decision of the Union of Post OfficeDispute Workers to ask their members to work to rule as a protest againstthe rejection of their request for an interim increase of wages. Therehad been no effect on the telegram and telephone services. the delays in postal services had varied from one part of the country toanother. The most serious congestion was at the sorting office atMount Pleasant in London: this was being relieved by transferringsome of the arrears to other offices and by suspending acceptanceof certain classes of bulk posting. So far the volume of publiccomplaint at delayed deliveries had been small. It was too soon toestimate for how long the union would maintain this demonstration.They would be influenced by the outcome of the current discussions between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Trades UnionCongress on the general question of wages policy.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It seemed anomalous that some postal workers should bepaid overtime in order to offset the results of working to rule. ThePostmaster-General said that this was necessary in order to prevent a more serious disruption of postal services which would be likelyto bring discredit, not merely on the postmen, but on the government also.(b) Was it necessary to take special steps to ensure the delivery of football pool coupons? Delays here would reduce public sympathy for the postmen.(c) This dispute had not arisen directly from the government&apos;s policy for securing a pause in wage increases. The postmeifs claim,based on comparison with outside rates, could not properly havebeen considered until the Pay Research Unit had completed a report which was not expected before the spring, and the Post Office had undertaken, when the claim was made, to negotiate on it as soon asthat report was available. It would be useful if the facts of this dispute could be presented more clearly to the public.The Cabinet (1) Took note of this statement by the Postmaster-General.(2) Invited the Minister of Housing to take such steps as were practicable to ensure that the facts of this dispute were more clearly presented to public opinion.
The Chief Secretary said that the proposed cuts in welfare services which the Cabinet were about to discuss were expected to yield about  34 million. It should not however be thought that intheir search for economies the Government had concentrated whollyon welfare. Many Ministers had already accepted painful reductions in their programmes, particularly in transport and in defence, in an effort to enable the Chancellor to fulfil his pledge.The Vote on Account in which the 1962-63 Estimates would be presented to Parliament was normally published in the middle ofFebruary. It would be possible to postpone publication untiltowards the end of February and this would allow a maximum of six weeks in which to take final decisions.The Cabinet Took note of C. (62) 2.Forecast of The Cabinet had before them memoranda  by the  ChiefGovernment Secretary, Treasury (C. (61) 218 and C. (62) 3) on the level ofExpenditure Government expenditure as now foreseen in the period up toup to 1965-66 1%5,66The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that, important as it was to honour the undertaking which had been given about the 1962-63Estimates, it was still more important to bring expenditure in the longer term into balance with resources. To this end it was desirablethat expenditure over the next five years should be concentratedespecially on programmes which might be expected to foster growth in the national economy within that period. Increased expenditureon education in the next few years would have no marked effect onthe health of the economy for 10 years or more. His paper set outthe background against which decisions could be taken.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The most important aspect of the Governments economic policy was the attempt to bring incomes and wages into line withthe growth in national productivity and to introduce measures designed to encourage economic growth. If these measures were successful it might be possible to plan on a more rapid rise in the gross domestic product than the 2\ per cent, which the paperassumed. This would reduce correspondingly the need forrestriction in public expenditure and would help to lower the high levels of debt interests forecast. As against this, however, even theestimate of 2\ per cent, had been based on optimistic assumptions about future trends. It had been assumed that the balance ofpayments problem would be solved, that exports would increase at per cent, a year, and that the productivity of the individual workerwould increase by 2\ per cent, per year instead of the 2 per cent,which had been the average over the last 10 years.(b) It was suggested that, in the context of a policy designed toincrease growth, it would be illogical to impose cuts in public expenditure which might inhibit it. Experience tended to show, forexample, that if home production were restricted exports went down.There was no particular virtue in maintaining public expenditure ata level of 42  per cent, of the gross national product; but, if itcontinued to rise, the economic balance would become increasinglyprecarious. In the last resort public expenditure had to be financed from the private sector; too great a diversion of resources from theprivate sector would lead to a collapse. Within the figure of 42  percent, it was possible to distinguish forms of expenditure which madea fairly direct contribution to the health of the economy roads forexample; and it was important that Ministers should themselves takethe initiative in suggesting economies or deferments in expenditure which made no such direct contribution in the period immediately ahead.
3iEducationInvestmentExpenditure(previous reference:C.C (61) 73rdConclusions,Minute 1)3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the chief secretary, Treasury (C. (62) 4), and the Minister of Education(C. (61) 221) on the level of educational investment up to 1965-66,and a memorandum by the Minister of Education (C. (62) 5) on educational policy.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that in all the major fields ofpublic expenditure except housing and education he had agreed withthe Ministers concerned programmes of investment over the next five years which were within acceptable limits. He was continuinghis discussions with the Minister of Housing and hoped that agreement would be reached. He had, however, been unable toreach agreement with the Minister of Education and the papers now before the Cabinet set out the extent of the difference between them.Eighteen months ago the Minister of Education had announced tolocal authorities a provisional investment programme for 1962-63.He now wanted to announce a further programme for 1963-64 at a level of  134 million and was for this reason anxious to obtain anearly decision. As compared with an average of  116 million a year for the three-year period from 1960-61 to 1962-63 the ministers present proposals involved an average level of expenditure of 136 million in the period 1963-64 to 1965-66. The Chief secretary said that in his view, and against the general economic backgroundwhich the Cabinet had already discussed, an increase from anaverage of  116 million to an average of  136 million could not bejustified. He had put forward proposals which would have the effectof reducing the average to  121 million. This could not be regardedas a cut in educational expenditure; even at the levels he proposed it represented a substantial increase.The Minister of Education said that forward planning oversuccessive three-year periods was an essential feature of the present programme for expansion in education. Local authorities alreadyknew what was expected of them in 1962-63 and building plans werein an advanced stage. To alter those plans at this late stage wouldbe difficult in practice and would give rise to political embarrassment.From the Cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion on 13th December he had takenit to be the view of his colleagues that no alteration should be madein the planned programme for teacher training colleges and force.C. 4 (62)(c) There was every reason to think that the problem would infact be greater than present figures suggested. In recent years actual expenditure had tended to outrun the Estimates by a substantialmargin.(d) There was a danger that cuts in social services would lead to pressure for higher wages, particularly in the lower paid sectors ofindustry, and would thus contribute to inflation. This had not always happened in the past but the danger should not be overlooked. If for this or for wider reasons it were decided tocontinue with the steady expansion in expenditure on social services which present forecasts assumed, it would be necessary either toincrease taxation or to make further reductions in other forms ofpublic expenditure. It was suggested that increased taxation shouldnot be ruled out; it might be preferable politically to some of the economies now under discussion.The Cabinet Took note of C. (62) 3 and of the points made in their discussion.
technical colleges, and in considering the possibility of economies hehad therefore concentrated on the schools programme. The chief secretary&apos;s proposals, however, involved both teacher training andtechnical colleges. The teacher training programme had alreadybeen pushed forward a year; the Chief Secretary&apos;s proposals wouldinvolve a further year&apos;s postponement of the original programme.So far as the schools programme was concerned any postponementnow of new starts would create great political difficulties as it wouldinvolve a departure from the undertakings given in the 1958 white paper on education. The political damage which this would causeseemed to him to be out of all proportion to the small gain to the economy. Even the programme which he proposed could be held to be too small; the National Union of Teachers were about to publish the results of an independent enquiry under the chairmanship of the Vice-Chancellor of Leeds University which would argue thatthe present rate of investment in education was too low. The mosthe could do to meet the Chief Secretary would be to reduce theaverage level of expenditure in the three years in question from 136 million to  131 million. This could be done without publiclyannouncing a reduction in the programme; to go lower than 131 million would involve a public statement and severe criticism.The following points were made in discussion:(a) It would not be easy to bring the housing programme withinthe limits which the Chief Secretary appeared to have in mind. Todo so would make it impossible to improve the rate of slum clearance,which was likely to become an increasingly sensitive political issue.It might be necessary for the Cabinet to reconsider the building programme as a whole, including the possibility of restoring building control in the private sector. The difficulties foreseen for Englandand Wales applied with at least equal force to Scotland.(b) The Minister of Education said that the reductions proposedby the Chief Secretary in the educational building programme wouldbe more formidable in practice than they appeared to be on paper.The programme for teacher training would be reduced from 6 million to  5 million a year and the programme for further education, mostly concentrated in technical colleges, from  17 million to  16 million in 1963-64. The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said thatif it were the case that programmes which had been approvedprovisionally and had been so announced could not now be alteredwithout upsetting local authorities because they had been used asa basis for executive planning it might be necessary to alter for thefuture the procedure under which programmes of this kind were authorised.(c) It could be argued that the expansion of teacher training facilities and of technical colleges would make no contribution towards economic growth in the five-year period with which theCabinet were mainly concerned. The buildings would not becompleted within that time and the immediate effect might be towithdraw skilled manpower from industry rather than increase thesupply. As against this it was recognised that in the longer term theeffect of expansion would be to increase the flow of qualifiedmanpower into industry against a background of increasing shortage.The Prime Minister said that the national economy wasprecariously balanced, and it was against this background that theCabinet had to decide whether to leave the educational building programme at the level of  131 million which the Minister ofEducation now proposed or to reduce it to  121 million. Theproblem would be of less importance if the Government succeeded in their main aim of getting incomes and wages into line with thegrowth in national productivity. But this was still uncertain and ifcontinued overstrain on the economy led to devaluation of sterlingthe effect would be disastrous to our standing in the world. Asagainst this it would be important to avoid economies which would
4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (C. (61) 219) submitting revised proposals for reductions in expenditure on certain welfare services.In the Cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion on 13th December there hadbeen a substantial measure of support for the proposal that theprovision of cheap welfare milk should in future be restricted tofamilies with four or more children. The Minister of Health saidthat his advisory committee on nutrition would support this changeprovided that cheap milk continued to be supplied also for three-childfamilies where all the children were under five. With this modification he would be ready to defend the change on nutritionalgrounds.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that he was prepared toaccept this modification, though it would involve some administrativecomplications which would delay the introduction of the change.On the other hand, the rise in the price of milk which had takenplace since his paper was circulated, and was likely to be maintained,would increase the savings to the Exchequer. With the concessionnow proposed by the Minister of Health the change would haveyielded, on the calculations in his paper, a saving of  17+ million ina full year. With the higher price of milk, this figure would now become  204 million though, in view of the delay in introducing themore complicated scheme, the full benefit would not be reaped inthe next financial year.In discussion the point was made that this proposal would expose the Government to the political criticism that they werewithdrawing a subsidy to poorer people with families at a time whenthey were affording relief to surtax-payers. It was also argued thatthe withdrawal of this subsidy would make it more difficult to secureco-operation in a policy of wage restraint. On the other side it was recognised that a strong case could be made against maintaining thissubsidy when it was no longer justified on nutritional grounds.The Cabinet were informed that it was not proposed to makeany change in the general arrangements for providing free milk in schools. It was, however, for consideration whether free milk shouldcontinue to be supplied in independent schools. The withdrawal ofthis concession would produce a saving of  870,000 a year. Nonutritional risk would be involved: it was likely that most of these schools would continue to serve the milk and to charge the parentsfor it.School Meals A saving of  17 million a year could be secured if the charge for school meals were raised from Is. to Is. 6d. The Minister ofEducation said that he was satisfied that this would not involve any direct educational disadvantage. It might have social disadvantagesif, as a result, more schoolchildren in the towns took their mid-daymeals in cafes.In discussion it was pointed out that, if this change were made,workers would have to pay an extra 2s. 6d. a week for each childtaking school meals.   This would apply particularly to rural areas,welfare services(previous reference:C.C. (61) 72ndConclusions)Welfare Milkfrustrate the Governments effort to get support for a viable wagesand incomes policy.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume at a later meeting their consideration ofthe future level of expenditure on education.
FamilyAllowanceswhere there was often no alternative. Here again therefore the changemight increase the difficulties of securing co-operation in a policy of wage restraint.Annex E of C. (61) 219 gave brief particulars of a possible meansof saving  34 million a year by adjustment of the present system of family allowances. This plan was not recommended by the chief secretary, Treasury. It would involve controversial and wide-ranginglegislation. It would reduce the income of large numbers of families,at a time when the Government were seeking to win support for apolicy of wage restraint. It could also be represented as involving ameasure of discrimination against the poorest families.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance said that, ifserious consideration was to be given to this proposal, either as analternative or as an addition to the other proposals set out inC. (61) 219, he would wish to have an opportunity of submitting amemorandum developing the objections in greater detail.The Cabinet Took note of C. (61) 219 and of the points made in discussion, and agreed to resume at a later meeting their consideration of these proposals for a reduction in certainwelfare services.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,9th January, 1962.
