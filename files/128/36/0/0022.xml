The future course ofReference: the Conference would probably turn on the final attitude of theC.C. (62) 20th Soviet Government towards the principle of inspection or verilica-tion. To a nuclear tests agreement, at any rate, this was crucial;and, if the Conference were to break down on this issue, it would be important that the Western Powers should be in a position to demonstrate that the Soviet Government had been unwilling toaccept any proposals, however reasonable, for internationalverification of&apos; their compliance with the terms of an agreement.The Prime Minister said that he hoped to be in a position tomake a fuller report on this question at the next meeting of theCabinet.Economic 2.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofSurvey, 1962   the Exchequer (C. (62) 52) covering a draft of Part I of theEconomic Survey, 1962.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while the value of publishing an annual economic survey was open to doubt, hethought it necessary to present one for 1962 in substantially the sameform as had been adopted in recent years. The draft which he had circulated was limited to Part I of the text proposed for publication.The first half of this draft summarised the main events of economic importance in 1961: the second half gave tentative forecasts ofeconomic developments in the remainder of the current year and suggested the main objectives of Government policy. Part II of the survey would contain a detailed analysis of economic developments in 1961. The draft of Part I had already been amended to take account of suggestions made by the Economic Policy Committee.He proposed that, subject to further consideration of draftingpoints, the Survey should be published on 4th April.Discussion showed that there was a general feeling in theCabinet that annual economic surveys, though possibly of some limited value to writers on financial and economic subjects, had ceased to have much general value. If a survey must be published in 1962, it should, if possible, be the last; and other means shouldbe considered of securing publicity for comparable material infuture years, possibly through the National Economic development council. The wording of the first half of the draft annexed toC. (62) 52 should be reconsidered. The first two paragraphs couldbe omitted altogether, if a suitable reference were includedelswhere (perhaps in paragraph 17) to the United Kingdonvsapplication for membership of the European Economic Community.The Cabinet  /Subject to further consideration of drafting amendments,approved for publication on 4th April the draft of Part Iof the Economic Survey, 1962, which was annexed toC.

(62) 51) on the Report of the Committeeappointed in May 1961 under the chairmanship of Lord Radcliffe to review security procedures and practices in the public service.The Prime Minister recalled that the immediate occasion forthe appointment of the Radcliffe Committee had been the public anxiety aroused by the results of two espionage trials (the Portland* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
case and the Blake case) in which Government employees had been convicted of communicating secret information to agents of theSoviet Government. The Committee had been invited to review the security procedures and practices in the public service in thelight of those convictions. They had been given the fullest access toall relevant material, including the Report of the earlier committee under the chairmanship of Sir Charles Romer which had investigatedthe circumstances of the Portland case. In addition, they had themselves carried out a corresponding investigation into the Blakecase. While they were sitting criticisms had been voiced in theHouse of Commons about the operation of the &quot; D &quot; Notice system for regulating the publication of defence information, and they hadbeen asked to include this among the subjects of their enquiry.Accordingly, they had presented their Report in three separate parts the first dealing with security procedures in the public servicegenerally, the second examining the special problems of the Blakecase, and the third commenting on the operation of the &quot; D &quot; notice system.The Report had been considered by the Ministerial Committeeon Security, who had agreed that all its recommendations could beaccepted. They had also concluded that there would be advantage in making public a substantial proportion of that part of the report which was concerned with security procedures in the public servicegenerally. The main theme of this part of the Report was the needfor continual vigilance against espionage: it was not enough toensure that Communists or Communist sympathisers were not employed in positions in which they could have access to secret information: the main danger came, not from the Communist Partyin this country, but from the intelligence services of the Soviet blocwho, in their choice of agents, did not confine themselves to people who accepted the Communist ideology: for this reason physicalprecautions, such as the safeguarding of premises and documents,were as least as important as personnel security. It was desirablethat as much as possible of the philosophy and reasoning of thispart of the Report should be made public. For, while it illustrated the danger of the espionage threat, it also demonstrated the difficultyof countering it effectively in a free society. Publication would therefore help to secure a better public understanding both of theimportance of the security problem and of its difficulties.Copies of the Report had been shown, in confidence, to the leader of the Opposition and three senior Privy Councillors of his party. These Opposition leaders had welcomed the proposal to publish a substantial proportion of the part of the Report which dealt with security procedures in the public service generally. Theyhad also favoured publication of the third section of the Report,dealing with &quot; D &quot; Notices; and it had been ascertained that thePress members of the standing committee through which the systemof &quot; D &quot; Notices was operated were also disposed on the whole to favour publication of this part of the Report. The opposition leaders had, however, agreed that, in view of the nature of the duties on which Blake had been employed, it would be contrary to long-standing convention to publish that part of the Report which was directly concerned with the Blake case. In the light of these consultations the Ministerial Committee on Security had supervisedthe preparation of a draft White Paper (annexed to C. (62) 51) which included the greater part of those sections of the Report which dealt with security procedures in the public service generally andwith the &quot; D &quot; Notice system. This draft White Paper followed, as nearly as possible, the wording of the Report itself: the changes made were almost entirely changes of omission. A number of these changes arose from the need to delete references to specially secretestablishments, details of foreign intelligence services anddescriptions of counter-measures. But, in addition, three largeromissions had been made on grounds of public policy:SECJ.   1

A number of these changes arose from the need to delete references to specially secretestablishments, details of foreign intelligence services anddescriptions of counter-measures. But, in addition, three largeromissions had been made on grounds of public policy:
In discussion the following points were raised:(a) Serious concern was expressed about the extent of communist penetration of Civil Service staff associations. Thebalance of advantage doubtless lay against publishing the full detailsdisclosed by the Radcliffe Committee. Urgent action should,however, be taken with a view to reducing the number ofCommunists employed as officials of these associations. As partof this operation, means should be sought of ensuring that themembers of these associations were aware of the extent to which their interests were being represented by Communists.(b) Further thought should be given to the possibility of preventing the disclosure in the Press of secret information relatingto military operations or equipment. It was arguable that thepublic interest would be better served if, instead of issuing &apos;; D &quot;Notices which covered a wide field but were not uniformly observed,a stricter system of enforcement could be applied to a smaller range of vital information. If an alternative system could be devised onthese lines, a successful prosecution under the Official Secrets Actwould set a salutary example. The Prime Minister suggested thatthe Ministers directly concerned with this problem might submit proposals for examination by the Ministerial Committee on security.(c) It had been contemplated that the White Paper might be presented to Parliament on 27th March. In view of theParliamentary time-table it would be preferable that its presenta-tion should be delayed until 3rd April.C.C. 22 (62)(i) No reference was made in the draft White Paper to theprocedure of normal vetting. This was a covert process, carried out without the knowledge of the individual concerned. While it hadbeen incidentally mentioned in Parliament on a few occasions, thenature and extent of the procedure had never been fully disclosed.(ii) The draft White Paper did not include a chapter of theReport which discussed whether Communists should be completelyexcluded from the public service. The Radcliffe Committeethemselves were divided on this issue and made no recommendation on it.(hi) The Ministerial Committee on Security had also decidedto exclude from the draft White Paper a chapter of the report which considered the problem of Communist penetration of CivilService staff associations. The situation disclosed by this chapter wasdisquieting and certainly called for urgent action. But the ministerial Committee were satisfied that some of the remediessuggested by the Radcliffe Committee (including the institution of&quot; house unions &quot; in certain secret establishments) were impracticable.They also considered that disclosure of the extent of Communistpenetration of these associations would shock public opinion in thiscountry and, even more, in the United States. Steps should certainly be taken with a view to reducing the number of communist officials in these staff associations; but for this purposea carefully prepared plan of practicable action was needed. Thiswas now in preparation, but further time was required to completeit. The Ministerial Committee were satisfied that the chances ofcarrying it through with success would be prejudiced by prematurepublication of this chapter of the Radcliffe Committee&apos;s Report.The Prime Minister said that in these circumstances he sought the Cabinet&apos;s approval for the publication of a White Paper in theterms of the draft annexed to C. (62) 51.
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the recommendations made in the Report ofthe Radcliffe Committee should be adopted.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for a White Paper inthe terms of the draft annexed to C. (62) 51 to be presented to Parliament on 3rd April.(3) Took note that the Ministerial Committee on Security would consider any proposals which might be put forward bythe Ministers concerned for preventing disclosure in thePress of secret information relating to military operations or equipment.KenyaConstitutionalConference(previous reference:C.C. (62) 20thConclusions,Minute 4)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (C. (62) 53) on developments in the KenyaConstitutional Conference and the possible courses of action nowopen to the Government.The Colonial Secretary said that the Conference had been unable to reach agreement on a constitution for self-governmentin Kenya and the delegations from Kenya were now looking for a lead from the United Kingdom Government. He proposed to put to them the outlines of a constitution which struck a balance betweenthe proposals by the Kenya African National Union (KANU) for astrong Government at the centre and those of the Kenya AfricanDemocratic Union (KADU) for a federal system of government.The details of any such compromise constitution would have to be worked out later with the active participation of both the mainAfrican parties. This could best be secured within a coalition government, headed by an official, which would have the framing ofthe new constitution as its main task and would be more of a constituent assembly than a normal Government. If the constitutioncould be agreed in this way, elections would be held under it,possibly at the end of 1962, and the period of self-governmentleading to independence would then begin.The least palatable feature of these proposals was that it wouldbe necessary to include Kenyatta in the coalition Government. If,however, he joined such a Government, he would find it moredifficult to satisfy his extremist followers, and the moderate element in the KANU party might gain greater influence. Whatever course was now adopted a serious security situation might well arise andthere could be no question of withdrawing British troops from kenya.The Colonial Secretary said that he also envisaged a largerprogramme of resettlement of landless Africans who in presentcircumstances presented the gravest threat to security. It would benecessary to purchase European farms and to equip them for Africanuse.. It was likely in any event that some of the European farmers would leave the country and claim compensation; and in the absenceof any scheme of African land-settlement fighting would be likelyto break put for possession of the deserted farms.In discussion the following points were made:(a) One possible course would be to adjourn the Conference,announce that it would be reconvened in, say, six months&apos; time, and continue the present Government in office. The objections to thi?were that it would be likely to lead to early outbreaks of violence,since there would be no restraint on the extremists; that it wouldbe a wholly negative policy; and that all the delegations to theConference (including the representatives of the European settlers)and the Governor were strongly in favour of an attempt to bring ina coalition Government at this i;tage.SECT.
(b) The hopes originally entertained that Mr. Kenyatta&apos;sinfluence would decline once he had been released from confinementhad not been fulfilled. He could not be relied upon to honour anyundertakings or to respect any constitution if he once attained fullpower. It could therefore be represented as unprincipled as wellas dangerous to offer him any position of responsibility. On theother hand it would not be practicable at the present stage to contemplate the formation of a coalition Government without him.He was still the acknowledged leader of his party, and his political influence was still considerable. His powers were, however,declining; and if he took office in a coalition Government his capacity to cause trouble would probably be less than if he were free to act independently. Even the representatives of the European settlersnow accepted the impossibility of excluding him.(c) It would not be easy to form a coalition Government, andthe attempt might well fail. From some points of view this mightbe an advantage, particularly if the failure came about in such away as to divide the extremist from the moderate element in theKANU party. If such a division in KANU led to a substantialweakening of their general position in Kenya it might be possibleto encourage KADU to continue in office at least for the time being and to entrust to them the task of working out the details of thenew constitution, possibly with the assistance of the moderateelement in KANU. These possibilities could not, however, be seriously discussed until the attempt to form a coalition Governmenthad been made and the likelihood of success or failure could be judged more accurately.(d) The financial implications of a large resettlementprogramme would need careful examination. considerable expenditure would be involved and it would not be easy to frame the resettlement proposals in such a way that they did not leadinevitably to demands for compensation from the european community as a whole.(e) In any event the security situation was likely to be dangerous. It would not be possible to contemplate the withdrawalof British forces at any time before independence and there might even be need for reinforcement. The possibility of withdrawingtroops from Germany for this purpose should be considered; if this were impracticable, present plans for reducing the Army to a strengthof 173,000 might have to be re-examined.The Cabinet1 (1) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to present to the KenyaConstitutional Conference proposals for a self-governingconstitution in Kenya based on the best attainablecompromise between the proposals of the Kenya AfricanNational Union and the Kenya African DemocraticUnion. ,(2) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to explore the possibilityof forming a coalition Government in Kenya to work outthe details of such a new constitution.(3) Took note that the Colonial Secretary would discuss withthe Chief Secretary, Treasury, a programme for thesettlement of Africans on land to be purchased fromEuropeans.(4) Invited the Colonial Secretary to report to the Cabinet the outcome of his enquiries under Conclusions (1) and (2)above.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,20th March, 1962.
