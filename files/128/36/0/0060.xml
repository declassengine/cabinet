The Cabinet had before them a note by the First Secretaryof State (C. (62) 153) covering a revised draft of The Queen&apos;s speech on the Opening of Parliament.In discussion it was suggested that paragraph 7 of the draft should be expanded to include a reference to the legislation whichwould be required if the United Kingdom joined the european economic Community. Omission of any specific reference to legislation would be taken to mean that the Government had decided against legislation in the coming session of Parliament and would invite pressure for an explanation of the Governments intentions.On the other hand, inclusion of a reference to legislation would be out of place if in the event negotiations were not completed in time toenable a Bill to be introduced and enacted during the session. Thegeneral view of the Cabinet was that on balance the prudent coursewould be to make no direct reference to legislation and to confine the Opening Speech to a reaffirmation of the Governments intentionto seek the approval of Parliament when the negotiations had beencompleted. It would be easier to explain the difficulties of timing inthe course of the Debate on the Address than to take account ofthem in the Opening Speech itself.In further discussion the Cabinet agreed upon a number of amendments in the draft Opening Speech.The Cabinet (1) Subject to the amendments agreed upon in their discussion,approved the terms of the revised draft of the opening speech.(2) Took note that the revised draft, as amended, would besubmitted by the Prime Minister for The Queen&apos;approval.1. The Lord Privy Seal said that the military situation in the yemen was still obscure. The republican Government appeared tohave a fair measure of control in the west and south of the territory,but in the north and east the tribes were maintaining their independence and their old loyalties. Tribal forces had captured the fort of Maarib, but it was understood that the republicans weremounting a counter-attack. The Imam Badr was believed to bealive and was reported to have been in touch with King Saud.The United States Administration agreed with us that recognitionshould continue to be withheld for the time being, although 20countries, including the Arab Republics, had already recognised thenew regime. The United States Administration had informed theEgyptian Government that they had important interests at stake inthe Arabian Peninsula which they would not be prepared to see putinto jeopardy by developments in the Yemen and it was helpful tous that they had listed the British position in Aden as being amongthe interests which they had in mind.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the Rulers in the AdenFederation were much disturbed by the course of events in the yemen. They were afraid, and with reason, that if the new regimesucceeded in establishing its position, their own armed forces wouldbe subverted. In that event Yemeni influence would be likely toextend through the Federation to the borders of Aden Colonyitself, and our position in Aden would be undermined.The Prime Minister said that it would be necessary to keepdevelopments in the Yemen under close review, in consultation withthe United States Administration. For the time being the policy ofnon-involvement and non-recognition must continue.
Cotton(previous reference:C.C. (62) 52ndConclusions,Minute 3)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (62) 155) on imports of cotton textiles from Pakistan.The President of the Board of Trade said that on 1st August theCabinet had agreed that if Pakistan could not be persuaded to restrictvoluntarily her exports of cotton textiles and yarns to the 1961 levelsimport restrictions would have to be applied. The 1961 figure for imports from Pakistan had amounted to 0-6 million lb. of yarmDuring the Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers he had agreed that Pakistan should be offered an increase in the ceilingfrom 0-6 million lb. to 1 -4 million lb., which had been the figure for1960. President Ayub Khan, however, had refused to accept this and had asked for an increase to 2-56 million lb., which had beenthe peak figure for 1956-57.The cotton industry had been given to understand that totalimports from Asian countries would not exceed 1961 figures. Evenan increase to 1-4 million lb. in imports from Pakistan wouldinvolve between 2 and 3 million more yards of cloth and would havesevere repercussions on the confidence of the textile industry, whichwas now at last showing faint signs of revival. Since there seemedno prospect that Pakistan could now be persuaded to acceptvoluntarily either the original figure of 0-6 million lb. or the revisedoffer of 1-4 million lb., he proposed that the offer should be withdrawn and that the original limit of 0-6 million lb. should be imposed compulsorily. The annual conference of the Cotton Boardbegan on 19th October and he would before then have had to informthe industry of the arrangements that would operate after the end of1962.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the proposal that HongKong, India and Pakistan should voluntarily restrict imports ofcotton textiles to 1961 levels suited the first two whose imports in1961 had been high, but did not suit Pakistan whose imports hadbeen below the levels of previous years. When this fact had been realised there had been a bitter reaction from the pakistan government and from President Ayub in particular; the latter had refused to accept the increase to 1-4 million lb. which had been proposed as a compromise and had persisted in demanding the much higher figure of 2-56 million lb. India had already agreed that she would not herself ask for an increase in her ceiling if the figure forPakistan was raised to this level. There was, however, a serious difficulty about Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Government had notyet been asked to comment on the possibility of any higher ceilingfor Pakistan. It was likely that, if any increase was conceded to pakistan, they would wish to increase their own exports above the1961 levels. He would not be prepared to impose compulsoryrestrictions on the export of textiles from Hong Kong. He felt,however, that if the Hong Kong Government could be induced toaccept an increase in the Pakistan ceiling not to 2-56 million lb., butto 1-4 million lb., it was possible that Pakistan might also accept this figure. In view of the likelihood of very serious damage to ourrelations with Pakistan if compulsory restrictions had to be imposed,he felt that it would be right to make this last attempt to obtainvoluntary agreement.In discussion the following points were made:(a) Even if Pakistan could be persuaded to accept a limitationof 1-4 million lb. voluntarily she would be unlikely to do so with good grace and our relations with the Pakistan Government would suffer in any case. It was inevitable that an increase to 1 - 4 million lb.for imports from Pakistan would have serious repercussions on theconfidence of the textile industry in this country. In thesecircumstances there was much to be said for withdrawing the offer of
1-4 million lb. which had been made in the context of theCommonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting and reverting to theoriginal figure of 0-6 million lb.(b) The attitude of the Pakistan Government had been less thanconstructive. Actual imports from Pakistan were currently runningwell below the level of 0-6 million lb. which was itself well in excessof the levels laid down by the Geneva long-term arrangement.Pakistan had made no allowance at all for the difficulties facing the textile industry in the United Kingdom. It was possible that, even at this late stage, if it could be clearly established that any increaseabove 0 - 6 million lb. would be unacceptable to Hong Kong, Pakistan,faced with the alternative of compulsory restrictions, might agree toaccept a limit of 0-6 million lb. voluntarily.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to base his statement to the cotton industry on the assumption that imports of cotton textiles from India, Hong Kong and pakistan would not be allowed to rise above the levelspreviously agreed.(2) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to make a finaleffort to persuade the Pakistan Government to restrictvoluntarily their imports of yarn into the United kingdom to a level of 0 - 6 million lb.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th October, 1962.
