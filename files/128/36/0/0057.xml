(62) 56thConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Prime Minister outlined to the Cabinet the course andthe results of the Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers whichhad ended on the previous day. In the event the timing of theMeeting had proved to have been fortunate; for, although it hadbeen hoped that the negotiations with the Six would have been further advanced, the general pattern had been clear enough togive Commonwealth countries the opportunity for full and informeddiscussion. Had the negotiations been further advanced at the timeof the Meeting it might have been said that we were trying to presentthem with a fait accompli.A particular disappointment had been the attitude of the african countries towards association. This would offer them greateconomic advantages, but these had not prevailed against their political dislike of anything which could be interpreted as a continuation of an inferior relationship with former colonial powers. The Africans had also pointed to the different arrangementsenvisaged for the Asian countries as confirmation of their view thatassociation was an inferior status. In fact, although the Asians were offered very reasonable treatment particularly in the nil tariff fortea, the arrangements proposed for them were less beneficial thanthose provided by association. The main concern of the asian countries had been to delay the application of the external tariff totheir imports until after the conclusion of the trade agreements.The most difficult problems had, however, been those of the older Commonwealth countries.   Canada was not really concernedForeign 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Soviet authorities in affairs Berlin had, without protest, complied with the request that the guardBerlin for the Soviet War Memorial should not travel through the western(Previous sector in an armoured vehicle. A &apos;bus had been used for the purposeReference: of relieving this guard on 15th September.   It now seemed unlikelyC.C. (62) 56th that discussions on Berlin between representatives of the united conclusions, States and Soviet Governments would be resumed until late in the minute 2) autumn.The Foreign Secretary said that the Central Government of the congo had sent representatives to Elizabethville to discuss certain aspects of the United Nations plan for a settlement between theCentral Government and the Government of Katanga. They had,however, shown reluctance to discuss the constitutional proposals inElizabethville, lest this should seem to concede a special importanceto Katanga. It had been suggested to them that this difficulty couldbe avoided if they arranged for their representatives to go to all theprovinces in turn to discuss this aspect of the proposals. Mean-while, fighting seemed to have started in the northern part of katanga. It was possible that the Central Government might beattempting to seize control of this part of the province, which wasremote and sparsely populated.The Foreign Secretary said that the problems of disarmament and nuclear tests were likely to figure prominently in the debates inthe General Assembly of the United Nations. On tests there was some prospect that the latest proposals of the Western Powers mightcommand support; and the Soviet Government, if they continuedto reject them, might find themselves in some embarrassment.The Prime Minister said that no useful progress was likely tobe made with this question until the current series of nuclear testshad been completed. Later in the autumn, however, there might bean opportunity for a fresh initiative towards an international agreement for the cessation of tests.
about her wheat exports, but had made the most of her otheranxieties. The Australians had fought strenuously for their interestsand would continue to try to drive a hard bargain. New zealand had taken a reasonably helpful line by emphasising the extent towhich their final attitude would depend on arrangements still tobe made.The Meeting had started badly, but had ended as well as could have been expected. In spite of all the earlier consultation,Commonwealth Ministers had not clearly understood the under-lyingconsiderations in favour of our entry into the Community. he hoped that the discussions at this Meeting had helped to clear their minds on this and to put our position in a better perspective. Thegroup discussions had also served a useful educative purpose.The Lord Privy Seal said that the general tone of the discussion had been influenced by the statement issued at the end of theconference in London of representatives of Opposition parties in commonwealth and Community countries. The attitude of the african countries towards association might have been different ifthe Indian delegation had been more helpful. We should now be obliged to explore the possibility of getting some of the advantages of association through trade agreements. This would be difficult and would in any case take time. There would also be a possibleconflict with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which required trade agreements to be balanced as between the various parties, for the essence of association was that it was not balanced.There might be psychological advantage in finding some other titlefor the status of association. Delay in the application of the external tariff to the Asian countries would raise for the Six a point ofprinciple; and they would also fear that the Indians might spin outthe negotiations for a trade agreement so as to continue to enjoy the advantages of free entry. A possible compromise might be to delay the imposition of a tariff for a stated period, say six to nine months, within which a trade agreement would have to be concluded.Of the old Commonwealth countries, the Canadian representa-tives still refused to give any idea of the priorities which they wouldattach to solutions of their difficulties. In the discussions ontemperate foodstuffs the Australians had taken an intransigent line;they had demanded, not only access, but a guaranteed priceremunerative to Australian producers. This was something whichwe could not have accepted even if our entry into the community had not been in question, since it would have involved anundertaking to cover in advance and at our expense the effects of australian inflation. New Zealand and Canada did not attach somuch importance to the question of price because they were efficientproducers. More should be done to explain these issues in public.New Zealand had now modified her original demand for the guaranteed export of certain fixed quantities of her produce andwas prepared to accept a guaranteed share of the market instead.He intended to review the New Zealand position on his next visit to Brussels when New Zealand representatives would be present.Full Ministerial discussions would be resumed in Brussels on 8th and October.In discussion the following points were made:(a) Although the course of the recent Meeting might seem tosuggest that the other countries of the Commonwealth were actuatedsolely by considerations of self-interest, it should be rememberedthat Commonwealth discussions with a commercial content had always been difficult. This Meeting had been less contentious thanthat which had led to the conclusion of the Ottawa Agreements.(b) Public opinion in this country was still insufficientlvinformed of the case for our entry into the Community. It wouldnot be easy to engage in publicity while the negotiations were stillincomplete,  partly  because  of  the  danger  of weakening  our
Supply ofArms(previous reference:CC. (59) 60thConclusions,Minute 4)Middle East3. The Foreign Secretary said that the Governments of theUnited Kingdom, the United States and France had had a long-standing agreement to refrain from sales of military equipment whichwould disturb the balance of military strength in the Middle East,particularly between the Arab States and Israel. The United StatesGovernment had renewed the agreement in July of this year. InAugust, however, they had informed the Government of Israel thatthey would be prepared to supply surface-to-air missiles as part ofa political bargain by which the Israeli Government would for their part undertake certain obligations, particularly on the refugeequestion. If the United States offer were eventually confirmed it was likely that the Israeli Government would, also for political reasons,wish to accept it and would not consider alternative sources ofsupply. Knowledge of the United States offer would produce a hostile reaction from the Arab States in the Middle East; and if thisreaction were to extend to the United Kingdom the results wouldbe more serious for us than for the United States. A number of arab States depended heavily on the United States for economic aidwhich they would be unlikely to jeopardise. The United kingdom on the other hand depended on staging rights in Libya and over-flying rights elsewhere, whose loss would be a serious embarrassment.We were, however, potential suppliers of missiles of the type inquestion and the Israeli Government were already aware of this. Ifwe were to refuse to consider supplying them with missiles, we should lose the chance of exports of great importance to the British aircraft industry without any guarantee that we should escape odium oreven reprisals when the United States offer became known. on balance, however, he had decided that it would be better to refrain from any approach to the Israeli Government at this stage and to await developments.CC. 57 (62)negotiating position in Brussels and partly because sectional interestsin this country, particularly the farmers, would expect specificassurances on particular points and would not be influenced by the broader arguments. Nevertheless, it would be right to extend thescope of the limited publicity which had hitherto been given tothe Governments case. The general arguments in favour of entry into the Community could now be deployed more forcibly, with the proviso that we should not join it if in the last resort it proved thatthe conditions were unacceptable. Suitable use could be made ofthe Prime Ministers opening and closing speeches to theCommonwealth Meeting and of the speech which he would be making on television that evening.(c) No firm date could be set to the conclusion ofthe negotiations in Brussels, but the outlines of a final settlement would progressively become clearer and more attention could begiven to the anxieties of British farmers. In the last resort the reaction of our own farming community might be decisive.The Cabinet (1) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the senior ministers concerned to discuss with the Lord Privy Seal,on the latter&apos;s return from Europe in the following week,the future handling of the negotiations for the UnitedKingdom&apos;s entry into the European economic community.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Minister without Portfolio, toconsider what use might be made of the Prime Ministersrecent speeches to give more publicity to the arguments in favour of joining the Community.
agricultural policy(previous reference:C.C. (61) 71stConclusion,Minute 6)FarmImprovementScheme4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Agriculture and the Secretary of State for Scotland and by theChief Secretary, Treasury (C. (62) 141 and 142) on the farm improvement Scheme.The Minister of Agriculture said that the  50 million which hadbeen authorised by the Agriculture Act, 1957, for grant aid to farmers under this scheme would shortly be exhausted. When thefuture of the scheme had been reviewed by Ministers in April it hadbeen thought that under the rules of competition applying within theEuropean Economic Community it would be permissible to continuevarious forms of direct subsidy to farming. It had been agreed thatthe rate of grant under this scheme should be reduced from 33^ percent to 25 per cent; and it had been intended that provision on this basis should be included in the Agriculture (miscellaneous provisions) Bill which would be introduced early in the following session of Parliament. He now believed that, if we joined theCommunity, the permissible forms of direct subsidy would be muchmore limited than had been supposed and he suggested that it wouldbe imprudent, in view of the importance of direct grants in the farming economy, to reduce the rate of grant on one of the fewschemes which probably could be continued. If the rate remained at 33^ per cent and the scheme continued to operate for the whole the Minister of Aviation said that, while he agreed in general with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s assessment of the position, there were two recent developments which he thought it right to emphasise.First, the Israeli Government had now asked us, through our ambassador in Tel Aviv, whether we would be prepared to supplymissiles. Secondly, the fact that unofficial Israeli representatives hadbeen told in Washington that we were possible suppliers seemed tohim to make it not merely probable, but inevitable, that we shouldbe a target for Arab hostility when the United States offer became known. In all the circumstances, he suggested that we might informthe Israeli Government privately that we might be interested insupplying missiles to them, and to make the same intimation tofriendly Arab States.In discussion there was general agreement that no action shouldbe taken until the United States offer, which was still thought to betentative, had become public. At that stage we could make it known that we held ourselves free to supply any Middle East country withmissiles of this type. Before this stage was reached it would be advisable to review in detail the present state of missile equipment in the Middle East countries concerned, the scope for increasing thelevel and effectiveness of that equipment, and the political andeconomic implications of so doing.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Defence and the Minister of Aviation, toarrange for a review of the present state of missileequipment of the countries of the Middle East, of thescope for increasing it and of the political and economic implications of so doing.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Defence and the Minister of Aviation, toconsider in the light of this review the terms in which theUnited Kingdom Government might announce their readiness to supply missiles to Middle Eastern countries,once the terms of the United States offer to supplymissiles to Israel had become known.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,20th September, 1962.of the 10 years originally intended, it would be appropriate to providea further  50 million. On the basis of 25 per cent the amount required would be  35 million, so that the saving from altering therate would be no more than  15 million, or  3 million per annum.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said he understood that therewas considerable risk that the Farm Improvement Scheme would beheld to contravene the rules of competition in the Common Market.Even if it were not so held, there did not appear to be sufficient justification for adding to the large investment already made in agricultural improvements. The best course might be to allow thescheme to come to an end early in 1963 and meanwhile to carry out a full review of the system of agricultural support, which would inany event have to be reviewed as soon as the effect of the policies of the European Economic Community could be seen more clearly.He would, however, be content that the scheme should continue onthe reduced rate of grant agreed upon in April.In discussion there was general agreement that public controversy about the future of the scheme should be avoided.There would be little to be gained by exercising the power given bythe Act of 1957 to make an Order increasing by  5 million theamount at present available; this would be taken as an indication that the scheme was running out and would produce a flood of applications. Nor would there be advantage in continuing thescheme on the basis of provisions which either left the rate of grant to be settled by Order or specified a rate which might be varied byOrder. Farmers needed to plan their expenditure over a period andwould claim, with good reason, that the rate of grant should be announced at the outset. As the rate prescribed in the Act hadbeen 33J per cent, an alteration could not be made without attractingattention and the right course, on a balance of all the considerations,would be to provide for continuance of the scheme at the same rate.It was, however, possible that there would in future be rather lessdemand for farm improvements than there had been in recent yearsand that for this or other reasons it might not be necessary to provide in the Bill for expenditure to continue at as high a level as in previous years. These points should be further considered and, ifpossible, the aggregate amount to be provided for by the Bill andthe Act of 1957 should not exceed  80 million.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the rate of grant paid under the farm improvement Scheme should remain at 33^ per cent.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to consider with theChief Secretary, Treasury, what additional amount of grant should be authorised in the proposed Agriculture(Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to enable the scheme tocontinue for a reasonable period.
