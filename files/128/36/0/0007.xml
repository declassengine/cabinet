ImperialChemicalIndustriesandCourtaulds1. The Cabinet reviewed the situation created by the currentattempt by Imperial Chemical Industries (LCI.) Ltd. to acquirecontrol over Courtaulds, Ltd.The Prime Minister said that the Home Secretary, in view of his private interest in Courtaulds, had thought it preferable that he shouldnot be present when this question was discussed by the Cabinet.The President of the Board of Trade said that the governments general attitude towards mergers and take-over bids had hitherto beenthat these were matters for the companies concerned, who were thebest judges of their own commercial interests, and that it was not forthe Government to interfere with the free operation of the privateenterprise system. This particular operation had, however, arousedgreat public interest and some anxiety among Government supporters mainly because of the size of the companies concerned and theextent of the monopoly which they already exercised over theproduction of man-made fibres. He had therefore thought it right tosee the Chairmen of both companies, separately, to inform himself ofthe situation and of their intentions. This had demonstrated theGovernments concern. He would welcome the views of the Cabineton the question whether on this occasion the Government should give some public indication of their attitude.Discussion showed that a strong body of opinion in the cabinet favoured the earlier view that operations of this kind were best leftto the commercial judgment of the companies concerned. In supportof this view the following points were made:(a) On the monopoly issue, it was the policy of the Governmentto rely on the machinery of the Monopolies Commission and the restrictive Practices Court; and it would be inexpedient for theGovernment to seek to form, in advance, their own judgment on the monopoly situation which might arise from an amalgamation of thesetwo firms. In any event, even without such a merger, something like a monopoly situation already existed through Courtaulds&apos; control overrayon and I.C.I.&apos;s control over terylene and the joint holdings of thetwo companies in British Nylon. Spinners.(b) There was little force in the argument that, if these two companies were merged, the joint undertaking would be likely to be nationalised by a future Socialist Government. For LCI. alone were already vulnerable to such a threat.(c) It would not be appropriate for the Government to comment on the terms of the offer which LCI. were proposing to make toshareholders in Courtaulds. Moreover, any Government statement about this operation might affect the market value of the sharesconcerned, and the Government might be open to criticism on that account.id) It would be a lengthy and laborious task to arrive at an objective judgment on the merits of this operation; and theGovernment would not be justified in taking a dogmatic view withoutfull enquiry into all the relevant facts and technical considerations.(e) If the Government were led into expressing a view on this operation, mainly because of its size, they would be setting a dangerous precedent. They would be pressed to declare their attitude towardsother transactions of this nature.  Where would they draw the line?if) Public opinion on monopolies and on the scale of industrial organisations was changing with the growing recognition of theincreased competition which British industry would face from thecountries of the Common Market, whether or not we joined that organisation.On the other side it was argued that the Government had a duty to consider whether the absorption of Courtaulds by LCI. would be contrary to the national interest. It was true that they had no statutorypower to prevent a take-over bid.  It was true that the procedure ofSECRET60500-3 A 2
the Monopolies Commission operated only when conditions of monopoly had already been established, and that even then therewere no powers to enforce the Commission^ findings though in thisparticular case the Government could break a national monopoly, ifthis were desirable, by adjustment of the tariffs on imported man-made fibres. It was also true that the techniques of take-over bidswere under investigation by the Jenkins Committee, and that it wouldbe difficult for the Government to take any line on this aspect of thematter until after that Committee had reported in the spring. But, infact, though these aspects were being canvassed in public discussion,none of them had any real importance in relation to this particularoperation. The crucial issue here was whether the future prosperityand expansion of this important British industry was more likely tobe assured if it was all brought under single management. The factthat Courtaulds had originally been willing to discuss proposals for a merger showed that they recognised the advantages of this course.The crucial question was whether those advantages were so great that,if they could not be secured by merger, it was right that LCI. should seek to obtain them by means of a take-over bid. It was certainlyimportant that the true issue at stake should be more clearly presented to public opinion. It was for consideration whether, in addition especially in view of the growing competition which British industry would face as the strength of the European Economic Communitygrew the Government should make it plain that, in their judgment,it would not be contrary to the national interest that these two firms should be brought under unified control.It was suggested that for this purpose it might be desirable thatthe President of the Board of Trade should hold further conversations with the Chairmen of the two companies so that the Governmentwould be in a better position to satisfy themselves, on the basis of more detailed knowledge, that they would not be justified in taking any stepsdesigned to prevent LCI. from gaining control over Courtaulds.Even if it were eventually decided that these further conversations should not be held, the Chairman of LCI. might at least be asked toprovide the President of the Board of Trade with a writtenmemorandum setting out the technical case for establishing unifiedcontrol over the operations of the two companies in the field of man-made fibres.The Prime Minister, at the end of the discussion, said that some statement about this operation would have to be made in parliament on behalf of the Government in the course of the next few days. Thiswould have to make it plain that the Government had no legal powers to intervene and that it was not for them to comment on theterms of the offer made to the Courtauld shareholders; it would haveto deal with the monopolies aspect; and it might with advantage refer to the prospects of increased foreign competition. It was forconsideration whether it should go further and say that the Presidentof the Board of Trade was proposing to hold further conversations with the Chairmen of the two companies so that the government might satisfy themselves, by these further enquiries, whether there was any reason to believe that the operation which LCI. were proposing to undertake would in any way be contrary to the national interest.Two alternative drafts could be prepared on these lines and, withthese before them, the Cabinet could resume their discussion at a later meeting. Meanwhile the Chairman of LCI. might in any event beasked to submit a written memorandum setting out the technical case for bringing the manufacture of man-made fibres under unifiedmanagement.The Cabinet (1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to preparealternative drafts of a Parliamentary statement on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister at the end of the cabinet&apos;s discussion.
(2) Took note that the President of the Board of Trade would obtain from the Chairman of LCI. a written memorandum setting out the technical case for bringing the manufactureof man-made fibres under unified management.(3) Agreed to resume their consideration of this question at alater meeting.Indonesia 2.   The Foreign Secretary sought the concurrence of the Cabinet(Previous        in the terms of a statement, to be made that day in both Houses ofReference:       Parliament, about the tension which had arisen between Indonesia andC.C. (62) 5th   the Netherlands over West Irian. This indicated that there was nowConclusions,     a prospect of negotiations which would permit this dispute to be minute 3)       settled without the use of force.  It went on to say that the UnitedKingdom Government were anxious to avoid any action which might increase the tension or add to the possibility of an armed conflict.They had therefore decided that, as a temporary measure untilthe situation had clarified, they must suspend the export of arms andmilitary equipment from the United Kingdom to Indonesia.In discussion it was explained that the method of suspending theseexports would be to cancel export licences already granted. Newlicences would be issued if it were decided later that these exportscould be resumed. It was agreed that this explanation could be givenin reply to supplementary Questions.The Cabinet Agreed that statements in the terms proposed by theForeign Secretary should be made that day in both houses of Parliament announcing the temporary suspension of theexport of arms and military equipment from the UnitedKingdom to Indonesia.South-east asia treaty organisation laos(previous reference:C.C. (62) 5thConclusions,Minute 1)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (62) 15) on the situation which would arise in Laos if the geneva Conference broke down.The Foreign Secretary said that, since this memorandum was circulated, the position had improved. The three Laotian Princes had undertaken to send a national delegation to Geneva by 1st February,and they had agreed that any dispute over the distribution of ministerial offices in a national Government should be resolved bythe King. In these circumstances it no longer seemed necessary tomake any formal communication to the United States government about the policy which we might feel obliged to follow if hostilitieswere renewed in Laos. It would be enough if the difficulties which weforesaw in that event were explained informally to the Americansthrough the diplomatic channel.The Cabinet Agreed that no formal communication should be made to theUnited States Government at this stage on the lines suggested in paragraph 10 of C. (62) 15.united nations(previous reference:C.C. (61) 47thConclusions,Minute 4)Cost of operations inthe Congo4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (62) 13) on the payment of the United Kingdom shareof the cost of current operations by the United Nations in the Congo.The Foreign Secretary said that in his view the United kingdom should continue to contribute to the cost of operations in the Congofor two main reasons. First, we maintained that there was a legal obligation on member countries to contribute and had supported the
application for a ruling in this sense by the International Court ofJustice. We could not consistently discontinue our own contributionwhile this ruling was awaited. Secondly, a failure to make our contribution would have a damaging effect on our relations with theUnited States Government. Our contribution from November 1961to June 1962 would amount to just over  2 million. He proposed, withthe agreement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that we shouldmake payments monthly in arrears and should withhold from our contribution the cost incurred by us in providing air support for theUnited Nations in the Congo and of maintaining the Nigeriancontingent.In discussion the following points were made:(a) If we sought to withhold payment until the international court had given its opinion, this would involve considerable delay andin the meantime our relations with the United States Governmentwould have been put at risk.(b) While the legal position remained in doubt it would bedifficult to argue that member countries who made no contribution, inparticular Russia and France, had no standing in United Nationsdebates on the Congo situation. Voting rights were indisputablyforfeit only if a member country defaulted on its contribution to theregular budget of the United Nations.(c) If contributions were paid monthly and in arrears it would bepossible for the Government to review the position if the united nations operations in the Congo developed on lines which they couldnot support.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the United Kingdom should continue tocontribute to the cost of United Nations operations in the congo on the basis proposed in C. (62) 13.The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (62) 14) on the question whether the United kingdom should subscribe to the bond issue in support of the finances of theUnited Nations.The Foreign Secretary said that the financial situation of theUnited Nations was now precarious; their reserves were limited, andtheir deficit was likely to reach $170 million by the middle of 1962.Even if the bond issue were fully taken up, further measures wouldhave to be taken in 1963 to keep the United Nations solvent. TheUnited States Government were determined to make the bond issue a success, and had offered to subscribe $100 million subject tothe approval of Congress. Congress would be influenced by the extentto which other member countries had in the meantime subscribed oragreed to subscribe, and for this reason the United States government attached great importance to the promise of a contribution from theUnited Kingdom at this stage.The Foreign Secretary argued that such a contribution would bejustified if it were made clear that the Government regarded the bondissue as no more than a holding operation designed to tide the united nations over until a more radical solution of its financial difficultieswas worked out. The United States Government had suggested thatwe should contribute $25 million. This was too large a sum. TheUnited Kingdom contribution to the regular budget of the united nations was 1\ per cent, and a subscription to the bond issue on this basis would amount to just over $15 million. He himself would favour an outright subscription of $.12 million; an alternative wouldbe to subscribe $5 million now with the promise of further contributions to follow.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23rd January, 1962.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The financial crisis in the United Nations which had made thebond issue necessary was directly due to the failure of member countries to contribute to the cost of current operations. It would therefore be logical to make our agreement to subscribe contingent onthe imposition on member countries of an obligation to meet their share of current costs or to face loss of voting rights if they failed todo so. As against this, however, the question of contributions to current operations raised legal points which were now before theInternational Court; it would for this reason be difficult to force animmediate decision on this, and it might be better to treat the bondissue as a separate question.(b) There was little doubt that the United States would in the last resort provide the money required to keep the United Nations going;but, if they were forced to do so without any help from us, Anglo-American relations were bound to suffer. It must be a main object ofthe Governments policy in 1962 to preserve and if possible increasethe degree of support which we could command in the general assembly and in the Security Council. There were difficult issuesahead, notably in Africa; and a subscription to the bond issue would help to create a more sympathetic attitude to our difficulties.(c) It was important that the bond issue should not be allowed toobscure or defer the real issues confronting the United Nations. Itshould be made clear that any subscription which the United kingdom might now make would be on a once-for-all basis, on the understand-ing that the opportunity thus provided would be used to overcome thedifficulties which had led the United Nations into its present state.(d) A subscription to the bond issue would not be easy to defendto Government supporters in this country. The timing was speciallyunfortunate in view of the other contentious issues with which theGovernment would shortly be faced. This difficulty would be easedto some extent if it could be made clear that any United Kingdomsubscription was subject to certain express conditions. It might even be possible to suggest that the United Kingdom subscription wouldbe to an amount not exceeding $12 million, the precise amount to be governed by progress in the United Nations itself towards a longer term solution. There might be other conditions which we should wishto make privately to the United States Government, particularly the degree of support which we should expect the United StatesGovernment to give us in forthcoming debates in the United nations on Colonial questions.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to circulate a further paper setting out the conditions which might be attached to anagreement by the Government to subscribe $12 million tothe United Nations bond issue.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a later meeting.
