The Foreign Secretary said that there has been a seriousbreach of the cease-fire agreement in Laos, near the Chinese frontier.Pathet Lao forces had routed a superior force of Royal troops.Representatives of the International Control Commission were proceeding to the Pathet Lao headquarters to discuss the situation.Mr. Malcolm MacDonald was in Laos and it was hoped that he wouldbe successful in preventing trouble from spreading. There were some signs that General Phoumi was at last responding to United Statespressure to co-operate in a national Government.The Foreign Secretary said there was reason to hope that, as aresult of mediation by the United Nations representative in the Congo,Mr. Tshombe might shortly resume his discussions with Mr. Adoulaon a basis which might lead to agreement between them. On theother hand there was evidence that mercenaries were returning toKatanga in some strength. It was alleged that the airfield at Kolweziwas being adapted for use by jet aircraft; and attempts by the united nations authorities to inspect this airfield were being frustrated by theKatangans. Some new initiative was required to prevent the situation from deteriorating; and arrangements were now being made for representatives of the United States, United Kingdom and belgium to meet privately in London to concert plans which, if approved,might be put into operation through the United Nations.The Foreign Secretary said that it was now evident that the SovietGovernment were not at present prepared to engage in seriousnegotiation on disarmament, and their representatives at the geneva conference were suggesting that the Conference should adjourn on1st June. The United States and United Kingdom representativesthought there would be advantage in continuing the public discussionof the main features of the United States and Soviet plans. Theywould argue in favour of continuing the Conference through the summer. It must however be recognised that, in view of the Sovietattitude, this would be largely an exercise in propaganda.The Foreign Secretary said that at the recent meeting of theNorth Atlantic Council in Athens he had had some informalconversation with the Foreign Minister of Portugal about thepossibility of modifying the Anglo-Portuguese treaties. He had explained that the United Kingdom would find great difficulty inhonouring their commitment to assist in the defence of the Portuguesecolonies. The Portuguese Foreign Minister had shown littleunderstanding of our difficulties and no enthusiasm for the revisionof the treaties. He had, however, agreed that this question might be pursued through diplomatic channels.North atlantic council(previous reference:C.C. (61) 75thConclusions,Minute 5)ministerial meeting inAthens3. The Foreign Secretary said that the discussions at the recent meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) in Athenshad, on the whole, been satisfactory. Despite what had been said inthe British Press, they had not in fact disclosed any substantialdifferences on defence policy between the Governments of the UnitedKingdom and the United States. Other members of the Alliance hadnot pressed for the creation of an independent NATO deterrent or forthe establishment of medium-range ballistic missiles in Europe. these projects had been set aside for the time being. Instead, agreement had been reached on the formation of a Nuclear Committee, through which the United States authorities would keep the other membersof the Alliance informed of the state of their nuclear preparations and plans in Europe.   This should be helpful in the next stage of the parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
Aid to countires overseas(previous reference:CC. (61) 5thConclusions,Minute 2)&apos; 4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (62) 68) about the current level ofexpenditure on aid to countries overseas and the possible growth ofthis expenditure.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as our balance ofpayments improved, we should come under increasing pressure toincrease the level of aid on a bilateral basis and to contribute more to international agencies for this purpose. He had therefore circulated for the information of the Cabinet a summary showing the positionalready reached and the new claims now outstanding. We could notescape our obligations to the International Development Association,the United Nations Special Fund, the Indus Basin Development fund and the European Fund; and, if we joined the European economic community, we should have to contribute to its Overseas development fund. Within the Commonwealth Nigeria and Kenya would needsubstantial assistance, and some short-term support would have to beprovided for the Central African Federation. India and Pakistanwere pressing for larger contributions. We had already agreed togive generous assistance to British Honduras for reconstruction workfollowing the recent hurricane. As regards foreign countries,particular difficulties arose over Egypt, whose recent request forfurther aid was said to be based on a desire to reduce its dependence on funds from the Soviet bloc. It would be inexpedient to discouragesuch a change of alignment; and further assistance could be made conditional on fulfilment of obligations under the Anglo-EgyptianFinancial Agreement. But if aid were extended to Egypt, it would bedifficult to justify less generous treatment for Iran and Turkey, whosepast support of our policies in the Middle East gave them greaterclaims to our consideration.The Colonial Secretary said that it might also be necessary toconsider shortly the grant of economic aid to Aden.The Cabinet-Took note of C. (62) 68 and of the statements made in their discussion.industrial disputes .National DockStrike(previous reference:CC. (62) 29thConclusions,Minute 1)5. The Minister of Labour said that the employers&apos; and workers&apos;representatives concerned with the threatened dock strike had failedto reach agreement at the meeting of the National Joint IndustrialCouncil on 8th May. An offer already made by the employers and accepted by the unions would provide an increase in pay of about per cent, for dockers who were paid on piece rates. An additionalIs. per day, equivalent to 3 per cent., had been offered for those paid on a time basis (which would affect overtime payments to piece-ratedockers)  and the employers had undertaken  to  consider  thediscussions on NATO strategy, in which the balance between the nuclear and the conventional strength of the Alliance would have tobe reviewed.The Minister of Defence said that, while some progress had beenmade at the Athens meeting, the next round of discussions on NATOstrategy was likely to be difficult. Serious differences of opinion had still to be resolved.The Foreign Secretary added that the colonial problems of theNetherlands and Portugal were causing tensions within the Alliance.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.
establishment of negotiating machinery with a view to a reductionin hours from 44 to 42 per week with effect from 1st January, 1963.The expected reduction of hours would add a further 4 to A\ per cent,to the wages bill. The unions were, however, asking for an additional.Is. 6d. instead of Is. per day for those paid on a time basis: and an extra 6d. would amount to a further \\ per cent, on the time rates,making a total increase of 3  per cent, in time and piece ratescombined. Officials of his Department had seen representatives ofthe two sides separately on the previous day and, although there seemed to be no prospect of agreement between them, he would himself see the employers and later the union representatives that afternoon. The two main points for consideration were whether, ifthe employers showed a desire to increase their offers, they shouldbe discouraged from doing so; and whether, if they showed no suchdesire, the Government ought to press them to make an increasedoffer. Strike notices had already been issued and, unless these were withdrawn, a national dock strike would begin at midnight on Sunday,13th May.The Cabinet first considered what arrangements should be made if efforts to avert the strike were unsuccessful. There was generalagreement that the Government would be expected to act swiftly tosecure the continuance of essential supplies and services and that a proclamation of Emergency should be made on the morning of14th May. Emergency Regulations, which should be ma&quot;de on thesame day, could be debated in both Houses of Parliament on 17th May.Steps should be taken to enable at least some troops to start work inthe docks on 14th May. For this purpose reconnaissance parties(who should wear civilian clothes) could hold.discussions with port authorities in the dock areas during the afternoon of Saturday,12th May; and advance parties could move during Sunday, 13th May(or, if necessary, on the previous evening) to the areas in which thetroops would be accommodated. Substantial bodies of troops wouldhave to be moved during Sunday, 13th May, but troops would notbe introduced into the ports themselves until the morning of 14th May.In discussion of the attitude to be adopted by the government towards the threatened strike there was general agreement that the overriding objective must be to avoid a major breach of theGovernments incomes policy. On the other hand, any positiveattempt to restrain the employers from making an improved offer would be taken as confirmation of the charge, which was already being made, that the Government did not want a settlement and wereindeed creating a strike about a mere 6d. per day. The accusationthat the Government wanted a strike should be firmly denied by theMinister of Labour in the discussions with the two sides which wouldtake place that afternoon. In the talk with the employers, he should say nothing which could be represented as dissuading them from making a further offer if they decided for themselves that such an offer should be made, but he should make it plain that the Governmentwere not pressing them to make such an offer. He should do his utmost to ensure that the employers themselves gave adequatepublicity to the offers they had made and, in particular, brought outthe full meaning of the commitment in regard to hours. disclosure of the facts, in terms of percentage increases, would demonstrate thatthe offers already made went far beyond the limits of the governments incomes policy. In speaking to the union representatives he coulddraw attention to the favourable nature of the offers made and couldstress the unfortunate long-term effects of strike action, not only inthe docks themselves, where the programme for decasualisation wouldbe delayed, but also in the economy of the country generally. Bothin the discussion with the two sides and in answer to the Questionswhich would be put to Parliament that day, it would be important
that the Minister of Labour should not step outside his constitutionalrole as a conciliator; and he should avoid giving any ground for anallegation that the Government were taking sides in the dispute.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) There was a conflict between the traditional function of theMinister of Labour as a conciliator in industrial disputes and hisfunction as an exponent of the Governments incomes policy. Thelogical consequence of that policy was that the Government shouldpublicly deprecate offers of wage increases in private industry whichwould mean that justifiable increases could not be given in otherindustries and in particular in those employments where remunerationwas directly under the Governments control. In presentcircumstances the prudent course would be to avoid giving either party to the dispute ground for claiming that the Government hadintervened either to promote a settlement by encouraging theemployers to concede an increase or to prevent a settlement by encouraging them to stand fast.(b) It was possible that if a strike started it would spread to workers in other branches of the Transport and General WorkersUnion. The repercussions could be serious for the national economy and in particular for the export trade. But it would be unwise to seek at the outset to employ troops on loading ships for export. first priority should be given to unloading essential and perishablefoodstuffs. Plans should, however, be prepared which would enabletroops to be used more widely at a later stage, if necessary at theexpense of disrupting the training programme.(c) The repercussions of a settlement on the basis of an improvedoffer would also be serious. Even on the basis of the offers already made, railwaymen would be able to claim in October that they shouldhave a substantial advance on the settlement reached with themearlier in the year.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Labour to ensure that the dockemployers gave full public explanations of the improvements in pay and working hours which had been offered to the unions.(2) Authorised the Home Secretary to arrange, as might benecessary, for a Proclamation of Emergency and the laying of Emergency Regulations on the morning of 14th Mayand for debates in both Houses of Parliament on 17th May.(3) Agreed that troops should not be introduced into dock areasbefore the morning of 14th May and that preliminarysteps towards their introduction should be confined toreconnaissance discussions with port authorities on the afternoon of 12th May, the movement of advance partiesto accommodation areas from the evening of 12th Mayonwards and the movement of troops themselves to accommodation areas during 13th May.Incomes Policy(previous reference:C.C. (62) 5thConclusions,Minute 6)Nurses6. The Minister of Health said that after discussions with theMinisters concerned he now proposed that the Management Side ofthe Nurses and Midwives Whitley Council should be authorised tosuggest to the Staff Side that negotiations on improvements in thepresent pay structure should be resumed. The object would be toconsider without prejudice the best means of deploying any extramoney which the Government might eventually make available forthe improvement of nurses&apos; pay. The Management Side would makeit clear that any agreement on a revised wage structure might haveto be implemented in stages.  If the Cabinet accepted this proposal
7. The Minister of Transport said that the Government were now in dispute with the United States Administration on two separatebut related issues concerned with the control of shipping. The first of these flag discrimination was a complaint of long standing. Thesecond the attempt to control international liner conferences wasa more recent and more serious development. The Federal maritime commission was seeking to apply a large number of new restrictions to foreign ships working into or from United States ports. This was open to objection on two grounds. First, it was wrong in principlethat a single State should claim the right to alter unilaterally the rules governing international shipping. Secondly, the legislation underwhich the Commission were taking action clearly discriminated infavour of United States commerce in general and United Statesshipping in particular. The Minister said that he had advised shipping companies in this country to refuse to produce the documentsdemanded by the Commission; but the Commission had insisted that under United States legislation they had a right to demand them anda deadlock had been reached. If the documents had not been produced by early June, the Commission might refer a test case for decision in the United States courts and the British shipping companyconcerned would be liable for heavy damages.The Attorney-General reminded the Cabinet that when thismatter had last been considered at the end of February 1962,consideration was being given to the possibility of a reference to theInternational Court. On an earlier occasion when the UnitedKingdom Government had been in dispute with the United StatesGovernment on a similar question of jurisdiction in matters arisinghe would announce it during the debate in the House of commons on 14th May.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Health to arrange for theManagement Side of the Nurses and Midwives whitley council to resume negotiations with the Staff Side onimprovements in the present pay structure for nurses, onthe basis which he had indicated; and to make anannouncement to this effect in the debate in the House ofCommons on 14th May.The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet that the MorrisonCommittee, which had been appointed to review the pay of probationofficers, had unanimously recommended an increase of the orderof 30 per cent. The negotiating body had considered thisrecommendation and had concluded that an increase of about 10 percent, would be appropriate. In present circumstances he had felt bound to reject these recommendations. He proposed to announce in the House of Commons that afternoon, in terms which he had agreed with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, that the increase of the pay of probation officers must be restricted to 2\ per cent., and thatany further implementation of the recommendations of the MorrisonCommittee must be deferred until the end of the year. This decisions would be severely criticised, since the importance of the work of probation officers and the inadequacy of their present rates of paywere widely recognised; but he had concluded that no other courseof action was possible at the present stage.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Home Secretary.
under United States anti-trust legislation, the threat of reference tothe International Court had produced a settlement. It still seemed likely that this would be an effective sanction in the present case, buthe had not been fully informed of the latest developments.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that after the discussion at the end of February to which reference had been made officials hadbeen instructed to prepare a comprehensive report. This had not yetbeen received and work on it should be accelerated.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider, in consultationwith the Minister of Transport and the Attorney-General,what action could be taken to challenge this claim by theUnited States Maritime Commission to exercise jurisdiction over British shipping companies; and to report their conclusions to the Prime Minister.Federationof RhodesiaandNyasaland(previous reference:CC. (62) 29thConclusions,Minute 2)8. The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet that he wouldthat evening be leaving London on his visit to the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland. His latest information was that, whilerelations between the United Kingdom Government and the federal government were still in a strained and delicate state, the federal prime Minister was unlikely to take any step before his arrival whichwould have the effect of prejudicing the atmosphere in which had discussions would be held. He would make a full report to theCabinet on his return.The Cabinet wished the Home Secretary success in his forthcoming mission.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,10th May, 1962.
