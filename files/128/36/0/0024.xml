security in thePublicService(previous reference:C.C. (62) 22ndConclusions,Minute 3)* 1. The Prime Minister recalled that, when they had considered on 20th March the draft of a White Paper (annexed to C. (62) 51.)reproducing a substantial part of the Report of the RadcliffeCommittee on Security Procedures in the Public Service, the cabinet had agreed that it would be expedient to exclude from the white paper all reference to the chapter of the Report which consideredthe problem of Communist penetration of Civil Service staff associations. The Cabinet had taken the view that, while urgentaction should be taken with a view to reducing the number ofCommunists employed as officials of these associations, the prospects of successful action to this end might be prejudiced by prematurepublication of this part of the Committee&apos;s Report. Since then,however, a London newspaper had given prominence to a report thatthe Radcliffe Committee had made recommendations on this subject which were so embarrassing to the Government that they were to be excluded from the White Paper. In the new situation created bythis disclosure, the Ministerial Committee on Security had come tothe conclusion that the balance of advantage now lay on the side of including in the White Paper a shortened version of this chapter ofthe Radcliffe Report. The draft White Paper was being revisedaccordingly and would now be presented on 5th April.The Cabinet Took note that the draft White Paper annexed to C. (62) 51would be enlarged by the addition of a shortened version of the chapter of the Radcliffe Report dealing withCommunist penetration of Civil Service staff associations;and that the White Paper, so amended, would be presented to Parliament on 5th April.Parliament 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Budget 3.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer sought the views of theCabinet on some aspects of his Budget statement.In accordance with precedent details of this discussion are notrecorded in the Cabinets Conclusions.incomes policy(previous reference:C.C. (62) 23rdConclusions,Minute 4)WagesCouncils4. The Minister of Labour said that twelve Wages Councils had submitted or were about to submit to him proposals for wage increases, most of which would exceed by a substantial margin the2-2\ per. cent, suggested in the White Paper on Incomes Policy(Cmnd. 1626). He had no statutory power to amend proposals fromWages Councils; his power was limited to referring proposals back for reconsideration. The present awards had already been agreed between the employers and work-people concerned, and they affectedcategories of workers whose wages were far below the minimumlevels current in other industries. If the awards were referred back,they were unlikely to be modified, and the only effect would be thattheir implementation would be delayed. This delay would be of little help in maintaining the Governments&apos;policy of restricting wage increases to an average level of 1\ per cent.; and it would be criticised as an unreasonable and arbitrary imposition on the classes of workerleast able to defend themselves.    He therefore suggested that he* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
should accept the proposals, but should make it clear in so doing thathe had no power to amend them, that he regretted them and that theywere in conflict with the advice given in the White Paper on incomes policy.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that, while he accepted thatin the end the proposals of the Wages Councils would have to beaccepted, it was important that the Government should be seen tohave taken every step open to them to make clear their objection inpresent circumstances to awards exceeding the limit suggested in theWhite Paper and to emphasise the effects which a series of suchawards might have on the national economy. It was open to themto refer the proposals back, and this should be done. It might otherwise be held that the Government were weakening in their determination to maintain their policy of restraint in wage increases.In discussion the following points were made:(a) In the debate in the House of Commons on 29th january the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster had given an assurance that from 1st April, 1962, Wages Councils Orders would be made&quot; in the normal course&apos;&quot;. In the context of the debate the intentionof this statement (which had been agreed with the Ministry of Labourand with the Treasury) had been to make it clear that the policy ofdelaying Wages Council awards for periods of up to four months would be brought to an end. But it could be held that it had committed the Government to refrain from the kind of referenceback which was proposed on the present occasion; for such referencecould not be described as normal procedure. On the other hand,the statement had referred specifically to 1st April; and no breach of faith would be involved in referring back awards made before thatdate.(b) The Government were applying their present policyrigorously in sectors of the economy over which they had full controland had incurred severe criticism on that account. It was therefore the more important that they should be seen to be making every possible effort to restrain by persuasion wage increases in industriesoutside their direct control, and that they should express theirdisapproval of increases falling outside the scope of their present policy. The effect of the recent settlement for employees in the waterindustry had been mitigated by the pressure which the responsible ministers had brought to bear in an effort to keep the increase within reasonable limits.(c) The object of referring back to the Wages Councils would benot to delay the effective date of any wage increases which might eventually be awarded, but to make clear the great importance whichthe Government attached to the maintenance of their present policyin every sector of the economy and to the consequences which would flow from any widespread breach of it.(d) It might be advisable at some stage to refer to the possibilityof legislation giving the Government power to reject or amend WagesCouncil awards if the Councils continued to ignore the Governmentsdeclared policy. Wages Councils had originally been established todeal with industries in which the workers had been poorly organised and in which the use of sweated labour had been prevalent. Althoughworkers covered by Wages Councils were still among the lowest paidcategories, it could no longer be held that the Wages Councils were essential to safeguard theifconditions of employment.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that thegeneral sense of the Cabinets discussion was in favour of inviting the Chairman of the Wages Councils concerned to reconsider thepresent proposals. In writing to them to this effect the Minister ofLabour should make it clear that it was not the governments intention to deprive workers in the industries concerned of justified
Portugal(previous reference:CC. (61) 31stConclusions,Minute 4)Supply ofCanberraBombers5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (62) 54) on a proposal that six Canberra aircraft shouldbe sold to the Portuguese Air Force.The Foreign Secretary said that an application had been madeby the English Electric Company for a licence to supply six B-2Canberra aircraft to the Portuguese Air Force. In view of currentcriticisms of Portuguese Colonial policy, it had been suggested thatthe licence should be granted only if the Portuguese Governmentgave an assurance that the aircraft would not be used in Portugueseterritories overseas. No such assurance had yet been sought, buthe thought it might be possible to obtain an undertaking that theaircraft would not be used in Africa. Failing that, the portuguese government might undertake that if sent to Africa the aircraft wouldbe used only in defence against external aggression. Although these aircraft could not be said to be required for any specific purposerelated to the needs of the North Atlantic Alliance, and although they appeared to be wanted at least in part for prestige reasons, thegrant of a licence would not, in his view, conflict with the statement made by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on 27th June,1961, on the supply of military equipment to Portugal, which had referred to PortugaPs reasonable military requirements as a memberof the North Atlantic Alliance.In discussion it was pointed out that in the present circumstancesof the aircraft industry and of the export trade, an order worth 500,000 would be particularly welcome. Public opinion would,however, be uneasy about the supply of aircraft to the Portugueseand it would be desirable that the Government should be able tostate that the aircraft would not be used in Africa. An assurance that they would only be used in Africa in defence against external aggression would not be so satisfactory because of the likelihood thatany external aggression would be related to internal difficulties. Thegeneral view of the Cabinet was that if an assurance could be obtainedthat the aircraft would not be used in Africa the licence should begranted; but that, if such an assurance were not forthcoming, theCC. 24 (62)increases in pay or to delay the effective date of introduction of such increases. The Government were, however, concerned at thepossibility that increases so clearly out of line with their policy might lead to a widespread breach of this policy. If this were to happenand were to lead, as it would, to further inflation, it would bear mosthardly on precisely those classes of worker whose interests the wages councils were required to safeguard. The Government would therefore wish to be assured, before approving the proposals, thatthe Wages Councils had taken this possibility fully into account andto be informed how they reconciled their proposals with theGovernments incomes policy. Copies of this letter should be sentto the Chairmen of all other Wages councils the Cabinet Invited the Minister of Labour to write to the Chairmanof the Wages Councils whose proposals were now before him warning them of the effects on the workers on whosebehalf they were acting if the proposals led to a generalbreach of the Governments present policy of wage restraint and asking them whether they had taken this possibilityfully into account, but making it clear that the Governmenthad no intention of arbitrarily delaying the effective dateof introduction of any wage increases which, afterreconsideration, they might finally propose.
matter should be further considered by the Cabinet. In thediscussions with the Portuguese Government it should be kept inmind that the loss of the staging rights enjoyed by the Royal AirForce in the Azores and Cape Verde Islands would be a serioushandicap.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to ascertain what assurancewould be given by the Portuguese Government about theuse of the six Canberra aircraft for which an export licence had been sought.(2) Agreed that the licence should be granted if an assurancewere given that the aircraft would not be used in Africa.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,29th March, 1962.
