Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference :C.C. (62) 13thConclusions,Minute 4)The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (C. (62) 41) on the Northern Rhodesia Constitution.The Prime Minister said that at their last discussion the cabinet had considered possible modifications of the proposals announced inJune 1961. These had led to widespread disorder in the territory andthe Government had in September announced their readiness toconsider reasonable representations for modifications within the area where divergences of view persisted. This in practice confined thescope for modification to the numerical alternative under whichcandidates were required to get 124- per cent, of both racial votes or400 votes whichever might be the less, and the Asian seat. Thecreation of the A.sian seat would involve the removal of over 2,000Asian voters to a separate roll, and it had been proposed as a corollarythat 500 extra African voters should be added to the upper roll. Attheir discussion on 1st February the Cabinet had agreed in principle to the abolition of the numerical alternative on which African criticismhad mainly centred. The Commonwealth Secretary had been authorised to put two alternative proposals to the Federal PrimeMinister, Sir Roy Welensky: either to set the percentage hurdle at per cent, of the votes cast or at a higher figure of \2\ per cent.Under the first proposal the Asian seat would have been retained.Under the second it had been the Cabinefs hope that Sir roy welensky would himself have seen advantage in dispensing with the asian seat. The Commonwealth Secretary had persuaded Sir roy welensky to agree to the abolition of the numerical alternative. Asbetween a low and a high percentage he had declared himself in favourof a high percentage, either \2\ per cent, or 10 per cent, of the votescast. He remained, however, opposed to the abolition of the Asianseat; for he believed that the restoration of Asian voters to theupper roll might have a decisive effect in marginal elections. He had also reminded the Commonwealth Secretary that the creation of the asian seat and the addition of 500 Africans to the upper roll must continue to be regarded as a single issue, and could not be considered separately.The Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s discussions in Salisbury had, asintended, broadened out to cover the future of the Federation as awhole. It had become clear that Sir Roy Welensky now realised thatany new Constitution for Northern Rhodesia would be likely toproduce an anti-Federal majority. There was already a large anti-Federal majority in Nyasaland, and Dr. Banda would shortly becoming to London to present his demand for immediate secession.If this were granted, and if by the date of Nyasaland&apos;s secession an anti-Federal majority were in power in Northern Rhodesia, that territory would be likely to follow suit and the Federation wouldcollapse. Sir Roy Welensky had therefore put forward proposals fora complete change of front which would involve deferring theintroduction of a new Constitution in Northern Rhodesia. He hadtentatively outlined a plan by which Northern Rhodesia would be divided into Barotseland, the Copper Belt and the remaining farmcountry. The Copper Belt would be closely linked with SouthernRhodesia and these two territories combined would form a coreround which a looser federation of the remaining territories could be grouped. This was, in effect, a revival of earlier proposals for a central African Alliance.The Prime Minister said that it might be helpful for the Cabinetto consider these broader issues before turning to the details of theNorthern Rhodesia Constitution. The first question to be decidedwas whether or not it would at this stage be politically practicable to postpone the announcement of a Northern Rhodesia Constitution andthe establishment of self-government in that territory.SECRET60620-7 a 2
The Commonwealth Secretary said that there were three relatedissues to consider the future of the Federation, the secession of nyasaland, and the Northern Rhodesia Constitution. On the last point he was clear that, although he would protest in public, Sir roy welensky would accept the abolition of the numerical alternative anda percentage of 10 per cent, of votes cast. He would, however,oppose the abolition of the Asian seat; and he would urge that thenumber of racially reserved seats should be increased from four to six.On the second issue, Sir Roy Welensky had accepted the difficultyof holding Nyasaland down by force if her demand for secession were refused. He was, however, anxious to ensure that the secession of nyasaland would not lead automatically to the secession of northern rhodesia. He doubted whether a government elected in northern rhodesia under any of the constitutional proposals now underdiscussion would be willing to remain in the Federation, and this had led him to revive the more radical proposals for the future of theFederation. The Commonwealth Secretary had explained that theUnited Kingdom Government would be unable to accept anyregrouping of the Central African territories which did not rest onthe consent of the peoples concerned; and that it would not be practicable to consider an arrangement which deprived SouthernRhodesia and the Copper Belt of the right of secession.The issue of secession would be raised in an acute form whenDr. Banda came to London in April. It was known that he wouldthen demand the right of secession. If this were conceded inprinciple, it would be possible to gain time while the necessary details were being worked out, and this process might take a year. If, onthe other hand, the Federal Government were opposed even to anagreement to give Nyasaland the right to secede the position wouldbe most serious. It was, therefore, essential to carry tiie federal prime Minister with us in settling Nyasaland&apos;s future. It was nolonger practicable to delay the Northern Rhodesia Constitution until agreement had been reached on the future of the Federation. our aim should therefore be to produce proposals for Northern Rhodesiawhich Sir Roy Welensky, however reluctantly, would be prepared toaccept.The Colonial Secretary agreed that a decision on the northern rhodesia Constitution must be reached without delay. It was out ofthe question to revive at this stage earlier plans for a Central Africanalliance: there was no prospect of securing agreement on them.Indeed, until self-government in Northern Rhodesia had beenestablished, it would not be possible to give practical considerationto the future of the Federation itself. Dangerous as an open clash with the Federal Government might be, the United KingdomGovernment must avoid being put in a position in which their anxiety to secure the Federal Governments co-operation over Nyasaland ledto concessions on the Northern Rhodesia Constitution which couldnot be defended.The Foreign Secretary said that there were two sources of danger in the present situation. Much attention had been given to thepossibility that the African population might take violent action. Butit was equally possible that the Europeans might, if driven too far,take the law into their own hands. It was by no means impossibleto conceive of a European-dominated association of SouthernRhodesia, the Copper Belt, Angola, Katanga and South Africa.Such a development would be fatal to British hopes of multi-racialco-operation in Africa. He agreed that it would be necessary to announce a Northern Rhodesia Constitution without delay. It wasalso necessary that the Federal Government should recogniseNyasaland&apos;s right to secede. But to allow secession to take placein circumstances which might lead to the breakdown of governmentwould be an evasion of the Governments responsibilities and might
lead to the kind of European reaction which he had described.Secession should be based, as envisaged in the Report of the central african Advisory Commission under the Chairmanship of LordMonckton, on the orderly transfer of power. He considered, therefore,that although the right to secede could be granted in the near future itshould be followed by a period of at least two years during whichtransfer of power would take place on an orderly and organised basis.At the end of that period, and as the result of some further executivedecision, secession could take place. It was indeed possible thatduring the transfer of power the Nyasaland Government&apos;would cometo realise the advantages of continued association with the federation and that the demand for secession might in the event be withdrawn.In discussion of these broader issues the following points weremade:(a) It would not be practicable to proceed with an examinationof the new grouping of Central African territories which the federal prime Minister had proposed. The plan was objectionable in itseif,since it would be represented as an attempt to retain the sources of wealth in European hands. Moreover, it would involve abandoning the present plans for self-government in Northern Rhodesia.What was needed now was the establishment of responsibleself-government; further development would have to take place onthe basis of consent and not by imposed solutions.(b) It would be legally possible for the United KingdomGovernment to legislate for the secession of Nyasaland against thewishes of the Federal Government, but this would be politicallyinexpedient. It would make an irreparable breach in our relationswith the Federal Government and would be strongly criticised by government supporters in this country.(c) There was general agreement that the over-riding object in negotiations with Dr. Banda would be to gain time in which thepractical disadvantages of secession could make themselves felt.There was therefore only a difference of degree between the viewthat the right to secede should be granted only after an orderlytransfer of power had taken place and the view that the right to secedeshould be granted in principle before the arrangements for thetransfer of power had been worked out.(d) There could be no question of delaying any further a definiteannouncement about the Northern Rhodesia Constitution.The Cabinets discussion then turned to the details of theNorthern Rhodesia Constitution.The Prime Minister said that he foresaw no particular difficulty about the percentage qualification. The important fact was that sir Roy Welensky had accepted the abolition of the numericalalternative: the difference between \2\ per cent, and 10 per cent, ofthe votes cast was not one of real substance. The proposal for anincrease in the number of racially reserved seats was also of minor importance. The critical question was the Asian seat. This hadbeen introduced as the result of negotiation with Sir Roy Welenskyand he had accepted the addition of 500 Africans to the upper roll inreturn. The two points were linked and it would not. be possible to conceal this. Equally it would be difficult at this stage to propose the removal of the 500 Africans without giving rise to furthercriticism. It could indeed be argued that the abolition of the Asianseat against the wishes of the Federal Government would at this stageconstitute a breach of faith.The Colonial Secretary said that in his view the overriding consideration at this stage was to introduce a Constitution which
would have the support of the people. If the Africans refused towork the Constitution civil disobedience and rioting would result andthe situation would get out of hand. The Africans must be given some chance of winning at least a small majority: they could not beexpected to participate in a Constitution which gave them no chanceat all. Even though the numerical alternative was now to be abolished the scales were still weighted heavily against them becauseof the limited franchise and the weighting of votes on the upper roll.His advice from all local sources was that the abolition of the Asianseat was needed to induce the main African party to co-operate. TheAsians themselves disliked it and the only justification for keeping itwas Sir Roy Welensky&apos;s belief, which might well be mistaken, that most of the Asian voters would vote against Federal candidates.Even if the Asian seat were abolished there was the likelihood offurther serious civil disorder. It would be possible to take and todefend the action which would then be necessary if the Governmentbelieved that their proposals had been fair and reasonable. He would find it difficult to defend action to suppress civil disorders if theconstitutional proposals could not be so described.In discussion the following points were made:(e) Although Sir Roy Welensky attached great importance tothe Asian seat, it was difficult to believe that its retention would havea decisive effect on African opinion. The idea of special racialrepresentation was one which had respectable precedents and wasdefensible in itself even though the Asians themselves were not infavour of it. The numerical alternative had rightly been represented as discrimination in favour of European candidates and its abolitionwas clearly an important concession to African opinion. The Asianseat came into quite a different category, and it was hard to believethat the African Parties would base a refusal to participate in theconstitution on so limited an issue.(/) The abolition of the Asian seat would be bound to produce a violent reaction from Sir Roy Welensky and might well lead him to withhold his co-operation over the Constitution as a whole. This in turn might affect his attitude towards Nyasaland&apos;s claim to a right of secession.(g) To abolish the Asian seat without at the same time removing the 500 extra African voters from the upper roll would be a clearbreach of faith. At the same time it was difficult to see how the500 African voters could be removed without giving rise to furthercriticism from the African side.(/?) It might be possible to retain the Asian seat for oneParliament only and to announce that it would then be abolished.This, however, might suggest that the Asian seat was a political devicewhich did not correspond to any genuine constitutional need andmight increase African criticism of the decision to retain it at all.(/) The number of racially reserved seats should remain at four.It was unlikely that Sir Roy Welensky would wish to press his proposals to raise them to six.At the conclusion of the discussion the Prime Minister suggestedthat at their meeting on the following day the Cabinet should concentrate their further consideration on the question whether the asian seat should be retained or not. Much would turn on the way in which the decision was announced and the reasons which could be advanced in support of it. The Cabinet should consider the termsof such an announcement before taking a final view.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that a Constitution for Northern Rhodesia should besettled and announced as soon as possible.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,27th February, 1962.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to circulate for then:consideration his proposals on the terms in which adecision to abolish the Asian seat and to remove 500African voters from the upper roll could best be announced.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at their meeting on thefollowing day.
