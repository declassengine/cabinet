National 2.   The Cabinet had before them a further memorandum by theAssistance       Minister of Pensions and National Insurance (C. (62) 77) on the level(Previous        of National Assistance scale rates.Reference:CC. (62) 38th The Minister of Pensions said that, in the light of the CabinefsConclusions, discussion on 29th May, he had held further consultations with the minute 5) Chairman of the National Assistance Board, who had put forwardstrong arguments for increasing the rate for single householders by4s., though he would be prepared to recommend that single personswho were not householders should receive an increase of only 2s. Hewas content that the increase for the married householder should be5s. 6d. But he had urged that all these increases should take effect from 24th September. The Minister sought the Cabinet&apos;s authorityto inform the Chairman that these proposals would be acceptable tothe Government.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that these revised proposals would cost over  11 million in the current year and  20-5 million ina full year. In view the representations made by the Chairman hewas prepared to accept them. If however an increase of 4s. were now given to single householders, he thought it important that theamount of any further increase to be given to this group in 1964 shouldbe left open for consideration in the light of circumstances at the time.The CabineCs discussion turned mainly on the question whetherthe announcement of a decision to increase the scale rates of national assistance would lead to pressure for increases in public service pensions. It was generally agreed that, if steps were to be takenlater in the year to increase public service pensions, there would bedisadvantage in delaying a decision on this question until the stageat which it would appear to have been taken in response to publicpressure. The timing of the announcement on National assistance should therefore be considered in relation to a plan for dealing with public service pensions.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Pensions and National insurance to inform the Chairman of the National Assistance board that the Government were prepared to agree that national assistance scale rates should be increased, from24th September, by 2s. for the single non-householder,4s. for the single householder and 5s. 6d. for the marriedhouseholder.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theMinister of Defence and the Minister of Pensions, toconsider the timing of the announcement of this decision in relation to the announcement of any proposals for increases in public service pensions, and to submit atime-table for the Prime Ministers approval.Commercial 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePolicy President of the Board of Trade (C. (62) 92) proposing amendmentsJapan to the list of products whose import from Japan would continue to(Previous be restricted after the conclusion of a commercial treaty.Reference:CC. (61) 59th The President of the Board of Trade reminded the Cabinet that conclusions, when they had considered this matter in December, 1960, they had minute 5) asked to be kept informed of developments and to be consulted beforeCC. 40 (62)Parliament \   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the week after the Whitsun recess.
any further commitments were accepted. There would be great advantage in concluding a commercial treaty which would giveUnited Kingdom exporters a reasonable chance to secure a fair shareof the expanding Japanese market. Exports from the United kingdom to Japan had increased substantially over the last year and there wasscope for further increase, although there would be competition fromWest Germany and the United States. If this expansion of our exporttrade was to be secured, it would be necessary to adopt a more liberalpolicy towards Japanese imports into this country. The proposals setout in his paper had been framed with this consideration in mind.The only difficulties now outstanding related to woollen goods andtransistor radios. He had himself held discussions with representativesof the woollen industry, who would have preferred a total restriction on imports from Japan, rather than a restriction confined to woollencloth. He had agreed to try to widen the definition of cloth to include a greater range of materials, and on this basis he believed that his proposals would be accepted by the industry. Cotton textiles would continue to be restricted.The Minister of Aviation said that he had discussed withrepresentatives of the industry the proposals to remove restrictionson certain classes of transistor radios. For reasons which he acceptedthey maintained that the proposals would seriously damage the growth of domestic production. In distinction to other products, for which some safeguards would be retained, the proposals on transistors wouldsubject United Kingdom manufacturers to the full weight of japanese competition, which was extremely powerful. The industry wouldnot be satisfied by an assurance that quotas could be quickly imposedif it was found in practice that the level of imports was having adisruptive effect on home manufacture; for it was common knowledge that the existing quotas for Japanese imports were heavilyover-subscribed and their removal would lead to an immediate andmassive increase in imports.In discussion the following points were made:(a) On broad economic grounds it would be important to conclude a commercial treaty with Japan which offered a fair chance to United Kingdom exporters to increase their share of this large and growing market. The Japanese Government had also beenhelpful to us in recent negotiations about unfair shipping practices.As against this it had to be admitted that, although the woollenindustry was not at present as sensitive to competition as the cottonindustry, its interests would need to be carefully watched.(b) Certain special interests affecting Hong Kong would need tobe taken into account before the commercial treaty with Japan was finally concluded. There were also special factors affecting certain industries in Scotland.The Cabinet (1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to discuss his proposals further with the Secretary of State for Scotland,the Colonial Secretary and the Minister of Aviation.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to report the outcome of those discussions to the Prime Minister.4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Foreign Secretary(C. (62) 73) covering an analysis of the advantages and disadvantagesto the United Kingdom of continued participation in United Nationsdebates, particularly in the Committee of Seventeen, on colonial affairs.The Colonial Secretary said that the Government had originallyagreed to co-operate in the work of the Committee of Seventeen on
a 3the understanding that it would not intervene in the affairs of territories for which the United Kingdom retained responsibility.The Committee were now in fact intervening in the affairs of such territories, and had thereby destroyed the basis of our co-operation.To continue to participate in their debates in such circumstances wasnot only undignified, but prejudicial to our Colonial interests. it made it more difficult to ignore any resolutions which might emerge,and it encouraged local extremists.The Home Secretary said that he was keenly conscious of thedifficulty to which the Colonial Secretary had referred. During his recent visit to Southern Rhodesia the main African Party had refusedto meet him, because they thought they had more to gain by contacts with the United Nations. The same influences would shortly be atwork in Northern Rhodesia, whose problems the Committee of seventeen intended to discuss and from which they would hearpetitions. In spite of this, he felt that the balance of advantage would lie in continued participation in the work of the Committee. our withdrawal would not lead to any lessening of United Nationspressure on us or to any reduction of their influence in the territories.On the contrary in our absence even more extreme resolutions wouldbe likely to be passed and countries favourable to us would be lessable to help us. Great patience would be needed and a real effort should be made to present the case in support of our policies more clearly and more cogently than had been done up to the present.The Foreign Secretary said that he fully recognised the disadvantages of the present position and the danger that our participation would be misinterpreted in the Colonial territories concerned. He feared, however, that the alternative of totalwithdrawal would be likely to be even more damaging. It wouldnot prevent the Committee from hearing petitions and passingresolutions which would have a considerable impact on publicopinion; and the countries which had been helpful to us in the pastwould find it more difficult to secure moderation if we were not present to put our own case and answer our critics. It was evenpossible that in those circumstances resolutions hostile to our interests would be passed with the support of the United States and some commonwealth countries. It was a relevant consideration that france had not improved her international reputation by withdrawing from participation in the United Nations debates.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It was arguable that the proceedings of the Committee of seventeen constituted intervention within the meaning of the charter and were therefore ultra vires. If this view could be sustained there might be advantage in referring the question to the international court. A decision favourable to us would greatly strengthen ourhand in confining the activities of the Committee. On the other handan unfavourable decision would be very damaging. The Law officers should be asked to advise whether it was likely that the international court would find in our favour if this question were referred to them.(b) It was suggested that there might be advantage in taking amore robust line in the Committee&apos;s debate, to the extent ofcross-examining petitioners and witnesses before the Committee and arranging for the submission of petitions in support of our ownpolicies. It had to be recognised, however, that such a course wouldinvolve a closer degree of participation in the work of the Committeethan had been thought expedient hitherto.(c) The Cabinet were informed that the Commonwealth Secretarysaw grave objection to the proposal that we should withdraw fromthe work of the Committee. We should thereby forfeit the support,not only of those Afro/Asian members of the Commonwealth whichhad been helpful to us in the Committee, but also of the older members
27 BSouth-east asia treaty organisation laos(previous reference:C.C. (62) 39thConclusions,Minute 5)5. The Foreign Secretary said that a further meeting of theLaotian Princes had now been held, and the King of Laos had given a satisfactory directive to Prince Souvanna Phouma about theformation of a national government. It was to be hoped that agreement on the distribution of portfolios in such a governmentwould be reached before Phouma had to leave Laos for Paris.Broadcasting 6.   The Home Secretary said that the report of the CommitteePolicy on Broadcasting had now been submitted to the Postmaster-General(Previous        and would be published on 27th June.   The report was critical of the reference:      quality of independent television and of the structure establishedC.C. (61) 9th    under the Television Act. 1954.   This part of the report would be conclusions,    highly controversial and a source of political embarrassment to the minute 5)       Government.   Its recommendations would have to be carefully examined and it would be prudent to refrain from giving any indication of the Governments attitude to them until public opinionhad crystallised.   Apart, however, from this controversial question there were various technical points in the report on which an early statement of the Governments view would be valuable to the radioindustry, and the Cabinet. Committee which had considered advancecopies of the report had invited the Postmaster-General to prepare the draft of a White Paper to deal with these points.   It might be practicable to issue a White Paper of this kind early in July, in timefor the debate on the report which must be expected before Parliamentrose for the summer recess.In discussion there was general agreement with the course ofaction proposed by the Home Secretary. The following points were raised:(a) The recommendations on the structure of independent television would attract much support from certain sections of thePress, and there might be some disadvantage in having a long gapof the Commonwealth. Our withdrawal would disappoint Canada.It would also mean that we should be unable to support Australia,if criticism were directed against the administration of theirdependencies.(d) The difficulty of continuing to maintain that the Committee&apos;section and debates were ultra vires while still continuing to take partin them might prove to be greater in theory than in practice. Itshould be possible to continue to emphasise our disapproval of theCommittee&apos;s behaviour while still taking steps to state our own viewson the subjects under discussion and seeking to influence the drafting of their resolutions.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to seek the opinion of the LawOfficers on the question whether the International court would be likely to rule that the activities of the Committeeof Seventeen were in contravention of Article 2 (7) of the charter of the United Nations.(2) Agreed that for the time being the United Kingdom shouldcontinue to participate in United Nations debates on colonial affairs, including those in the Committee of seventeen, and that every effort should be made to presentthe policies of the United Kingdom in a constructive light.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion of this question when theadvice of the Law Officers was available.
TheFishingFleet(previous reference :CC. (52) 73rdConclusions,Minute 10)Grants and loans forconstructionandmodernisa-tion ofvessels7. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretaryof State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food about trawler subsidies (C. (62) 78) and grants and loans torfishing boats and engines built abroad (C. (62) 94).The Cabinet were informed that under present arrangements the fishing industry received Exchequer assistance in two main forms operational subsidies, and grants and loans for construction and modernisation of vessels. I he powers under which the assistance was paid would expire at the end of the current year or early in thefollowing year. The main purpose of the Sea Fish Industry Bill,which was now under discussion in the House of Lords, was to providefor a new system substantially on lines recommended by the FleckCommittee in 1961. Both forms of assistance would be maintained at about the present level, but the Governments detailed proposals had given rise to political difficulties.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that grants and loanswere not at present available for boats and engines built in foreignyards, but earlier in the year it had been decided that this restrictionshould be removed. An announcement of the decision on 18th May-had evoked protests on behalf of British boatbuilders. Particulardisquiet had been felt about the possibility that foreign yards whichenjoyed Government subsidies would benefit by British orders, andthat British yards would not have the equal chance to compete whichhad been promised in the announcement. In a discussion of these points that morning the Economic Policy Committee had concluded that the decision to remove the restriction should be upheld and thatadministrative means could be found of ensuring that British yardswould have an equal chance to compete. Subject, therefore, to theapproval of the Cabinet, he proposed, in an adjournment debate onCC. 40 (62)between the publication of the report and the announcement of theGovernments attitude to those recommendations. It would not,however, be practicable to delay the publication of the report; and,if the White Paper to be published in July included a warning referenceto the need to consider other points of view, this would help to contain the pressure for a full statement. The Committee on broadcasting and Television should arrange for the draft White Paper to bebrought before the Cabinet and should consider whether any separatestatement on the structural recommendations would be advisable.(b) The Committee on Broadcasting and Television had thoughtthat, in view of the length of the report, a popular version should beprepared by the Central Office of Information and put on sale throughthe Stationery Office; and they had invited the Postmaster-general to arrange for this to be done.(c) It would be useful if members of the Cabinet could have anearly opportunity of reading the report.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the report of the Committee on Broadcastingshould be published on 27th June.(2) Invited the Postmaster-General to circulate copies of thereport to the Cabinet.(3) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the Committeeon Broadcasting and Television to consider and submit to them in due course the draft of a White Paper dealingwith the technical matters arising from the report; andto consider whether a separate statement should be made about the recommendations in the report for changes inthe structure of independent television.
the following day, to defend the removal of the restriction and to say-that steps would be taken to ensure that the system of grants and loanswould not be used to give any advantage to subsidised foreign yards.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It would not be advisable for the White Fish Authority, whichwas responsible for payment of the grants and loans, to list forfishermen either the countries known to subsidise the building ofboats or those believed not to do so. The Authority should be instructed that, before accepting a foreign tender for grant or loan, thattender and others from British yards should be put before a committeeto be established by the Minister of Transport to supervise the examination of tenders.(b) It was well known that yards in France, Spain and Italy weresubsidised, and the Committee would have no difficulty in preventing the payment of grants and loans for boats built in those countries.In some other countries, however, subsidies were paid by less openmeans and would be less easy to identify. But the Committee couldinsist on four or five tenders being obtained from British yards in eachcase; and where any material element of subsidy was detected in aforeign tender they could say that no grant or loan would be made if that tender were accepted.(c) A suggestion had been made that, where it was proposed toaccept a tender from a foreign yard higher than the lowest Britishtender, the amount of grant or loan might be limited to the amount which would have been paid on the lowest British tender. This formof escalation was open to some objection and would require furtherconsideration.(d) In the House of Lords that afternoon the Lord president would have to intimate that the Government would seek to annul theeffect of the amendment recently carried against the Government withthe purpose of maintaining a statutory restriction on the payment of grants or loans for boats built in foreign yards.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that grants and loans for the construction and modernisation of fishing vessels should be available forvessels built in foreign yards but that administrative steps should be taken to ensure that the system did not giveadvantage to foreign yards which were subsidised.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to consult theChief Secretary, Treasury, the Minister of Agriculture andthe Minister of Transport about the form of words whichhe should use in Parliament on the following day aboutgrants and loans for vessels built in subsidised foreignyards.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the idea underlying the Fleck recommendations for operational subsidies was that, as the fishing industry could be expected to stand on its own feet after someyears, Exchequer assistance should be tapered off. In the case ofthe inshore and herring fleet, the Government had not said for how long the assistance would last and subsidies were to continue on present lines, which were broadly acceptable to the industry. In thecase of the trawler fleet, however, the proposal was that assistance should be reduced year by year by fixed proportions and should cometo an end in 10 years. The key question was the starting rates forsubsidy for the three different types of trawler. These rates had been negotiated in the previous year with the two representative bodies the British Trawler Federation (B.T.F.) and the Aberdeen OwnersAssociation and they were still accepted by the B.T.F. in spite of the bad times which had been experienced by all sections of the fleet inthe past few months. But the rates were now being contested by theScottish trawler interests, who argued that the starting rates for near
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,7th June, 1962.and middle water trawlers should be doubled. The Secretary of state said that he appreciated the importance of adhering to the agreement which had originally been accepted by all sections of the industry but he felt much sympathy with the owners of near and middle watertrawlers, who had been the chief sufferers from the prevalentover-fishing and from the agreements which had had to be made withIceland and the Faroes. Conditions for these sections of the fishingfleet were likely to get worse, and it would be prudent to take theacknowledged risk of reopening the agreement with the B.T.F. he proposed an increase in starting rates for near and middle watertrawlers, at a cost of some  1-4 million per annum at the outset.The Minister of Agriculture said that if the agreement werereopened it was likely that the B.T.F. would split into three sectionsand that the Government would then have to face serious and continuing political difficulties. To temper the wind for certain sections of the industry, as proposed by the Secretary of State forScotland, would amount to a reversal of policy; the Governmentsobject should be to base assistance on cost and catching capacityrather than on need, so that the more efficient sections of the fleetwould be encouraged to expand. It would, however, be right togrant a moratorium to the White Fish Authority (who financed loans for trawlers out of advances from the Exchequer) so that they couldallow defaulters more time. It would also be right to remove therestrictions which at present prevented fishing off Iceland by middlewater trawlers. Of the  350.000 available in the first year assupplementary subsides for particular groups of trawlers in special difficulties,  250,000 had already been allocated to middle watertrawlers and it was likely that the remaining  100,000 which wasbeing held in reserve would in due course be allocated in the same way.In discussion there was general agreement that, while the near and middle water sections of the industry, especially in Scotland,were in serious difficulties, it would be a mistake to go back on theagreement which had been reached with the representative bodies inthe industry. It was hoped that, with the help of the moratoriumand the other subsidiary measures which had been mentioned, theScottish trawler owners could be brought to accept that the startingrates for subsidy could not be improved.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that discussion of the starting rates for trawlersubsidies should not be reopened.
