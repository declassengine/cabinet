1. The Cabinet discussed the arrangements for handling theremaining stages of the Debate on the Address in the House ofCommons. Mr. Churchill was to intervene in the debate later that day and it was understood that he might speak on the subject of western Union. The Foreign Secretary would not be in a positionto make, in reply, any declaration of Government policy on that subject, as he had not yet had an opportunity to discuss with his cabinet colleagues the results of the recent meeting of representa-tives of the Brussels Treaty Powers; and it would therefore be preferable that he should not himself intervene in that day&apos;s debate.It was, however, agreed that the Lord President, in replying to the debate on the Governments behalf, should make some generalreferences to anything which Mr. Churchill might say on thesubject of Western Union with a view to discounting the effect which those references might otherwise have on public opinion in thiscountry and abroad.It was agreed that it would be convenient if Mr. Speaker wouldrefrain from calling the official Opposition amendment until the lasttwo days of the debate, on 2nd and 3rd November. The general discussion could then continue for two further days, on 29th october and 1st November. If there were a general desire to discuss defence questions, these could be taken on 29th October. And the Chancellorof the Exchequer could give a review of the economic position on1st November. The Chief Whip undertook to put these considera-tions to Mr. Speaker.The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business tobe taken in the House of Commons (luring the following week.2. The Home Secretary said that he wished to discuss withhis colleagues the composition of the Tribunal to be appointed underthe Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, to inquire into certain allegations against Ministers and officials of the Board ofTrade and possibly other Departments. The Lord Chief Justice had said that, while he would be willing to preside over this Tribunal,if the Government thought it his duty to do so, he believed that this might unduly magnify the importance of the allegations and thoughtit would be more appropriate that one of the judges of the HighCourt should preside. The Lord Chief Justice and other legalauthorities who had been consulted all agreed that the best choicewould be Mr. Justice Lynskey. The Home Secretary said that,subject to the views of his colleagues, he proposed that Mr. JusticeLynskey should preside over the Tribunal and that the other members should be Mr. Russell Vick, K.C., and Mr. Gerald Upjohn, K.C.The Cabinet-Approved the Home Secretary&apos;s proposals regarding theconstitution of the Tribunal.The Cabinet also discussed whether the Attorney-General should himself conduct the proceedings before the Tribunal, including the cross-examination of witnesses. They were informed that the attorney-General had been inclined to think that it was his duty to conduct the case and that, if he refrained from doing so, it mightbe thought that he refrained because the Government and theadministration were deeply involved in the matters which were tobe the subject of the inquiry. On the other hand, it was pointed outthat the Attorney-General would be placed in an embarrassing position if he had to cross-examine Ministerial colleagues. If hehandled such crossrexamination lightly, it might be said that he did so because the witness was a colleague : and if he pressed the cross-examination, his future relations with his colleague might be prejudiced. Further, he might be required to lead the prosecutionin criminal proceedings connected with the subject-matter of this-1

(48) 59thConclusions,Minute 4.)India.Eire.inquiry; and difficulty might arise over this if he had himself taken a leading part in conducting the case before the Tribunal. In thesecircumstances it was the general view of the Cabinet that the attorney-General should open the case before the Tribunal andshould then indicate that, while he was ready to give them any further assistance they might require, he thought it might be more convenientthat the cross-examination of the witnesses should be conducted by another leading counsel. It was likely that the Tribunal wouldconcur in that view; but, if they should ask the Attorney-general to conduct the whole case before them, they would at least share theresponsibility for any embarrassing consequences which might ensue.The Lord Chancellor and the Solicitor-General undertook to convey to the Attorney-General the views which had been expressed in the Cabinets discussion.3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (CP. (48) 244) on the nature of the constitutional relation between the various countries of the Commonwealth and the probablecourse Of future constitutional changes in India and Eire.The Cabinets discussion regarding India, and the conclusions reached, are recorded in the Secretary s Standard File of cabinet conclusions.Regarding Eire, it was pointed out that the Eire Government had publicly stated that their country had already ceased to be a memberof the Commonwealth and the object of their proposal to repeal the external Relations Act was largely to put this issue beyond dispute.During the recent discussions the representatives of Canada,Australia and New Zealand had, however, impressed on UnitedKingdom Ministers the need for handling the negotiations with the eire Government in a spirit which would not create such bitternessbetween the two countries as might diminish the chances of Eire&apos;sultimate return to the Commonwealth. During the discussions whichhad taken place at Chequers on 17th October, the practical conse-quences of the repeal of the External Relations Act had been franklyexplained to Eire Ministers; but it was clear that they were nowtoo far committed to be able to abandon their declared intention to repeal the Act. It must, therefore, be expected that legislation forits repeal would be introduced in the Dail at an early date. once the Act had been repealed, it would no longer be practicable for other commonwealth countries to continue to maintan that Eire was amember of the Commonwealth.The suggestion was made that, in view of the serious and far-reaching consequences of Eire&apos;s secession from the Commonwealth,a further effort ought to be made to persuade the Eire government at least to postpone the introduction of legislation to repeal the external Relations Act. In the discussions with the Eire Ministersemphasis had been laid on the practical consequences of repeal inthe field of personal status and trade preferences. Every effort would no doubt be made to mitigate these consequences to themaximum extent compatible with the United Kingdom&apos;s inter-national obligations.  But behind the immediate issue lav the Eire
Governments determination to end partition, and there was little doubt that they recognised that they would be in a better position toput pressure on the United Kingdom Government once Eire had become a foreign country. For it could be assumed that no furtherobstacles would be placed in the way of Eire&apos;s admission to theUnited Nations; and it would then be open to her to raise thequestion of partition in the General Assembly with the assurance of substantial support. The United Kingdom Government had hitherto maintained the attitude that partition was an issue for settlement by the Irish themselves. But Eire&apos;s secession from theCommonwealth would raise acutely the issue whether, for defencereasons, it was possible any longer to maintain that attitude; andit would certainly be embarrassing for the United Kingdom Govern-ment to be put in the position of having to support the continuanceof partition. The Government and people of Northern ireland would undoubtedly regard Eire&apos;s secession from the commonwealth as a serious threat to them; and, whatever mitigation of thepractical consequences of secession might be acceptable to the UnitedKingdom Government, it was likely that the Government ofNorthern Ireland would feel bound to adopt rigorous measures inprotection of their interests. This was a further reason for pressing the Eire Government to postpone action for a few months. By then it might have been possible to devise a constitutional status for india which might be also acceptable to Eire as the basis for her continued membership of the Commonwealth.The general view of Ministers was, however, that further efforts to persuade the Eire Government to postpone the introduction oflegislation to repeal the External Relations Act were likely to be ineffective. The arguments for delay had been put before theirrepresentatives in the conversations at Chequers, but they clearlyfelt themselves committed to immediate action. Moreover, it was not clear that delay would produce the advantages desired. The eire government, were determined that Eire should cease to be a memberof the Commonwealth, and no constitutional status which involvedcontinued membership of the Commonwealth would be acceptable tothem. It was, however, agreed that the practical consequences ofthe repeal of the. External Relations Act might be brought moreformally to the notice of the Eire Government. No written communi-cation on this point had yet been sent to them, and they were stillinclined to think that the practical difficulties were all susceptibleof easy solution if there was goodwill on both sides. While it was important to avoid the impression of attempting to coerce them,would it not be fairer to ensure that thev were fully aware of thepractical consequences of their policy? It had been agreed, at theend of the discussion at Chequers, that both sides should explorepossible solutions of these difficulties, and an aide-memoire had subsequently been received from the Eire Government. It would,therefore, be quite appropriate to send a formal statement of theposition in reply to that communication. But, before any such statement was sent, Ministers should themselves be clear how farthey were prepared to go towards mitigating the practical conse-quences of Eire&apos;s secession from the Commonwealth. It would be most inadvisable to give the Eire Government the impression thatthey were being threatened with measures which the UnitedKingdom Government were not in fact intending to enforce. Andthe Government would no doubt be pressed in Parliament to make their attitude clear once the External Relations Act had beenrepealed.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to submit a memorandum setting out (i) the terms of a written communication which mightbe sent to the Eire Government on the practical

The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations saidthat in several Commonwealth countries there had been publiccomment on the fact that, in the final communique issued to the press at the conclusion of the recent meeting of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters, the word &quot;British&quot; had not been used in the variousreferences to Commonwealth countries, Commonwealth governments and members of the Commonwealth. Although this had not in fact been a deliberate omission, it was true that, in informal conversa-tions with several Commonwealth Prime Ministers, the suggestion had been put forward that it might be useful to establish, withoutany formal change, the convention of describing the commonwealth as &quot; the Commonwealth of Nations &quot; instead of &quot; the BritishCommonwealth of Nations.&quot; The object of this informal change would be to foster the impression that the Commonewalth was wide enough to include nations which, by reason of their race and history,could not feel that they were &apos;&apos; British &apos;&apos; nations. The PrimeMinister of New Zealand, who had been asked to reply publicly to comment in the New Zealand Press, had proposed to indicate thatthis was the purpose of the change; and, after consulting the PrimeMinister, the Secretary of State had told him that we should haveno objection to his giving this explanation. There were somegrounds for believing that in the Parliament at Westminster theofficial Opposition would not raise objection to the informal adoptionof this convention.The Cabinet-Agreed that it would be useful to establish, without any formal change, a &quot;convention of describing the Common-wealth as &quot; the Commonwealth of Nations&quot; instead of&quot; the British Commonwealth of Nations &quot; ; and took note that this informal change should be defended on the basis that it was an object of policy to make it possible fornations to remain within the Commonwealth after they hadattained their independence, even though they felt that, byreason of their race and history, they could not properly be described as &quot; British &quot; nations.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,28th October, 1948.consequences of the repeal of the Eire Executive!Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936; and(ii) the measures which might be taken to mitigate the iconsequences of such repeal so far as concerned the United Kingdom and other commonwealth countries.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the attorney-General and the Solicitor-General, to consider and report whether,, after the repeal of the EireExecutive Authority (External Relations) Act, special privileges accorded to Eire and her citizens in suchmatters as trade preferences and freedom from aliens&apos;restrictions could be defended against challenge by foreign Governments based on &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot;clauses in Commercial Treaties; and, in particular,whether the grant of trade preferences to Eire would be safeguarded by the Geneva General Agreement on Tradeand Tariffs.
