Palestine.(previous reference:CM. (48) 61stConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to recent developments in Palestine. Both sides had failed to observe the truce and, as the result of recent operations, the Jews had extendedtheir control over a large part of Palestine and were, indeed, inoccupation of a number of Lebanese villages. The efforts of theSecurity Council to re-establish the Truce had so far provedunsuccessful and there were some grounds for fearing that, in theirpresent aggressive mood, the Jews might attack Transjordan. Inthat event His Majesty&apos;s Government would be bound by theirTreaty obligations to come to the assistance of Transjordan. Ifsuch an attack should take place, our task would be complicated bythe serious shortage of arms and ammunition from which both theRoyal Air Force detachments and the Transjordan Forces were suffering as the result of our strict fulfilment of the terms of the truce. Supplies of equipment and ammunition were available, but had not hitherto been sent to Transjordan in view of the criticism which might be provoked by such action. There were, however,two arguments for immediate action : the increasing threat toTransjordan, and the risk of bad weather conditions which mightrender impracticable the regular use of the Amman airfield. Inthese circumstances, the Chiefs of Staff had advised that immediate steps should be taken to despatch by air reinforcements for theRoyal Air Force detachment at Amman, together with anti-aircraft equipment and some 30-50 tons of ammunition to be held in readiness-ness for issue, in case of emergency, to the Arab Legion. They had also advised that naval dispositions should be made for the defenceof Aqaba in the event of threatened attack. In view of our close association with the United States Government in the attempt toestablish an effective Truce through the Security Council, it wouldbe necessary to keep the United States Secretary of State fully informed of our intentions.Ministers were generally agreed that our Treaty obligationswith Transjordan must be fulfilled; and they approved the adoptionof the precautionary measures &quot;proposed. In this connection thepoint was made that the transfer of ammunition from one Britishbase to another in the Middle East was not incompatible with theterms of the Truce. Ministers were, however, agreed that it was essential to keep in close touch with Mr. Marshall in this matter.In further discussion, the following points were made :-(a) Some concern was expressed at earlier suggestions to theeffect that, under certain circumstances, British Forces might becalled upon to support the Transjordan Forces operating inPalestine. It was pointed out that any such proposal raised very wide and controversial issues. Our Treaty obligation to defendTransjordan itself was well known and inescapable; but publicopinion here and abroad would not regard this obligation as covering the despatch of British troops to operate in Palestine itself. Whenit was decided to withdraw from Palestine, the general under-standing had been that British troops would not again be calledupon to operate there except as part of a United Nations Forceengaged in carrying out an international settlement, and thereshould be no departure from that policy. Moreover^ it was clearthat, notwithstanding the Truce, the strength of the Jewish forces had greatly increased in recertt months, and it would not be easy,in view of our commitments in Malaya and elsewhere, to deployforces in Palestine on the scale which would be necessary to ensuresuccess,(6) The suggestion was made that the best means of securing asettlement might now be to encourage direct negotiations betweenthe Israeli and Transjordan Governments. The general view ofMinisters was, however, that this suggestion would be regarded asa blow to the prestige of the United Nations.   Moreover, it was

(48) 262: by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations, covering the draft of a reply to the aide-memoire of20th October from the Eire Government;CP. (48) 263 : by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations, covering a memorandum on  he measures which mightbe taken to mitigate the practical effects on the United Kingdomof Eire&apos;s repeal of the External Relations Act;CP. (48) 264 : by the Lord Chancellor, covering a LegalOpinion discussing the effect of that repeal on the special privileges granted to Eire and her citizens in such matters astrade preferences and freedom from aliens restrictions;(CP. (48) 254 : by the Prime Minister, covering (i) a note of the constitutional proposals discussed with the PrimeMinister of India during his recent visit to London, and(ii) an Opinion prepared by the Lord Chancellor and the LawOfficers on the question whether those proposals would consti-tute an adequate basis for enabling India to remain withinthe Commonwealth and for resisting claims by foreign countries under &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; provisions in existing treaties.The Cabinet first discussed the effect of the proposed repeal ofthe Eire Executive Authority (External Relations) Act. It was clearthat the Eire Government were determined to carry through their declared intention of repealing that Act; and, further, that theywere resolved that Eire should cease to be a- member of the Common-wealth. What they desired was that Eire, while ceasing to be amember of the Commonwealth, should continue to enjoy many ofargued that the great discrepancy in military strength between thetwo sides precluded the possibility of equitable negotiations. Inthe circumstances, it was thought that the right course was to give full support to the efforts of the Security Council to achieve asettlement.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Minister of Defence to arrange for addi-tional reinforcements and ammunition to be despatchedby air to the Royal Air Force at Amman, including30-50 tons of ammunition to be held for issue to theTransjordan Forces in the event of emergency.(2) Authorised the Minister of Defence to arrange for naval dispositions to be made in the Suez area to enable Aqabato be defended against attack.(3) Invited the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to arrange for the United states secretary of State to be informed of the action whichwas to be taken in accordance with Conclusions (1) and(2) above; and took note that the Prime Minister would decide, in the light of anything which might be said bythe United States Secretary of State, on what date that action should be taken.
the advantages of membership through a factual association based,not only on her historical relations with Commonwealth countries,but on a reciprocal exchange of trade preferences and citizenshiprights. They evidently envisaged an intermediate position in whicnEire would be neither a British natron nor a foreign State. was it conceivable that such an intermediate position would be recognised in international law ?The Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General said that theyhad considered this question with great care, but had reached theconclusion that there was no device by which they could hope tosatisfy an international court that a country which was not a memberof the commonwealth was not a foreign State. If Eire repealed the external relations  Act she would, in the contemplation of inter-national law, become a foreign State in relation to the UnitedKingdom and other Commonwealth countries. Some.of the practicalconsequences might be mitigated by United Kingdom legislation.The Parliament at Westminster could enact that Eire should betreated for some specific purposes as though she was within HisMajesty&apos;s dominions. But such domestic legislation could not affectthe position under international law. And it followed that we couldnot accord to Eire or her citizens any special privileges which wewere not willing to accord to other foreign countries to whom wehad contracted to give &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; treatment. as was explained in the memorandum annexed to CP. (48) 264, ourposition would not be secure even in respect of countries which had signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the HavanaCharter. For other countries not signatories to that agreement and Charter could claim that the United Kingdom should accord to them the same trade advantages as she accorded to Eire; and, if that claim were conceded or upheld by the International Court, thecountries which were parties to the Agreement and the Chartercould then claim that they were entitled to the same privilegesunder article 1 of the Agreement and article 16 of the Charter.Full consideration had been given to the possibility that commoncitizenship might afford a constitutional link on which to foundan adequate defence against a challenge made by third parties on&quot;most-favoured-nation&quot; grounds. But this had been found, on examination, to be inadequate even for India, which was preparedto declare that she remained a member of the Commonwealth. Fora true common citizenship must confer on the citizen a right to enterany part of the territory of which he was a citizen and a right to share in its government; and the possession of Commonwealthcitizenship would not confer those rights throughout all the terri -tories of the Commonwealth. Even for India, therefore, theCommonwealth citizenship would not in itself afford a sufficientconstitutional link; and it would be even less effective in respect of eire, since her Government were determined to declare that she had ceased to be a member of the Commonwealth. If, therefore, Eirerepealed the External Relations Act, there seemed no room fordoubt that in internationnal law she would become a foreign Stateand that, by reason of the treaty obligations which they had under-taken in &quot;most-favoured-nation&quot; clauses, the United KingdomGovernment would have no alternative but to treat her as a foreign state and her citizens as aliens.In discussion some Ministers stressed the disadvantages of eire&apos;s becoming a foreign State. The Home Office would be con-fronted with the most formidable administrative difficulties if allEire citizens had to be treated in this country as aliens. If Eirebecame a member of the United Nations and raised the Partitionissue there, the United Kingdom Government wOuld find it highlyembarrassing to be forced to give positive support for thecontinuance of Partition as they would probably find themselvescompelled to do for strategic reasons alone, apart from any
consideration for the feelings of the people of Northern Ireland.Account must also be taken of the unfavourable reactions on publicopinion, both in the United Kingdom and in other commonwealth countries, of Eire&apos;s secession from the Commonwealth. Were not allthese good reasons for looking at the spirit, rather than the letter,of the aide-memoire from the Eire Government? This had recog-nised the existence of a specially close relationship between Eireand Commonwealth countries &quot;arising, not only from ties of blood and kinship, but from traditional and long-establishedeconomic and social trade arrangements based on common interest&apos;&apos;;and had urged that this relationship &quot; should be maintained on thebasis that the rights and privileges involved .... were dependentupon long-established custom and tradition.&quot; Was it not clear thatEire Ministers had been led by considerations of domestic politicsto commit themselves too hastily to the repeal of the external relations Act; and could not some means be found of helping themto extricate themselves from their difficulties ? Might not a solutionbe found along the lines of persuading the Eire Government to makea public declaration that they did not regard Eire as foreign tothe countries of the Commonwealth in certain specified respects ?In reply, it was pointed out that the difficulties in internationallaw could not be evaded by a unilateral declaration made by one government or even by domestic legislation enacted by one Govern-ment. Due consideration must also be given to the risk that, if Eirewere allowed to secede from the Commonwealth and still retain manyof the advantages of membership, other Commonwealth countries might ask what they stood to gain by their continuing membership.Further, if trade preferences and other privileges were accorded to eire solely on the basis of the factual association which sheadvocated, how could we continue to maintain that our &apos;&apos; most-favoured-nation &quot;rights would be infringed by a similar relation-ship between the South American countries or the States of theArab League, who could allege a similar historical association and similar ties through language, religion and political co-operation ?After further discussion Ministers agreed that we should atleast put clearly on record the legal implications, as we saw them,of Eire&apos;s repeal of the External Relations Act and the difficulties to which this repeal would give rise. We should also make it clearthat these were consequences which would inevitably follow, as amatter of international law, as a result of the action of the eire government in repealing the Act. It was important that it should,if possible, be brought home to public opinion in Eire that these were the inevitable consequences of the action taken by their own government, and not measures applied by the United KingdomGovernment, at their discretion, in retaliation against Eire&apos;ssecession from the Commonwealth. It was therefore desirable thata formal communication should be sent without delay to the eire government and that full publicity should be given to its contents.The Cabinet recognised that there was little prospect that, as a resultof such a communication, the Eire Government would delay theintroduction of legislation to repeal the External Relations Act.They were, however, informed that this legislation was to include provision for its being brought into operation at a date to be deter-mined by Order; and it might at least be urged that the date tobe fixed for the commencement of the Act should be such as to allowample opportunity for full discussion of all its legal implicationsand the practical difficulties to which it would give rise. It wasalso agreed that the communication might end with the suggestionthat if the Eire Government had any doubt about bur view of thelegal implications of their action, they might appoint legal experts to discuss with ours the legal and constitutional issues which were involved. It was most desirable that our communication should bepublished before the proposed legislation was introduced into the
85CM. 71 (48)Dail; and the text of the communication should be carefully wordedwith publication in view.Representatives of the Governments of Canada, Australia andNew Zealand had taken part in the conversations with eire ministers at Chequers on 17th October; and it was therefore desirable that they should at least be aware of the contents of the communication which we proposed to send to the Eire government before it was despatched. After discussion, it was agreed that the attorney-General, who was going to Paris on other business that afternoon, should take the opportunity of discussing the text of theproposed communication in Paris with the Prime Minister ofNew Zealand, the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and theCanadian Secretary of State for External Affairs. Subject to their comments, the communication should be despatched to the eire government that evening; and, as soon as it had been delivered, itand the aide-memoire of 20th October from the Eire Governmentshould be communicated to the Press.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the draft reply to the Eire Governmentannexed to CP. (48) 262 should be revised on the lines indicated in the course of the Cabinefs discussion.(2) Invited the Attorney-General to show the text of the revised communication to the Prime Minister of NewZealand, the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia andthe Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs inParis that afternoon.(3) Subject to any comments received as a result of the actionto be taken under Conclusion (2) above, invited theSecretary of State for Commonwealth Relations to despatch a communication to the Eire Government inthe terms of the revised draft and to make arrangements to ensure that it and the aide-memoire of 20th Octoberfrom the Eire Government should receive full publicityat the earliest possible date.The Cabinet then discussed the issues raised in CP. (48) 254regarding India&apos;s future relations with the Commonwealth.The Cabinefs discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of Cabinet Conclusions.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,12th November, 1948.
