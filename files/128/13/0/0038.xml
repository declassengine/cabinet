Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet discussed the arrangements for the debate onForeign Foreign Affairs which was to be held in the house of Commons onAffairs 9th and 10th December.Dfeb^e- Interest would focus mainly on the problems of Europe,   theForeign Secretary said, however, that he could not avoid making some reference to recent events in China. He did not intend tosay anything at this stage which would exclude the possibility ofour subsequently establishing friendly relations with any communist government which might emerge in China.The Foreign Secretary would open the debate on 9th December.It was understood that Mr. Churchill intended to speak on 10thDecember; and it was agreed that the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster should intervene in the debate soon afterwards in orderto reply to Opposition criticism of the Government&apos;s handling ofthe current discussions in Paris on the form of the standing arrange-ments to be made for consultation between the countries of western europe. The Minister of State or the Parliamentary Under-Secre-tary of State for Foreign Affairs would reply to the debate.Western 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that, at the meetings of. theUnion. Committee of Inquiry in Paris, the French representatives were(Previous pressing their proposal for a Consultative Assembly for westernReference: Europe; and, in view of the publicity which was being given toC.M.(48)68th these discussions, there was perhaps some risk of our being pressedConclusions, to define prematurely our final attitude towards the proposals thereMinute 4.) under discussion. It was important that we should not be forced into any exclusive association with France and the benelux countries: We had also to consider our relations with the othercountries of Europe and with Commonwealth countries overseas.The function of the Committee of Inquiry was to examine all thepossible forms of ensuring closer co-operation between the countries of western Europe, and to submit their recommendations to the consultative Council established under the Treaty of Brussels; andit was important that the preparatory character of the current discussions should not be obscured. The Consultative Council, whenthey received the report of the Committee of Inquiry, would haveto consider whether they should adopt at once some machinery for closer consultation between the Brussels Powers alone or whetherthey should seek to bring into the scheme a number of other Euro-pean Powers, including Italy and the Scandinavian countries. TheForeign Secretary said that, as at present advised, he was disposed to advocate the second course. He had particularly in mind theneed for devising arrangements which would enable Germany tobe associated, in some appropriate manner, with any standingorganisation which might be established for the discussion ofEuropean problems.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that there wasno immediate risk of our being involved in any commitment as aresult of the current discussions in Paris. The Committee of inquiry had appointed a sub-committee to consider in detail theproposals put forward by the representatives of the United Kingdomand France and any alternative proposals that seemed to meritconsideration; and this had been arranged without any commitment in principle to either the French or the United Kingdom plan.The report of the Committee of Inquiry could, he thought, takethe form of presenting the alternatives for final decision by the consultative Council; and he hoped it would be possible to avoiddisclosing in that document any disagreement between the Frenchand United Kingdom Governments. It was clear that the Com-mittee of Inquiry were not empowered&apos; to reach final decisions.The Cabinet took note of these statements.
G 0 IPalestine.(previous reference erence:CM. (48) 71stConclusions, -Minute 1.)National 4.   The Minister of Defence drew attention to an OppositionService Bill. amendment to the National Service Bill to the effect that a person(Previous should not be called up after attaining the age of 18^ years unlessEeference: he had applied for deferment.   This amendment would have toCM.

It was agreed that this point should be explored.The Cabinet-Took note Of the statement by the Minister of Def em:of the points raised in the discussion.and3. The Foreign Secretary made a report to the Cabinet onthe course of the discussions oh Palestine at the United Nationsmeeting in Paris. After recalling the earlier history of these discussions the Foreign Secretary explained the circumstances inwhich the latest United Kingdom resolution on the subject had beenput forward. This had proved unacceptable to the Arab States,who were still unwilling to acknowledge the partition of Palestine;and they had combined with the Slav and South American groups to ensure its defeat. An amended resolution would come beforethe Assembly shortly; and if, as seemed likely, it proved impossibleto secure a two-thirds majority in its favour, the position wouldbe governed by the Security Council resolution, under which Dr.. Bunche would continue to act as mediator.In discussion it was suggested that, although we might be unable as yet to recognise the Israeli Government, it would be convenient if some practical arrangement could be made for establishing direct communication with that Government. Atpresent, the British Consuls in Haifa and Jerusalem were unableto communicate with the Jewish authorities at Telaviv. Theestablishment of some channel of communication with the israeli government would be of practical convenience to several Depart-ments of the United Kingdom Government, and would also help to meet Parliamentary criticism.There was general agreement that we must continue to opposeany attempt to secure the admission of Israel to the United Nations.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement, and invited him to consider whether it would be possible,without fornially recognising the Israeli Government,to devise practical means of establishing a channel ofcommunication with that Government.
5. On 2nd December the Cabinet had invited the -ordPresidents Committee to examine Clause 19 of the Licensing bill relating to the provision of alcoholic drinks at bottle parties. TheCabinet now had before them a memorandum by the Home Secretary(CP. (48) 292) reporting the results of this examination and of later discussions with the Lord Chancellor.2 ) The Home Secretary said that this problem was confined to central London. Bottle parties had come into existence there sometwenty years ago as a means of evading the licensing law. Theywere not liable for the heavy licensing fee and the contribution tomonopoly value which a licensed house had to pay, and they werenot registered clubs. Under a Defence Regulation which would come to an end in 1950, a chief officer of police could make an orderclosing undesirable premises in certain circumstances, and seventy-three such orders had been made by the Commissioner ofPolice of the Metropolis in respect of bottle parties, including threein the present year; but the Lord Chancellor and he agreed thatit was not practicable to deal with this problem by putting theseemergency powers on a permanent basis. It would be politicallydifficult to make any concession in favour of bottle parties; and this difficulty had been increased by statements which had appeared inthe newspapers in the last few days to the effect that the Governmentwere proposing to increase the facilities for drinking. He thoughtit should be left to the occupiers of licensed premises and to regis-tered clubs to make any further use which they might desire of theexisting statutory provisions regarding applications for extensions of permitted hours on special occasions. A bottle party whichchanged its status to that of a. registered club would have the sameopportunity as existing clubs to apply for such extensions.The Lord Chancellor regretted that it had been found necessaryto interfere with reputable night clubs, where young people foundharmless pleasure in dancing. He also thought that, in the interestsof the tourist trade, it was unfortunate that the Governmentshould do anything to enhance the impression that London was adull place compared with other capital cities. He had been attracted by a proposal that there should be a statutory provision under which,in areas specially designated by the Home Secretary (and he need only designate central London), the chief officer of police shouldbe empowered to grant extensions of permitted hours two or three times a week under proper safeguards.In further discussion it was generally agreed that it was not desirable to amend the Bill in the direction of giving further facili-ties for drinking after the existing permitted hours. There wasno general demand for an extension of facilities of this kind, andany general increase of such facilities might have undesirable social and economic consequences. It might be that the Commissioner ofPolice could give, on a rather more liberal scale, extensions underthe existing statutory provisions relating to special occasions; but no reference should be made to this in the course of the debate.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that Clause 19 of the Licensing Bill relating tobottle parties should remain unaltered.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to consider at a later stagewhether, by administrative means, some extension ofpermitted hours could be allowed in central London inappropriate cases, subject to suitable safeguards.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,6th December, 1948.
