capital punishment.(previous reference:CM. (48) 53rdConclusions,Minute 3.)The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Home secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (48) 252) proposing the appointment of a Royal Commission on capital punishment.The Home Secretary said that by the statements made by government spokesmen in the House of Commons on 22nd July,which were reproduced in paragraph 1 of CP. (48) 252, the Govern-ment had undertaken to investigate the possibility of retaining the death penalty only for certain crimes of murder; and he and theSecretary of State for Scotland had been considering how effect could best be given to that undertaking. They were satisfied thatsome form of independent enquiry was required, and that neither a departmental Committee nor a Select Committee would commandsufficient public confidence. They therefore recommended theappointment of a Royal Commission, with terms of reference whichwere sufficiently general to cover the question of total abolition ofcapital punishment but would, at the same time, direct special atten-tion to the possibility of reserving the death penalty only forcertain crimes of murder and to the problem of alternative treatment for persons who would otherwise have suffered the death penalty.Public attention might soon be drawn to this question in one of threeways: it might be raised in the proceedings on the criminla justice (Scotland) Bill, or by the introduction of a Private Member&apos;bill, or when a case occurred in which, under the existing law, the responsible Minister felt unable to advise that the death sentence should be commuted to penal servitude for life. On any of theseoccasions the Government might be asked how they proposed to implement the undertakings given on 22nd July. It was therefore recommended that an early announcement should be made to theeffect that the Government had decided to appoint a Royal Com-mission with the terms of reference proposed in CP. (48) 252: the composition of the Commission could be settled later.The Cabinet first discussed whether it would be possible toavoid holding an independent enquiry into this question. The state-men ts made on 22nd July did not, it was suggested, commit theGovernment in terms to a formal investigation by an independent body. There were as yet no signs of renewed interest in this question by any substantial number of Government supporters; and it mightbe that, after the inconclusive debates of the preceding Session,public opinion generally would be content to leave this controversy in abeyance for the time being. Most Ministers, however, thought it inevitable that the question should be raised in one way or anotherduring the course of the current Session; and they feared that itwould give an impression of weakness if the Government took no action until forced by public pressure to carry out the undertakings given on 22nd July. The Cabinet therefore concluded that some form of enquiry ought to be set on foot.Discussion then turned to the question whether the scope of theenquiry should be such as to include the total abolition of capital punishment. On this, the general consensus of opinion in the cabinet was that an enquiry embracing this general question was not likelyto lead to any practical result. If the Commission were to includepersons who had already declared themselves in favour of or againsttotal abolition, there would be little prospect of securing an agreedreport; and, if it were to include no one who had declared himself on the general question, it would be difficult to assemble a body of people whose views would command public confidence. It would be preferable, therefore, to limit the enquiry to the two practicalquestions (i) whether there was any practicable means of retaining the death penalty only for certain crimes of murder and (ii) underwhat conditions, and for how long, persons who would otherwise have suffered the death penalty should be detained. This wouldhave the effect of stressing the practical and historical approach tothe problem, and avoiding the abstract issues of justice and con-science on which controversy was not likely to be brought to a final conclusion. But even this limited enquiry&quot; would raise problems of
such complexity that it was unlikely to be completed before thenext General Election.The question was then raised whether the advocates of total abolition would be content with an enquiry with this limited scope and, in particular, whether any of them would be willing to partici-pate in it. On this point there was some divergence of view; but themajority of the Cabinet believed that some of those who were opposed to the death penalty might be persuaded to participate inan enquiry designed to limit its application.It was agreed that the enquiry should not extend to the impo-sition of capital punishment in the Armed Forces or in colonial territories overseas. It should be limited to the powers of the civil courts in Great Britain.Before reaching a final decision Ministers wished to have anopportunity of considering revised terms of reference, on the restricted basis suggested during their discussion. They also wishedto be satisfied that it would be possible to secure the services, for alimited enquiry of this kind, of people of standing whose nameswould command public confidence. For this latter purpose they agreed that the Home Secretary might take informal soundings witha view to assuring himself that some of those whom he had in mindwould be prepared to serve.The Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to submit (i) draft terms of reference for an enquiry, by a Royal Commission, which would not embracethe general question of the total abolition of capital punish-ment and (ii) an appreciation of the prospects of securing,for such a limited enquiry, the services of individuals whose views would command public confidence.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,8th November, 1948.
