Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.Common-Health -Relations.Eire.(previous reference:C.M.(48)76thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the week following the Christmas recess.2. The Cabinet were informed that in the debate on Eire inthe House of Lords that afternoon Viscount Simon was likely toask which Department of the United Kingdom Government wouldin future handle relations with Eire. The Foreign Secretary saidthat he was concerned lest the forthcoming change in the constitu-tiohal status of Eire should have the effect of creating in GreatBritain an Irish vote which would be embarrassing to him in his conduct of foreign policy; and he was anxious that the ForeignOffice should not undertake any responsibility for Irish business.The Prime Minister said that the transfer of this responsibility tothe Foreign Office would in any event be inconsistent with theGovernments policy that Eire should not be regarded as a foreign country. The right course was to leave the conduct of Eire business with the Commonwealth Relations Office; and this could, ifnecessary, be announced in the debate in the House of Lords that afternoon.The Prime Minister said that he had received an interim reporton the progress made by the working party of officials which theCabinet had appointed on 22nd November to consider what conse-quential action might have to be taken as a result of Eire&apos;s ceasingto be a member of the Commonwealth; and it seemed likely thatsome legislation would have to be passed by the Parliament at westminster, if so, the legislation should be passed as soon aspossible after the commencement of the Republic of Ireland Acton 21st January, 1949; and this point should be kept in mind in arranging Parliamentary business for the period immediately following the Christmas Recess.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Commonwealth Relations Office shouldcontinue to be responsible for handling relations betweenthe United Kingdom and Eire.(2) Took note that legislation consequential upon the cominginto operation of the Republic of Ireland Act might haveto be introduced in the Parliament at Westminster soon after the end of the Christmas Recess.Army and MsForce Courts-Martial.(previous reference:CM. (48) 5thConclusions,Minute-3.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordChancellor (CP. (48) 300) covering reports of a committee under thechairmanship of Mr. Justice Lewis, and of an interdepartmental committee of officials which had examined the recommendations ofthe Lewis Committee, on the procedure of Army and Air force courts-martial.The Lord Chancellor explained that effect had already beengiven to certain interim recommendations of the Lewis Committeerelating to the organisation of the Judge Advocate-General&apos;department. The two principal recommendations made by the lewis committee in their final report had been accepted by all the Depart-ments represented on the official committee. One was that generalatid district courts-martial, when trying serious cases, should have as president a civilian lawyer, whose functions would be similar tothat of a judge in a Court of Assize. For this purpose it would beijecessary to; appoint a Chief Judge-Martial and probably thirteenJudges-Martial, of whom six would serve abroad. The lewis committee recommended that the Chief Judge-Martial should havethe status and remuneration of a Judge of the High Court, but the36384-2 b 2
official committee suggested that he should be paid a salary of 3,000- 3,500 and should be removable in certain circumstances bythe Lord Chancellor. The second main proposal was to set up aCourts-Martial Appeal Court, which would meet to hear appealsunder the presidency of the Chief Judge-Martial. The committee considered that this procedure would be fairer, or would at leastappear to be fairer, than the present review of cases by the service departments and Service Ministers. The Board of Admiralty werenot convinced that the proposals now made in respect of the Armyand Royal Air Force could be. applied to the Navy. The Navy hadnot been represented on the Lewis Committee and the LordChancellor proposed that a committee on the lines of the lewis committee should now be set up on which naval representatives would serve. He believed that the announcement of the appointmentof this further committee would meet any criticisms that might beraised in Parliament about the failure to apply the new proposals to the Navy.The following were the main points raised in discussion : (a) Conflicting views were expressed about the value of theproposed appeal procedure. On the one hand, it was pointed outthat Service men should not be denied the rights of appeal whichwere available to civilians arraigned before the criminal courts;and that this point was of special importance now that a systemof compulsory military training was in operation. Moreover, underthe present procedure Service Ministers and their advisers were called upon to decide difficult points of law, or of mixed law andfact; and, despite the legal advice available to them, this was a heavy, responsibility. On the other hand, it was agreed that Servicemen sentenced by courts-martial would receive more sympathetic consideration of all the circumstances of their case from service authorities and Ministers than they could expect to receive from anAppeal Court: the existing system left room for mercy as well asjustice. Moreover, while all court-martial sentences were nowsubject to review, it was estimated that only 10 per cent, of thoseconvicted would under the new system exercise their right of appeal.In public discussion attention would be drawn to the fact that theDarling Committee of 1919 and the Oliver Committee of 1938 had reached the conclusion that the existing system provided more effective safeguards for a soldier and airman than were enjoyed bya civilian and had advised against setting up a court of appeal.(6) Much of the criticism of court-martial procedure was madein time of war, when much larger numbers of cases had to be dealtwith more hurriedly. The Lewis Committee had envisaged somecontinuance of the proposed system of appeal in time of war, andThe Secretary of State for Air said that he was himself in favourof this. On the other hand the official committee had thought itwould be impracticable to continue the Appeal Court system intime of war and had recommended the substitution of an appealin writing to the Chief Judge-Martial. If safeguards accepted as necessary in time of peace were abandoned in time of war, wouldnot war-time decisions of courts-martial tend to be called inquestion?(c) The proposals envisaged that the Service members of acourt-martial, presided over by a civilian president, would act as members of. a jury rather than as judges. This would undoubtedlylead to a demand (on the lines of an addendum to the Lewis Reportby Mr. A. R. Blackburn, M.P.) that privates and non-commissioned officers should be eligible to serve on courts-martial. Most Ministersthought it would be difficult to meet such a demand, since courts-martial were essentially an aspect of Service discipline.(d) The Lord Chancellor proposed the withdrawal of thepresent power of quashing conviction from all authorities at presentpossessing it, including His Majesty. Any such provision wouldhave to be carefully drafted to avoid interference with the royal
prerogative of mercy, which should continue to apply to court-martial cases.(e) There would be Parliamentary difficulties in dealing withthis matter in the Army and Air- Force (Annual) Bill. That bill could not be introduced until the middle or end of March and ithad to pass into law by the end of April. It was doubtful whetherthis would afford time for both Houses to consider provisions onthis controversial subject.The general view of the Cabinet was that further time shouldbe given for consideration of the difficult issues raised by the lord chancellor&apos;s memorandum. The right course appeared to be to publish the report of the Lewis Committee and to announce theappointment of a corresponding committee to enquire into NavalCourts-Martial. Although it was some months since the lewis committee had reported, the delay in publication could, to someextent, be explained by referring to the steps already taken to carryout some of the recommendations to which effect could be given by administrative action.The Cabinet -(1) Invited the Secretary of State for War to arrange for thereport of the Lewis Committee on Army and Air force courts-Martial to be published as a Command Paper.(2) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty, in consultationwith the Lord Chancellor, to set up a correspondingcommittee to enquire into the procedure of Naval Courts-Martial.(3) Agreed that consideration of the major issues raised in cp. (48) 300 should be deferred for the time being,but that the Secretaries of State for War and Air shouldimplement any minor non-controversial recommendationsof the Lewis Committee which were regarded as desirable and did not require legislation.Germany. 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignOccupation Secretary (CP. (48) 301) covering the draft of an occupation statute. Statute for Western Germany.(Previous The Foreign Secretary recalled that the Cabinet had approvedReference: on 8th June (CM. (48) 37th Conclusions, Minute 1) the recommen-C.M.(48)76th dations of the Six-Power Conference on the future of GermanyConclusions, as set out in the Report annexed to CP. (48) 143; and Annex minute 6.) to that Report had contained a Letter of Advice to the military governors setting out the broad principles for an occupation statute. The Military Governors had not yet been able to reach agreement on a draft text for submission to the three Governments;and representations had now been received from the German Parlia-mentary Council that their work on the Basic Law for germany would be delayed unless they could be given some indication of theterms of the Statute. The Military Governors had arranged tomeet the representatives of the Parliamentary Council on16th December; and, if the Cabinet agreed with the general principles embodied in the text annexed to CP. (48) 301, he thoughtthat they might be authorised to inform the Council of the general sense of the draft. He suggested that they should also be askedto complete their discussions on the draft without delay, so that early arrangements might be made for an inter-Governmentalmeeting to settle the final terms of the Statute. The actual textwould not be communicated to the Parliamentary Council untilthe Cabinet had had an opportunity of seeing it again, after theinter-Governmental talks had taken place. The Statute wouldradically alter the relations between Western Germany and the occupying Powers, and extensive powers would be transferred to german hands. But our aim was to build a peaceful and democraticWestern Germany, and this could be achieved only by the gradual
transfer of real responsibility to the Germans themselves. under paragraph 2 of the draft important powers would be reserved tothe Occupation authorities, and he was satisfied that our security requirements would be adequately safeguarded.In discussion, the following points were made : (a) The terms of the Proclamation under which the occupation statute would be issued could not be read to imply that the Occupy-ing Powers were committed to the permanent disarmament ofGermany. This was a matter for settlement by the peace treaty;and it might then be necessary to make some provision for a limited measure of rearmament in Western Germany.(6) Attention was drawn to paragraph 7 of the draft Statute,which provided that the legislation of the Occupation authoritiesshould remain in force, but that such legislation as was consideredincompatible with the Statute should be expressly abrogated. Inthe absence of a specific reservation under paragraph 2, the GermanGovernment, by virtue of their powers under paragraph 1, wouldhave the legal power to create Armed Forces. It was agreed thata reservation to cover this point should be included in paragraph 2.(c) In view of the anxieties felt by Ministers about the provi-sions of the Long-Term Programme submitted to the organisation for European Economic Co-operation on behalf of the Anglo-American Zone of Germany, it was important that adequate powers should be reserved to the Occupying authorities to enable them toprevent the German Government from employing unfair tradingmethods. Specific provision to cover this point had been made inparagraph 2 (g) of the draft.(a) The question was raised whether, without relinquishingany powers that might be considered essential, it would be possibleto define the powers reserved to the Occupation authorities in a lessconspicuous form. The lengthy and detailed provisions of para-graph 2 might render the draft Statute unpalatable to Germanopinion. In view of the opening words of this paragraph the german governments might well be left in legitimate doubt about the extentof their powers under paragraph 1. The Foreign Secretary pointedout that both the United States and French Governments attached great importance to ensuring that the Occupation authorities were left with adequate reserve powers. It was, however, proposed toamend the opening words of paragraph 2 so as to read &apos;&apos; TheOccupation authorities reserve to themselves the right to take any action they may deem necessary or appropriate to enable themto / . ...&quot;(e) Some doubt was expressed whether the provisions of thedraft Statute were not, in general, unduly restrictive. In the lightof recent international developments, should we not be more con-cei-ned with Western Germany as a future ally than as a potentialmenace to world peace ? Against this, it was argued that it wouldbe premature at this Stage to place too much confidence in western germany as a reliable ally; she had yet to give proof of a genuinechange of heart and outlook. Moreover, our policy towards germany must take full account of the French point of view: it was vital to our security that France should be strong and stable. Para-graph 24 of the draft would enable further powers to be pro-gressively transferred to German hands, if experience showed thatthis could be done without risk.(/) The War Office were anxious that any limits which mightbe placed for political reasons on claims under paragraphs 20 and 21for reimbursement of occupation costs should not be fixed at too lowa, figure.. It was important that the new arrangements should notthrow a heavy additional charge oh United Kingdom Defence Votes.The Cabinet--(1) Subject to the points recorded in paragraphs (b)above, approved the general lines of the draft of theStatute for Western Germany annexed to CP. (48) 301.
161CM. 81 (48)(2) Agreed, that the Military Governors should be authorisedto inform the German Parliamentary Council of thegeneral sense of the draft Occupation Statute.(3) Agreed that early discussions should be arranged between&apos;the Governments concerned with a view to reaching agreement on the final text of the Occupation Statute.(4) Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should settle with theMinisters directly concerned the instructions to be givento the United Kingdom representatives on the points tobe discussed at the inter-Governmental meeting to bearranged in accordance with Conclusion (3) above.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,15th December, 1948.
