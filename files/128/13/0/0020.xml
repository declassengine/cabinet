2. The Cabinet considered a note by the Minister of Defence(OP. (48) 221) covering a draft statement on the suspension of releases and the other measures which were being taken in accordancewith their decisions of 26th August. It was proposed that this statement should be made by the Lord President during the courseof his speech in the Debate on the Address on 14th September.In discussion, the following points were made : (a) It was suggested that, since the Minister of Defence wouldhave to make a full statement in the proposed defence debate, thestatement by the Lord President need not be so long and detailed.On the other hand, it was pointed out that Parliament ought tobe given a comprehensive factual statement in advance of the debate.(b) The Lord President should explain that the House wouldhave an opportunity of discussing defence questions after the debate on foreign affairs in the following week; and any passages likelyto encourage Members to raise general issues of foreign policy inthe Debate on the Address should as far as possible be excluded fromhis statement. It was, however, essential that the second and thirdsentences of the first paragraph should be retained. .(c) The opening paragraphs of the statement should bring out more clearly the fact that it had been recognised in all parts of theHouse that the inevitable consequence of a rapid and large-scaledemobilisation of the Forces after a major war was that, for atime, the three Services would be seriously handicapped by theshortage of skilled men; and that this was a risk which, in thelight of the circumstances existing at the end of the war, the Govern-ment had thought it right to take in the interests of - economic recovery.(e) The Cabinet were informed that it would be necessary tointroduce a Civil Defence Bill in the 1948-49 session, and it wasagreed that the paragraph relating to civil defence should statethat considerable progress had already been made with the prepara-tion of any legislation that might be necessary.Preparationslor Defence.(previous reference:CM. (48) 58thConclusions,Minute 2.1larliamentary i. The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the arrange-lusiness.       ment of business proposed for the session which would begin on14th September. ;It was contemplated that there would be a debate on defence on 15th September and a debate on economic affairs on 16th and17th September. The Debate on the Address would be concluded on17th September; and 20th, 21st and, possibly, 22nd September wouldbe devoted to the Parliament Bill. A debate on foreign affairs would have to be fitted in to the remainder of the week. On28rd September there might be a debate on the report of the national coal Board and there would be the usual Adjournment debate xin24th September!In discussion it was suggested that it would be preferable tohave the defence debate after the debate on foreign affairs; andthat there was no need to allow two days for the proposed debate on economic affairs. It was also suggested that, in view of the limited purpose of the new session, an allowance of four days forthe Debate on the Address was excessive. It was accordingly agreedthat an attempt should be made to arrange for the Debate onthe Address to be concluded by 15th September. There could then be a debate on economic affairs on 16th September anda debate on the report of the National Coal Board on 17th September;and, if the proceedings on the Parliament Bill could be shortened,it would be possible to &quot;devote 22nd September to the foreign affairs debate and 23rd September to the defence debate.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord President and the Chief Whip to explore the possibility of rearranging the business for the forth-coming session on the lines suggested in discussion.
(/) The Minister of Defence said that the Chiefs of Staff had pressed strongly that the question of recruitment to the regular forces should be dealt with in greater detail in the draft statement.He did not, however, consider that it would be advisable to go beyondthe reference to this matter contained in the draft. The cabinet were in general agreement with this view.(g) Ministers emphasised the importance of avoiding, both inthe Lord President^ statement and in the subsequent defence debate,any suggestion that the Government were contemplating an exten-sion of the period of service under the National Service Act.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation withthe Lord President and the Minister of Defence, would jsettle, in the light of their discussion, the terms of the!statement on defence preparations to be made in the Debate]on the Address.Mr. Jinnah. 3.   The Cabinet were informed that the B.B.C. had suggestedthat a Minister should broadcast an appreciation of the late mr.. Jinnah in their Overseas Service. In view of what had beendone on the occasion of Mr. Gandhi&apos;s death, this suggestion ought not to be rejected; but it was undesirable that the broadcast shouldbe given either by the Prime Minister or by the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth Relations.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was willing togive the proposed broadcast, provided that its time could be adjustedso as to fit in with his other commitments.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should arrange to broadcast an appreciation of Mr. Jinnah in the overseas Service of the B.B.C.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,.13th September, 1948.
