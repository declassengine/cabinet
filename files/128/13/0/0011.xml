1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.It had been intended that Parliament should be prorogued on30th July; but it was likely that the Opposition might ask that parliament should be adjourned, instead of being prorogued, so thatit might be convened more easily if the international situation deteriorated or some other emergency arose during the summer recess.After discussion the Cabinet agreed that the balance of advantage lay on the side of adjourning Parliament for the summer recess and authorised the Lord President to announce, at the appropriate time,that it was not the Government^ intention to ask for prorogationuntil after the recess.2. The Cabinet were informed that Mr. S. S. Silverman, M.P..and other Labour supporters who had favoured the suspension ofthe death penalty had suggested that, when the Lords&apos; amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill were debated in the House of Commonslater that day, the Government should make it clear that theircompromise clause on the death penalty represented the limit ofthe concessions which they were ready to make on this question andthat, if this was rejected, they intended to ensure, if necessary byrecourse to the Parliament Act procedure, that the Bill should pass into law in the form in which it first left the Commons.It was the view of the Cabinet that it would be a mistake intactics for the Government to announce at the present stage what course they would follow if the compromise clause were not acceptedby the House of Lords. It was possible that the Lords would rejectthis clause; but, if the Government announced in advance what they intended to do in that event, they would be inviting the Lords to reject it. The view was also expressed that it might be unwise tohave recourse to the Parliament Act procedure on an issue of thiskind, where public opinion was uncertain and Parliamentary opinion was not divided on Party lines.The Cabinet agreed that the Government must first concentrate on getting the House of Commons to accept the compromise clause.There was no obligation on them to disclose in advance what coursethey might take if that clause were subsequently rejected by theHouse of Lords; and it would be inexpedient for Ministers to bedrawn into public discussion of that question at the present stage.The Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary to explain to Mr. Silvermanand his colleagues, before the debate that afternoon, thereasons why the Government felt unable to give at thisstage any public indication of the course which they mightadopt if the compromise clause on the death penalty were rejected by the House of Lords.3. The Cabinet were informed that the Conservative Opposi-tion in the House of Lords, while they had agreed to make no furtherdifficulties over those provisions of the Representation of the PeopleBill which concerned the Parliamentary franchise, had askedwhether the Government would give sympathetic consideration to an amendment designed to give Westminster and the City of Londonincreased representation on the London County Council. These areasat present had eight seats on the London County Council: underthe provisions of the Bill they would in future have only three. Theyhad, however, large numbers of business voters and high rateablevalues; and on these grounds it was represented that they shouldtogether have six seats on the London County Council.In discussion it was pointed out that this concession could notbe made without reopening the claims of other London boroughs.Nor could the Government concede a claim which was admittedlybased on business votes and rateable values.
The Cabinet-Agreed that the Government spokesmen in the House ofLords should resist any attempt to introduce into the representation of the People Bill amendments designedto give to Westminster and the City of London increasedrepresentation on the London County Council.Electricity.Control ofDomesticConsumption.(previous reference erence:CM. (47) 74thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of fuel and Power (CP. (48) 183) on the control of domestic consump-tion of electricity.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, owing to the slow progress made in installing additional generating plant, thesupply of electricity was likely to fall short of the peak demand until1954 and the shortfall would be specially large during the next threewinters. Arrangements would have to be made for spreading the load next winter, and plans covering both industrial and commercialconsumers had been approved by the Production Committee on 2nd July (P.C. (48) 13th Meeting, Minute 2). The problem ofspreading the domestic load had been examined by a committee underthe Chairmanship of Sir Andrew Clow, which had recommended the introduction of a system of differential charges to discouragedemand during the months of peak demand. It might be possible bythis means to obtain a saving of between 250,000 and 500,000kilowatts in domestic consumption. Some householders might find it difficult to meet the additional expense during the winter months,even though this would be offset by lower charges in the summer; butthe burden would mainly fall on those who used electricity only forheating rooms. The detailed revision of tariffs would be undertaken by the Area Boards.Discussion showed that there was general support for thisproposal, which had been endorsed by the Production Committee.The following points were made : (a) Care should be taken to explain to the public the purpose and effects of the proposed system of differential charges, in orderto secure the maximum economy with the least possible friction.Publicity for this purpose should be concerted by the Ministry of fuel and Power, the Economic Information Unit and the british electricity Authority. Full use should be made of broadcastpublicity.(ft) Was it necessary that the scheme should apply to the north of Scotland, where no deficit in generating capacity was expectednext winter? It was pointed out that the detailed applicationof the scheme would be left to the Area Boards, who would have discretion to adopt arrangements appropriate to local circumstances.(c) Should the scheme extend to consumers using slot-meters ?These would be the least able to bear the heavier winter charges and there were so few of them that the economy achieved would hardly warrant the hardship caused. Moreover, they were alreadypaying higher rates for electricity than those who paid quarterly.It was pointed out, in reply, that other consumers mighti feelaggrieved if the new system was not extended to consumers usingslot-meters. Moreover, the use of slot-meters was not confined tothe poorer people; they were widely used in hotels and lodginghouses. Ministers agreed that the question whether the scheme should apply to slot-meters should be left for the Minister to decide in consultation with the British Electricity Authority and the area boards:The Cabinet-Approved the proposal in CP. (48) 183 that the reportof the Clow Committee should be published with an indi-cation that the Government had accepted their recommen-dations, and that the British Electricity Authority shouldbe asked to give effect to them.
5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal (CP. (48) 179) reporting the results of the review of the civil aircraft programme made by the Civil Aviation Committee. they also had before them a memorandum by the Minister of Supply(CP. (48) 182) setting out his objections to the Committee&apos;s recom-mendation that Canadair aircraft should be bought for use by theBritish Overseas Airways Corporation, and a joint memorandumby the Minister of Supply and the Minister of Civil Aviation(CP. (48) 180) covering the final report of the Committee of enquiry into the Tudor aircraft.The Lord Privy Seal recalled the general background against which the Civil Aviation Committee had carried out their review and drew attention to the main features of the long-term civil aircraft programme set out in paragraph 5 of CP. (48) 179. Themost difficult question which the Committee had had to considerwas how to provide for the Empire services of B.O.A.C. duringthe interim period before the new British types became available.It had been hoped that B.O.A.C. would be able to rely for thispurpose on Tudor IVs and Tudor II&apos;s and that the Tudor V (avariant of the Tudor II) might be used by B.S.A.A.C. but, in viewof the disappointing results of the trials of the Tudor II, it seemed clear that neither it nor the Tudor V could be used on scheduled services and the Committee therefore recommended that sixteenTudor IVs on order for B.O.A.C. should be transferred to be.S.A.A.C., and that B.O.A.C. should be allowed to buy twenty-twoCanadairs on the understandings (i) that no immediate dollar expenditure would be involved, and (ii) that B.O.A.C. would under-take that this would not be allowed to prejudice the introductionon their services of the new British types as they became available.The Minister of Supply dissented from this recommendation and proposed that B.O.A.C. should use Tudor IVs, the twenty-sixTudor IPs on order being converted into Tudor IVs.The Lord Privy Seal added that, in conducting his review ofthe civil aircraft programme, he had been disturbed by the lackof co-operation between the Ministry of Supply and the Ministryof Civil Aviation and by the evidences of friction between these departments and the Corporations. He also thought it deplorablethat so much of the deliberations of the Committee should havebeen divulged and that improper attempts should have been madeby the interests concerned to influence the decisions to be takenby Ministers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet thaton the previous day the United States Ambassador had written tohim suggesting that, if the Cabinet decided to depart from the&quot; fly British &quot; policy, they should buy United States aircraft ratherthan Canadairs. This proposal had been supported by the argu-ment that Constellations, being better aircraft, would earn moredollars and an offer had been made to finance the purchase of Con-stellations through the Export-Import Bank in such a way as to involve no net dollar expenditure by the United Kingdom. In fact,however, the purchase of Constellations would be less attractivefrom the point of view of our dollar resources, since all the dollar earnings of any Constellations bought would have to be devotedto repayment of the purchase price, whereas the Canadian Govern-ment were willing to agree that the purchase of Canadairs shouldbe financed out of the Canadian assets which we were at presentcommitted to realise in repayment of the Canadian interest-freeloan, with the result that we should reap the benefit of any dollarsearned by the Canadairs without any corresponding increase inour dollar payments to Canada apart from the extension of theperiod of repayment of the interest-free loan.The Cabinefs discussion was confined to the question whetherthe interim needs of B.O.A.C. should be met by Canadairs orTudor IVs.In support of the proposal to buy Canadairs it was argued that, in attractiveness to passengers and in pay-load, the Canadair
was in almost all respects superior to the Tudor IV and that, even after allowing for the additional capital cost of the Canadairs,the cost of operating them over a period of five years would beless than that of operating a corresponding number of Tudor IV&apos;by a sum ranging, according to the varying estimates, from 5-3 millions to  13-5 millions. Moreover, there would be nodifficulty in operating the Canadair on Empire airfields, but the bearing strength of some of those airfields W4s at present only justadequate for- the Tudor IV and was thought likely to deteriorate.Again, it would be possible to give a better service on the north atlantic route with Canadairs and so to earn, or save, more dollars.Other uses could be found for most, if not all, of the twenty-sixTudor II&apos;s and the decision not to compel B.O.A.C. to employ Tudorson their scheduled routes, though a departure from the &quot;fly British &quot;policy, need not involve any reflection on the merits of the british aircraft industry as a whole, nor any interference with the produc-tion of other aircraft by A. V. Roe, Ltd. While it was reasonable to require the Corporations to use British aircraft where the alter-native foreign aircraft were not markedly superior, it would bringnothing but discredit both to British civil aviation and to theBritish aircraft industry if the Corporations were compelled touse aircraft with which they could not hope to compete successfullyfor the available traffic.Against the proposal to buy Canadairs it was argued thatthe superiority of the Canadair over the Tudor IV was not enoughto justify a departure from the &quot;fly British&quot; policy. the tudor IV&apos;s were already being operated successfully by B.S.A.A.C.and, although there might be difficulties in using them on certainMiddle and Far East airfields, these difficulties should not be insuperable. The damage to the prestige of the British aircraft industry would be severe and would undoubtedly affect their overseassales, and the aircraft industry would lose the valuable experienceof operating British aircraft on the Empire routes. The Tudor IVwas, in fact, being used on the North Atlantic route and it was doubtful whether on that route the Canadair would show any marked superiority. The purchase of Canadairs by B.O.A.C. would represent a much more serious departure from the &quot; fly British &quot;policy than the purchases of Constellations and strato--cruisers, andthe use of such a high proportion of American-designed aircraft would prejudice the chances of persuading B.O.A.C. at a later date to accept new British types.Other points in discussion were : (a) A. V. Roe, Ltd., were engaged on important development work for the Royal Air Force, and the Air Ministry would depre-cate any action that would prejudice this work. On the other hand,it seemed clear that, if any emergency arose in the next five years,the United Kingdom would have to rely on United States produc-tion for heavy bombers, and to that extent the departure from the&quot; fly British &quot; policy in respect of the Tudor aircraft could notbe opposed on defence grounds.(&amp;) The Civil Aviation Committee had reached their conclu-sions without seeing the text of the final report of the Committeeof Enquiry into the Tudor Aircraft. This report suggested thatB.O.A.C. were mainly responsible for the delays and difficultieswhich had arisen in the development of the Tudor II and its criti-cisms of the Corporation would undoubtedly be used in any public controversy caused by the purchase of Canadairs. Further, thereport contained no indication of the terms of reference of theCommittee, who had been asked to report on the development and production of the Tudor aircraft and not on the use to which itmight be put, and to a certain extent (e.g., in paragraph 68) theCommittee had introduced into their report irrelevant andembarrassing matter. For these reasons &quot;it was suggested that thepublication of the report might be delayed at least until the finalresults of the trials of the Tudor II were available and that, mean-while, the Committee might be asked to modify its terms.
It was pointed out, however, that it would be difficult to justifydelaying the publication of the report until after the debate on civil Aviation in the House of Lords on 21st July and that it wouldbe inexpedient to ask the Committee to alter the terms of theirreport.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendations for the purchase of Cana-dairs in paragraph 15 (4) and (5) of CP. (48) 179;authorised the Minister oi- Civil Aviation to announce this decision in the forthcoming debate in the House ofLords; and took note that the Minister would consult with the Lord Privy Seal, the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, and the Minister of Supply on this partof his speech.(2) Approved the publication of the final report of the Com-mittee of Enquiry into the Tudor aircraft, subject tothe inclusion in it of a statement of the terms ofreference of the Committee; and authorised the simul-taneous publication of a Government statement indi-cating the preliminary results of the Khartoum trialsof the Tudor II.(3) Agreed to resume discussion of the recommendations madein paragraph 15 (l)-(3) of CP. (48) 179 when they hadreceived the report which was being prepared on theprocedure for ordering civil aircraft.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th July, 1948.
