The Prime 1.   The Cabinet were informed that a message had beenMinister. received from the Prime Minister thanking them for their kindmessage of sympathy and expressing his regret that he was not yetable to be with them again.preparations for Defence.(previous reference:CM. (48) 57thConclusions,minute 2.)2.   The Cabinet had before them (i) A note by the Minister of Defence (CP. (48) 214) covering the report of the working party set up, in accordancewith the Cabinefs decision of&quot;26th August, to make proposals for carrying out in an equitable manner thedecision to suspend releases from the Armed Forces; and(ii) a memorandum by the Secretary of State for War(CP. (48) 216) drawing attention to the difficultieswhich would arise if the scheme recommended by themajority of the working party was put into force.The Minister of Defence explained that the scheme recom-mended by the majority of the working party, which was on thegeneral lines originally proposed by the Chiefs of Staff, providedthat each man should be called on to serve for an additionalthree months beyond the date when he would normally be released. This was&quot; in accordance with the view accepted by theCabinet on 26th August that the burden of additional service should fall equally, on all concerned. The alternative schemeadvocated by the War Office representative seemed to him to be related rather to the long-term man-power problems of the armed forces, and the political and economic implications of its assumptionthat the Army should be maintained at a strength of 400,000 mustbe considered in relation to the financial and man-power budgetsof the country as a whole. It would, in his view, be premature todecide on a scheme of this kind until Ministers had been able toconsider the comprehensive review of the National Service Act whichthe Cabinet had invited him to set on foot at their meeting on26th August. He had ascertained that the Prime Minister agreed with this view and favoured the adoption of the majority scheme.The Secretary of State for War said that, although he was disposed to accept the majority scheme, he felt bound to point out to the Cabinet the difficulties to which it would give rise. Thus, the pledge that all men called up before 1947 would be released before1949 would be broken, and it would also be necessary to keep inthe Forces for over two years some of the men called up in 1947.The scheme would increase the strength of the Army to about 440,000by 1st January, 1949, but immediately thereafter it would benecessary to restart releases and, if the strength of the Army hadto be reduced to about 300,000 men by the end of 1949, it would benecessary to release men at a very rapid rate.. This would make itimpossible for the Army to fulfil the obligations laid upon it. Itwas most important that the Army should be able to make its planssix months ahead on the basis of a known strength, and he stressed the urgency of completing the comprehensive review of the NationalService Act.The Minister of Health said that, if a decision were taken to suspend releases for three months in order to strengthen the armed forces over the next six to nine months, the Government would inevitably be placed in an embarrassing position when the periodof suspension came to an end. The suspension of releases wouldhave serious political and economic consequences, and it wasimpossible to rely on any definite improvement in the international situation in the next six months which would justify the Governmentin bringing this suspension to an end. He therefore felt that thebenefits5 which would be derived from the proposal were more thanoutweighed by the subsequent embarrassment which the Governmentwould have to face.b 2
Further points in discussion were 1(a) The Cabinet were informed that the Foreign Secretarysupported the majority scheme.(&amp;) The Chief of-the Air Staff said that the essential need ofall three Services was for more men of skill and experience, andthe primary task of the working party which was to review theNational Service Act must be to consider urgently how this needcould be met having regard to the differences between the Services.For the immediate future, the only practicable course was to acceptthe majority scheme, which secured uniformity of treatment, eventhough it was not ideal for any one of the Services.(c) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that themajority scheme would give the Army by 1st January, 1949, some40,000 men more than it actually needed, and there would thus bea waste of man-power which could be better employed in industry.If releases were to be suspended, it would be better for the Cabinetmerely to lay down that no man should be retained for an additionalperiod of more than three months, leaving it to each Service to retainor release men according to its needs. This would enable the army to be strengthened without any breach of the pledges given by theGovernment. He recognised that the alternative scheme advocated by the War Office representative on the working party would entailan extension of the period of service laid down in the NationalService Act, but such an extension was inevitable since the army would be unable to fulfil its obligations with a strength of only 300,000.(d) The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, in order tosecure a reasonable improvement in the state of preparedness of theRoyal Navy, it would be necessary to call on some men to serve for two years and nine months, and many would have to serve for aslong as two years and six months. In the interests of morale itwas important that the case for this should be adequately presentedand, in his view, it was essential that the additional period for which men were to be called on to serve should be the same in all three services.(e) If the majority scheme were approved,  the necessary 1shipping would have to be provided for the revised programmes of releases and reinforcements which would be entailed; and it was Iagreed that the Minister of Defence should take this matter up with 1the Minister of Transport..   (/) For reasons of. morale, it was desirable that the suspension of releases should come into force as soon as possible after it had been announced.   If, therefore, an announcement had to be made jearly in the new Session of Parliament, the suspension should operate from about the middle of September.   This would involve Ipractical difficulties for the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, whose Brelease schemes worked by complete groups each month; but the jalternative of allowing a considerable interval to elapse after theannouncement would give rise to more trouble.  Men who were due Mto begin courses at universities or colleges in October and were still Hin the. Armed Forces when the suspension came into force could Be 11dealt with under the scheme of Class B releases, which would not be Haffected by the suspension. I(g). If the majority scheme were approved, the announcement Bshould state that each man serving would be held to serve three jmonths beyond the date when he would normally have been released; I,and the additional period should not be described either as a Imaximum or a minimum. H. (h) The working party which was being set up to review the MNational Service Act,on the lines indicated by the Foreign Secretary jat the. Cabinefs meeting on 26th August should take into account Ithe economic consequences of their proposals and should consider Mgenerally how the differing man-power needs of the three Services jcould best be met, whether by some extension of the period of national flj
service or by other measures, such as additional inducements to secure a larger number of regulars.The Minister of Defence said that, while he appreciated thedifficulties to which the Minister of Health had drawn attention, hethought it essential to take immediate steps to strengthen the armed forces by stopping the further release of skilled and experiencedmen. Until July the Government had been proceeding on theassumption that there would be no major war for a period offive years from October 1947, and that, should any sudden emergencyarise, the Armed Forces would have to fight with whatever resources were available. When, as a result of the Berlin situation, the Chiefsof Staff had been called upon to advise what could be done in animmediate emergency, they had stressed the lack of balance in the armed Forces and had unanimously recommended a suspension of releases in order to make the striking power of the Armed Forcesmore effective by retaining some of the skilled and experienced menwho would otherwise be lost to them. He had in July pressed thatthe suspension should be brought into force immediately and he regretted that this had not been done. Any further delay could notbe defended in Parliament and would deprive the Foreign Secretaryof the necessary support for his foreign policy. If releases weresuspended, all three Services must, in his view, be treated in thesame way, and it seemed clear that the needs of the Royal navy and the Royal Air Force could not be met except by the majorityscheme. As regards the Army, he recalled that, when the proposalto suspend releases had originally been put forward, the Army&apos;sshortage of non-commissioned officers and other men of skill and experience had been strongly stressed. In these circumstances itshould be possible for the Army to employ the additional skilled menwhich the majority scheme would secure to it. He realised the urgency of obtaining a report from the working party on theNational Service Act, and he hoped that it might be possible topresent it to Ministers by the end of September.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the majority scheme for the suspension of releases from the Armed Forces set out in the report of theworking party annexed to CP. (48) 214.(2) Agreed that the announcement of the scheme should statethat men in the Armed Forces would have their serviceextended for a period of three months beyond the date when in the normal course they would have been released;and invited che Minister of Defence, in consultation withthe Service Ministers, to arrange for the suspension of releases to operate from a date as near as possible to theannouncment.(3) Took note that the Minister of Defence would settle, withthe Prime Minister, the Foreign i. Secretary, theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Labour andthe Service Ministers, the terms of a comprehensive statement dealing with the suspension of releases and theother measures which were being taken in accordancewith the Cabinet&apos;s decisions of 26th August.(4) Took note that the Minister of Defence would discuss withthe Minister of Transport the provision of adequateshipping for the revised programmes of releases andreinforcements which would have to be carried out.(5) Invited the Minister of Defence, in the light of the dis-cussion, to settle with the Chancellor of the Exchequer theterms of reference of the working party which was to review the National Service Act, and to arrange for thereport of this working party to be submitted at theearliest possible date.
The King&apos;speeches onthe Proroga-tion and opening ofParliament.(previous reference:C.M.(48)55thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (48) 215) covering revised drafts of TheKing&apos;s Speeches on the Prorogation and Opening of Parliament.In discussion the following points were made on the draftProrogation Speech: (a) Were not the two opening paragraphs unduly gloomy andshould there not in any event be some reference in paragraph 1 tothe unfavourable effect of the rise in world prices?The general view was that no change in these paragraphs wasnecessary except the inclusion of a reference to the effect of the risein world prices.(&amp;) The first sentence of paragraph 5 should be amended to makeit clear that only States in the Western Zones of Germany were referred to.(c) Paragraph 7 should include a reference to the beneficialresults of the discussions with the Prime Minister of Australia.(d) The paragraph about Burma should be placed after the paragraphs about Palestine.There was general agreement that the Opening Speech should remain in the form approved by the Cabinet at their meeting on29th July and should contain no reference to foreign affairs ordefence.The Cabinet-Subject to the points made in discussion, approved the draftSpeeches annexed to CP. (48) 215.ForeignAffairs.Germany.(previous reference:CM. (48) 54thConclusions.)4. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreigniffairs informed the Cabinet of the progress so far made in thediscussions between the Military Governors in Berlin on thequestions which had been remitted to them as a result of the Moscowconversations. If agreement were reached in Berlin on thesequestions there would doubtless be further conversations in Moscow.There was general agreement that it would be helpful if theForeign Secretary could give the Cabinet a general review of thesituation at an early date.The Cabinet-Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would ask the Foreign Secretary to review the international situation,with particular reference to recent developments inGermany, at a meeting of the Cabinet in the following week.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,Brd September, 1948.
