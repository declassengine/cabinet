I. The Foreign Secretary said that the United States andFrench Governments had agreed that their Ambassadors in london should, with Sir William Strang,. constitute a committee to keep under review the development of the current situation in Berlin,and he proposed that this body should in the first instance considermeans of supplying the civil population in Berlin by air. ThePrime Minister of Canada had ofiered to supply concentrated foodsfor this purpose; and the Foreign Secretary believed that it mightbe possible to transport to Berlin by air a total of 2,500-3,000 tonsof supplies a day, as compared with the average daily figure of5,000 tons supplied before the interruption of land communications.The United States Government had communicated to the two other Governments a draft of a proposed note to the Soviet Govern-ment. This was a lengthy document, and it might give the SovietGovernment an opportunity to reopen all their old grievances onthe German question. The text would need careful scrutiny andthe Foreign Secretary would submit it, with his recommendations,to an early meeting of the Ministerial Committee on Germany.He himself believed that there might be advantages in delayingfor a few days the presentation of a formal note of protest to theSoviet Government, since there were indications that the soviet authorities might decide gradually to withdraw the restrictions which they had imposed.There was no foundation for the statements, published in thePress the previous evening, that the Russians were flying barrageballoons on the air approaches to Berlin. Enquiries were beingmade into the source of these statements.The Cabinet took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Palestine. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that the United Nations(Previous       Mediator in Palestine had communicated to the Arabs and the JewsEeferenee:      new proposals for a settlement of the Palestine problem.   TheseCM (48)35th   proposals had not yet been communicated to the other GovernmentsConclusions,     concerned; but it seemed possible that some progress was beingMinute 7.)&apos;     made towards a settlement.   Meanwhile, however, the Jews inPalestine were having serious trouble with their own extremistgroups and it was possible that something like a civil war might develop before the Jewish State could be established.Yugoslavia. 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that, if there were no reconcilia-(Previous       tion between Moscow and the Communist leaders in Yugoslavia,reference:      it seemed likely that Yugoslavia and Bulgaria might move towardsCM.

It had been the aimConclusions,    of the Soviet Government to secure control of Greece by supportingMinute 2.)      the Communist movement in that country and to turn the Turkishflank by that means. Marshal Tito, on the other hand, had favoured the alternative course of securing an outlet to the south through theestablishment of a Balkan Federation.   These differences betweenthe Soviet Government and the Communist leaders in yugoslavia and Bulgaria were, however, differences of method, not of ultimate aim; and they would not ease our problem of preventing Greecefrom being detached from the Western Powers.Germany.Situationin Berlin.(previous reference:CM.

The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Second Reading of the British Nationality Bill would betaken on 7th July. It nad been suggested that the government might publish a White Paper explaining how the amendmentscarried by the House of Lords were inconsistent with the agreementsreached with other Commonwealth Governments on the generalscheme of the Bill. It was, however, the view of the Cabinet thatit would suffice if the Home Secretary explained these points in moving the Second Reading of the Bill, and that it was unnecessary to issue a White Paper for this purpose.The Cabinet reaffirmed their decision of 22nd June that thetwo main amendments introduced into the Bill by the House ofLords must be rejected by the House of Commons.national insurance(industrial injuries)Act.Supple-mentaryInjuriesBenefitsfor Miners.(previous reference:CM. (48) 42ndConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the memoran-dum by the Minister of Fuel and Power (CP. (48) 156) covering a revised scheme of supplementary injuries benefits for miners. they also had before them a memorandum by the Minister of Pensions(CP. (48) 163) drawing attention to the disparities between thebenefits under this scheme and certain war pensions.The Minister of. Pensions said that, although he had indicated that something might be done for pensioners who were unemployableor had to undergo treatment, he had hitherto resisted all demands for in the standard rates of war pension.   If, however,this supplementary scheme were approved, members of all political parties would support a demand for a general increase in warpensions and it would, in his view, be impossible to avoid concessionscosting between  5 million and  6 million a year. He was particu-larly concerned about the proposal that the young, able-bodiedchildless widow of a miner should receive a supplementary pension of 20s. a week which, added to the standard pension under thegeneral industrial injuries scheme, would give her 40s. a week as compared with the 20s. a week received by an able-bodied childlesswar widow under the age of 40.In discussion Ministers agreed that, in view of the relatively small contribution which the workers would make to the total costOf the supplementary scheme, there would be strong pressure for increases in war pension rates. If such increases were made, theymight well provoke criticism of the standard rates payable underthe general industrial injuries scheme with which the war pensionsrates were closely linked. There might also be demands for increases in the rates of old age pensions and other benefits under the national insurance scheme; and the new principle that under that scheme a young, able-bodied, childless widow should receive an allowance only for a limited period would be jeopardised. For these reasons some ministers were inclined to the view that the Minister of Fuel and power and the Minister of National Insurance should refuse to approve the supplementary scheme, or should at least insist on amendments designed to obtain from the workers a much highercontribution than 12^ per cent, towards the total cost.On the other hand, it was pointed out that it had always beenaccepted that there should be a supplementary scheme for miners,that the Cabinet had already agreed that the workers could not beexpected to contribute as much as 50 per. cent, of the cost of thescheme, and that the individual miner&apos;s contribution of 4c?. a week under the supplementary scheme was equivalent to his contributionunder the general industrial injuries scheme, though the benefits under the supplementary scheme were much less valuable. Thefundamental difficulty was the high accident rate in the miningindustry and it was not unreasonable that account should be taken of this fixing the respective contributions of the worker and the employer.   It was also pointed out that, with the knowledge of
Ministers, the negotiations between the National Coal Board andthe National Union of Mineworkers had already been carriedvirtually to a conclusion and that for the Government at this stage to reject the scheme or insist on radical changes in it would lead to serious trouble with the Union, who had included in the Miners&apos;Charter a supplementary scheme without contributions from theworkers and had only with the greatest difficulty been persuaded toagree to a worker&apos;s contribution of 4e . a week. In comparing thebenefits under this scheme with war pensions it should be rememberedthat war widows with children received family allowances inaddition to a pension of 11s. Od. for each child, and also thatsubstantially higher rates of pension were paid in respect of menabove the rank of private.In further discussion it was agreed that it would be inexpedient to reject the scheme or to insist on a higher contribution from theworkers. It should, however, be possible to secure an adjustmentwhich would remove the disparity between the pension payable tothe young, able-bodied childless widow of a miner and thecorresponding war pension. This modification would remove oneof the major difficulties raised by the Minister of Pensions, thoughit was recognised that there were other features of the scheme whichmight give rise to claims for improvements in the rates of warpensions which would have to be considered.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of National Insurance and the Ministerof Fuel and Power to arrange with the National coal board and the National Union of Mineworkers for a modification of the proposed scheme of supplementaryinjuries benefits for miners which would bring the pension payable to a young, able-bodied, childless widowinto line with the war pension payable to a similarwidow;(2) Subject to Conclusion (1), authorised the Minister of fuel and Power and the Minister of National Insurance to approve the revised scheme of supplementary injuriesbenefits for miners outlined in Annex II to CP. (48) 156.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofSupply (CP. (48) 164) on the export of commercial scrap fromGermany.This showed that, if the United Kingdom steel industry was to achieve the output of 14-75 million tons in the year 1948-49, itwould require 8 - 26 million tons of scrap, of which between 1 - 07 and1 - 44 million tons would have to come from Germany. During thisperiod 1 - 2 million tons of scrap were to be exported from Germany,and of this only 540,000 tons was likely to be allocated to the UnitedKingdom. In addition it was estimated that we should obtain about460,000 tons of booty scrap from Germany. Even if the whole ofthese supplies were received they would not suffice to meet our needs;and it was unlikely that we should be able in practice to obtain thefull amount of commercial scrap allocated to us. It was recommended that a central purchasing mission should be established in Germany to supervise the export of commercial scrap. It wasalso recommended that efforts should be made to persuade the UnitedStates Government that the export of commercial scrap fromGermany should be increased and that a larger share of the increasedtotal should go to the United Kingdom.In discussion grave anxiety was expressed at the situation disclosed in this memorandum. There was general agreement thatthe United States Government should be strongly pressed to supportmeasures for securing for the United Kingdom steel industry alarger quantity of commercial scrap from Germany. An increased output of steel was the largest contribution which the UnitedKingdom could make towards the restoration of Europe&apos;s economy;
shortage of scrap was the factor which limited the expansion of our Isteel output; and it was inconsistent with the whole basis of the IEuropean Recovery Programme that the United States should take Ifrom Germany scrap which might be made available to the United IKingdom steel industry. The Cabinet were informed that on this ipoint the United States Government were subject to political Ipressure from steel interests in the United States; but they considered that the absurdity of the present situation should be Istrongly represented to the United States Administration, and that Iall possible measures should be taken to induce them to agree that jlarger supplies of scrap should be made available to the United eKingdom from Germany. The European representative of the IEconomic Co-operation Administrator might be persuaded to make Irepresentations to his Government on this matter.Other points made in the discussion were (a) There was reason to believe that scrap was being wastefullyused by the German steel industry. It was agreed that, if thetechnical advisers of the Ministry of Supply thought there wassubstance in a report to this effect which had reached the ForeignOffice, the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Supply shouldjointly consider means of preventing the continuance of such waste.(b) Hitherto, one of the main difficulties had been that Germanscrap merchants were unwilling to collect scrap for export, and ithad been hoped that this difficulty would disappear when the german currency was reformed.   It was again suggested that the British jMilitary Governor should take powers to requisition commercialscrap in Germany.   It was pointed out, however, that such action would be inconsistent with past quadripartite decisions and would 1probably lead to difficulties with the United States authorities.   Itwould therefore be preferable to defer considering any such action for a short time, until it could be seen whether, now that the currencyhad been reformed, German scrap merchants would have a sufficientincentive to collect scrap for export.(c) The central purchasing mission which was to be established in Germany to supervise the export of commercial scrap might consider whether it would be advantageous to create an organisationof German scrap merchants for this purpose.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the conclusions summarised in paragraph 4 of cp. (48) 164;(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of supply to concert together plans for increasing the amount ofcommercial scrap to be obtained from Germany for theUnited Kingdom steel industry in the vear July, 1948-June, 1949;(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider how best to enlist the support of the United States Government in these efforts to increase the supply of commercial scrap fromGermany to the United Kingdom.The Cabinet next considered a memorandum by the Minister ofSupply (CP. (48) 160) covering the final report of the ScrapInvestigation Committee appointed in pursuance of the cabinets decision of 2nd February, 1948.The Minister of Supply said that all practicable steps were now being taken to give effect to the recommendations made in this report-1In discussion of the report the following points were raised : 1(d) The international situation had deteriorated since thedecision was taken that the Services should expedite their declara-tions of surpluses; and there was some risk that this decision might now lead to our scrapping some war material which might be of value in re-equipping the armed forces of our allies in the &quot;Western Union.The Minister of Defence undertook to arrange for a report on this report ofInvestigationCommittee.(previous reference:C.M.(48)27thConclusions,Minute 7.)
point to be submitted to the Defence Committee. The Cabinet agreedthat, until this report had been considered, no war material should be scrapped which might be required for the re-equipment of the armed forces of the Western Union Powers.(e) The Cabinet were informed that, as a result of the acceleration in the programme of ship-breaking, very few warshipswould be available for scrapping in 1950. It was explained that bythat time the planned expansion of our pig iron capacity would betaking effect, and it was in the intervening period that the need for(/) Could the Regional Boards assist in improving thearrangements for collecting scrap in the United Kingdom? TheCabinet were informed that, as a result of an intensive campaign,the rate of collection of scrap in this country had already been raised from 70,000 to 90,000 tons a week.(g) The report concluded that there was no ground for anygeneral increase in scrap prices. Was it clear that present pricesprovided a sufficient incentive to induce industrialists to. scrapobsolescent plant? There was reason to believe that a higher rateof plant replacement could be achieved in the cotton industry ifhigher scrap prices were offered for old plant.The Minister of Supply said that he was satisfied, from theadvice available to him, that there was no ground for any general increase in scrap prices. He would, however, consider whether itwas practicable and desirable to introduce a differential scrap price for cotton machinery.The Cabinet-(4) Endorsed the proposals made by the Minister of Supply inhis memorandum (CP. (48) 160) covering the final reportof the Scrap Investigation Committee.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.1st July, 1948.
