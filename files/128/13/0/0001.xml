Industrial 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the latest developments inDisputes.        the strike of London dockers.London Dock The strike had so far been confined to London and efforts to -Workers&apos; bring out dockers in other areas had hitherto failed. It had,Strike. however, spread to the coid:storage workers in London and itmight affect the meat markets. A meeting was to be heid in theAloert Hall that morning at which the General Secretary of theTransport and General Workers&apos; Union would advise the strikersto return to work. The Union leaders had rejected a suggestionthat this meeting should be held in the Victoria Park, but someof the strikers were to hold a meeting there simultaneously withthe other meeting. The General Secretary of the Union was fairlyconfident that the Albert Hall meeting would be successful, but the strikers would probably be reluctant to return to work unless somemove was made which would enable them to do so without lossof face. The Parliamentary Secretary, Minister of Labour, had spoken to the Foreign Secretary, who thought that care should betaken to avoid encouraging the formation of a breakaway union and that there might be a case for reviewing the operation of the disciplinary machinery in the London area. It was therefore suggested that the statement on the situation which was to be madein reply to a Private Notice Question later in the day might include an indication that, if the Union asked for a review of the operationof the disciplinary machinery, the Government would be preparedto assist in this matter.The Cabinet were shown copies of a report by the OfficialEmergencies Co-ordinating Committee on the measures proposed for meeting the situation created by the strike. The general secretary of the Union was not prepared to call for volunteers -to handle the perishable foods now lying in the docks, and it wastherefore recommended that 300 members of the Services shouldbe brought in on 23rd June to remove these goods and that, if thecommercial lorry drivers refused to work with them, 150 Servicelorries and their drivers should also be called in. These men and vehicles were ready for employment at short notice. If the strikecontinued, members of the Services should also be used to movenon-perishable foods; and it was estimated that 4,275 men, 123crane drivers and 120 lightermen would probably be required forthis purpose. The Services could make available the numbers required, but these would include only about 40 trained stevedoresand it would be ten to fourteen days before the Service gangs wouldbe fully effective. It was also estimated that about 3,000 vehicleswith drivers would be required and the Services should be able toprovide this number within the same period. If the strike extendedto the meat market an additional 5,000 men would be needed. TheGeneral Secretary of the Union had agreed that, if the strikecontinued, the Government would have no alternative but to usetroops to load and unload the ships.In discussion there was general agreement that, while the precise terms of the statement to be made later in the day must depend on the result of the Albert Hall meeting, it should give afull account of the course of events and make clear the Government^view that the strike could not be justified. It should not hold out any hope of an enquiry into the operation of the disciplinarymachinery, though it might be appropriate to examine this matterafter the strike was over. Once the ill-feeling connected with thestrike had subsided, the Government might also urge the union to bring home to the workers the benefits which they derived fromthe decasualisation scheme and to impress on them that unjustifiablestrike action would inevitably undermine the scheme.The Cabinet were also agreed that, should the strike continue,all possible steps should be taken to arrange for the movement withthe aid of the Services of cargoes both of perishable and of non-perishable foods.
Pood.Supplies ofCereals.(previous reference:C.M.&apos;(47)84thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister ofFood (CP. (48) 152) and the Minister of Agriculture (CP. (48) 153)on grain supplies for the United Kingdom in 1948-49.The Minister of Food proposed that bread rationing should be abolished from 1st July. To avoid waste, supplies of flour wouldbe restricted to 103,000 tons a week. Bakers would receive alloca-tions based on their consumption of flour in the period beforerationing and 3,000 tons would be kept in reserve to meet exceptionaldifficulties. The Minister also proposed that from 1st Julyoatmeal should be freed from points rationing, that barley productsshould continue unrationed, that 20,000 tons of maize should besubstituted for wheat in breakfast cereals and that the extraction rate should remain at 85 per cent, until 30th June, 1949, unless itwere found possible to obtain more wheat from Russia. In orderto prevent wheat stocks from falling below nine weeks&apos; supply at30th June, 1949, and to reduce the risk of deterioration of the large supplies of coarse grains which would accumulate in the UnitedKingdom up to April 1949, he suggested that the Governmentshould exercise their option to give United Kingdom farmers coarsefrains in place of the 20 per cent, of millable wheat of the 1948arvest which they were expecting to retain.The Minister of Agriculture, while supporting the proposals with regard to bread rationing and oatmeal and barley products,urged that farmers should be allowed to retain 20 per cent, of themillable wheat of the 1948 harvest and proposed that an additional150,000 tons of coarse grains should be made available in order toenable the conditions of eligibility for rations for pigs and poultryto be widened.The Cabinet first discussed the proposal to substitute for bread rationing a system of bulk allocation of flour and to relax the present restrictions On the human consumption Of oatmeal and other cerealproducts. There was general approval of these measures, whichshould lead to a substantial saving in man-power without any appreciable increase in the consumption of cereals. It was felt,however, that it would be inexpedient to announce the changes inadvance of the statement which the Government would have to make on the import programme for 1948-49 as a whole. It was likely that, even with aid from the United States, imports of some com-modities would have to be reduced; and there would be confusion and misunderstanding both at home and abroad if an announce-ment to this effect followed closely on an apparent relaxation ofThe Cabinet-(1) Took note that a full statement on the lines agreed in discussion would be made in the House of Commons later in the .day. :(2) Agreed that arrangements should be made to begin theunloading of perishable food-stuffs, with the aid ofmembers of&quot; the Services and, if necessary, Servicevehicles, from the morning of 23rd June; and that immediate steps should be taken to supplement theavailable troops and Service vehicles to the extentproposed in the report of the Official Emergencies Co-ordinating Committee in order to enable the movementof non-perishable food-stuffs to be undertaken shouldthe strike continue.(3) Invited the Minister of Labour, in consultation with theMinister of Transport, to consider and report whatimprovements could be made in the operation of the dock labour decasualisation scheme and what propaganda infavour of the scheme could be undertaken among the dockers with a view to reducing the risk of furtherdockers&apos; strikes.
the restrictions on the consumption of cereals. The import programme would be submitted to the Cabinet within the next week or two and it should be possible to make an announcement bythe middle of July.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals made by the Ministerof Food in paragraph 6 (i) to (iv) and (vi) of cp. (48) 152; and agreed to consider in connectionwith their forthcoming review of the import programme for 1948-49 the date on which these proposals shouldbe announced and the form of the announcement.(2) Agreed that, when a decision on the date and form of theannouncement had been taken, advance information ofwhat was proposed should be communicated to theGovernments of the United States, Canada and australia.The Cabinet then discussed the proposal- to offer coarse grainsin substitution for the 20 per cent, of millable wheat of the 1948harvest which farmers were expecting to retain for their own use.It was pointed out that the adoption of this proposal would ensure that the United Kingdom would not need to buy additionalwheat in 1948-49 in order to prevent stocks from falling to a dangerous level and that it would be a convenient method of disposing of the temporary surplus of coarse grains.On the other hand, it was recalled that farmers had been ledto believe that they would be allowed to retain 20 per cent, of theirwheat unless there was an acute shortage of wheat for human consumption. It would be necessary to make available 353,000 tonsof coarse grains in return for 265,000 of wheat and an additional cost of  2-^ million would be incurred. Moreover, the estimates ofthe probable stock levels at 30th June, 1949, seemed to have beenmade on pessimistic assumptions : it should be possible to preventstocks from falling much below the level of nine weeks&apos; supply even at the critical period at the end of June. At the same time, it was recognised that on defence grounds it would be desirable tomaintain substantially higher stocks throughout the year.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that farmers should be allowed to retain 20 per cent,of their millable wheat of the 1948 harvest.The Cabinet then discussed the proposal that 150,000 tons of coarse grains should be released in the period up to 30th April, 1949,to enable the conditions of eligibility for pig and poultry rationsto be widened.It was explained that the present large stocks would enablethe wider basis of rationing to be continued for at least a further year and that, even though no supplies were obtained from theArgentine in 1949, there was good reason to hope that enough couldbe secured from Russia and Eastern European countries to justifytaking the risk of widening the basis of rationing. This step wouldbe particularly valuable in encouraging new producers and it would reduce the risk of deterioration of the supplies of coarse grains inthe United Kingdom.The Cabinet (4) Agreed that 150,000 tons of coarse grains should be madeavailable in the period up to 30th April, 1949, to enablethe basis of eligibility for pig and poultry rations tobe widened.(5) Agreed that the Production Committee should iconsiderwhether still further increases in feeding-stuffs rationscould be justified.
BritishNationalityBill.(previous reference:C.M.(48)31stConclusions,Minute 8.)3. The Lord Privy Seal said that, in spite of prolonged con-consultations, the Government representatives in the House of Lordshad been unable to persuade the Opposition leaders to modify theirattitude towards certain features of the British Nationality Bill;and in the Committee Stage on the previous day the Opposition had carried against the Government two important amendments of theBill. The first of these changed the term &quot;citizen of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies &quot; to &quot; British subject of the United King-dom and Colonies.&quot; This was inconsistent with the whole schemeof the Bill, which contemplated that each of the self-governing partsof the Commonwealth would have its own local citizenship, and thatthe term &quot; British subject or Commonwealth citizen &quot; would be reserved as a general description of all citizens possessing localcitizenship of any part of the Commonwealth (save Eire). Thesecond amendment provided that nothing in the Bill &apos;&apos; should affectthe status by British law of a citizen of Eire in respect of his rightto be regarded as a British subject.&quot; This amendment was incon-sistent with Clause 2 of the Bill, which enabled Eire citizens whowere British subjects at the commencement of the Act to retain their status as British subjects only if they made a writtenapplication for that purpose on grounds specified in the Clause.By the first of their amendments the Opposition had under-mined the general scheme which had been evolved in agreement withall other Commonwealth Governments save the Government of Eire.And, by their second amendment, they had similarly underminedthe separate agreement which had been reached with the eire government about the position of Eire citizens who desire to remainBritish subjects. By carrying these two amendments against theadvice of the Government they had done a great disservice to thecause of Commonwealth unity.The Cabinet-Agreed that the House of Commons should in due course be advised to reject these two amendments which the Houseof Lords had made in the British Nationality Bill.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,22nd June, 1948.
