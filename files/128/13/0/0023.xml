1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (48) 228) setting out the recommendations of theMachinery of Government Committee for the appointment of a council for Wales and Monmouthshire.The Lord President reminded the Cabinet that when theestablishment of the Scottish Economic Conference had beenapproved it had been recognised that it would probably be necessaryto appoint a Council for Wales and Monmouthshire which would represent important Welsh interests and focus Welsh opinion on matters affecting Government policy in Wales. The constitutionof the proposed Council, which was shown in Appendix I to cp. (48) 228, took account of the fact that the new body would deal with cultural as well as economic matters. The Welsh RegionalCouncil of Labour, whose avowed aim was to obtain the appointmentof a Minister for Welsh Affairs at some future date, had suggestedthat a Minister of Cabinet rank should preside over the Council,but the Committee were satisfied that this Ministerial chairmanwould find himself in an embarrassing position and that the difficul-ties which would arise between them and other Ministers would strengthen the demand for a Secretary of State for Wales. It was accordingly proposed that individual Ministers of Cabinet rankshould from time to time attend meetings of the Council, the choice of Minister depending on the main subject to be discussed.In discussion the main points raised were : (a) The selection of workers&apos; representatives after consultationwith the Trade Union Committee of the Welsh Regional Councilof Labour would be open to criticism on the ground that this Councilrepresented one political party; and it was agreed that the lord president should consider further what form of consultation on the selection of workers&apos; representatives would be most appropriate.(6) Once the consultations proposed in paragraph 6 of cp. (48) 228 had been carried out, the Minister of Labour mightcommunicate the proposals informally to the Trade Union congress and the British Employers&apos; Confederation so that they should be aware of them before they were published.(c) In discussing the proposals with the Welsh Regional Councilof Labour the Lord President might, if necessary, promise that eachmeeting of the new Council would be attended by a Minister ofCabinet rank. It should be made clear, however, that the council would have no right to summon particular Ministers to their meetings.The Cabinet-(1) Subject to the points recorded in paragraphs (a) and (c)above, approved the recommendation of the Machineryof Government Committee for the establishment of a council for Wales and Monmouthshire and authorised the Lord President to discuss them with the WelshRegional Council of Labour and the Welsh Parliamen-tary Labour Group. .(2) Agreed that, subject to any modifications suggested as aresult of these discussions, the establishment of a council should be be announced during the next annual Welshdebate, unless it seemed desirable to make an earlierannouncement.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (48) 234) reporting the latest developments in thenegotiations with the United States Government on their proposal that the German reparations programme should be reviewed in theinterests of the European Recovery Programme.The Foreign Secretary recalled that, under Section 115 (F) ofthe Economic Co-operation Act, the Economic Co-operation-a b 2
Administration was required to call upon the United States Secre-tary of State to obtain the agreement of the countries concerned that capital equipment scheduled for removal as reparations from thethree Western Zones of Germany should be retained in Germany ifthis would most effectively serve the purposes of the European Re-covery Programme. The Administrator had recently appointed aCommittee to undertake a fresh enquiry to determine what plantsnow scheduled for reparations should be retained in Germany, andthe United States Secretary of State had formally requested that,pending the conclusion of this investigation, the dismantling of plants in the British Zone should be suspended. The Foreign secretary had resisted this request on the ground that, once dismantling hadbeen stopped, it would be impracticable to resume it on any adequate scale, but a discussion which he had had with Mr. Hoffman on 13thOctober had made it clear that certain members of Congress attachedsuch importance to this matter that the second appropriation underthe European Recovery Programme might be seriously prejudicedunless a satisfactory solution could be found. He had accordinglyagreed to propose to the Cabinet that, though there should be no general suspension of dismantling in the British Zone pending thecompletion of the investigation, any dismantling carried out duringthis period should be of such a character as would not prevent the eventual retention in Germany, in the interests of the european recovery Programme, of any plants under review, excluding those already allocated by the Inter-Allied Reparation Agency. In return,Mr. Hoffman had agreed to urge the Committee to give prior atten-tion. to those plants which were already being dismantled, and to thepreparation of a list of plants in which they would have no furtherinterest, in order that such plants might be made available for allocation. It would be necessary to consult the French government before any further communication was made to the United states authorities. The French Foreign Minister had recently made a speech in Germany which suggested that the French Government/attitude on reparations policy had substantially changed, and it seemed reasonable to expect that they would accept the proposals.There was general support for the Foreign Secretary&apos;s recom-mehdations. In further discussion, the following points weremade: &apos;(a) The Minister of Supply said that the retention in germany of certain small steel units, which had been claimed for the UnitedKingdom, might delay to some extent the steel development pro-gramme. He was, however, more concerned at the prospect of delay in the delivery of two hydrogen-peroxide plants which were urgently needed for defence purposes. The dismantling of these plants hadbeen agreed with United States authorities and was now virtuallycomplete, but the plants had not yet been allocated by the Inter-Allied Reparation Agency. Would it not be possible to modify theproposals; so as to enable work to proceed in plants which were inthis position ?It was explained that, since the group of plants which hadbeen dismantled but not allocated were of special interest to theUnited States authorities, they would be unlikely to agree to excludethem from review. The Foreign Secretary would, however, ask Mr.Hoffman to arrange for the Committee to examine the hydrogen-peroxide plants urgently.(&amp;) It was pointed out that the Soviet Government would belikely to protest strongly against any modification of the reparationsprogramme and to press again their claim to reparations from current production.The view of Ministers was that this risk must be accepted andthat the Soviet Government had no real grounds for complaint,since they had failed to give effect to the intentions of the PotsdamAgreement. It Was also agreed that, in view of Western Germany&apos;sparticipation in the European Recovery Programme, there -could beno question of payment of reparations from current production.
31CM. 63 (48)(c) The Minister of Civil A aviation said that it was his personalconviction that the policy of the Western Allies towards germany must now enter a new phase. Hitherto, the principal aim had been to ensure that Germany could not again become a menace to world peace. But the time had come when Western Germany at least mustbe regarded, not as a potential danger, but as a valuable ally againstCommunist aggression.On the other hand, it was pointed out that it would be im-prudent to assume too readily that the restoration of german industry could not constitute a menace to the security of the UnitedKingdom. It would, in any event, shortly be necessary for theCabinet to consider afresh the whole question of future policy towards Germany.id) The other Commonwealth countries had an interest inGerman reparations and should therefore be kept fully informed of developments.The CabineWApproved the proposals contained in CP. (48) 234.3. The Foreign Secretary recalled that arrangements for the reciprocal abolition .of visas had been made with a number of countries. He had considered, in consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Home Secretary, whether a general schemefor the abolition of visas covering the United States and all thecountries participating in the European Recovery Programme mightnot be devised, but he had been advised that this would not be practicable. In view, however, of the importance of the dollartourist traffic in present conditions, he had decided to explore further the possibility &quot; of making special arrangements with the UnitedStates Government. The United States authorities had made itclear that they regarded the existing visa requirements as anessential feature of their immigration control, and there was, there-fore, no prospect of their agreeing to the reciprocal abolition of visas.It might, nevertheless, be advisable, in the interests of the touristtrade, to abolish the existing visa requirements to which UnitedStates tourists visiting this country were subjected, provided thatthe United States Government, for their part, were prepared at least to abolish the charge made for United States visas granted to Britishsubjects. He pointed out that six European countries had abolishedtheir visa requirements without receiving reciprocal concessions from the United States.    &apos; -7 In discussion, some, concern was expressed at the possible effectOn public opinion of arrangements on the lines suggested by theForeign Secretary. .    . -... The Cabinet-,  : - &apos; -&quot;Invited the Foreign Secretary to circulate a paper on his proposal to relieve United States citizens from existingvisa requirements.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofSupply (CP. (48) 227) covering a revised draft of the Iron andSteel Bill and a memorandum by the Lord President (CP. (48) 229)setting out the&quot;views of the Socialisation of Industries Committee on certain points raised in paragraphs 3 to 13 of CP. (48) 227.The Cabinet first discussed the question of the relations betweenthe Minister and the Iron and Steel Corporation.   .The Minister of Supply said that his proposals were based onthe view that the Government must have power to ensure that theiron and steel industry was effectively brought within the&quot; ambit ofthe planning of the nation&apos;s resources. Clause 4 (2) of the Billaccordingly conferred on him power to give specific directions to
the Corporation about the total capacity of the industry, the!quantities, types, qualities and sizes of its products, and the location!of new works, when he considered that such directions were necessary!in the national interest.    He had been advised by the Solicitor-!General that the power to give general directions conferred by 8Clause 4 (1) would enable him to control the total capacity of theindustry and power to give specific directions on this need not,therefore, be taken; nor did he now desire to control the qualities of the industry&apos;s products.   He thought it essential, however, thathe should have power to give specific directions to the corporation should they be unwilling to produce the quantities, types or sizesof particular products which the Government, with their wider view,knew to be required in the national interest.  It would also be better that he should have a positive power to give directions about the location of new works than that he should have to rely on the negativepowers now exercised by the Board of Trade.  The existence of thepower to give specific directions would not weaken the authority ofthe Corporation, for the power would, in fact, seldom or never be]used. But the fact that he had this power would make immeasurablyeasier the task of persuading the Corporation to conform to generalGovernment policy.The Lord President said that the majority of the members ofthe  Socialisation of  Industries  Committee,  including all  theMinisters responsible for socialised industries except the Ministerof Civil Aviation, were satisfied that it would be a mistake to take power to give specific directions to the Corporation on the lines proposed by the Minister of Supply.  The taking of such a power would be contrary to the hitherto-accepted doctrine that socialisedboards could be trusted to act,, by and large, in the national interestand need not be subjected to the same degree of control as private industry; the critics of the Bill would ask why it was necessary toappoint a Corporation at all; and the Minister would find it difficult,if not impossible, to obtain competent persons to serve on the jCorporation.   The Minister had admitted that under the power to jgive general directions, which followed the precedent of earlier!socialisation measures, it would be possible to control the total icapacity of the industry and that the Board of Trade could control 1the location of new works. It had also been admitted that in practice Ithe power to give specific directions would seldom, if ever, be jused? In these circumstances, there seemed to be every disadvantage Iin including in the Bill provisions which would imply that thejCorporation would be unfriendly to the Government and would increase the chances of the Governments being exposed to political pressure on questions of location-   Experience in other industries had shown that the general powers reserved to the responsible ministers, coupled with the friendly relations which should exist between Ministers and boards of socialised industries, were sufficientto ensure that effect was given to Government policy, while at the Isame time preserving a full sense of responsibility in the boards.In further discussion it was urged in favour of taking power togive specific directions that the existence of a power of this kind would greatly strengthen the Ministers hand in his dealings withthe Corporation and would at the same,time make it easier for thelCorporation to yield to the Ministers persuasion. It was incon-&quot;sistent to argue that this would undermine the responsibility of theCorporation if the power to give general directions was to be usedto enable the Government to Control the capacity of the industry. Itmight well be in the national interest for the Corporation to producecertain types of steel which would yield less profit than others or which might even have to be sold at a loss and, unless the minister had the power proposed,-he.might find it difficult to secure this bypersuasion. It was true that the difficulty might sometimes be avoided by Government purchase of the product, but this would not,always be practicable. As regards&apos; the location of new works, theexisting system of negative control inevitably led to delays an
33CM. 63 (48)seemed wrong that the Government should not have positive powers in the case of developments of large economic and social conse-quence. The failure to take specific power of direction would notappreciably mitigate the oppposition to the Bill and might wellexpose the Government to criticism from their own supporters.In reply it was argued that to take power to give specific direc-tions was inconsistent with the appointment of a Corporation, wouldbe fatal both to its efficiency and sense of responsibility, and would impose on the Minister an impossible task. It was right that theCorporation should conform to any general plan for the disposition of the nation&apos;s resources, but this should be secured by bringing the Corporation into full consultation at an early stage in the formulation of the plan and by the use of the general powers ofcontrol conferred by the Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers)Act. It would be most undesirable to detract from the Board ofTrade&apos;s responsibility for location of industry, and experience had shown that, though the existing power of control was negative,industrialists were in fact willing to accept positive suggestionsfrom the Government. ,The prevailing view was that the Bill should not confer onthe Minister the power to give specific directions given in clause 4 (2).The Cabinet then had a preliminary discussion on the questionwhether the Iron and Steel Bill should be so framed as to enablethe assets of the present iron and steel companies to be transferredto the Corporation before the general election in 1950.The Minister of Supply explained that under the procedure adopted in previous socialisation measures the order appointing aday for the transfer and the regulations relating to the appointmentof a representative of the stockholders and determining how thenew stock of the socialised undertaking was to be held and dealtwith were subject to annulment by Parliament. If this procedurewere followed it would be possible for the House of Lords to hold upthe process of transfer until the general election. To get over this difficulty the draft Bill had been so framed as to make the orderappointing a day for the transfer not subject to parliamentary approval and the.two sets of regulations had been incorporated inthe 5th and 7th Schedules. Thus it would be possible for the Govern-ment, should they desire, to carry out the transfer within two orthree months of the Royal Assent to the Bill.In discussion the following points were made : (a) It would probably prove impracticable in the event to effect the transfer before the general election. There was, therefore, little to be gained by including in the Bill provisions which might be criticised as an attempt to evade the verdict of the electorate.(b) The proposal to include in the 5th and 7th Schedules matter which in previous measures had been left to be dealt with by regu-lations was unlikely to be criticised.(c) The possibility of making the proposed order subject toannulment by the House of Commons only might be considered.The Cabinet- &quot;(1) Agreed that Clause 4 (2) of the draft Iron and Steel Billannexed to CP. (48) 227 should be deleted.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of the question raised in paragraphs 14 to 22 of CP. (48) 227 at an early date.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th October, 1948.
