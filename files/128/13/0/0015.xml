1. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord President(CP. (48) 195) covering drafts of The King&apos;s Speeches on the prorogation and Opening of Parliament prepared by a Committeeof Ministers under his chairmanship.The Lord President said that the Committee were- grateful tothe Lord Chancellor for Undertaking the preparation of a draft ofthe Prorogation Speech. It would be necessary to revise the drafts of both Speeches in the light of events during the recess; and reviseddrafts would., if necessary, be circulated to the Cabinet for final approval early in September. Meanwhile, he hoped that hiscolleagues would approve the drafts, subject to a number of minor amendments to the Prorogation Speech which had been suggestedsince CP. (48) 195 had been circulated.The following points were made in discussion : (a) A reference to the trade agreement with Eire should beincluded in the Prorogation Speech if the agreement had been signed before the Speech was delivered.(b) It was contemplated that in the short session in september and October the House of Commons would adjourn after disposing of the debate on the Address and the Parliament Bill unless any important or urgent matters for debate arose. Meanwhile,suggestions for debates in either House during this session shouldbe discouraged.The Cabinet-(1) Approved, subject to minor amendments, the draft Speechesannexed to CP. (48) 195, and agreed that the lord president should settle with the Prime Minister anyfurther amendments which it might seem desirable tomake in these drafts before they were delivered.(2) Took note that, if any substantial amendments should haveto be made, revised drafts of the Speeches would besubmitted for the Cabinet&apos;s approval early in September.civil Aviation.        2.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memorandum(Previous       by the Lord Privy Seal (CP. (48) 179) reporting the results of the reference:      review of the civil aircraft programme made by the Civil AviationCM. (48)51st   Committee. They also had before them a memorandum by the PrimeConclusions,    Minister (CP. (48) 191) covering the report of the CommitteeMinute 4.)      appointed, under the chairmanship of Mr. J. Hanbury-Williams, to enquire into the procedure for ordering civil aircraft, and a memo-randum by the Minister of Supply (CP. (48) 194) commenting onthat report.At their meeting on 15th July the Cabinet had deferred a finaldecision on the long-term civil aircraft programme until they hadreceived the report of the Hanbury-Williams Committee. Ministersnow agreed that the long-term programme recommended inparagraph 15 (1) to (3) of CP. (48) 179 should be approved. Itwas pointed out, however, that, if the Airways Corporations weregiven greater freedom in placing orders under the procedurerecommended by the Hanbury-Williams Committee, they might notbe willing to accept, all the types now included in that programme.If, therefore, that procedure was adopted, it could not be applied. fully to types already ordered, and a clear understanding would haveto be reached with the Corporations that any future decision againstbringing any of these types into operation would have to be takenjointly by the Government and the Corporation concerned. It wouldalso have to be made clear that the Corporations would not be free,without the agreement of the Government, to depart from the &apos;&apos; flyBritish &apos;&apos; policy.The Cabinet then proceeded to a preliminary discussion of thequestions of principle raised in the report annexed to CP. (48) 191&apos; j       on the procedure for ordering civil aircraft for the airways corporations.35897 b 2Parliament.King&apos;sSpeecheson theProrogationand Openingof Parliament.(previous reference:CM. (47) 80thConclusions,Minute 3.)
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he did not dissent from the Committee&apos;s conclusion that the Corporations should beallowed to place production orders by direct negotiation with the manufacturers. He was, however, strongly opposed to the furtherproposal that the Corporations should be left with a similardiscretion in the ordering of prototypes. In his view, this proposalmust have one of two consequences : either it would put an end tothe effective development of civil aircraft in this country or it wouldresult in a waste of public funds. On this point the Committee^recommendations went substantially beyond the proposals putforward by the Corporations themselves, who had suggested that theMinistrv of Supply should place orders for prototypes afterconsultation with the Aircraft Requirements and ContractsCommittee, and he thought that the Government should not agree togo further than this.There was general support for this view. The airways corporations were primarily concerned with operating their services on a commercial basis, and they would therefore be inclined to favouraircraft which had already been proved rather than to develop new types which could not come into operation for several years. Inthe past, they had shown little interest in developing new types; andif the full responsibility for ordering prototypes was transferred tothem our prospects of producing new and competitive types of civil aircraft were likely to be prejudiced. The Committee&apos;s proposal would also result in a dangerous and wasteful diffusion of responsi-bility for research and development work on aircraft. It would be inadvisable, at the present stage of growth of aeronautical science,to create an artificial separation between the authorities responsiblefor developing new types of civil and military aircraft; nor was itdesirable that the Airways Corporations should be encouraged tobuild up an extensive organisation for technical research whichwould duplicate the organisation already in existence in theMinistry of Supply.Ministers therefore considered that a small body of officialsrepresenting the Treasury, the Ministry of Supply and the Ministryof Civil Aviation should consider and report on the practical!implications of adopting the procedure recommended by the&quot;Hanbury-Williams Committee for ordering production types; thepractical implications of adopting the procedure recommended bythe Airways Corporations for ordering prototypes; and the stage inthe development of a prototype aircraft at which it might be opento an Airways Corporation to place a production order.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendations made in paragraph 15 (1)-(3) of CP. (48) 179 regarding the long-term civil aircraft programme.(2) Agreed that a Committee of officials representing theTreasury, the Ministry of Supply and the Ministry ofCivil Aviation should be appointed to consider andreport on (i) the practical implications of adopting the]procedure recommended by the Hanbury-WilliamsCommittee for ordering production types of aircraft andiof the procedure recommended by the Airways Corpora-tions for ordering prototype aircraft, and (ii) the stage in the development of prototype aircraft at which theAirways Corporations might be free to place production orders.(3) Agreed to resume discussion of the recommendations madein the report annexed to CP. (48) 191 when the Socialisa-tion of Industries Committee had been able to consideithem in detail in the light of the report of the official committee to be appointed under Conclusion (2) above!(4) Agreed that,.if it should be decided to permit the Airway!Corporations to buy production aircraft by direct negoltiation with the manufacturers, it should be stipulate
that any future decision against bringing into operation the types covered by the long-term programmes approvedunder Conclusion (1) above, or any proposal to departfrom the &quot;fly British&apos;&apos;. policy, should not be taken without the concurrence of the Government.3. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister ofPensions (CP. (48) 192) and the Minister of National Insurance(CP. (48) 196) dealing with proposals for increases in certain warpension rates.The Minister of Pensions reminded the Cabinet of the pressure,particularly from the Opposition, for improvements in war pension rates. This had been intensified as a result of the decision to approve a scheme of supplementary injuries&apos; benefits for miners,and it would, in his view, be difficult to resist some increase in the basic rate of disablement pension. TIig modest increase of 5/- aweek proposed by him was not based on grounds of need but on theprinciple that it was the duty of the State as employer to make some provision for persons injured in its service corresponding tothe supplementary schemes which had been, or might be, made byother employers. He was also satisfied that on merits the rate ofunemployability supplement should be raised; that treatment allow-ances should be granted where other-rank war pensioners wereineligible for sickness benefit, or eligible for it only at a reduced rate, and that the rate of pensions for widows who were over 40or were invalids or had children should be raised to 40/- a week.He hoped the Cabinet would authorise - him to announce theseproposals in the debate which was due to take place later in the day.In discussion the following points were made :- -(a) It was unfortunate that the Cabinet should be called uponto take decisions on particular proposals for increases in rates ofbenefit or pension without being able to see the consequences of granting these, increases. Indeed, it seemed desirable that thereshould be a comprehensive review in order to determine whether too much of the national income was not being devoted to social servicepayments.(&amp;) It had never been admitted that war pension rates were fixed on the basis of need, and the Minister of Pensions shouldresist any attempt to establish this principle.(c) The Minister should also reject any suggestion that, because a supplementary injuries&apos; scheme for miners on a contributory basishad been approved, the Government were under any obligation tomake increases in war pension rates.(d) The war pension rates paid to ex-privates already comparedfavourably in many respects with those payable to miners, even when allowance was made for the miners&apos; supplementary benefits.Moreover, as ex-officers or warrant officers, many war pensionerswere in receipt of much higher pensions, and 94 per cent, of all war pensioners were employed.(e) There was general agreement that an increase in the rate ofunemployment allowance from 20/- to 30/- could be justified andthat treatment allowances should be paid to war pensioners who wereineligible for sickness benefit or eligible for it only at a reduced rate.The Minister of Pensions should, however, discuss with theChancellor of the Exchequer whether treatment allowances shouldnot be restricted to men with dependants who suffered a loss of earnings on undergoing treatment.(/) It was agreed that the pensions payable to widows of the1914-18 war should be increased. But the proposal made inparagraph 13 (4) of CP. (48) 192 went far beyond this, and theMinister of Pensions should reconsider it with a view to. limiting the increase to those widows who were suffering hardship;(g) Small earnings by disabled men in employment weredisregarded and special arrangements had been made to provide
White fish industry.. (previous reference erence:C.M.(47)95thConclusions,Minute 6.)them with transport to their work. But the Minister of Pensionsmight consider whether anything further could be done for thisCictSS\h) It was suggested that any general campaign by theOpposition in favour of widespread increases in war pension ratesmight be countered by suggesting that such increases should be borne out of a special tax on higher incomes. Against this, however, itwas pointed out that there would be serious practical difficulties inany such scheme. *(i) In the debate in the House of Commons later that day theMinister of Pensions should arrange to speak first. He should review what had been done for war pensioners both by the&apos; present government and by their predecessors and should emphasise that war pension rates were constantly being adjusted to meet cases of real hardship. He should then announce that it had been decidedto change the rate of unemployment allowance to 30/- and to paytreatment allowances. He should make no reference to the proposalto improve the pensions of widows of the 1914-18 war, but should indicate that the Government intended to continue their policy of keeping war pension rates under review.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the unemployment supplement payable to war pensioners should be raised from 20/- to 30/- a week andthat treatment allowances should be paid to war pensioners who were not eligible for sickness benefit orentitled to it only at a reduced rate, on the understandingthat the Minister of Pensions would discuss with theChancellor of the Exchequer the possibility of restrictingsuch allowances to men with dependants who suffered a loss of earnings through undergoing treatment.(2) Invited the Minister of Pensions to submit to the lord presidents Committee proposals for improving thepensions payable to widows of the 1914-18 war.(3) Agreed that in the House of Commons debate later in theday the Minister of Pensions should take the line indi-cated in paragraph (i) above, and should, if necessary,reject any claims that war pension rates ought to be fixed on the basis of need, or that the Government were under an obligation to increase war pension rates because theyhad approved a supplementary injuries scheme for miners.(4) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to arrange for the lord presidents Committee to review the arrangements for determing changes in the rates payable under thevarious schemes of social security, including the warpensions scheme, with a view to ensuring that in considering any such changes Ministers were fully aware of the consequences of adopting them.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (48) 197) reporting the conclusions reached by a ministerial Committee appointed by the Prime Minister to examinecertain proposals for the reorganisation of the white fish industry!made by &quot;the Fisheries Ministers and the Minister of Food. TheyJalso had before them a memorandum by the Fisheries Ministers(CP. (48) 198) criticising the recommendations made in CP. (48) I9ron the ground of their inadequacy and objecting to the proposal than White Fish Executive should be established.The Lord President said that the recommendations made iiiCP. (48) 197 had the support of all the independent members of theCommittee and of the Minister of Food. It had not been found possible to accept the proposal of the Fisheries Ministers for thfjestablishment of a White Fish Production Board, though it wa^
recognised that later experience might strengthen the case for a body of this kind. Legislation would be required to give effect tothe Committee&apos;s recommendations and the provisional programme for 1948-49 prepared by the Future Legislation Committee madeallowance for this.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that therecommendations made in CP. (48) 197 were wholly inadequate and,in particular, would not enable the urgent task of rehabilitating thenear and middle waters fishing fleet to be carried out. This being so, the introduction of legislation based on these recommendations would, in his view, damage the prestige of the Government.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, while he regretted that the original proposals put forward by the Minister ofAgriculture and himself had not been approved, he was preparedto accept the recommendations of the Committee, on the under-standing that these might have to be supplemented later on in thelight of experience.In discussion there was general agreement that, although therecommendations of the Committee did not provide for a radicalreorganisation of the white fish industry on the lines originally proposed by the Fisheries Ministers, they were in themselves usefuland there was no reason to suppose that Parliament would regard them as wholly ineffective.Other points in discussion were : (a) While it was desirable that a joint committee of officials of the Fisheries Departments and the Ministry of Food should beestablished to co-ordinate the exercise of those functions whichwould have to be discharged centrally, it would be misleading to give this committee the title of White Fish Executive or to make anyspecial announcement about its establishment.(b) The possibility of making the Ministry of Food responsiblefor the catching as well as the distributive side of the fishing industry might have to be considered at a later date.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the preparation of legislation to confer thepowers listed in paragraph 3 of CP. (48) 197.(2) Agreed that the exercise of the functions of the FisheriesDepartments and the Ministry of Food relating to thewhite fish industry should be co-ordinated through ajoint committee of officials of these Departments, butthat this committee should not be given the title of WhiteFish Executive.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th July, 1948.
