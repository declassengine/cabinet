Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.1. The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business to be taken in the House of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet discussed who should speak on the Government^behalf in the debate on the Second Reading of the National service bill on 1st December. Although this Bill was concerned with theadministration of the call-up, which fell within the jurisdiction ofthe Minister of Labour, the case for the changes proposed in theBill rested on broad grounds of defence policy and it was likely that the debate would range widely over the general question of our defence preparedness. The Cabinet therefore agreed that the SecondReading of the Bill should be moved by the Minister of Defence,who would say that the Minister of Labour would be preparedto intervene at an appropriate stage in the debate to deal with anytechnical questions which might be raised; that the Minister ofLabour should speak during the course of the debate, if required;and that the Secretary of State for War should reply to the debate.The Cabinet were informed that it was intended to hold a one-day debate on Foreign Affairs in the near future, probably duringthe week beginning 6th December.Common-wealthRelations.Eire.(previous reference:CM. (48)75thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet had before them (i) a note by the Secretary(CP. (48) 280) covering copies of telegrams from other Common-wealth Governments commenting on the terms of the statement tobe made in the Parliament at Westminster on the forthcomingrepeal of the Eire Executive Authority (External Relations) Act,1936; and (ii) a note by the Prime Minister (CP. (48) 278) covering a revised text, of that statement prepared in the light of the comments received from other Commonwealth Governments.The Secretary of the Cabinet also read out, at the PrimeMinisters request, the relevant part of the speech which the PrimeMinister of Eire had made in the Dail on the previous day whenmoving the Second Reading of the Bill for the repeal of the external relations Act.The Prime Minister said that there seemed to have been nothing in Mr. Costello&apos;s speech which called for any further amendmentof the draft statement annexed to CP. (48) 278; and, subject tothe views of the Cabinet, he proposed that statements in those terms should be made in both Houses of Parliament that afternoon. Inpursuance of the Cabinefs decision of 22nd November, he had informed the Leaders of the Opposition Parties in the House ofCommons of the course of the discussions with Eire Ministers andhad given them a broad indication of the lines of the statement whichwould be made on behalf of the United Kingdom Government.In discussion of the draft statement the following points were raised : \(a) The reference to consultation with Northern Ireland, in the fifth paragraph of the draft, should be transferred to the end of thefourth paragraph and amended so as to read as follows : &quot;I havealso discussed this matter personally with the Prime Minister ofNorthern Ireland and informed him fully of the position.&quot;(&amp;) The third sentence in the fifth paragraph of the draft shouldbe amended so as to read : &apos;&apos; They regret that Eire will then nolonger be a member of the Commonwealth.&quot;(c) What was the significance of the statement, in the final paragraph of the draft, that Commonwealth citizens in Eire would receive comparable &quot; treatment to that accorded to Eire citizensin Commonwealth countries? It was explained that it was not intended, or desired, that the treatment should in all cases be identical. Thus, Commonwealth citizens could not be given the franchise in Eire without amendment of the Eire Constitution; but even if it were desired to deprive Eire citizens of the franchise inthe United Kingdom it might be found to be administratively
impracticable to do so. The essence of the plan was that the rightsconceded by one country to the citizens of another should be broadlycomparable, taken as a whole.(d) What could be said in reply to the supplementary questionswhich were likely to be asked about the position of Irish loyalists ?It was pointed out that their position would not be prejudiced inany way by the adoption of the policy announced in the statement.Their rights under section 2 of the British Nationality Act, 1948,would not be affected.In further discussion the point was made that the Governmentsof Canada and New Zealand seemed to have received this policy with less enthusiasm than had been shown by their representatives inthe discussions with Eire Ministers. The Cabinet were informedthat further explanations would doubtless be given to those Govern-ments by their Ministers who had taken part in the most recent discussions in Paris: and, as a result, the initial reactions of those governments might be modified to some extent.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the draft statement annexed to CP. (48) 278,subject to amendment on the two points noted in para-graphs (a) and (6) above.(2) Agreed that statements in these amended terms should bemade that afternoon by the Prime Minister in the Houseof Commons and by the Lord Chancellor in the Houseof Lords3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Commonwealth Relations (CP. (48) 281) covering copiesof telegrams from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations and the Minister of State regardingCeylon&apos;s application for membership of the United Nations.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said thathe had thought it advisable to bring to the notice of the Cabinetthe representations which he had received from the parliamentary under-Secretary of State regarding the Government&apos;s policy inthis matter. It was clear that the Soviet Union would continue toexercise her right of veto on Ceylon&apos;s application so long as OuterMongolia was refused admission to the United Nations. In the telegrams annexed to CP. (48) 281 attention was drawn to theserious effects which this situation might have on Ceylon&apos;s attitudetowards her membership of the Commonwealth, and it was suggestedthat it might be advisable to try to reach a settlement with the SovietGovernment covering all outstanding applications for membership.The Minister of State had dissented from this suggestion, and had pointed out that China would in any event be likely to veto OuterMongolia&apos;s application, whatever decision the other members of theSecurity Council might take. While he recognised that adherence to our present policy might have serious consequences, the Secretaryof State thought it would be a mistake to attempt to evade them at the expense of basic principles on which the United Nations hadbeen founded. Outer Mongolia fulfilled none of the conditions for membership of the United Nations : it was wholly under Sovietcontrol and had no direct relations with the outside world. More-over, an agreement on the lines proposed would be incompatible with the general principles laid down in the Advisory Opinion givenby the International Court of Justice in May last oh the conditions for admission to membership of the United Nations. It was unreasonable for the Ceylon Government to blame the UnitedKingdom Government for this situation. The whole position hadbeen fully discussed at the meeting of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters in October, when it had been made clear to the Prime
MilitaryTraining(Faculties)Bill.(previous reference:C.M.(47)93rdConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Parlia-mentary U nder-Secretary of State for War (CP. (48) 274) covering the draft of a Military Training (Facilities) Bill.The Parliamentary U nder-Secretary of State for Warexplained that the Bill was required to bring up to date the pro-visions of the Military Manoeuvres Acts, 1897 and 1911. The advent of compulsory national service and of mechanised forces made itimpossible to rely for training purposes on the Military ManoeuvresActs, which were designed to meet the needs of a small regular army which held set manoeuvres over a fairly wide area for a short period of the year. It was now necessary to have training facilities in all parts of the country and at all times of the year. The bill was needed partly to enable land to be used for the purposes of territorial Army training and partly to enable troops to bivouacon land on the way to regular training areas. Defence Regulation 52was at present used for these purposes, but that would cease tobe available at the end of 1950. The terms of the Bill had beendiscussed with officials of all the. Departments concerned, and agreement had been reached on all save two minor points whichwere set out in paragraph 21 of the memorandum.In discussion, attention was drawn to the sweeping characterof the powers which the Service Departments sought to take underthe Bill. Subject to certain safeguards relating to the manner inwhich land could be used, notably by tracked vehicles, the Billenabled the military authorities to use any land on giving forty-eight hours&apos; notice. It was true that compensation would be payable for damage done, and that the War Office proposed to safeguard theposition of arable land; but there would be strong criticism,especially in the House of Lords, about the wide powers that werebeing taken, and this criticism would not be allayed by the assurance that on most occasions the facilities desired would be secured by negotiation with the occupiers of the land. It would have been preferable, if it had been practicable, to proceed by amendment ofthe Military Manoeuvres Acts rather than by taking entirely freshpowers.Minister of Ceylon that the General Assembly would be invitedto pass a resolution asking the Security Council to reconsider their decision on Ceylon&apos;s application. Every effort would be made tosecure the widest support for any such resolution; and we shouldalso ensure that Ceylon was invited to co-operate fully in the workof the Specialised Agencies. The position might, however, be furthercomplicated if, as was now understood, Dr. Evatt sought to find asolution by general agreement.In discussion, some Ministers expressed concern at the possible consequences of Ceylon&apos;s continued failure to secure membership ofthe United Nations, and it was argued that the admission of OuterMongolia would place no greater strain on the principles of theUnited Nations than that of the Ukraine. Might there not be something to be said for Dr. Evatt&apos;s suggestion that a generalagreement should be sought on the disposal of all outstandingapplications? The general view of Ministers was, however, that acceptance of this proposal would involve a radical change of policy,which could not be justified in the light of the recent ruling of theInternational Court of Justice.The Cabinet-Agreed that no attempt should be made to reach a generalagreement with the Soviet Government on outstandingadmissions for membership of the United Nations.
The Cabinets(1) Invited the Secretary of State for War to consider, in thelight of the discussion, whether it would be possible to incorporate in the Military Training (Facilities) Billany of the safeguards contained in the MilitaryManoeuvres Acts and any of the administrative restric-tions which he proposed to impose on the use of the newpowers by military authorities.(2) Agreed that the Legislation Committee should examine thedraft Bill, with any amendments made in pursuance of conclusion (1) above, and that the matter should then befurther considered by the Cabinet.Housing Bill. 5    The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of(Previous Health (CP. (48) 275) and the Lord Privy Seal (CP. (48) 279) on reference- the question whether the grants to be provided under the proposedCM. (48) 64th Housing Bill for the improvement of houses should be available mConclusions, . respect of tied cottages.Minute 1.) In support of the view that grants should not be made tor theimprovement of tied cottages, it was argued that a tied cottageshould be regarded as part of the industrial unit to which itbelonged, whether farm, railway or colliery, and should be improvedat the expense of the owner of that industrial unit. Many farmerscould well afford to make these improvements, as evidenced by thefact that in many parts of the country they were buying cottagesfor occupation by farm workers. It was at any time open to theowner of a tied cottage to change the contractual relationship tothat of an ordinary tenancy : and, if grants were not available for improving such a cottage, the fault would lie with the owner who.refused to create a tenancy. If grants were made available for theimprovement of tied cottages, many rural councils would devotelabour and materials to this work to the detriment of the construc-tion of new houses. The Labour Party Conference in 1947 and 1948had voted against the system of tied cottages, and the government might find it difficult to convince their supporters that the systemof tied cottages should be buttressed by providing from public fundsgrants for their improvement. At a discussion on housing in theLord Presidents Committee on 7th May, 1948 (L.P. (48)8th Meeting, Minute 5), an effort had been made to devise a formof safeguard under which payments might be made in respectof theimprovement of tied cottages, but this had not proved to be practicable.On the other hand, it was argued that it would be indefensibleto make grants for the improvement of some cottages in a ruralcommunity while adjacent cottages were not improved because theywere tied. The benefits of improvement would be enjoyed by the occupiers of the cottages and not by the owners, and it would be politically difficult to maintain the position that agricultural workers could be left under unsatisfactory housing conditions whileother occupiers benefited from the new proposals. The Governmentwere spending large sums on the furtherance of their agricultural policy, but that policy might to some extent be stultified if adequatesteps were not taken to improve the housing of agricultural workers.It would be many years before there were enough local authorityhouses in rural areas to meet agricultural needs, and there were many isolated farms for which it would be unreasonable to expectI local authorities to build houses. The provisions for grant wouldbe so framed as to ensure that the owner of the house derived no benefit from them; and many of the smaller farmers were not in aposition, even if they were so minded, to carry out improvementswithout financial assistance.  It was no answer to sav that a farmer
123CM. 76 (48)could qualify for grant by creating an ordinary tenancy, since ifhousing accommodation was not available for his workers the farmmight become unworkable. Under the Housing (Financial- and miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1946, assistance could be given forthe construction of a house to be let under a tenancy agreementallowing possession to be obtained without proof of alternative accommodation, and it would be anomalous if public money couldbe spent on building such houses but not on improving them wherethey existed already. While, admittedly, there was strong feeling among many Government supporters against tied cottages, the tradeunions concerned were not unanimous in their views on the subjectof grants for their improvement.The general feeling of the Cabinet was that the question of grants for improving tied cottages could be separated from the controversy over the tied cottage system. Even in regard to thissystem, it was pointed out that in present conditions a tied cottagehad become a privilege and that the Government found it necessary,in order to secure labour for agriculture and mining, to make it acondition in certain cases that houses should be let only to these classes of workers. Similarly, the Forestry Commission ownedhouses for the exclusive use of their workers. The offer of housing accommodation, along with employment, was a powerful inducementat a time when both housing and labour were scarce.The Cabinet then discussed whether it would be practicable to distinguish, among tied cottages, between those which were occupiedas part of a contract of service and those which were let on a tenancyagreement allowing possession to be obtained without proof of alternative accommodation. It was the general view of ministers that grants might reasonably be made in respect of improvements in the second type of tied cottage. Cottages occupied as part of a contract of service were often in a bad state of repair and requiredimprovements; but the contract was objectionable since it enabled the owner to evict the occupier at very short notice. It was argued that it was reasonable to make it a condition of grant that thereshould be a tenancy agreement. It was pointed out, however, that land owners and farmers were often reluctant to change from a contract of service to a tenancy agreement because of the substantialdelays which might occur before they secured possession of thecottage under the latter arrangement. The Ministry of Agriculturefavoured an arrangement under which the Ministry of Health would only make a grant in respect of the improvement of a cottageoccupied as part of a contract of service if it was unreasonable inall the circumstances to create a tenancy. Here, again, the difficulty was that the unwillingness of the land-owner or farmer to change from one system to the other would penalise the occupier of thecottage, who would have no redress except the threat to remove toother employment.The general feeling was, however, that the aim should be tomake the payment of grants depend, so far as possible, on thecreation of a tenancy agreement. Labour and materials should,however, be made available to owners of cottages occupied as partof a contract of service who were prepared to effect improvementsat their own expense.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that in principle grants for the improvement of tiedcottages should be limited to those let on a tenancyagreement.(2) Invited the Minister of Health, the Secretary of State forScotland and the Minister of Agriculture to considerwhether there were any limited classes of case in which,because of potential hardship to the occupier, it wasnecessary to make grants to cottages occupied as part ofa contract of service.
Germany.WesternFrontiers.(previous reference:C.M.(48)39thConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (48) 250) covering the report of the working partyset up by the Six-Power Conference on Germany to consider the benelux and French territorial claims on Germany and the futureboundaries of the Saar territory.The Cabinet were informed that, while the Foreign secretary had originally been prepared to support the Benelux claims, he feltthat, once there was no longer any hope of a Four-Power settlement,territorial claims on Western Germany ought to be restricted tominor frontier rectifications which would involve no appreciableloss to the German economy and could be defended on their meritsas eliminating local anomalies. The working party had examined the claims on this basis; and it was now proposed that their recommendations on frontier rectifications and special frontierarrangements, as set out in Parts I, II and III of their report,should be accepted. The frontier rectifications proposed wouldinvolve the transfer of no more than 128 square kilom. with a population of about 17,000 persons; and special provision was proposed to prevent the indiscriminate expulsion of the poulation.The working party had also been authorised to consider thefuture frontiers of the Saar, and they had now recommended thatthese should be fixed as determined by the French Government on 6th June, 1947. The Foreign Secretary proposed that this recom-mendation should also be accepted.In discussion, some doubt was expressed whether the british representatives on the working party ought not to have adopted aless rigid attitude towards the minor territorial claims, set out inPart IV of their report, which had been supported by all the other delegations. In reply, it was pointed out that the British represen-tatives had been instructed to adhere strictly to their terms ofreference. Moreover, they had doubtless felt some responsibility for safeguarding the interests of Western Germany. Experience had,in any event, shown that even minor frontier changes were apt tobe a serious and continuing source of international friction.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals of the working party as set outin CP. (48) 250.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to discuss with the otherGovernments concerned means of giving effect to therecommendations of the working party.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,25th November, 1948.
