Common-wealthRelations.ConstitutionalDevelopmentsin Eire.(previous reference:CM. (48) 71stConclusions,Minute 2.)On 12th November the Cabinet had agreed on amendments to thedraft note to the Eire Government annexed to CP. (48) 262, andhad invited the Attorney-General to show the text of the revisedcommunication to the Prime Minister of New Zealand (Mr. Fraser),the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia (Dr. Evatt) and theCanadian Secretary of State for External Affairs (Mr. Pearson) inParis that afternoon. They now had before them a note by theSecretary (subsequently circulated as CP. (48) 268) covering the revised draft of the note, together with two telegrams, Nos. 390and 391 of 12th November from the Attorney-General reporting the outcome of his talks with Mr. Fraser, Dr. Evatt and Mr. Pearson.Both Dr. Evatt and Mr. Pearson had expressed concern at theproposal to send a note to the Eire Government in these terms.Dr. Evatt had recalled his earlier opinion that emphasis on thepractical difficulties which would arise from the repeal of the EireExecutive Authority (External Relations) Act would prejudice theprospect of reaching a satisfactory settlement of the problem. he himself was not satisfied that the consequences described in the draft note need follow upon the repeal. They would follow if the UnitedKingdom Government repealed section 3 of the British nationality act, 1948, but he was not sure that this section need be repealed.Even if the views expressed in the draft note were correct, it wasin his opinion inopportune to put them forward at this stage, andhe could not associate himself with them. Mr. Pearson had saidthat he would have to consult his Government before expressing any firm views. Mr. Fraser had raised no objection to the despatch ofthe note, but had emphasised that the New Zealand Governmentcould not be associated in any way with it. He had expressedanxiety about the development of events.Ministers first discussed whether it would be advisable, havingregard to these views, to proceed with their original intention of communicating the proposed note to the Eire Government imme-diately, so that it and the Eire aide-memoire of 20th October might receive full publicity before the Bill to repeal the External relations act was introduced into the Dail on 18th November. The publica-tion of these documents would bring home to the people of Eire thepractical consequences of the repeal; and, if Eire Ministers felt lessconfident of public support, they might at least be prepared to adopta more reasonable attitude in determining the date from which thenew Act would take effect. Furthermore, no formal communicationhad so far been sent to the Eire Government on the consequences ofthe repeal of the External Relations Act, and the United KingdomGovernment might subsequently be criticised for having failed to warn Eire Ministers in detail of what these consequences were likelyto be. The Commonwealth Ministers in Paris were looking at this problem from the point of view of their own countries, none of whichhad interests in world trade comparable with those of the UnitedKingdom.^ Against this, it was argued that a further effort ought to bemade to reach agreement with the Commonwealth Ministers on thelegal issues before any formal communication on the lines suggested was made to the Eire Government and, in particular,before further publicity was given to the United Kingdom Govern-menfs attitude on these questions. While it was true that thepractical consequences of the repeal of the External Relations Actwould be more embarrassing to the United Kingdom than to the other commonwealth countries, the fact remained that there were substantial Irish communities in some of those countries and theCommonwealth Governments concerned were, therefore, naturallyanxious that Eire should not secede from the Commonwealth in circumstances which left her with an enduring sense of grievanceagainst the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth countries.Moreover, it was clear that any action which could be taken at thisstage would be unlikely to affect the Eire Governments intention tointroduce this legislation during the following week. wide publicity had been given, after the Chequers talks, to the probableconsequences of the legislation, and the publication of the two notes
would not be likely to have any greater effect in deterring eire ministers at this stage. The important point was to ensure thatthe Act was not brought into force until there had been a sufficientinterval to enable its implications to be fully discussed. When theCabinet had considered this matter on the previous day, ministers had been under the impression that the date of commencement was tobe stated in the Bill itself, but it now appeared that the intention was to provide merely that the Act should come into operation on a date to be appointed by order. The aim should be, therefore, to persuade Eire Ministers to allow a reasonable time for discussionsbefore the Act was brought into operation.It was suggested that it might be advisable to communicate the text of the Legal Opinion annexed to CP. (48) 264 to the eire government in confidence. It was, however, pointed out that this opinion had not been drafted in terms suitable for communication to the Eire Government. Some communication should, however, besent to the Eire Government before the proposed Bill was introduced into the Dail, in reply to their aide-memoire of 20th October. Itwas agreed that an interim reply should be sent to the effect that theUnited Kingdom Government had been giving careful considerationto this aide-r^empire, but were still unable to find any way of over-coming the difficulties which had been fully explained to eire ministers; and suggesting that, if it was impossible for the eire government to postpone the introduction of the Bill, the date to befixed for the commencement of the Act should be such as to providea sufficient interval to enable the full implications to be further discussed.It was further agreed that the next step would be to holdfurther discussions with the Commonwealth Ministers in Paris witha view, if possible, to reaching agreed views on the legal issues involved, and the Cabinet invited the Lord Chancellor and theSecretary of State for Commonwealth Relations to proceed at once to Paris for this purpose. They would doubtless bear in mind thepossibility of obtaining early agreement to the despatch of a message to the Eire Government inviting them to join in further discussionof these problems; and would also consider whether the other commonwealth Governments could be persuaded to represent to the eire Government the advantage of allowing a reasonable intervalto elapse before the proposed legislation was brought into operation.This opportunity should also be taken to hold a preliminary discus-sion with the Commonwealth Ministers on the question of Indiansfuture relations with the Commonwealth on the basis of the docu-ments annexed to CP. (48) 254; and attention should be drawn tothe possible effects on India and other Commonwealth countries ofthe policy adopted in relation to Eire.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to send an interim reply, on the lines agreed in thediscussion, to the aide-memoire of 20th October from the eire Government.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations to proceed to Paris for discussions with the Prime Minister of New Zealand, the deputy Prime Minister of Australia and the CanadianSecretary of State for External Affairs on the legal issues raised by the Eire Governments declared intention to repeal the Executive Authority (External Relations)Act, 1936, and on India&apos;s future relations with theCommonwealth.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,13th November, 1948.
