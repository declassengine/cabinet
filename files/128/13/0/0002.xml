industrial disputes.London DockWorkers&apos;Strike.(previous reference erence:CM. (48) 41stConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinet were informed of the further developments in the strike of London dockers.At Tooley Street all men had returned to work and the Trans-port and General Workers&apos; Union were holding meetings to urgea return to work at the other docks. The sympathetic strike oflightermen had been approved by their Union and representativesof this Union, together with dockers on strike, had sought a meeting with the Prime Minister on the previous day in order to urge theremoval of the penalties which had led to the strike. The PrimeMinister had rejected this request &quot;and it was proposed to maintainthe attitude that there could be no discussion of the strikers&apos;grievances until they had returned to work. According to a policereport, no work was being done except at the Hay&apos;s Wharf group of docks, but if a strong lead were given by the Union the strikerscould probably be induced to resume work. There was evidence thatthe Union had not been sufficiently active in trying to persuade themen to abandon the strike and it was reported that the strikers had expressed resentment at being summoned to attend the Unionmeeting at the Albert Hall. The movement of perishable foods bymembers of the Services was going forward smoothly and arrange-ments were proceeding for bringing in additional troops to handlenon-perishable foods. The Services would have great difficulty in providing aid at other ports than London : there was, however, as yet no sign of any such extension of the strike.The Cabinet-Took note of the position and invited the parliamentary secretary, Ministry of Labour, when he saw the Secretaryof the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union later in the morning, to impress on him the need for the utmost efforts on the part of the Union to bring the strike to an end.Germany.Situationin Berlin.(previous reference:CM. (48) 27thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet were informed that no progress had been madein the quadripartite discussions on the possibility of introducing a single currency for the whole of Berlin, and that early on theprevious day it had been announced that the new currency for theSoviet Zone would be introduced into the whole of Berlin. TheMilitary Governors of the Western Zone had countered this byannouncing that the new currency for the Western Zones wouldbe introduced into the western sectors of Berlin. Early that morning the Soviet authorities had stopped all rail traffic between berlin and the Western Zones and all electricity supplies from the easternto the western sectors of Berlin. It was not yet clear whether these restrictions were designed as a tactical reply to the action taken bythe Western Powers on the currency question or whether they werethe first move in a major offensive to force the Western Powers towithdraw from Berlin. Our Military Governor had been askedfor a full report on the situation and this was expected by noon.The Cabinet recognised that a very serious situation might develop in Berlin; and it was important that the Western powers should take their stand on a position which they were confident ofbeing able to sustain. The Minister of State undertook to arrange that the Foreign Secretary should be fully informed of the situationwithout delay. As soon as the promised report on the situation wasreceived, he would also consider, in consultation with the foreign secretary and the Prime Minister, whether the British military governor in Berlin should be recalled to London for consultationwith Ministers.Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.3. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord President said that at the end of his Statement on business that afternoon he would inform the House of Commons of
the arrangements proposed for holding a short session in the autumnfor the purpose of passing the Parliament Bill for a second time.An identical statement would be made simultaneously in the Houseof Lords. The short session would be opened on 14th September and,if the business on the Parliament Bill could be completed in bothHouses within a fortnight, Parliament would be adjourned on 24thSeptember until 25th October, when it was expected that the session would be brought to an end by prorogation. The session of 1948-49would be opened on 26th October.In connection with the Statement on Business that day theGovernment were likely to be asked when Parliament would be ableto debate the Bilateral Agreement under the Economic Co-operationAct. It was agreed that the Lord President should state, in reply,that negotiations on the text of the Agreement were still proceeding in Washington, but that Parliament would be given full opportunityto debate the text before the Agreement was signed. This might mean that the Agreement could not be signed before 3rd July (thedate after which financial assistance under the Aot could not beprovided to this country unless our Agreement had been concluded),but it seemed preferable to go past that date rather than o-iveParliament inadequate time for the discussion of so vital0 anAgreement.India and pakistan:financial negotiations.(previous reference:CM. (48) 40thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at a meeting ofthe Economic Policy Committee on 21st June (E.P.C.(48) 24th Meet-ing, Minute 1) it had been agreed that in the negotiations with theFinance Minister of India he should not offer to release more than 40 million of the accumulated balances over the next three years.On further consideration, he had come to the conclusion that an offer of this kind would represent too drastic a reduction as comparedwith the amounts made available to India in 1947 and he now wishedto propose a three-year settlement under which the total amount ofaccumulated balances released would be  80 million. There wouldbe no releases in the first year unless the amount in the Indiancurrent account fell below a given level and thereafter we should be committed to release the balances at the rate of  20 million in eachhalf year. Under this agreement it was unlikely that there wouldbe any releases in the first year, since the Indians would not then beable to spend more than the balance available in their current account. He also proposed to agree to make available in the first year, if exceptional reasons were shown, between  10 and  15million in hard currencies. Exports of capital goods from theUnited Kingdom to India would probably continue roughly at the1947 level of  35 to  40 million a year, though it was not intendedto give any firm guarantee of this. He understood that the terms proposed were likely to be acceptable to the Indian Government and,in view of the advantages of making a three-year agreement, he recommonded them to the Cabinet. Corresponding terms would be offered to Pakistan.The Cabinet-Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in his nego-tiations with the Finance Ministers of India and Pakistan,to try to reach settlements on the lines indicated above.EuropeanEconomicCo-operation.(previous reference:CM. (48) 39thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (48) 161) indicating the economic consequences to the United Kingdom if no aid were made available under the European Recovery Programme.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the latest develop-ments in the negotiations on the draft Economic Co-operationAgreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the UnitedStates Government.  The Economic Co-operation Act provided that
each of the participating countries must conclude individual agree-ments with the United States Government by 3rd July, and theUnited States Government had decided that these agreements shouldbe drafted in identical terms for all participating countries. Thefirst draft communicated to the European Governments had beenextensively modified in negotiation and the latest draft, which hadbeen considered by the Economic Policy Committee on 21st June, wasa substantial improvement, both in tone and in substance. Never-theless it still contained certain features which were objectionablefrom the point of view of the United Kingdom, and His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington had been instructed to make every effort to secure further modifications in the draft. The main provisions towhich objection had been taken were : (i) The United Kingdom Government might be required toassist the United States Government to obtain equitable treatment for their commercial interests in countries outside the United  statesfrom which purchases were made with dollars provided under theEuropean Recovery Programme.(li) The United Kingdom Government would be required touse materials bought with aid provided under the Programme only for the purposes specified in the justifications put forward insupport of their requests for aid.(iii) The United Kingdom Government would be subject tounacceptable obligations regarding the use of United Kingdomassets in the United States, unless it were placed on record in an agreed Minute that they had already complied with this require-ment.(iv) The United Kingdom Government would be required toundertake to adopt measures to stabilise its currency, to maintain a valid rate of exchange and to balance its budget, in spite of the assurance already given under Article VII of the Paris Convention.(v) The provision dealing with monopolistic control would beobjectionable, unless it were brought into line with the obligations which His Majesty&apos;s Government had already accepted under theHavana Charter for an International Trade Organisation.(vi) The United States Government proposed to make a public statement implying that, by the general provision for mutual con-sultation under the Agreement, it would be open to them to insist on our consulting with them about exchange rates.(vii) The Article relating to the purchase of raw materials for stockpiling would not be acceptable, unless it were made clearthat the United Kingdom Government could not be called upon topurchase materials for the United States from sources outside theUnited Kingdom and the Colonies.(viii) In connection with the Article relating to the provisionof information, we should require a formal assurance that theUnited States Government would not make requests for detailed information about technical processes.(ix) The period of notice for termination of the agreement should be substantially less than the period of twelve monthsproposed by the United States Government.(x) It was difficult for us to accept the United States proposal that most-favoured-nation treatment should be extended to Japan.The negotiations were still proceeding. Though it did notappear that any material concessions had been made, it was not clear precisely how far the United States authorities were preparedto modify the draft on these points. His Majesty&apos;s ambassador had, however, reported that the other participating countries had now accepted the draft and that, in the circumstances, it was likelyto be published within the next two or three days.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the situation wasvery serious. The Ambassadors message showed that the UnitedKingdom Government could look for no support from the other participating countries in securing a more acceptable draft.   Even
the French Government appeared now to have modified theirattitude^ although it had been understood that they were- anxiousto consult with the United Kingdom Government before reaching a final decision. There was little prospect that the United StatesGovernment would agree to further changes in the draft of theAnglo-American Agreement, once the terms accepted by other participating countries had been made public. On the other hand,His Majesty&apos;s Government would find very great difficulty injustifying to Parliament an Agreement in the terms of the present draft. In his view, they would have to be able to show that theyhad exhausted every possibility of securing more acceptable terms,and he himself thought that a Minister should proceed immediately to Washington to explain the views of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto the United States Administration at the highest level.In discussion, Ministers expressed great concern at the situa-tion which had arisen. Both Parliament and the country mightbe expected to react strongly against the draft Agreement in itspresent form: on the other hand, the economic consequences of refusing aid under the European Recovery Programme, as set outin CP. (48) 161, would be so grave that people in this country would ultimately overlook the circumstances in which it had been rejected. The fact that the United States Government had chosen to impose terms on the United Kingdom identical with those offered to Italy, an ex-enemy country, would gravely damage Anglo-American relations at a time when the unity of Western europe was increasingly threatened by the attitude of the Soviet Govern-ment. Until the Foreign Secretary could be consulted, no finaldecision could be reached on the suggestion that a Minister should visit Washington; but Ministers considered that the views of HisMajesty&apos;s Government should be communicated at once to theUnited States Ambassador for transmission to his Government.The question was also raised whether it would be advisable to informthe Opposition in confidence of the position, before any Ministerwent to Washington.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the present position in the negotiations withthe United States Government on the draft economic co-operation Agreement.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would inform the UnitedStates Ambassador in London of their views on the draft agreement.(3) Agreed that the Economic Policy Committee should consider, in the light of the full report of the negotia-tions which had taken place in Washington on theprevious day, what further steps should be taken to persuade the United States Government to agree to the modification of the draft Agreement.national insurance(industrial injuries)Act.Supple-mentaryInjuriesBenefitsfor Miners.(previous reference erence  :CM. (48) 31stConclusions,Minute 7.)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of fuel and Power (CP. (48) 156) seeking approval in principle for a revised scheme of supplementary injuries benefits for miners, onwhich the National Coal Board and the National Union of Mine-workers had reached provisional agreement. Under this scheme the miners would contribute 4d. a week, which was equivalent to ,12i per cent, of the cost, while the Board&apos;s contribution would be4d. a ton of coal.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that it was disappointingthat the Board had not been able to secure a larger contribution fromthe workers. It had, however, been very difficult to persuade theUnion to agree even to a contribution of Id. a week and some members of the Board itself had taken the view that a lower;contribution would be justifiable. If the Government refused to jendorse the provisional agreement reached between the Board and
the Union there would be a major conflict with the miners and, inall the circumstances, he recommended that the revised scheme shouldbe approved in principle.The Minister of National Insurance said that he had hopedthat agreement might have been reached on a scheme under whichthe workers contribution would be Id. per pound of wages, whichwould have yielded a sum equivalent to a flat-rate contribution ofabout 7d. a week. It seemed clear, however, that the miners couldnot be persuaded to contribute under the supplementary scheme agreater sum than the 4d a week that they would contribute under thegeneral industrial injuries scheme. He would wish to examine thescheme in detail, in consultation with the Minister of Fuel and power, before formal approval was given.In discussion it was suggested that the Government should, sofar as possible, avoid taking direct responsibility for the contents of the scheme, which had been negotiated by the Board as a matterwithin their responsibility : it would then be easier for the Govern-ment to resist claims for equal treatment from other classes. Onthe other hand, attention was drawn to the danger that the boards of socialised industries and their employees might agree onunnecessarily generous schemes. The cost of these would be mainlymet by the consumer and their benefits would discredit the rates paid under the National Insurance Scheme.Other points in discussion were : (a) Active steps had been taken to reduce the high accident ratein the mining industry and there had been a substantial improvementin recent years.(6) There was a disturbing increase in the incidence ofindustrial diseases and the Minister of National Insurance intendedto consult with the Health Ministers on the best means of tacklingthis problem.(c) If the proposed scheme were adopted, the Minister ofPensions would find it difficult to adhere to his policy of resistingdemands for a general increase in war pensions, and other service pensions might also be affected.The Cabinet Agreed to continue their discussion of CP. (48) 156 at anearly meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.24^ June, 1948.
