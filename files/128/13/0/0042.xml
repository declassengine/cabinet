1. The Foreign Secretary outlined the circumstances leading to the military operations undertaken by the Dutch against the republicans in Java. The negotiations between the netherlands government and the Republican leaders for the establishment of an interim Federal Government for Indonesia had broken downbecause the Republicans had wished to retain their army, whereas theDutch had wished it to pass under the control of the Dutch HighCommissioner until it could be incorporated in the army of theFederal Government. He had been endeavouring to bring the two sides together on this point when the Dutch took what they described as police action against the Republic. The Dutch claimed that,while the negotiations were proceeding, there had been a steadyinfiltration of Republicans into the rest of Indonesia, and that considerable numbers of Indonesians who were co-operating withthe Dutch had been murdered.The representatives of the United States and Australia had nowraised the matter on the Security Council; but the exact terms ofthe resolution to be moved by the United States representative werenot yet known. The Foreign Secretary had given instructions that,if the resolution called for a cessation of hostilities, our representa-tive should support it, but that, if it was proposed to apply sanctions,he should seek to secure the postponement of a decision since previousendeavours to apply sanctions had not proved successful. the embargo on the shipment of war-like stores to Indonesia had recentlybeen relaxed to some extent, and instructions had now been given that the machinery for maintaining the embargo should, where necessary, be tightened up.The Prime Minister said that he had received a message fromPandit Nehru asking the United Kingdom Government to supportthe United States resolution on the Security Council. India,Pakistan and Ceylon were proposing to deny port and airportfacilities to the Dutch.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (48) 303) on the Humphrey Committee&apos;s proposalsfor changes in the German reparations programme. They also had before them a further memorandum by the Foreign Secretary(CP. (48) 306) defining the main objectives of the government&apos;s policy towards Germany and summarising the present position ofthe major questions under consideration.In CP. (48) 303 it was recalled that the Humphrey Committeehad been set up by the Economic Co-operation Administrator, inpursuance of Section 115 F of the Economic Co-operation Act, to review the capital equipment scheduled for removal as reparationsfrom the three Western Zones of Germany. It was now, understoodthat the Committee proposed to recommend that, in the interests ofthe European Recovery Programme, 167 out of the 381 plants underreview should be retained in Germany. The effect of their recom-mendations would be to increase substantially the war potential ofa united Germany or of a Power occupying Western Germany; and acceptance of the Committee&apos;s recommendations might for thisreason have serious repercussions in France. It would, however,be desirable to go some way to meet the United States views on thisquestion in the interest of securing an early settlement of the wholereparations question, and the Foreign Secretary therefore sought authority to propose to the United States Government that thenumber of plants to be deleted from the British, French and UnitedStates lists should be reduced from 167 to 117, details of whichwere given in Annex B to CP. (48) 303. He further suggested thathe should be given discretion to agree to the retention in germany of certain further plants, if this should be found necessary in orderB 2
to obtain agreement, provided that a satisfactory agreement could at the same time be reached on the related questions of the prohibi-tion and limitation of- certain German industries and the establish-ment of a Ruhr authority.Discussion turned first on the question whether it was possibleto determine at this stage what our final attitude should be towardsWestern Germany&apos;s future relationship with Western Europe.Should we regard her as a potential ally against Soviet aggression,or should our predominant concern be to render it impossible forher to become once again a menace to world peace or a military assetin hostile hands? Decisions on specific issues, such as that raised in CP. (48) 303, must turn on the basic assumptions of our long-term policy. So long at we were uncertain about the ultimate objectives of our policy, our handling of any such issues tended to be confined to an attempt to find a workable compromise between the divergentpoints of view of the United States and the French Governments.Was it not time to make up our minds about the place which western germany was ultimately to occupy in Europe ?It was pointed out that the* immediate objective of our policy towards Western Germany must be to assist the Germans to achieve a reasonable standard of life. This was the first line of defence against Communist infiltration and was, indeed, the necessaryfoundation for a stable and democratic society. It was essential, too,that Western Germany should become self-supporting: she hadbeen brought within the ambit of the European recovery programme, and every effort was being made to forge enduringpolitical and economic links between her and the other countries of Western Europe. On these aspects of our policy, we were in full agreement with the United States Government; and notableprogress had been made in persuading the French Government of the soundness of this policy. Beyond this, however, there were manyuncertain factors to be taken into account. On the one hand, it was argued that the main danger to world peace for many years to comewas likely to be Soviet Communism rather than German nationalism.From this point of view we should be well-advised to establish astrong and democratic Western Germany as part of our system of defences. By keeping Western Germany in a weak and subordinatecondition, we should damage our own interests; and we might,indeed, be in danger of driving them into the arms of the soviet union. It had been argued that it was dangerous to build upGermany&apos;s industrial capacity in case it fell into Soviet hands; but could it be seriously argued that, under conditions of modernwarfare, industrial plants in France or the Benelux countries were any less vulnerable ? It was not suggested that Germany should beallowed to re-arm; but could not re-armament be prevented more effectively by controlling the finishing end of the engineering industry rather than the basic industries essential to peace-time production ? On the other side, it was argued that there could beno certainty that Western Germany would in due course take herplace beside the liberal and democratic countries of western europe. There had recently been disturbing signs of a resurgentnational! sm in Germany, and our policy could not altogether ignore the possibility that she might once again become a serious menace to world peace. For this reason, the policy of Western Union andof the Atlantic Pact should be based on the assumption that germany must remain militarily weak. Under present conditions, bothGerman and French industry might be vulnerable to military attack;but, in the long run, French industry was the less vulnerable byreason of its geographical position.In concluding the discussion, the Foreign Secretary said thatit would be premature at this stage to attempt to reach any firmconclusions about the ultimate attitude of Western Germany. Hisaim had been to establish a liberal and democratic State in closepolitical and economic association with the other countries of
Germany.international authority forthe Ruhr.(previous reference:CM. (48) 37thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (48) 304) covering the drafts of an agreement and press communique regarding the establishment of an international authority for the Ruhr.The Foreign Secretary recalled that Annex C of the Reportof the Six-Power Conference on the Future of Germany, which theCabinet had approved on 8th June, had laid down the principles fora detailed agreement governing the establishment of an international authority. Representatives of the Governments concerned had met recently in London, and agreement had been reached on the text of the draft annexed to CP. (48) 304. This draft was in generalno more than an amplification of the general statement of principles laid down by the Six-Power Conference, though it had been necessary, in deference to the wishes of the French Government, togo somewhat further than their Report in the provisions dealingwith the control of management. Since CP. (48) 304 had been circulated, certain minor alterations had been made in the text of thedraft agreement : these are set out in the Annex to these conclusions.In discussion, the following points were made : (a) The question was raised why the French proposal for theinternational ownership of the Ruhr industries should be regardedas &quot; impracticable and undesirable &quot; as stated in paragraph 17 of cp. (48) 304. The Foreign Secretary said that he had neverregarded it as practicable to place German industry alone under international ownership, particularly as the French Governmentwould interpret this as involving international management. It was unlikely, in his view, that any such system could be made to work;and it would certainly be greatly resented by German opinion. Hethought, however, that, sooner or later, it might be possible to achieve a functional integration of certain basic industries throughoutWestern Europe.Western Europe. But it would be unwise to place too much reliance on Germany&apos;s ultimate willingness to pursue a pacific and co-opera-.tive policy. At this stage, therefore, it would be impossible to devise a long-term policy towards Germany based on any firm assumptionsregarding her ultimate relationship with Western Europe. In themeantime his aim was to pursue a practical policy, which, whileassisting Western Germany to achieve a reasonable standard of life in collaboration with other Western European countries, would atthe same time take proper account of the French pre-occupationwith security. The French Government would certainly not besatisfied with any system of disarmament limited to the control ofthe finishing end of German industry. As regards the policy ofdismantling industrial plant, it should not be overlooked thatGermany had been able, during the war, to build up an inflatedindustrial capacity by drawing upon the plant and man-power resources of occupied countries. It was wholly unreasonable thatshe should expect to be allowed to retain capacity created in thisway on a scale beyond her peace-time needs. In justice to her formerenemies, a reasonable balance must be restored between the industrial capacity of Western European countries. The level of industryplan, for the Anglo-American Zone, which had been drawn up in1947 in agreement with the United States Government, seemed tohim to provide a satisfactory compromise between the conflictingfactors involved.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendations made in CP. (48) 303.(2) Took note of CP. (48) 306.
(6) Article 18 of the draft agreement would not, in itself,provide an effective safeguard against the development of the ruhr industries for aggressive purposes. It was unfortunate that a finaldecision regarding the ultimate disposal of the Ruhr industriescould not be deferred for at least five years until a clearer idea couldbe formed of future political developments in Germany, but theGerman political parties had made it clear that any such postpone-ment would gravely prejudice their own position.(c) In the absence of an agreed policy regarding the applicationof sanctions to Germany after the Control Period, the provisions ofArticle 24 relating to default by the German Government could nothave much substance. But this was a matter which would have tobe separately considered.The Cabinet (1) Approved the draft annexed to CP. (48) 304 (subject to the amendments set out in the Annex to these Conclusions)for an agreement for the establishment of an Inter-national Authority for the Ruhr.(2) Approved the general lines of the draft communique in annex II to CP. (48) 304 and agreed that it should, ifpossible, be made public on 23rd December.Census of 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theDistribution.    President of the Board of Trade (CP. (48) 305) on the questionwhether the first census of distribution should be held in 1950 or should be postponed until a later year.The President of the Board of Trade said that the production committee, which had discussed this question on 17th December,1948 (P.C. (48) 25th Meeting, Minute 2), had favoured taking thiscensus in 1950 but had considered that the political issues involved should be referred to the Cabinet for decision. If the census wasto be postponed on account of the General Election, it would have tobe postponed until 1952, since preliminary forms giving notice ofthe questions to be asked had to be circulated in the year before the census was taken. If the census was held in 1952, it would not bepossible, in view of the time required to marshal and consider theinformation collected, to introduce legislation based on that information during the next Parliament. No difficulty would be caused to the larger retail businesses, which already collected fortheir own purposes the type of information which the Governmentrequired; and the form which the small shopkeepers had to completehad now been greatly simplified and should present them with no great difficulties. He hoped the Cabinet would see their way toauthorise the holding of the census in 1950.In discussion, it was pointed out that the census of distributionwas a statutory requirement under the Statistics of Trade Act, 1947,and had been unanimously recommended by a committee appointed in 1945 by the Caretaker Government. The holding of the censushad already been once postponed and a further postponement forlonger than a year would have the appearance of indefinite postpone-ment. Apart from certain information relating to the co-operative societies and chain stores, the Government in this country lackedinformation on many important points affecting the organisationof the distributive trades. From the point of view of economic planning, including the efficient use of man-power, it was important that the Government should have this further information. the lack of information about the distributive trades made it difficultto formulate any general policy for their reorganisation.Against holding the census in 1950, it was argued that many small shopkeepers would be irritated at having to complete theform and might be induced to believe that the information was to
169 CM. 82 (48)be used for political purposes. It was certainly awkward that this opportunity for controversy should have to be offered to theOpposition Parties in an election year. The lack of the information to&quot; be secured by this census need not preclude the Labour Partyfrom putting forward any proposals affecting the distributive trades in their programme for the General Election. Doubt was also expressed whether it would be expedient to suggest at this stage, as was tentatively proposed in paragraph 4 of CP. (48) 305, that a royal Commission should be appointed to make recommendations for improved efficiency in distribution following the results ofthe census.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet could not reach final agreement on the timing of the census of distribution until theyhad been given an opportunity to study the questions which smallshopkeepers would be expected to answer, and had some indication of the extent to which policy could be framed without waiting forthe results of the census.The Cabinet-Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consulta-tion with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to submit a supple-mentary memorandum dealing, inter alia, with the points mentioned by the Prime Minister.housing bill.(previous reference:CM. (48) 76thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Minister of Health said that he was due shortly toattend a meeting of a committee of the Labour Party Executive,which was to discuss the problems of tied cottages with represen-tatives of the agricultural trade unions. The representatives ofthe unions would probably express views hostile to the grantof financial assistance under the proposed Housing Bill forthe improvement of tied cottages. He would be in a difficult position if, while expressing a general dislike of tied cottages, he was notto disclose the fact that the Government were considering the making of grants under the Housing Bill.The Cabinet were informed that the Minister of Health, theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Agricultureconsidered, on examination, that it would not be desirable to make grants to cottages occupied as part of a contract of service.Accordingly, grants for the improvement of tied cottages wouldbe limited to those let on a tenancy agreement.The general view of the Cabinet was that the Minister ofHealth should make it clear that the Government had decided thatgrants under the Housing Bill should be available for the improve-ment of tied cottages let on a tenancy agreement. As the text ofthe Bill would not be available for some time, the Minister wouldhave to give this information on a confidential basis at the present stage. It would, of course, be open to him to report to his colleagues on the reception which the agricultural unions gave to thisintimation of the Government^ decision.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,22nd December, 1948.
