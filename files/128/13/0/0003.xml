European 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the latest developments in theEconomic       negotiations on the draft Economic Co-operation Agreement betweenCo-operation.   His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government.(Previous After the Cabinefs discussion on the previous day the PrimeEeference:      Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had seen the united cm.

(48) 26thMeeting) in the afternoon and at an informal meeting of ministers in the evening of the previous day. As a result of these further dis-cussions all save two of the main objectives of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, as reported to the Cabinet on the previous day, hadbeen secured.On the first of the two outstanding points, the United StatesGovernment had now made a further concession. They were pre-pared to amend the opening words of Article II of the Agreement soas to read : &quot; In order to achieve the maximum recovery through theemployment of assistance received from the Government of theUnited States, the Government of the United Kingdom will use its best endeavours. ...&quot; And they offered to substitute for Part (C) ofthat Article the following formula: &quot;To stabilise its currency,establish or maintain a valid rate of exchange, balance its Govern-mental Budget, create or maintain internal financial stability,including credit policies, and generally restore or maintain confidence in its monetary system.&quot; These changes fully met the objectionspreviously raised against this Article.On the second of the outstanding points the United StatesGovernment had now agreed that the proposal for conceding most-favoured-nation treatment to Japan should not form part of thisAgreement. They had indicated that they might wish to make it acondition of their signing this Agreement that we should enter intoa separate arrangement with them about Japan. Acceptance of sucha condition would involve us in difficulties with Australia and othercountries which had played a prominent part in the war against japan; and it was desirable that we should adhere to the view thatthis question must be remitted to the Far Eastern Commission. TheUnited States Government had, however, agreed that further nego-tiations on this point could be conducted through the United states ambassador in London; and this should enable us to dissociate theJapanese question from the Economic Co-operation Agreement.The Cabinet agreed that in these circumstances our negotiatorsin Washington could now be authorisd to agree the revised form ofAgreement.Discussion then turned on the arrangements for publishing theAgreement and debating it in Parliament. As the text was likelyto be released in Washington as soon as it had been signed, it was desirable that it should be presented to Parliament at the earliest opportunity. Ministers agreed that, if the final text could be obtained in time and if a satisfactory arrangement on the Japanese question could be reached through the United States Ambassador in London,the Agreement, should be presented to Parliament as a White paper in the late afternoon of Monday, 28th June. Failing that, the white paper should be presented on Tuesday, 29th June. On the day of publication, before copies of the White Paper were available to members of Parliament, the Chancellor of the Exchequer shouldmake an announcement in the House of Commons about the generaltenor of the Agreement. This would give him an opportunity toexplain, in accordance with what had been agreed with the UnitedStates Government, how certain of its provisions would apply to theUnited Kingdom, and thus to forestall criticism of^these provisions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer would also hold a Press conference with Lobby correspondents on the day of publication, and would explain the Agreement to a special meeting of the parliamentary labour Party on Wednesday, 30th June. The Agreement would thenbe debated in Parliament on 5th and 6th July.

iany.tionsrlin.riousence:(48) 42nd.conclusions,te 2)3. The British Deputy Military Governor in Germanyinformed the Cabinet of the latest developments in the situation inBerlin. The British garrison could be supplied by air, andarrangements for this purpose would be brought into operation inthe following week. Food stocks were sufficient to supply the civilpopulation in the British sector for twenty-seven days. Theelectricity generating stations controlled by the Western powers could meet about 50 per cent, of the electricity requirements in theWestern sectors of the city. The German people in those sectorswere calm, and the majority of them were ready to resist Russianorders if they were confident that they would continue to receive thesupport of the Western Powers. It would be useful if the british military Governors could be authorised to make it clear that theRussian authorities were to blame for any inconvenience orsuffering arising from the suspension of land communications between the Western Zones of Germany and the Western sectors of berlin.In reply to questions, The Deputy Military Governor said thatit would not be practicable to bring freight trains from the western zones to Berlin by force. Nor would it be feasible to convoy lorriesby road to Berlin, save as a major, military operation. He doubted whether it would be practicable to bring in sufficient food for thecivil population by air, even if the magnitude of the commitmentwere reduced by removing, on the return journeys of the freightaircraft, such members of the civil population as were willing toleave the Western sectors of the city. It might be advisable ata later stage to remove by this means some of the more prominentGermans who had opposed Soviet policies in Berlin. We were notin a position to put any effective pressure on the Soviet authorities by withholding supplies normally sent from the Western Zones to theSoviet Zone. No such supplies were being sent at the present time:but none of the commodities concerned was essential to the economy of the Soviet Zone, and the lack of them would not be more than aninconvenience to the Soviet authorities. No steps had yet been takento close down the Soviet broadcasting station in the British sector;for it was thought that, if this were done, the Soviet authorities would cut our cable communications between Berlin and London.The numbers of British troops in Berlin were sufficient for thepurpose of dealing with any civil disturbances; and there could beno question of undertaking military operations in Berlin.Ministers were concerned at the position which would arise ifland communications between the Western Zones and Berlin were notre-opened before the food supplies of the civil population wereexhausted. The Soviet authorities could supply, without greatdifficulty, food for the whole of the civil population of Berlin; but itcould not be assumed that they would undertake responsibility for supplying the Western sectors while the Western Powers retainedtheir garrisons in the city. Immediate consideration should therefore be given, in consultation with the United States andFrench authorities, to the possibilities of maintaining supplies tothe civil population in the Western sectors of the city, and inparticular to the extent to which supplies for the civil populationcould be maintained by air.The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the terms of thestatement about the situation in Berlin which he was proposing tomake in the House of Commons later that morning.The Foreign Secretary said that his advisers were consideringthe implications of the statement issued by the Soviet Governmentthat morning on the conclusion of the Warsaw Conference withrepresentatives of the satellite States of South-Eastern Europe. Hewas also considering the basis of an approach to the United Statesand French Governments with a view to concerting with them a,jointpolicy for dealing with the general political situation created by thislatest Soviet move to force the Western Powers out of Berlin. Onthis aspect of the matter he would make a further report at an early meeting of Ministers. Meanwhile, he would be glad if the PrimeMinister would consider whether the -Defence Committee, or some
other group of Ministers, should be authorised to keep in constanttouch with the developments of the situation in Berlin.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for a group of Ministers to assist the Foreign Secretary in keeping under review the development of the current situation in Berlin and considering means of dealingwith it;(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to obtain and submit to thegroup of Ministers to be constituted under Conclusion (1)above technical advice on the possibilities of providingsupplies for the civil population in the Western sectors of Berlin;(3) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would consider how best to concert a common policy in this matter with theGovernments of the United States and France.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.25th June, 1948.
