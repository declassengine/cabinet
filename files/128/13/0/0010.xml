1. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the memoranda by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (48) 177 and 178) on the programmes, and statistics to be submitted to the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation in connection with the forthcoming negotiations for the allocation of aid under the European recovery programme for the year July 1948 to June 1949.As a background to the discussion of possible savings in the dollar import programme, the Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet of the main items in the programme and the estimated expenditure on each.The Cabinet then continued their discussion of the suggestionthat they should reverse their earlier decision to let farmers keep20 per cent, of the millable wheat of the 1948 harvest. It waspointed out that the original promise to the farmers had been madeto encourage both the expansion of livestock production and the growing of more wheat. It was true that farmers had been warnedin January that the Government might find it necessary to require them to surrender this 20 per cent, and to accept instead an equivalent amount of coarse grains. But it had then been statedthat this course would only be adopted if there were an acute shortage of grain for human consumption; and Ministers felt thatin the face of their decision to abolish bread rationing it would beimpossible to argue that the situation contemplated by the Januarystatement had arisen. It was therefore agreed that farmers shouldbe free, if they desired, to retain 20 per cent, of their millable wheat from the 1948 harvest but that everything possible shouldbe done to persuade them voluntarily to market more than 80 percent, of this crop and to encourage them to accept coarse grains in substitution. For this purpose, the possibility of making changesin the relative prices of wheat and coarse grains should be explored.The Minister of Food said that, after further consideration, hehad come to the conclusion that it would be dangerous to acceptthe proposal that wheat stocks should be allowed to fall to a levelof six weeks&apos; consumption in mid-1949. He regarded a stock levelof nine weeks&apos; consumption as the minimum for safety and he pointed out that in the current year, when a stock level of ten weeks&apos;consumption had been aimed at, stocks had in fact fallen to six anda half weeks&apos; consumption and the position during the dock strike had been precarious. The Foreign Secretary and the Minister ofDefence supported the view that stocks should not be allowed to fall below the level of nine weeks&apos; consumption, and there was general agreement that every effort should be made to maintain this level by buying from non-dollar sources any excess over the stocklevel proposed in paragraph 22 of Annex A to CP. (48) 177.The Cabinet reaffirmed their decision of 22nd June (CM. (48^41st Conclusions, Minute 2) to abolish bread rationing and it wasagreed that, in announcing this decision, the Minister of food should emphasise that the consumption of flour would be limited by other methods. The terms of the announcement should be settled with the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet next discussed the proposal that imports of UnitedStates tobacco should be reduced by $20 million. It was pointed outthat, if this cut were made, manufacturers would reduce their outputby 20 per cent, unless they could be assured that they would be ableto replenish their stocks in 1949, and that assurance could not begiven. There was already a widespread shortage of cigarettes.This further cut would cause considerable inconvenience and would provoke political criticism. It must be accepted that the rationing of tobacco and cigarettes was not administratively practicable. Theimmediate shortage could not be satisfactorily cured by increaseduse of Balkan tobacco. Cigarettes made wholly of Balkan tobaccowere not readily saleable in this country. And the addition of anincreased proportion of Balkan tobacco to Virginian cigarettesinvolved, owing to the higher moisture content of Balkan tobacco,serious technical difficulties which could not be overcome without
purchasing special machinery or adulterants from dollar sources.On the other hand, it was pointed out that it would be necessary,for a long time to come, to restrict dollar expenditure on tobacco,and the manufacturers must therefore be made to face the need for making greater use of Balkan tobacco. They must seek means of influencing public taste towards Balkan cigarettes and of over-coming the technical difficulties of blending the two types of tp&apos;pacco.The Cabinet were informed that our purchases of Rhodesiantobacco had already been substantially increased, and arrangements had been made for further expansion of tobacco production in southern Rhodesia. In all the circumstances Ministers agreed thata cut of- $20 million should be made in the import programme fordollar tobacco.The Cabinet also agreed that further savings of dollar importsmight be made by reducing the raw materials programme by$30 million. This programme had been prepared on the basis ofmaintaining a four-page newspaper until 1st July, 1949. It waspointed out, however, that there were prospects of increased suppliesof newsprint both from home production and from non-dollar sources, and it was agreed that the possibility of introducing a five-page newspaper at an earlier date need not be excluded.It was agreed that the question of reducing the allocation of sugar for manufacture by 10 per cent, should be postponed until september; and that no reduction should be made in the import programme for machinery.The Cabinet were informed that it was not proposed to make public at this stage the programmes submitted to the organisation for European Economic Co-operation. It would probably benecessary to publish the programmes ultimately submitted by theOrganisation to the Economic Co-operation Administrator.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the United Kingdom dollar import programme for 1948-49 should be adjusted to give effect to thefollowing decisions : (i) The Minister of Food should aim at maintainingwheat stocks at a minimum level of nine weeks&apos;consumption, on the understanding that the excess over the stock level proposed in paragraph 22 of annex A to CP. (48) 177 would be met from non-dollar sources.(ii) Farmers  should  be  free   to  keep  for  animalconsumption 20 per cent, of millable wheat of the1948 harvest, but the Ministers concerned should do all they could to persuade farmers to marketmore than 80 per cent, of this crop for human consumption and to accept coarse grains for animal feeding; and for this purpose they should consider the possibility of a change in the relativeprices of wheat and coarse grains.(iii) The Minister of Food should aim at limiting theconsumption of flour to an average level of100,000 tons a week.(iv) Consideration of the proposal for a cut of 10 percent, in the allocation of sugar for manufactureshould be postponed until September.(v) A cut of $20 million should be made in the proposedpurchases of United States tobacco,(vi) The raw materials programme should be cut by$30 million, on the understanding that a five-page newspaper might be introduced before 1st July, 1949, if it were, found possible to obtainthe necessary newsprint from non-dollar sources.(2) Agreed that a figure of 20 million tons should be includedin the return of the level of coal exports in the fiscalyear 1948-49 to be submitted to the Organisation for
129CM, SO (48)European Economic Co-operation, provided that it wasmade clear that it might not be possible to find a market for about 1 million tons of this amount;(3) Approved the proposals made in paragraphs 11, 18 and 20of Annex C to CP. (48) 177 for controlling the UnitedKingdom balance of payments with non-dollar countries;(4) Agreed that the memorandum and tables annexed to cp. (48) 178, adjusted to take account of the decisionsrecorded in (1) and (2) above, should be submitted tothe Organisation for European Economic Co-operation;(5) Reaffirmed the decision to abolish bread rationing, and invited the Minister of Food to consult the foreign secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer on theterms in which this decision should be announced.2. The Foreign Secretary drew attention to the risk that aninflationary situation might develop in the Sudan and might spreadfrom there to British Colonial territories in Africa. Sudanproduction, especially of cotton, had recently commanded high prices, and a large amount of additional money was being put intocirculation which was not balanced by an increased supply of consumer goods. Could arrangements be made, without interfering with essential exports, to send increased supplies of less essentialconsumer goods to the Sudan?The Cabinet were informed that similar difficulties were already arising in British Colonial territories in Africa. In someterritories the situation had been eased by holding in an equalisationfund some part of the additional receipts due to increased export prices. In spite of this, however, there was urgent need forincreased supplies of consumer goods. In discussion, it was pointedout that more could be done to increase the export of less essential goods to these territories if the local Governments could be persuaded to relax some of their import restrictions.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that further efforts should be made to increase thesupply of less essential consumer goods to the Sudan andto British Colonial territories in Africa;(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for an early meeting to be held, while the Governor-General of theSudan was in London, at which officials of the ForeignOffice, Colonial Office, Treasury and Board of Tradecould concert means of increasing the supply of consumer goods to these territories.3. The Secretary of State for the Colonies gave the Cabinet a brief report on the disorders in Malaya. All the requests formilitary assistance which had been made by the authorities on the spot had been, or were being, met and there was close collaboration between the civil and military authorities under the supervision of the British Defence Co-ordination Committee. The local Govern-ments had been authorised to introduce emergency powers; andthere was reason to believe that the situation was now being brought under control.In discussion it was suggested that a comprehensive review should be made of the organisation of the Colonial police services,with a view particularly to improving their intelligence work.There was little doubt that the situation in Malaya had beenexploited by Communists, and similar attempts to foment disordermust be expected in other parts of the Colonial Empire. While weshould not be deterred by this threat from continuing to pursue a progressive Colonial policy, Colonial Governments must be preparedto deal effectively and promptly with any such outbreaks.   -
The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the position; 1(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to confer with the Minister of Defence regarding the need fo&quot; a review of the organisation of the Colonial police services.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,13th July, 1948.
