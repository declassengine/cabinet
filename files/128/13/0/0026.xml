49CM. 66 (46)1. The Cabinet considered a joint memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture and the Minister of Food (CP. (48) 241)and a memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade(CP. (48) 242) on the location of, the permanent headquarters of theFood and Agriculture Organisation and the International trade organisation.The location of the headquarters of the Food and agriculture organisation was1 likely to be discussed at the forthcoming meetingof the Council and Conference of the Organisation. The choiceappeared to lie between Washington, Rome and Copenhagen. Thefirst would doubtless be pressed by the United States and Canadianrepresentatives; but it would involve for European Governments a heavy and continuing dollar cost and the present United states administration had not made any offer of office accommodationcomparable to those made by the Italian and Danish Governments.Some European Governments also felt that the choice of a site inEurope would be politically advantageous, and would diminish thestrength of American influence in the Organisation. It was there-fore suggested in CP. (48) 241 that the United Kingdom delegation should seek to secure postponement of a decision until the nextConference, in the hope that the United States Government might then be able to offer more favourable terms. If a decision couldnot be avoided, the Foreign Office were inclined to favour the selec-tion of Washington, provided that the United States Governmentcould be induced to offer accommodation on reasonably favourable terms. If, however, it became clear that the Conference would accept only a European site, it was suggested that the delegation should support the choice of Copenhagen in preference to Rome.The President of the Board of Trade said that his paper had&apos;been circulated before he had had an opportunity of seeing CP. (48)241. His main concern was to ensure that the headquarters of theInternational Trade Organisation was ultimately located in Europe.The United States Administration would make every effort to securethe Food and Agriculture Organisation for Washington and, onreconsideration, he was inclined to think that, if this effort seemed likely to be successful, our Delegation should concentrate on obtain-ing satisfactory concessions regarding the provision of accommoda-tion and securing general support for the proposal to site the Inter-national Trade Organisation in Europe.Discussion turned first on the question whether the headquarters of the Food and Agriculture Organisation ought to be located in washington or in Europe. It was suggested that, by meeting thewishes of the United States Government over this, we mightstrengthen our chance of securing agreement that the headquarters of the International Trade Organisation should be in Europe. Onthe other hand, a decision in favour of Washington would throwa heavy and continuing burden of dollar expenditure on european governments both for the maintenance of delegations and for thef)ayment of contributions. Moreover, there was a strong case forocating the headquarters of the Organisation nearer to the areasof the World with which it would primarily be concerned; and, inparticular, it was important that it should be able to maintain close contact with those countries in the Organisation for European&apos; Economic Co-operation which were concerned with Colonial develop-ment. Further, if its headquarters were in the United States, itwould come under the influence of American pressure groups, andthe United States Government would also press the argument for maintaining close physical proximity between it and the Inter-national Trade Organisation.Discussion next turned on the question whether Rome orCopenhagen would be the more suitable European site. In favourof Rome, it was argued that the establishment of an international organisation in Italy would be a stimulus and encouragement tothe Italian people; that Italy was an important agricultural country;and that the political interest of the United States Government in36113-3 b 2internationalOrganisations.(previous reference:C.M.(46)95thConclusions,Minute 2.)
ill50Italy might mean that Rome would be for them the most acceptableEuropean site for the Organisation. On the other hand, a largeproportion of the staff of any International Organisation tended tobe recruited locally; and, as experience of the International institute of Agriculture had shown, Rome would not be a fortunate choicefrom this point of view. Moreover, Rome itself could not beregarded as a representative capital city; and, if the aim was to associate the Organisation with the Italian people, Milan would bea better choice. But the choice of any site in Italy was open tothe objection that this would, from the outset, gravely prejudice theWork of the Organisation in Africa, where public opinion was hostile to the Italians. None of these objections applied to Copenhagen.The Scandinavian Governments had given strong support to thework of the United Nations and its specialised agencies, and therewas much to be said for locating the headquarters of one of theInternational Organisations in a Scandinavian country.Tn further discussion, it was suggested, that experience had shown the value of ensuring close physical proximity between the headquarters of the various United Nations Organisations. If effec-tive co-ordination was to be maintained there should be constantcontact between the leading members of these Organisations. Forthese reasons, it was argued that it might be found best to site the headquarters of these two Organisations either in New York or in geneva.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the United Kingdom Delegation to the forth-coming Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organi-sation should be instructed (i) to press that a decision regarding the location of thepermanent headquarters of the organisation should be held over until the next Conference;and(ii) if this could not be secured, to press for the location of the headquarters in a European country.(2) Agreed to consider further, in the light of the progress ofthe discussions at the Conference, the selection of asuitable site in Europe for the headquarters of theOrganisation.Parliament.Iron and.Steel Bill.(previous reference:C.M.(48)64thConclusions,Minute 6.)2. the Lord President said that it was proposed that the Ironand Steel Bill should be presented to Parliament on 27th october and published on 29th October. This would have the effect of excluding from the Debate on the Address in the House of Commonsall discussion of the Governments proposal to socialise certain sections of the iron and steel industry. The Cabinet should be aware of this, since it might arouse protest from the Opposition.The exclusion of this topic from the Debate on the Address could,however, be defended on the ground that there would be ample opportunity to discuss it in the forthcoming debates on the Bill;and there were several precedents for the course which it was proposed to follow.The Cabinet were informed that in the House of Lords theOpposition could not be prevented from raising this question duringthe Debate on the Address and it was understood that they in factintended to do so.The Cabinet took note of the position.
51cm. 66 (A)The Cabinet discussed the terms in which they should announce their decision, taken on 22nd October, that in the forthcoming session seven days should be made available for Second Readingsof Private Members&apos; Bills and three further days, if required, forthe remaining stages of any such Bills as might pass throughStanding Committee. If the Government indicated that they wereprepared to allot a total of ten days for Private Members&apos; business and less than three days was in the event required for the report stage and Third Reading of Private Members&apos; Bills, the Govern-ment might be pressed to make the balance of that time availablefor Private Members&apos; Motions. An offer to allow any such balanceto be used for the Second Readings of further Bills would be of little value, since Bills read a second time so late in the Session wouldhave little chance of making further progress. It seemed, therefore,to be preferable that, in announcing the decision, the Prime minister should say that the Government proposed to make seven days avail-able between Christmas and Easter for the Second Readings ofPrivate Members&apos; Bills and that thereafter they would be preparedto make additional time available, up to a maximum of three furtherdays, for the remaining stages of any such Bills as might have passed through Standing Committee.is The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would announce their decision in this form.3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (48) 219) on the question of providing forthe dependants of Ministers of the Crown killed or injured in thecourse of their duties.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, before 1939, no such provision was made. During the war, however, in view of thespecial risks of air travel under war conditions, civil servants hadbeen allowed to charge to public funds the cost of premiums tocover insurance up to a sum equal to two years&apos; salary, and this practice had also been extended to Ministers. This arrangementhad been continued since the war, but it was not invariably followed and it applied only to air travel. He had therefore thought it advisable to raise the whole question. If the Cabinet thought that provision should be made for Ministers, the choice lay between con-tinuing the war-time practice of taking up insurances with private companies or extending the provisions of the Injury Warrant tocover Ministers. The second course would involve legislation; andit was also doubtful whether the provisions of the Injury Warrant,which was part of the general superannuation code for civil servants,could appropriately be extended to Ministers.In discussion, there was general agreement that it would be inappropriate to introduce legislation extending the Injury Warrantto Ministers. There might be advantage in continuing the existing arrangements for meeting from public funds the cost of premiumson special insurance policies covering Ministers against air travelrisks. It was argued that the cost of such premiums formed partof the normal costs of travel which were met from Governmentfunds. Under the Local Government Act, 1948, local authorities were empowered to make reasonable arrangements covering risksincurred by their members and staffs, and Ministers should not bein a less favourable position. Alternatively, the Treasury might make special arrangements with the insurance companies whichwould ensure that Ministers received favourable terms. The general view of the Cabinet was, however, that the arrangements made forthe payment of insurance premiums in respect of Ministers ought not to be continued.   These arrangements had been adopted to meet
the special risks of air travel under war conditions. The risks were now so greatly reduced that it would be hard to justify this excep-tional treatment. While it was possible to draw a, legitimatedistinction between Ministers and private Members in this matter,it would in practice be difficult to resist claims from the latter that similar facilities should be extended to them; and any attempt to differentiate publicly in favour of Ministers would provoke criticism.In these circumstances, the right course appeared to be to revert tothe position as it existed before the war.The Cabinet-Agreed that no provision should be made from public funds for the dependants of Ministers of the Crown killed orinjured in the course of their duties; and that the existing practice of meeting from public funds the cost of premiumson special insurance policies to cover Ministers againstthe risks of air travel should be discontinued.Government 4   The Cabinet had-before them two memoranda by theInformation Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (48) 199 and 212) on the presentServices.        cost of the Governments Information Services.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the total expenditureon these services had now reached a level which exposed the Govem-ment to risk of public criticism. From now on he thought that any expenditure on the provision of new services or the extension of- existing services should be compensated by reductions under otherheads. The enquiry into the cost of the Home Information Services,proposed in paragraph 3 of CP. (48) 199, had already been launched.The main question for the Cabinet was whether a similar enquiry should be made into the cost of the information services abroad.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said thatthe Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs,Commonwealth Relations and the Colonies had already been askedto work out a three-year programme for the overseas information services and in the course of this they would consider what economiescould be made in the existing services. The Chancellor of theExchequer suggested, and it was agreed, that the Financial Secre-tary to the Treasury should join with the three Under-Secretariesin working out this programme.The Cabinet were informed that the Foreign Secretary hadalready reviewed the expenditure on those overseas information services for which he was responsible and did not think it practic-able to reduce the total expenditure incurred on these. Indeed, hethought that there were serious deficiencies to be made good. Inpresent circumstances it was essential that a positive reply should bemade to the Communist challenge throughout the world; and theUnited Kingdom were in a stronger moral position to make thatreply than any other country. The right kind of publicity in foreigncountries could produce most valuable results, and the expenditure involved was small in relation to our expenditure on defence.Discussion showed that, while Ministers were in general agree-ment with the view that effective publicity was a valuable instrument for resisting further Communist encroachment, they felt that this did not diminish the need for careful scrutiny of the existinginformation services abroad and the expenditure incurred on them.If new services were required to meet the Communist challenge,could any of the existing services be discontinued ? Was it certain,for example that all the activities of the British Council were worth the cost involved ? Moreover, was it not reasonable that the overseas services should be subjected to the same kind of scrutiny as was nowbeing applied to the home services?
The Prime Minister suggested that the Cabinet should consideron some later occasion, when the Foreign Secretary could be present,what would be the most appropriate method of enquiring into thecost and efficiency of the information services abroad.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of CP. (48) 199 and 212, and endorsed the action taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to institute an enquiry into the cost of the Home Information Services;(2) Agreed to consider at a later meeting the most suitablemeans of instituting a corresponding enquiry into thecost of the Overseas Information Services.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,25th October, 1948.
