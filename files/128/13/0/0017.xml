1. The Cabinet expressed their regret at the Prime Ministersindisposition and asked that their wishes for his speedy recoveryshould be conveyed to him.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (CP. (48) 206) setting out the measures recommended bythe Defence Committee m order to put the Armed Forces in a better position to fight, should an. emergency arise in the near future.The Foreign Secretary said that no settlement had yet beenreached in the talks proceeding in Moscow. Whatever the outcome of these talks, however, he was convinced that the country would be faced with a very difficult period in the next six to nine months;and, if we were to exert due influence in the discussions which wouldtake place and hold our position in the world, it was essential thatwe should be able to deploy somewhat greater strength than thatwhich we at present possessed.The Minister of Defence explained that the Defence Committeehad held a series of meetings at which they had considered the stateof preparedness of the Armed Forces. The memorandum by thePrime Minister (CP. (48) 206) was the result of those discussions and he suggested that the Cabinet should consider the specific recommendations made in paragraph 4.In paragraph 4 (a) it was recommended that there should bea general suspension of releases from the Armed Forces for a period up to 31st March, 1949, and the Cabinet were asked to decide whether this suspension should operate from 1st September or1st October, 1948. In discussion of this question the followingpoints were made : (a) The Minister of Defence said that he, the Service ministers and the Chiefs of Staff all attached very great importance to the suspension of releases, which would allow the three Services to retainin their ranks considerable numbers- of the trained men which were so necessary to them. Before approving the proposal, however, theCabinet should appreciate that the three Services would have to face a major administrative problem in 1949 if all the men whoserelease was suspended had to be demobilised within a short period after 31st March. Any such rapid demobilisation would have a disastrous effect on the structure of the Army. It was mostimportant to discover quickly how these administrative difficulties might be overcome and he proposed, therefore, that a working party should be instructed to enquire into the matter urgently.(6) The Secretary of State for War agreed that the Army wouldbe confronted with a formidable administrative problem if releaseswere suspended for the next six months and then reopened at theend of the financial year. The further demobilisation that wouldthen be involved could only be progressive, and this would mean thata man who had already been retained for a period of six monthsmight have to wait a further month or two for his release. In any event,- to release up to 300,000 men in what would remain of 1949would, disorganise the Army to such an extent as to make it unableto meet its commitments.(c) In any scheme for the suspension of releases provision shouldbe made for the continuance of Class &quot;B&quot; releases (i.e., releaseson compassionate grounds), and for the release of men who had entered or decided to stay in the Services on voluntary engagements&quot;.(d) The Foreign Secretary said that it was essential that any scheme adopted should be equitable. The Defence Committee&apos;recommendation that releases should be suspended for a block period was not equitable, since the burden of additional service would not fall equally on all concerned. The need of the moment was to retainin the Services, for the next six .months or so, the maximum numberi-2
Review ofNationalService Act,1947.SelectiveRecall ofRegularReservistsand Recall ofSpecialistsfrom Class ZReserve.of trained men, and the only way to do this and be fair to allconcerned was to call upon each trained man, whatever his lengthof service, to extend his service for an equal period beyond the date when in the normal course he would be released. It would, of course,be necessary to depart from the dates given in the programme of releases which had already been published, but, provided: that allknew that the burden was being shared equally, this should not leadto serious trouble. The working party proposed by the Ministerof Defence should concentrate on finding a solution on these lines.There might also be some readjustment of the intake, if this would serve to promote greater efficiency in the Armed Forces over the next six months.(e) There was general agreement that it would be preferable to bring the suspension of releases into operation on 1st Octoberrather than 1st September.In paragraph 4 (&amp;) the Cabinet were asked to note that a working party set up by the Minister of Defence was consideringthe possibility of adjusting the National Service Act (e.g., bylengthening the period of service with the colours) in order to enablethe man-power needs of the Armed Forces in the next few years to be met more effectively.; The Foreign Secretary said he would like to broaden the termsof reference which had been given to this working party. while he had an open mind on the question whether it was necessary tolengthen the period of service with the colours, it seemed clear that,through no fault of the Services, the Act would prove bothuneconomic and unscientific in operation. The working party should therefore be instructed to look at the whole problem afreshand to consider what the best arrangement would be&quot; both for the armed Forces and for the country as a whole. They should be completely free to consider what the terms of service with the coloursand with the reserve should be, with the one reservation that theprinciple of national service should not be questioned. fresh legislation would no doubt be required, but the sooner a.really soundscheme could be devised the better. Such a scheme might well help to solve the administrative difficulties which would face the armed forces at the end of any period of suspension&quot; of releases.Other points in the discussion of this matter were : (/) The Secretary of State for War and the Minister of Laboursaid that it was important to offer special inducements to nationalservice men who were skilled in particular technical trades. Suchinducements would attract men into. Service units which were atpresent short of technical personnel and would enhance the reputation-tion of the Services, since the men concerned would feel that theywere receiving during their. time with the colours practical experience which would stand them in good stead on return to civilian life.(g) The Foreign Secretary said that the Exchequer ought toassume responsibility for paying the salaries or wages of membersof the Territorial Army and the corresponding auxiliary forces during their period of training. The. Minister of Defence explainedthat a great deal of thought had already been given to this question and undertook to circulate a memorandum on the subject to theDefence Committee.In paragraph 4 (c) the Cabinet were asked to note that measures for the recall of reservists were not recommended since they wouldbe regarded both at home and overseas as a step towards mobilisation.The Minister of Defence said that, though he would have liked to ask the Cabinet to authorise a selective recall of these reservists,which in the opinion of the Chiefs of Staff was as necessary ameasure as the suspension of releases, he recognised that this wasnot at present a practicable proposition.

liage In paragraph 4 id) the Cabinet were asked to agree that theScheme. War Office Village Green Scheme, which provided for the registra-tion of men with war experience in anti-aircraft units, should beput into effect at once, corresponding schemes to meet the needs ofthe Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force also being brought intooperation.The Secretary of State for Air said that the Air Ministry hadparticulars of such specialists as they might wish to recall and thatthe framework of the Royal Air Force did not include any localunits. The Air Ministry did not therefore propose to operate aVillage Green Scheme on the lines proposed by the War Office.The First Sea Lord said that the requirements of the royal navy differed considerably from those of the War Office.    TheAdmiralty would, however, wish to recall a number of specialists. and a scheme to enable them to do so was under consideration.The Cabinet were informed that the Chancellor of theExchequer had been consulted generally about the proposals madein paragraph 4 of CP. (48) 206 and did not wish to oppose them.These proposals would, however, make substantial demands on man-power and materials. In particular they would call for about100,000 tons of steel, of which there was already a serious shortage.Other points in discussion were : (h) The Lord Privy Seal expressed concern about the effect ofthe proposals on the oil-production programme. He recalled theimportance attached to the provision of additional refineries and asked whether the plans for these refineries would be affected.In reply it was explained that, although the steel for the pro-posed works on the United Kingdom pipe-line would not, as suggested in paragraph 4 (Z) of C.P. (48) 206, be found from the oil companies&apos; allocation, the work on the pipe-line system would divertfrom the oil industry a certain amount of steel in the form of pipes.For the rest it would be impossible to provide anything like theadditional 100,000 tons which it had been hoped to find for the oil-expansion programme; but the allocation of 580,000 tons forthe maintenance and expansion of oil production would not beaffected.(i) The Chancellor of . the Exchequer considered it mostimportant that cuts which might have to be made in civilianproduction should not fall on production for export.(j) The Board of Trade would wish to discuss with the otherDepartments concerned how best the additional cloth required forthe Armed Forces could be found. The Cabinet were informed thatthe Chancellor of the Exchequer thought it essential that the costof finding this cloth should fall wholly on the home consumer; andthis was agreed.(k) The Minister of Labour said that, while the suspension of releases would inevitably make a substantial reduction in the generalman-power available for industry, the production proposals set outin paragraph 4 of CP. (48) 206 were not likely to raise difficultiesexcept in so far as it would be necessary to divert some labour fromthe pottery industry for the production of small-arms ammunition and to make certain production Cuts in Gloucester and Preston asa result of additional orders for fighter aircraft. Some additionaldirection of labour might also be involved.1 In paragraph 6 the Cabinet were asked to consider the form and timing of any announcement, bearing in mind its probable effect onthe conversations in progress in Moscow and the fact that when parliament met on 14th. September there would undoubtedly bequestions on the subject in the House.The Foreign Secretary said that a statement should be madeto Parliament when the new Session began in the middle ofSeptember.   Meanwhile, there should be no publicity, but, subject
to this, all preparations should be made to give effect to the decisions Iof the Cabinet as soon as the statement had been made.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle to the suspension of releases from the armed Forces and invited the Minister of Defence toarrange for a working party to formulate, for considera-tion at a meeting on 31st August, pioposals on the lines indicated by the Foreign Secretary in paragraph (d)above.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for a working party to make a comprehensive review of the NationalService Act on- the lines proposed by the foreign secretary.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence to circulate a memorandum to the Defence Committee dealing with the suggestionthat the Exchequer should assume responsibility forpaying the salaries or wages of members of theTerritorial Army and the corresponding auxiliary forces during their periods of training.(4) Took note that the Minister of Defence would consider thesuggestion made in paragraph (/) above with regard tothe rates of pay of national service men.(5) Approved the proposals made in paragraph 4 (d) to (I) of cp. (48) 206, subject to the points made in paragraphs (i)and (j) above.(6) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theForeign Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer,to prepare a draft of a comprehensive statement, to bemade early in the new Session of Parliament, covering the Government&apos;s intention to proceed with the proposals approved; and agreed that meanwhile action should betaken to put into effect the proposals which could go forward without publicity.Financial 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign and Secretary (CP. (48) 208) on the policy to be pursued in dealing with commercial the Jewish authorities on commercial and financial matters pendingRelations with a political settlement in Palestine.Jewish The memorandum proposed that the general aim should be to authorities. avoid discrimination between Arabs and Jews and to try to preventeither side profiting at the expense of the other from the results ofthe recent military operations in Palestine. As regards oil, it wassuggested that for the time being no action should be taken by HisMajesty&apos;s Government or by British oil companies to secure the resumption of operations at the Haifa refinery; but that no objectionshould be taken to the supply of refined petroleum products byBritish oil companies to the Jewish authorities, provided thatdeliveries were limited to normal peace-time requirements. It wouldbe necessary to inform the Mediator of what was proposed and toexplain the position carefully to the Arab States; arid the overseas negotiations Committee should keep the situation under review.No discussions On financial matters should be held for the presentand no encouragement should be given to the idea that a jewish state might eventually be included in the sterling area. Substantialreleases from blocked Palestifie accounts should be made only withthe prior approval of all the Departments concerned, and thePalestine Currency Board should continue its functions for the tiiflebeing. The memorandum also proposed that every effort should bemade to purchase citrus fruit elsewhere in order to&quot; avoid the accusations-tion that the United Kingdom were purchasing from the Jews the products of citrus farms from which the Arab owners had been driven out. If the immediate essential requirements could not bemet from other sources, purchases in Palestine should be confined to such amounts as could be equally divided between Arab and jewish suppliers.
In discussion the following points were made : (a) It was realised that postponement of financial discussions with the Jewish authorities would make it more difficult to securepayment of their debts to His Majesty&apos;s Government, but therewere overriding political advantages in postponement.(b) The Minister of Food said that the cessation of purchases in Palestine would have a very serious effect on the supply both oforange juice and of oranges, and that there was no hope of replacinganything like the whole of the Palestine supplies from other sources.Palestinian citrus products were in fact purchased through boardswhich, so far as he knew, still contained Arab representatives andhe suggested that some arrangement might be made under whichthe boards would guarantee that any payments made would go tothe rightful owners.The Foreign Secretary said that he was most anxious to avoid any suggestion that His Majesty&apos;s Government were making pay-ments to the Jews in respect of products which they had acquiredas a result of the recent military operations, since this would ruinany prospect of securing Arab acquiescence to proposals for a politi-cal settlement. He would, however, be prepared to consider any arrangements that the Ministry of Food might be able to deviseto avoid this difficulty.The Cabinet-(1) Approved generally the proposals made in CP. (48) 208 forthe conduct of financial and commercial relations withthe Jewish authorities pending a political settlement inPalestine.(2) Invited the Minister of Food to consider, in consultationwith the Foreign Secretary, whether arrangements couldbe devised under which it would be possible to continuethe purchase of citrus fruit from Palestine while ensur-ing that any payments made for the produce- of Arabfarms were made to the rightful owners of these farms.(3) Agreed that the Overseas Negotiations Committee should consider any further questions that might arise similarto those dealt with in CP. (48) 208.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (48) 207) on future policy with regard to Palestine.The Foreign Secretary said that he had reached the conclusionthat a settlement should be sought by stabilising the existing situa-tion in Palestine on the lines suggested in Annex B to CP. (48) 207.There had already been informal discussions with officials of theState Department on a solution of this kind and there was reasonto hope that the United States Government would agree to theprocedure outlined in Annex A to CP. (48) 207. He was convincedthat any attempt to make further progress through direct discussions between the Arabs and Jews themselves would fail, and that the only hope lay in the imposition of a settlement by the United Nations.The Minister of Defence supported the policy advocated by theForeign Secretary in CP. (48) 207. If the proposals set out in annex B, including the incorporation of the Arab areas in Trans-jordan, could be brought into effect, the problem of the defence ofthe Commonwealth would be greatly eased. The retention of WesternGalilee by the Jews would be unfortunate from the strategic pointof view, but it might be possible to modify this element of theproposals. He hoped that the United States Government could be persuaded to give their full support to the proposals, for they would no doubt meet with a certain amount of opposition in the united nations.
The Lord Privy Seal emphasised the importance of the proposal in paragraph 6 of Annex B that a permanent frontier line shouldbe established as soon as possible. He believed that there was goodhope of achieving a- satisfactory settlement on the lines proposedby the Foreign Secretary, provided that the support of the UnitedStates Government could be secured.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the scheme for a political settlement in Palestineset out in CP. (48) 207, and authorised the foreign secretary to continue discussions with the United StafesGovernment on the lines proposed.(2) Agreed that, if agreement could he reached with the UnitedStates Government and with the Mediator on the scheme,the influence of His Majesty&apos;s Government should beused to obtain support for it from other members of theUnited Nations.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,26th August, 1948.
