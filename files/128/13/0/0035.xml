Royal Yfstt toAustralia andNew Zealand.1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the King&apos;smedical advisers were of opinion that the state of his health wasnot equal to the strain of the forthcoming visit to Australia andNew Zealand. His Majesty had been advised to cancel the arrange-ments for the visit and also to refrain from undertaking any publicengagements in this country for some months. An announcement tothis effect would be published in the press on the following day.The Cabinet received this news with very great regret and asked that an expression of their sympathy should be conveyed to HisMajesty.Common-wealthKelafcioas.ConstitutionalDevelopmentsin Eire.(previous reference:CM. (48) 74thConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary ofState for Commonwealth relations (CP. (48) 277) covering thedraft of a statement to be made in Parliament on behalf of theUnited Kingdom Government as soon as possible after the secondReading of the Bill for the repeal of the Eire Executive Authority(External Relations) Act, 1936.The Prime Minister said that in pursuance of the cabinets decision of 18th November he had informed the Prime Ministerof Northern Ireland of the course of the recent discussions withEire Ministers and of the policy which the United Kingdom Govern-ment proposed to follow. Sir Basil Brooke had raised no objectionand, indeed, had agreed that in the circumstances no other course was open to them. He had, however, asked to be assured that theconstitutional position of Northern Ireland would be safeguarded :the Prime Minister had given him that assurance, and had agreedthat he might state publicly that he had been so assured. Sir BasilBrooke had principally in mind the risk that numbers of SouthernIrishmen might enter Northern Ireland and, finding means of exercising the franchise, might then outvote the loyalists on the partition issue. He had suggested that it might be necessary onthis account to tighten up the restrictions on the local franchise.The Prime Minister had told him that this was within the powers ofthe Northern Ireland Government and that the United KingdomGovernment would raise no objection to it. Sir Basil Brooke saidthat he might also have to ask for some modification of the Imperialfranchise, and on this the Prime Minister had said, without any commitment, that the United Kingdom Government would, ifnecessary, be prepared to consider such a request. Even if this pointwere not pressed by Northern Ireland, it might be raised in relationto Great Britain by Opposition parties in the Parliament at westminster.The way was now clear, therefore, to proceed with the further action approved by the Cabinet on 18th November. The EireMinister for External Affairs had confirmed his governments intention to go forward on the basis of the provisional conclusions reached in the Paris discussions on 16th November, and he had beeninformed that the United Kingdom Government, for their part,were prepared to proceed on the basis indicated in paragraph 8 of cp. (48) 272. The terms of the statement to be made in parliament could not be finally determined until it was known what eire ministers proposed to say in the Bail on 24th November on theSecond Reading of the Republic of Ireland Bill, but the other commonwealth Governments should be consulted at once on theprovisional draft so that, if they were willing to adopt a similarpolicy, they might be in a position to make comparable statements on or soon after 25th November.The Cabinet then considered the draft statement annexed to cp. (48) 277. In discussion, the following comments were made : (a) When the text of the statements to be made in the Dail on24th November was available, it might be possible to expand thefinal paragraph of the draft to give greater prominence to anyassurances that Mr. MacBride might make about the forthcomingamendment of the Eire citizenship law.36205-3 B 2
(b) Was it advisable to state specifically that, when theRepublic of Ireland Bill came into force, Eire would no longer bea member of the Commonwealth? After discussion it was recog-nised that this was not a point on which it would be possible to evade a clear statement. It would be emphasised by the Eire Govern-ment, and United Kingdom Ministers would be pressed in Parlia-ment to elucidate the position if no reference was made to it in thestatement. ,   ^(c) The statement should make it clear that the Government ofNorthern Ireland had been informed of the course of the discussions with Eire Ministers.(d) The Opposition leaders were likely to press for assurances that the position of the &quot; loyalists &quot; in Eire would not be prejudiced.It was pointed out that they could be assured that, if the eire government revised their citizenship law on the lines now proposed,the position of the loyalists would be better than it was at present,as a British subject was now an alien under Eire law.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the Prime Ministers report of his conversa-tion with the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to settle the final terms of thedraft statement annexed to CP. (48) 277 in the light oftheir discussion and of the exact terms of the statements to be made on behalf of the Eire Government in the Dailon 24th November; and took note that the final form ofthe proposed statement would be available to them attheir meeting on 25th November.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would see the opposition leaders on 23rd November and inform them of the policywhich the Government proposed to follow in respect of eire&apos;s future relations with the Commonwealth.The Prime Minister recalled that, in paragraph 9 (iv) of CP.(48) 272, it had been suggested that it would be expedient to com-municate to the Eire Government a detailed statement of treaty provisions under which difficulties might at some stage arise, andthat this might be accompanied by an invitation to the Eire Govern-ment to send one of their own legal advisers to this country toconfer on the arguments which the two Governments might jointlyuse to rebut any such claim. What was required at this stage was,not a repetition of the general warning about the possible dangersunder most-favoured-nation clauses, but an appreciation of thequarters from which such a challenge might come, the grounds onwhich a claim might be made by those particular countries, and an indication of possible arguments which might be used to rebut thatclaim. Officials of the Foreign Office, Home Office, commonwealth relations Office and Board of Trade might now be instructed todraw up such an appreciation for transmission to Dublin.There were also many existing arrangements which would haveto be reviewed in consequence of Eire&apos;s ceasing to be a member ofthe Commonwealth. The first need was to assemble these in areport for consideration by Ministers and, if the Cabinet agreed,he proposed to invite the&apos; Secretary of the Cabinet to convene a working party of officials to prepare such a report.The Cabinet-(4) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to arrange for officials of the Departments concerned to prepare a detailed statement on the treaty provisionsunder which difficulties might arise, as the result ofthe adoption of the policy set out in CP. (48) 272.(5) Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to convene a work-ing party of officials to prepare a report for ministers on the consequential action which might have to be taken, by the United Kingdom Government as a result of Eire&apos;sceasing to be a member of the Commonwealth.
3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Defence (CP. (48) 276) recommending that the periodof National Service should be increased from twelve to eighteen months, that the period of reserve liability should be reduced fromsix to four years and that the annual intake of National Service men should be controlled by raising slightly the general standard of acceptance and by deferring registrations from time to time.The Minister of Defence said that the Chiefs of Staff, in areport appended to his memorandum, had explained that under present arrangements the Forces could not have enough trained mento meet their current commitments. To meet these commitments,they would have favoured a period of service of two years, but they recognised that this was politically and economically impracticable.A working party had studied the means by which a period ofNational Service of eighteen months could be adjusted to meet theneeds of the Forces, and the recommendations now submitted to theCabinet were based on this investigation. Some curtailment of overseas commitments would, however, be required if the period ofservice were not extended beyond eighteen months.The Cabinet first considered the position, of each of the three services. The Royal Navy did not depend on National Service mento the same extent as the other two Services, but the Board ofAdmiralty agreed that in present circumstances an increase ofservice from twelve to eighteen months was desirable and wouldmake it possible to give a. longer period of sea-service to NationalService men. The strength of the Royal Air Force would declineseriously after 1st January, 1949, if the period of service remained at twelve months. Even more serious would be the reduction in thenumber of trained men. With eighteen months&apos; service there wouldbe a substantial increase in the trained man-power available. Inthe Army the need for an extended period of service arose mainly from the fact that, as the international tension had not eased tothe extent assumed when the National Service scheme was originallyintroduced, it was necessary to use the National Service man as atrained soldier, often at some distance from this country. A periodof service of eighteen months would be barely enough to enable theArmy to maintain the necessary garrisons overseas. Attention was drawn to the summary statement (in paragraph 17 of the War office memorandum appended to the report by the Chiefs of Staff annexed to CP. (48) 276) of the consequences of extending the period ofservice to eighteen months only. It was generally agreed that allpossible steps should be taken to lessen the consequences thereindicated.........The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that acceptance of thepresent proposals should not be regarded as committing him at thisstage to any particular figure of expenditure on defence in thefinancial year &quot;1948-49. Nor should it be assumed that the total strength of the Forces would be increased if the period of service were extended to eighteen months. The object of the proposals wasto secure more efficient Forces, not larger Forces.The Minister of Defence said that, while these proposals neednot in themselves commit the Government to increased expenditureon defence, it would, in his view, be impossible to avoid some increasein the Service Estimates for the coming year. The demands arisingfrom our overseas commitment had not been relaxed to the extentoriginally assumed, and the organisation of the Forces had beenimpaired by the economies imposed in the financial crisis of theprevious summer. The Cabinet were now asking that the forces should be brought to a higher state of preparedness against the riskof an. early emergency. If resources could not be provided to meet all the needs of the Forces, the best remedy might be to reduce someof our overseas commitments.The Cabinet next discussed the basis on which the increasedperiod of service should be defended in Parliament.  The argument
that under present arrangements the Forces would become seriouslyunbalanced Ster 1st January, 1949, would not in itself be convincingsince it would be argued that this could have been foreseen. Thechangeshould[rather be justified on the ground that the internationalhad not eased and that we had not been relieved of our over-seas commitments to the extent originaUy assumed. These con-tfnuing commitments overseas made Tt difficult to secure balancedForces If the international situation had been improving as theGovernment had earlier assumed that it would, some dislocationwithin the Services could have been accepted; but in present circum-stances the risk could not be taken. The emphasis should be onthe need for trained and efficient Forces, rather than for largerForces. Detailed information could be given about the strength of the  United States Forces and their period of national service(21 months): this would serve to show that international commit-ments had led the United States Government to require an evenlonger period of service than was contemplated in this country andthat the United States was preparing to make its contribution inmen as well as money.Reference was then made to the character of the training atpresent being given to National Service men and its effect on the willingness of National Service men to volunteer for a further periodof service with the regular Forces. The rate of recruitment to theregular Forces equalled anything which had been achieved beforethe war; but larger numbers were now required, and every effort should be made to improve upon the present rate of recruitment.There was no doubt that hitherto National Service, particularly inthe Army, had involved a substantial waste of man-power. after an initial period of intensive training, National Service men hadbeen left with little to do or had been employed on menial tasks,and this had given rise to widespread discontent. The reportsof the Wood Committee had shown that there was considerable scope for improvement and steps were being taken to implement its recommendations. Government spokesmen would have to admit that the situation had not been satisfactory and must be in a positionto give as specific information as was practicable about the steps that were being taken to rectify matters.The Cabinet then considered the following points of detailarising on the proposed legislation : (a) Medical and dental students and registered medical prac-practitioners and dentists would be made liable to call-up for NationalService up to the age of thirty instead of twenty-six. This changehad been agreed with the Health Departments independently of thepresent proposals for increasing the period of service.(&amp;) A National Service man who joined one of the auxiliary forces after he had completed his period of whole-time service was now liable both for his reservist liabilities and for the more exactingtraining liabilities of the Auxiliary Forces. This position shouldbe so adjusted as to encourage recruiting for the Auxiliary Forces.(c) It seemed to be reasonable to maintain the total period of reserve liability at sixty days, although the period during whichit had to be performed was being reduced from six to four years.(d) Care would have to be taken to ensure that the gradualraising of the age of call-up (which would result from the defermentof registrations) did not cause unnecessary disturbance to Universitycareers. At present young men going to a University could performtheir national service between school and University, and it was desirable to maintain this position so far as was practicable.The Cabinet were informed that the Government&apos;s proposals would be outlined at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour party on Wednesday, 24th November, and that thereafter the Bill wouldbe formally introduced. The Bill should come before the legislation committee not later than Thursday, 25th November, and bepublished later in the same day. The Second Reading would betaken on Thursday, 2nd December, and it was hoped that the bill would pass through all its stages before the Christmas Recess.
115CM. 75 (48)The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals put forward by the Minister ofDefence in CP.&quot; (48) 276.(2) Authorised the Minister of Labour, subject to the usualreference to the Legislation Committee, to introduce aBill making the necessary amendments in the NationalService Act.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for War to submit to theDefence Committee a detailed statement of the steps which were being taken to ensure that more effective usewas made of the period of training of National Servicemen in the Army.Service Pay 4.   The Minister of Defence said that the pay and allowances and of regular members of the Armed Forces had now been reviewed,Allowances.     in the light of experience of the practical working of the new pay(Previous        codes introduced in 1946; and the Chancellor of the ExchequerReference:      had agreed that certain improvements might now be made.   ForCM.(46)20th   officers, no increase in basic pay was proposed; but marriageConclusions,     allowances were to be increased by 3s. Od. a day for officers accommo-Minute 5.)      dated in married quarters and by 6s. Od. a day for officers not soaccommodated.  As regards other ranks, there was no case for any increase in the basic pay of recruits or men with no special tradequalifications or other Service qualifications.   For men with higherqualifications or higher rank, however, pay increases were proposedranging from %d. a day for privates or their equivalent to Is. Qd.a day for sergeants and warrant officers.   There would also beincreases in the marriage allowances ranging from 7s. Od. a week for corporals and lower ranks to 11s. Od. a week for warrant officers.National Service men would not receive these increases in the marriage allowances or, during their first year of service, any increases of pay. It was, however, proposed that the Service emolu-ments of National Service men should be supplemented by a systemof National Service Grants designed, like the War Service grants of the war years, to meet cases of special hardship.The gross cost of these proposals would be not more than 12^ million a year. The net cost, taking account of taxation,would be about  10^ million, of which only about  2^ million would be payable to officers.These changes were to be announced in Parliament on24th November, and a White Paper explaining them in detail wouldbe presented to Parliament immmediately thereafter.The Cabinet-Took note With approval of the improvements to be madein Service pay and allowances.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,22nd November, 1948.
