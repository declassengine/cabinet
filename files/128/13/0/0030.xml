Parliament. 1    ^Ae Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business business in     to be taken in the House of Commons during the following week,the House of Three days would be devoted to the Second Reading of the IronCommons. and Steel Bill. The debate would be opened on 15th November byIron and the Minister of Supply, and on 16th November by the Chancellor ofSteel Bill. the Exchequer; the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Supply(Previous (Mr. J. Hi Jones), would intervene at an appropriate stage on the reference: second or third day; and the Lord President would reply to theC.M.(48)66th   debate on 17th November.Conclusions, It was likely that the Opposition would feel unable to agreeMinute 2.) to a voluntary timetable for this Bill, and in that event it wouldbe necessary to have recourse to the guillotine procedure. It was contemplated that thirty mornings should be allotted for the Com-mittee Stage, for which some afternoon sittings could also bearranged, four days for the Report Stage and one for third reading. The Cabinet authorised the Lord President and the chief whip to proceed on that basis.The Bill should reach the House of Lords by the middle of May.The Lord Privy Seal said that he had hoped that it would reach the lords earlier. If it were not there rejected on Second Reading,substantial amendments would probably be made in Committee;and a good deal of time would then be needed towards theend of the Session for proceedings designed to secure agreementbetween the two Houses. On the other nand, it was pointed outthat, as the Bill might be rejected by the House of Lords and haveto be enacted under the Parliament Act procedure, it was speciallyimportant that it should leave the Commons in a form in which itcould be passed into law without further amendment. There was,therefore, little prospect of reducing the time proposed for its passage through the Commons.The Cabinet took note that the Wireless Telegraphy Bill had secured a Second Reading in the Commons, but considered thatsome concessions might have to be made in Committee on the pro-visions for controlling the use of electrical apparatus which causedinterference with broadcasting or navigational wireless.In discussion the suggestion was made that the enforcement ofthese provisions in respect of private premises should be delayed until administrative measures had been taken to extinguish all inter-ference from apparatus in public institutions. The government ought also to be satisfied that adequate supplies were available ofthe equipment required to remedy interference by existing electricalapparatus.The Lord President undertook to arrange for these and other suggestions to be considered, before the Committee Stage of the Bill,by the Ministers in charge of the Departments most directly concerned.Debate on the The Cabinet expressed their appreciation of the efficiency shownAddress. by the Government Whips in securing so large an attendance ofGovernment supporters for the final Division at the conclusion ofthe Debate on the Address.WirelessTelegraphyBill.(previous reference erence:CM.

(48) 260) on the holding of elections for the CityAssembly and magistrate of Berlin.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (Lord Henderson) said that the term of office of the assembly and magistrate had ended on 20th October. Elections were originallyto have been held on 24th October, but the date had been postponed until 5th December. The Soviet authorities had from the outsetbeen hostile to this proposal, and had made their approval subjectto a number of conditions which were wholly inconsistent with the
holding of free elections. The -Foreign Secretary had originallyconsidered that, if elections could not be held for the whole of berlin, it would be preferable that the existing City Council should carry on as a caretaker Government: he had been anxious to avoidelections for the western sectors of the city only, which would involvethe final division of the City Administration. The Germans, how-ever, felt bound by their Constitution to hold elections, even if this were possible only in the western sectors; and they feared that, ifthe City Council remained in office beyond its legal term, it wouldbe declared by the Communists to be unconstitutional and unrepre-sentative. Moreover, it now seemed clear that the Soviet authorities were determined in any event to destroy the authority of the CityAdministration and to replace it, in their own sector, by one nonii-nated by themselves. In these circumstances, the Foreign Secretaryrecommended that nothing should be done to prevent the germans from holding elections in the western sectors of the city on 5thDecember.The British Military Governor said that the British authoritiesin Berlin had been apprehensive about the consequences of allowingelections to be held in the western sectors only; for they had feared that this would give the Soviet authorities an excuse for repudiatingthe City Assembly and magistrate. The United States authoritiesin Berlin had, however, taken the opposite view and were determined to allow the elections to be held in their sector. Moreover, theGermans themselves were most anxious to go forward with theelections in the western sectors; and it was clear that their resistance to Soviet encroachment, in the battle of Berlin, would be weakenedif they were prevented from making this demonstration againstCommunist attempts to dominate their eity. He therefore supported the proposal made in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum.The Cabinet Agreed that, in the circumstances described, elections forthe City Assembly and magistrate might be held in thewestern sectors of Berlin on 5th December.Cyrenaica. 3:   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Foreign(Previous Secretary and the Secretary of State for War (CP. (48) 261)Reference: covering draft Trusteeship and other Agreements for CyrenaicaCM. (48) 5th. prepared by the interdepartmental working party of officials which conclusions, had been appointed in pursuance of the Cabinefs conclusion of minute 2.) 19th January.The Prime Minister said that members of the Cabinet wouldhave had little time in which to study this lengthy document, whichhad only been circulated to them on the previous day; and hesuggested that, before they took a final decision,, the details ofthe draft should be studied on their behalf by a small committeeof Ministers. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster mightpreside over this committee, which should include the Minister ofDefence, the Secretaries of State for War and commonwealth relations and Ministers representing the Treasury, Foreign Office,and Colonial Office.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to convene a meeting of the Ministers directly concerned, toexamine the draft Agreements annexed to CP. (48) 261*and to. submit their recommendations for consideration at the Cabinefs meeting on 18th November.
4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP: (48) 255) covering a report on the economicsituation.The following points were made in discussion: The employment figures for September had become availablesince the report was circulated. They showed an increase of 30,000in the total working population and an increase of 46,000 in thenumbers in civil employment, including a rise of 27,000 in manu-facturing industries. An increase of 20,000 in the numbers unem-ployed was largely due to the ending of certain seasonal employ-ments. There had been no disproportionate increase of unemploy-ment in the development areas where, on the whole, the position was very encouraging. Merseyside, however, gave cause for some anxiety : in recent months there had been a steady increase inthe numbers unemployed there. The recent decision to scheduleit as a development area would enable the Government to take more drastic measures to meet this problem, and the possibilities ofestablishing alternative industries there were being examined.The man-power problems of the mining industry had recentlybeen investigated by the Joint Committee on Production appointedby the National Coal Board and the National Union of Mineworkers.Their report showed that it would be inadvisable to set the industry&apos;sman-power target for 1949 above 736,000.In the first ten months of 1948 the number of days lost throughlabour disputes amounted to 1,800,000 as compared with 2,100,000in the same period of 1947. These figures were strikingly less thanthose for the corresponding period after the 1914-18 war.The results of the recent drive for increased coal production had been disappointing : the rate of absenteeism was high, particu-larly for Saturday shifts. The Minister of Fuel and Power wasabout to submit a paper to the Production Committee dealing withthe whole question of future coal production. There was a serious risk that output in 1949 might be affected by unrest in the coalfields,particularly in Scotland, Yorkshire and South Wales, resultingfrom the increasing tension between Communists and non-Communists. The Minister undertook to keep in close touch withthose of his colleagues who had personal experience of mining areas with a view to devising means of checking the spread of suchtrouble.Stocks of low quality coal continued to grow; and, unless these were distributed for home consumption, it would not be possibleto fulfil our export commitments under the European recovery programme. The National Coal Board had been asked to take special steps to reduce these stocks.Attention was drawn to the figures in Table II on p. 7 of cp. (48) 255 which showed that the output of mining machineryhad fallen substantially short of the approved targets. It was explained that the targets had been set too high. The same explana-tion applied to the apparent shortfall in the production of rayonstaple fibre.It was possible that there might be some slowing up in therate of increased productivity, but it was too early to reach any definite conclusions on this. There were signs that industry wasresponding to the current efforts to stimulate interest in this problem.In England and Wales it had now been possible to bring thehousing programme into balance. Latterly it had been necessary,for this purpose, to make some increase in the number of housesstarted and this had been secured without any increase in tenderprices. The wage increase of 3d. an hour had been absorbed in greater efficiency. Except for timber and steel, building materialsWere no longer scarce; and a large area of repair and maintenance work, both on houses and other types of building, had been freed from licensing control. There was now some risk that the control which had been maintained over housing costs might be undermined
external trade,Balance ofPayments.Prices.by rising prices on other building work. It was therefore suggestedthat the Headquarters Building Committee should consider what should, and could, be done to check increases in the cost of buildingother than house construction.In Scotland new house-building had been confined to certain areas, and the attempts to bring the programme into balance hadmeant that in many areas it had not been possible to make a starttowards meeting even the most urgent requirements. This made it all the more essential that in Scotland a careful watch shouldbe kept on the construction of factories and commercial buildings.Great discontent would be caused if there were a noticeable increasein such building in areas where the building of new houses hadnot been started.Considerable progress had been made in many areas in thebuilding of houses for rural workers, though care was still requiredto ensure that housing got its due share of the available materials and labour, as compared with the repair of farm buildings. the reconditioning of rural houses would be dealt with in legislation which the Minister of Health &quot;hoped to introduce at an early date.The daily average of the export figures for October was equiva-lent to the record figures reached in July; and the gap betweenimports and exports in that month was lower than it had beensince January 1947.The balance of payments situation was not unsatisfactory. but our gold and dollar reserves were being reduced by delays inobtaining payments under the European Recovery Programme.There was a serious risk that, when the second allocation under theEconomic Co-operation Act came up for consideration, Congressmight be disposed to deduct from it any unspent balances from thefirst allocation; and it Was, therefore, important that every effort should be made to bring reimbursements into line with expenditure by the end of the year.There had been a marked improvement in. the terms of trade.During recent months, the pressure of United States competition for goods and materials in non-dollar markets had noticeablydecreased. Some doubt was expressed whether this improvementwas adequately reflected in retail prices, but it was pointed out thatretailers had not been unresponsive to the policy set out in theWhite Paper on Personal Incomes, Costs and Prices. reductions in raw material prices were likely to be reflected in reduced prices for clothing and footwear in 1949.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of CP. (48) 255 and of the points made in discussion.(2) Agreed that the Headquarters Building Committee should consider what should, and could, be done to checkincreases in the cost of factory and commercial building and other types of building work outside the housing programme.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,11th November, 1948.
