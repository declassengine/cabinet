Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.Germany.CurrencySituationin Berlin.(previous reference:CM. (48) 73rdConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business to be taken in the House of Commons in the following week.2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda (CP. (48) 285and 297) by the Foreign Secretary on the currency situation inBerlin.The Foreign Secretary explained that, since the earlier of thesetwo memoranda had been circulated, there had been further developments which were set out in his later paper. The SovietGovernment had taken various steps which had effectively dividedthe city administration in Berlin into two parts; and it was on this account easier for us to introduce into the western sectors of thecity the currency system most convenient to those sectors. Hethought that it could now be decided in principle that the westernmark should be introduced as the sole currency in the western sectors c&apos; the city; and he recommended that the Governments ofthe United States and France should be asked to join with us ininstructing the three Military Governors to consider the method and timing of the change. It could be left to the Military Governorsto decide, after confidential consultation with the Germans, whethercourse C or course D in CP. (48) 285 should be adopted.The United States authorities wished to make an immediate announcement to the effect that the western mark would be introduced into the western sectors of the city. The Foreign Secretary saidthat he did not favour making such an announcement while the currency situation in Berlin was still being considered by theCommittee of Experts appointed by the Security Council. Frominformal soundings which he had taken he was satisfied that suchan announcement would have an unfortunate effect on the othermembers of the Security Council. The Committee of Experts were due to present their report by 31st December; and it would take atleast three weeks for the Military Governors to work out detailed arrangements for introducing the western mark into the western sectors of the city. By the time that these plans were ready, thereport of the Committee of Experts should be available; and itwould be possible to consider then, in the light of that report, theform which any public announcement should take. If the cabinet endorsed his view, he would seek to dissuade the United StatesGovernment from announcing any decision : he believed that theFrench Government would support him in his view that no annouce-ment should be made until the report of the Committee of Expertswas available.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in CP. (48) 297; and invited theForeign Secretary to seek agreement with the Govern-ments of the United States and France that the threeMilitary Governors should be instructed to work outplans for introducing the western mark as the solecurrency in the western sectors of Berlin.(2) Agreed that a final decision on the method of making this change and on the date of its introduction should be deferred until the Committee of Experts appointed bythe Security Council had presented their report, and thatno public announcement should be made in the meantime.
India.Kashmir.(previous reference erence:CM. (48) 13thConclusions,Minute 4.)Naval 4.   The Cabinet were informed that the Home and Mediter-Exerolses In ranean Fleets were due to meet at Gibraltar and carry out exercisesthe Mediter- in the Mediterranean on 7th-9th March. The suggestion had beenranean. made that certain units of the United States Fleet now in theMediterranean might be asked to join in these exercises. Before any approach was made to the United States Admiral in the Mediter-ranean the Admiralty wished to be assured that there were no political reasons against extending such an invitation.The Foreign Secretary said that he did not wish to raise any objection on political grounds.In further discussion the suggestion was made that units ofthe French Fleet might also be invited to take part in these exercises.The Minister of Defence said that he would like to have anopportunity to discuss the matter with the Chiefs of Staff before a final decision was taken, in view of possible repercussions in other directions.The Cabinet Agreed that, if the Chiefs of Staff desired that units ofthe United States Fleet, or of the French Fleet, should join in the exercises which the Home and Mediterranean Fleetswere to hold in the Mediterranean on 7th-9th March, therewere no political objections to their participating in theexercises.Service PayandAllowances.Women&apos;services.(previous reference:CM. (48) 75thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister ofDefence (CP. (48) 295) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer(CP. (48) 296) on the rates of pay, pensions and gratuities to befixed for the women&apos;s Services in consequence of their establishmentas a permanent part of the Armed Forces.The Minister of Defence said that a decision on the rates of pay for these Services had been outstanding for more than two years,and from the Parliamentary point of view it was important thata statement should be made on the subject in the following week.Members of these Services were specially anxious that there should3. The Prime Minister reported to the Cabinet the latest information about the position in Kashmir. The Government ofIndia maintained that the objective of their present operations wasstrictly limited; and the United Kingdom High Commissioner inIndia had expressed the view that a general offensive was not intended, or indeed practicable, during the winter. The PrimeMinister of Pakistan took a different view of the position and hadthreatened that the Pakistan forces would take the offensive if theIndian Army continued their existing operations. It was difficultto form a reliable impression of the intentions of either side, andeven more difficult to judge whether any further advice from theUnited Kingdom Government was likely to be helpful.In discussion the point was made that, if the situation deteriorated further, it was possible that the Soviet government might intervene, not directly in support of either party, but by encouraging Afghanistan to exploit this opportunity for raidingacross the frontier.Reference was also made to the proposal that the security council should appoint an independent person of high standing to supervise the holding of a plebiscite in Kashmir. It seemed possiblethat the United States Government would be reluctant to allow a united States citizen to undertake this duty.The Cabinet-Took note of the position.
be a fixed ratio between their rates of pay and those of men in theForces; and he was glad that the Chancellor of the Exchequer wasnot now pressing for special rates of pay for women. He recom-mended a ratio of four-fifths of the pay of corresponding grades inthe men&apos;s Services, because the women&quot;s Services were now fully .integrated with the Armed Forces and they would expect to betreated on the same principle as had been regarded as reasonable inthe past in other Services, notably the Civil Service, where womenreceived four-fifths of the rates of pay for men. He recommendedthat the pensions and gratuities should similarly be four-fifths of theamounts paid in similar circumstances to men. The estimated costof the proposed improved pay for women was  900,000 a year onthe present enlisted strengths, and  1,300,000 a year on the targetstrengths. The Chancellor of the Exchequer added that, if the costof pensions and gratuities were included, the eventual annual cost would be  1,500,000 and  2,100,000 on the present and the targetstrengths, respectively.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he could not acceptthe argument that, taking the women&apos;s Services as a whole, women were performing comparable services to the men in the armed forces. This differentiated the Armed Forces from the CivilService. The Royal GomvSsion on Equal Pay had pointed to the distinction between the \ iies of men and women in the Forces,notably to the fact that v. omen were not required to use personallethal weapons. In the higher grades of the women&apos;s Services, the responsibilities were not as serious as those which had to be borneby an officer who was responsible for the lives of his men. he therefore hoped that it would be practicable to maintain a differencebetween the pay of men and women in the Armed Forces, even ifequal pay were conceded elsewhere; but that would not be possible if at this stage the four-fifths ratio were adopted. An increase ofthe ratio to four-fifths involved substantial increases, notably in thehigher ranks; and in this connection it had to be borne in mind thatpensions were also being granted for the first time. The proposalsof the Minister of Defence were likely to lead to a demand forincreased pay for nurses in the Services; and this, in turn, wouldhave repercussions on the pay of civilian nurses and of other civilianworkers. Even if it were decided, against his advice, to adopt thefour-fifths ratio for pay, he saw no justification for adopting thesame ratio for pensions. The average regular soldier retiring at, say,the age of 45, had far heavier family responsibilities than a womanretiring at the same age. The pensions now being granted to thewomen&apos;s Services for the first time should not be more than one-half,or at most two-thirds, of the pensions for men in correspondinggrades.In discussion, reference was made to the following further points : (a) For certain classes of work in the Services, notably theRoyal Air Force, men and women were fully interchangeable.Moreover, since they had now been fully integrated with the armed forces, members of the women&apos;s Services were liable to be posted toany part of the world. There remained, however, certain markeddifferences, e.g., members of the W.R.N.S. were not liable to sea-service.(&amp;) There was a strong feeling in the women&apos;s Services thatthey should, under the new conditions, be paid a fixed proportion ofthe men&apos;s rates. From the point of view of morale, it was important to express the new rates in this way and not as special scales forwomen.(c) Only a handful of women would receive the substantial increases in pay which the four-fifths ratio would give to the migher ranks in the women&apos;s Services. Although their responsibilities weredifferent in kind from those of officers in command of combatant
units, the administration of women&apos;s Services in the Armed ForcesEresented difficult and delicate problems which placed a heavyurden of responsibility on those who were in charge and called fora high standard of ability and integrity.(d) Apart from the W.R.NTS., the women&apos;s Services were unlikely to be able-to recruit the numbers required unless theconditions of service were made more attractive. The A.T.S. had so far recruited only 12,000, against a target of 18,000, and theW.A.A.F. 14,000 out of 26,000.(e) The repercussions on civil employment of giving thewomen&apos;s Services four-fifths of the men&apos;s pay had to be considered.Admittedly the ratio was already four-fifths for administrative andclerical grades in the Civil Service, and even higher for some ranks of the women police; but in industry women only received, on anaverage, about three-fifths of the pay of men, and the women&apos;organisations would use the Service analogy to press for higher rates for women. The substantial increases in pay involved inthe four-fifths ratio would also lay the Government open to the criticism that they were departing from the principles laid downin the White Paper on Personal Incomes, Costs and Prices.(/) It was not necessary that the ratio for pensions and gratuities should be the same as for pay. The average woman whoreceived four-fifths or three-quarters of the pension paid to a manin a corresponding grade would be in a much better financial posi-tion, because of the family responsibilities of the man.&quot;(g) It was again suggested that further interdepartmentalmachinery should be established for ensuring that the repercussions of proposals for the improvement of pay and of conditions of service,particularly in the sector of public employment, were fully examinedbefore Ministers were asked to take decisions upon them.The Cabinet Agreed that the rates of pay in the women&apos;s Services ofthe Armed Forces should be fixed at three-quarters of thecorresponding rates for men, and that pensions and gratuities should be two-thirds of the corresponding ratesfor men.economic affairs.(previous reference:CM. (48) 70thConclusions,Minute 4;)Man-Power.Production.6. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (48) 288) covering a report on the economicsituation.The following points were made in discussion :-Attention was drawn to the continuing shortage of man-power in the mining industry : the results of the recruitment drive had fallen short of expectations. The question was raised whether therewas any evidence of political interference with production in theindustry. The Cabinet were informed that the Communist leaders in the industry had been careful to avoid opposing the productiondrive, though individual Communists among the miners might havebeen following or advocating a &quot;go slow &quot;&apos; policy. A more seriouscause for anxiety was the recent increase in involuntary absenteeismdue to sickness. This had become evident since 5th July, and it seemed possible that it was due to the increased rates of sickness benefit. It was agreed that this point should be investigated inrelation to industry generally. - .Some increase in the output of opencast coal might be expectednext year. Experience had shown, however, that projects for theexpansion of opencast operations were often delayed by the difficultyof Obtaining the agreement of interested Departments, and theMinister of Fuel and Power was considering whether some special machinery for interdepartmental consultation should be proposedwith the object of reducing such, delays.
145CM. 79 (-18)169Building. If permanent aluminium houses were included, the number ofnew permanent houses completed in Great Britain during Octoberhad been 19,741.External The export figures for November were the highest by valueTrade. ever achieved; and by volume they had almost reached the target for the end of the year. Although imports had also been high,the adverse visible balance of trade was the lowest for two years.While these figures were admittedly encouraging, the slow expansionof exports to hard-currency countries gave cause for some anxiety.The trade position with Switzerland and Belgium was particularlyunsatisfactory: it seemed likely that gold payments amounting toover  39 million might have to be made to the latter in 1948-49.Attention was drawn to the facts that, in spite of the gradual reduction in our adverse trade balance, a number of currencieswere tending to become hard while, on the other hand, substantialdrawings were being made on the sterling balances. These factssuggested that large favourable balances were being accumulatedin certain countries, and it was suggested that it might be helpful if the Treasury were to identity these and to advise whether special steps should be taken to divert exports away from them.Balance of The net gold and dollar deficit in November had risen sharplyPayments. to  46 million : this was due mainly to heavy drawings by Indiaunder her agreement, and to a normal seasonal increase in imports.Dollar expenditure during the current quarter had fallen short ofthe approved Departmental programmes, and some embarrassmentmight result from the substantial discrepancy between the actualfigures of our current dollar deficit and the estimates submittedearlier to the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation.Delays in reimbursement by the Economic Co-operation Adminis-tration had made it necessary to sell further gold, but arrangements had now been made which reduced delays in making reimbursements.Prices. Since the last report, the terms of trade had changed for the worse. This was largely due to increased prices payable under long-term agreements. Tor the moment no reduction could be expected in the indices of retail and wholesale prices, though it was hopedthat some improvement might take place in the spring as the resultof reductions in clothing prices.Wage Rates. The National Union of Raihvaymen had pressed their claim for a general wage increase of 12s. Qd. a week, in spite of the factthat they had not been supported by the National Railway Shop-men&apos;s Council. The Railway Executive had made an offer of 2s. aweek, which had been refused and subsequently withdrawn. TheSecretary of the Union had then reported the existence of a dispute,and it was probable that it would be referred to arbitration, by either the National Arbitration Tribunal, or the Industrial Court,within a few days.Bilateral Shipments of meat from the Argentine were falling far belowNegotiations. the levels fixed by the Andes Agreement, and it was possible thatthe Argentine Government were deliberately reducing the shipmentswith a view to strengthening their hands in the forthcoming trade negotiations. If supplies could not be increased, an early reductionin the meat ration would be unavoidable.It was suggested that the President and Government ofArgentina might be unaware of the extent to which Senor Mirandahad failed to carry out the requirements of the Andes Agreement,and that they might be sensitive to any suggestion that Argentinahad defaulted on an international agreement. The general viewof Ministers was, therefore, that the Foreign Secretary should make representations to the Argentine Foreign Secretary against hisGovernments failure to carry out its obligations under the AndesAgreement. It might also be necessary for us to take retaliatory action; and it would therefore be desirable to review urgentlythe working of the Andes Agreement as&apos; a whole and to consider what effective retaliatory action could be taken in the event of the
continued default of the Argentine Government. The full circum-stances should also be explained to the public in advance of any reduction in the meat ration; and the Argentine Government shouldbe made clearly aware that full publicity would be given to theirfailure to honour their agreements.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of CP. (48) 288 and of the points made in discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour, in consultation with theMinister of National Insurance, to consider and reportto th? Cabinet whether the recent increase in the ratesof sickness benefit had resulted in any increase ofabsenteeism in industry.(3) Invited the Ministers concerned to furnish the Chancellorof the Exchequer with detailed information, for inclu-sion in the next Economic Report, on recent relaxationsof economic controls.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Presidentof the Board of Trade to consider what steps could betaken, whether by the diversion of exports or otherwise,to draw down our favourable trade balances with certainsoft currency countries and to secure a correspondingimprovement in our balance of payments with hard currency countries.(5) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forthe Departments concerned to review the working of theAndes Agreement and to consider what retaliatorymeasures might be taken in the event of the continuedfailure of the Argentine Government to fulfil their obligations under the Agreement.(6) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider, in the light ofthe report made to him in pursuance of Conclusion (5),how best to frame his representations to the ArgentineForeign Minister regarding the failure of the argentine government to observe the terms of the AndesAgreement.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,9th December, 1948.
