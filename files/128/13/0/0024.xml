slativeramme for1948-49ion.iviousirence:(47)80thilusions,ite 2.)1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president, (CP. (48) 230) submitting for their approval the finalProgramme of Government Legislation for the 1948-49 Session.They also had before them a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (CP. (48) 235) setting out the arguments in favour of introducing a Motorways Bill at the beginning of the Session.The Lord President said that the Future Legislation Com-mittee had felt some doubt whether the inclusion of a MotorwaysBill in the Programme would be justified but, after discussing thematter with the Minister of Transport, he was satisfied that therewas a case for introducing the Bill in the 1948-49 Session.The Minister of Transport explained that motorways would be constructed only where all-purpose roads could not be improved oradapted to serve the reasonable needs of motor traffic with safety and economy. Motorways were cheaper to build and used less landthan all-purpose roads and, since other forms of traffic than motor vehicles could be denied access to them, they could be preserved fortheir proper use. The passage of the Bill would enable the road system of the country to be properly planned and would not leadto any material increase in the annual expenditure which would otherwise be incurred on roads.Other points in discussion were : (a) If it were found necessary to introduce a National service bill it would rank as a major Bill, and the Minister of Labour wouldbe primarily responsible for it.(6) The Foreign Secretary attached importance to the earlypassage of the proposed Consular Convention Bill.The Cabinet-Approved Groups I to VI of the Annex to CP. (48) 230as the Legislative Programme for the 1948-49 Session, and invited the Legislation Committee to keep the Programmeunder review.2. The Lord President said that it would be necessary todecide before the new Session began whether, as in previous sessions of the present Parliament, the Government should take private members&apos; time. In earlier Sessions it had been possible to argue that this was inevitable because of the congestion of government business, but on this occasion the taking of Private Members&apos; time would have to be justified on the ground that the House could make better use of any available time in other ways than in debates on private Members&apos; Motions or Bills. It was estimated that in thecoming Session it would not be possible, without interfering withthe Governments Legislative Programme, to make available to private Members more than six Fridays between the opening of the session and Christmas; and, if this time were to be given, he wouldbe in favour of offering it for Motions rather than Bills, In his view, however, the offer of such a limited amount of time would beregarded by the House as derisory, and past experience of the useof Private Members&apos; time led him to the conclusion that any avail-able time would be much better used if it were devoted to debates on subjects of general interest agreed on between the Governmentand the Opposition.In discussion it was urged in favour of the abolition of private members&apos; time that, with a Government which aimed at carryingout a positive programme, the House had to consider a much largervolume of Government legislation than in the past and that it couldprofitably devote more time to the review of administration. Itwould, therefore, be wasteful to devote time to the discussion ofMotions or Bills which were often of no more than academic interestand sometimes embarrassing to the Government. It was also main-tained that there was no keen demand for the restoration of Private36113-1b 2.
Members&apos; time among the newer Members of the House, and that private Members&apos; time was of no real value fo Opposition Members,who in practice found their most effective opportunities for inter-vention in the discussion of Government business.On the other hand, it was argued that a decision to abolishPrivate Members&apos; time should not be taken lightly. Though it was true that in past Sessions much of this time had been wasted, its 1abolition would do away with an essential element in the character gof the House, would encroach on the rights of the Opposition andwould deprive individual Members of opportunities for displayingtheir abilities and their independence. Moreover, many usefulmeasures which would not have been introduced as Government bills had been successfully brought forward by Private Members. Forthese reasons the preponderant view in Cabinet was in favour of restoring Private Members&apos; time in some degree during the 1948-49Session, and Ministers were, on the whole, inclined to make time available for Bills rather than Motions, though it was recognisedthat, if six Fridays were given for Second Reading debates on private members&apos; Bills, the Government would be obliged to make sometime available later in the Session for the remaining stages of anyBills that might receive a Second Reading.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that there should be some restoration ofPrivate Members&apos; time in the 1948-49 Session.(2) Invited the Lord President and the Chief Whip to consider how best to give effect to this decision, having regard tothe general view that it would be better to devote any private Members&apos; time to Bills rather than to Motions.The King&apos;speeches onthe Froroga-tion and opening ofParliament.(Previous&quot;Reference:C.M.(48)58thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord President(CP. (48) 231) covering drafts of The King&apos;s Speeches on the Pro-rogation and Opening of Parliament prepared by The King&apos;speeches Committee.The Lord President said that he was grateful to the LordChancellor and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster for their help in the preparation of the drafts.In discussion a number of drafting amendments to both Speecheswere approved, and the following points were made on the draftOpening Speech : (a) In the passage about Germany the reference to the action ofthe Soviet Government in Berlin should be amended on lines suggested by the Foreign Secretary.(&amp;) No mention should be made of the Motorways Bill, the NewForest Bill or the Licensing Bill, but the reference to the territorial and Reserve Forces Bill should stand.The Cabinet-Subject to the points made in discussion, approved the draftSpeeches annexed to CP. (48) 231.Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.4. The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the probablecourse of business in the House of Commons during the first fort-night of the coming Session.The Minister of Defence said that, at their meeting on 7thOctober, the Defence Committee had agreed that the Home secretary and he should prepare a comprehensive statement on defence, to bemade during the debate on the Address. It now seemed doubtfulwhether it would be possible to reach decisions on certain major issues, such as the length of the period of national service, in timeto enable a full statement to be made so soon, and he suggested thatthe Prime Minister might, in opening the debate, explain that the
39CM. 64 (48)Government would not be in a position to make a statement on defence for some little time.It was pointed out that it would be extremely embarrassing forthe Home Secretary to have to delay any further his consultations with associations of local authorities on civil defence, and that itwould in any event be virtually impossible to dissuade the opposition from discussing defence matters at length during the debate on the address.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Defence to consider what steps could be taken to enable as full a statement as possible tobe made on defence during the debate on the Address.5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of fuel and Power (C.P. (48) 233) outlining alternative proposals forrelaxing the existing petrol rationing arrangements.The Minister of Fuel and Power explained that, when thestandard petrol ration had been introduced, it had been assumed thatthe savings achieved by the economies then made and by the suppression-sionof the black market would in a year roughly amount to the 120,000tons of petrol required to provide the standard ration. In fact, how-ever, the savings had proved to be much greater and, when thefigures were published, the motoring organisations, who had been persuaded with difficulty to support the proposals for a standardration, would undoubtedly press for some additional concessions tomotorists. On the other hand, the demands of the Services had risen,though it was not yet known what their total requirements would be,or how far they could be supplied from the United States. If itwere decided to allow more petrol to motorists, the main alternativeswere to leave the standard ration unchanged, but to stop deductingit from supplementary allowances or to adopt a proposal made by theRussell Vick Committee under which the standard ration woidd beincreased to 120 miles a month and only 60 miles a month would be deducted from supplementary allowances.The Minister of Transport recalled that when the standardration had been introduced, ne had imposed a 121 Per cent, cut inpetrol supplies on all coach hire journeys and private hire work. Ifa concession were made to the private motorist, there would be strong pressure to restore this cut. The public had, in his view, settleddown to the idea of going through the winter with the present standard ration, and he suggested that any additional savings shouldbe devoted to building up stocks for defence. If any concession hadto be made, he would prefer the proposal made by the Russell VickCommittee.The Minister of Defence supported the Minister of transport and drew attention to the seriously low level of Service stocks. Hereminded the Cabinet that the Services had interrupted their stock-building programmes earlier in the year in order to make supplies available for civil purposes.In further discussion, there was general agreement that theright course would be to leave the standard ration unchanged but to stop deducting it from supplementary allowances. This would meetthe recognised grievance of members of local authorities and other persons engaged in voluntary public work, would avoid criticism from abroad, and would make the smallest call on supplies duringthe next few months.&quot;... V&apos;    . - ..     :      .&apos;    - &apos;:v;&quot;..      -The Cabinet-Agreed that the standard petrol ration should be unchangedbut should no longer be deducted from supplementary allowances
Iron andSteel Bill.(previous reference:CM. (48) 63rdConclusions,Minute 4.)6.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the questionwhether the Iron and Steel Bill should be so drafted as to enable the assets of the iron and steel companies to be transferred to the.Corporation before the general election in 1950.The Minister of Supply said that he realised that practicaldifficulties would probably make it impossible to effect the transferbefore the general election. It seemed to him, however, that theGovernment would be in a much stronger position if they kept a freehand in this matter by providing that the order appointing a day for the transfer should not be subject to Parliamentary proceedings.It was true that the corresponding orders in previous socialisationmeasures had been subject to annulment by Parliament, but it could fairly be argued that the appointment of a day for the transfer of assets was an administrative act within the competence of theMinister.The Lord President recalled that under previous socialisationmeasures the vesting dates had been from six to nine months afterthe royal Assent and pointed out that, though some of the features of the procedure to be adopted for the socialisation of the iron andsteel industry could be held to justify a shorter period, it was difficult to see how the necessary business connected with the transferof assets could be reasonably transacted within a period of two orthree months. There was no doubt much to be said on merits for not making the order in question subject to Parliamentary pro-ceedings, but it was difficult to depart from precedent in thisparticular case.In further discussion, there was general agreement that it wouldbe preferable to provide in the Bill that the transfer should takeplace on a specified date, e.g., 31st March, 1950, fixed on the assump-tion that the Bill would pass during the 1948-49 Session, and toconfer on the Minister power to vary this date by order.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the socialisation of Industries Committee to consider whether the date forthe transfer of assets could be fixed by the methodsuggested in discussion.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) and to the modification of Clause4 to which they had agreed at their meeting on 15thOctober, approved the draft Iron and Steel Bill annexed to CP. (48) 227.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.18th October, 1948.
