Parliament.Business inthe1 House ofCommons.1. The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business to be taken in the House of Commons in the following week.The Prime Minister said that the Leader of the Opposition was anxious that the House of Commons should meet in secret session to discuss the international situation. It was questionable whetherit would be expedient to hold secret sessions in peace-time, and care-ful thought should be given to the advantages and disadvantages of this course. The Leader of the Opposition had been dissuadedfrom pressing his suggestion publicly for the time being.Wirelesi 2.   The Cabinet discussed the Parliamentary difficulties whichTelegraphy were likely to arise over the &quot;provisions in the Wireless TelegraphyBUI- Bill for controlling the use of electrical apparatus which causedinterference with broadcasting or navigational wireless.The Postmaster-General explained that these provisions were designed to enable his Department to deal more effectively with this problem. At present they had to rely on voluntary co-operation bythe users of the apparatus which was causing the interference.This was forthcoming in the great majority of cases. But theycould not always secure entry to the premises from which the inter-ference appeared to come and, even when they were able to identify the cause of the trouble and advise how it could be remedied, theowners of the apparatus were not always willing to act on thatadvice. Interference might be caused by household appliancessuch as refrigerators or electric cleaners, but the more serious inter-ference came from industrial plant and from apparatus used fordiathermy in hospitals, &amp;c. He was concerned to prevent, not onlyinterference with the reception of broadcasting, but, even more,interference with radar and wireless used for air navigation which was of great and increasing importance in the prevention ofair accidents. The provisions of the Bill could, he thought, be defended as necessary on both grounds.In discussion it was pointed out that Parliamentary criticism of these provisions was likely to centre on two points first, the pro-posed right of. entry on premises, including private houses, for thepurpose of detecting the source of interference; and, secondly, theassumption that the owner of the apparatus should defray the costof any alterations required to remove or reduce the interference.Under the first head it would be strongly urged that the extent ofthe nuisance did not warrant this invasion of private libertiesUnder the second, it would be suggested that manufacturers shouldbe required so to construct new apparatus that it would not involveinterference with wireless reception and, as regards existingapparatus, that the cost of adaptation should not fall on private owners.: It seemed likely that these criticisms would be strongly pressed,and the Government might find themselves in an embarrassingParliamentary situation. Might it not be wiser therefore to delay the Second Reading of the Bill until means had been devised ormeeting these criticisms ? Could the right of entry, for example,be confined to premises other than private dwelling-houses ? Andmight the necessary adaptation of apparatus be secured by requiringmanufacturers by regulation to make the necessary modifications,either before sale or in the process of servicing apparatus alreadysold?On the other side it was urged that these provisions could bejustified as an application to.modern circumstances of the old law of nuisance, and that people, who had bought a wireless licence were entitled to some official assistance in avoiding persistent interferencewith their reception of broadcasting. There was an even strongercase for providing the Post Office with effective means of safeguard-ing the efficiency, of radar and wireless used for purposes of air navigation, where risks to human life were directly involved.36203-2 b 2
It was the general view of the Cabinet that the balance ofadvantage lay on the side of proceeding with the Second reading of this Bill, on the understanding that the Government spokesmenwould place frankly&apos; before Parliament the conflict of interests involved and offer to consider during the Committee Stage any suggestions which would limit, without prejudicing the essentialpurposes of the Bill, any hardships or inconveniences which these provisions might involve for householders.The Cabinet Agreed to proceed with the Second Reading of the wireless Telegraphy Bill, on the basis suggested at theconclusion of their discussion; and invited the Postmaster-General to consider meanwhile what concessions might bemade if strong criticism were directed against the Bill&apos;sprovisions for reducing interference with broadcasting ornavigational wireless.North Atlantic 3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignSecurity Paot.  Secretary (C.P. (48) 249) on the major questions discussed at therecent meeting in Paris of the Consultative Council set up underthe Treaty of Brussels.The Foreign Secretary recalled that, after exploratory discus-sions between officials representing the Governments of the UnitedKingdom, the United States and Canada, a document laying down the lines of a North Atlantic Pact had been submitted to those governments in September. This had been approved by the DefenceCommittee on 7th October (D.O. (48) 20th Meeting, Minute 1).When the matter came before the Consultative Council, it had beenagreed that the United States and Canadian Governments shouldbe informed that the Brussels Treaty Powers were now prepared toenter into a Treaty with those Governments on North Atlanticdefence; and that each Government should thereafter instruct itsrepresentative on the Permanent Commission established by theTreaty of Brussels what attitude he should adopt towards the detailed proposals made in the Annex to the Report of the Wash-ington Talks. The representatives of the Five Powers in Washing-ton and Ottawa had subsequently been instructed to make a con-certed approach to the United States and Canadian governments on these lines, and Ministers had now to consider what instructions should be given to the United Kingdom representative on thePermanent Commission. The Foreign Secretary suggested thatthe right course was to support the conclusion of a Treaty on thegeneral lines proposed in the Annex to the Report, but &quot;to resist any proposal to extend the Treaty to cover economic, social and cultural aims. It was important that the scope of the Treaty shouldbe restricted to defence, so that co-operation under it might be clearly distinguished from co-operation in the European recovery programme. In due course, Eire, Iceland, Portugal, Denmark,Norway and, if possible, Sweden should be sounded as to their? readiness to accept an invitation to a conference for the framing of the Treaty, but there would be no advantage in attempting toinclude Italy under present circumstances. It would also be wise to exclude from the discussions for the time being any of thesecountries whose attitude seemed likely to delay the progress of thenegotiations. He proposed that the United Kingdom representative on the Permanent Commission should be instructed to suggest thatthe United States Government should convene a conference for detailed discussion of the terms of a-Treaty. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would, be represented at this conference by HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington.
There was general support for the proposals put forward by theForeign Secretary. In discussion, the following points were raised : 1(a) Some doubt was expressed about the wisdom of invitingPortugal to participate in the Pact.- The object was to create a regional security system for the defence of western democracy, andthe moral value of the Pact might be prejudiced by the inclusion ofa State whose system of government was wholly authoritarian. Inreply, it was pointed out that there were powerful strategic grounds for including Portugal in any North Atlantic defence arrange-ments : experience in the last war had shown that no scheme ofAtlantic defence could be effective without, the use of the Azores.Our object was to build up a system of regional security underArticle 51 of the United Nations Charter; and it would be unrealistic to allow the practical effectiveness of that system to be seriously weakened on account of political considerations. Moreover,the internal regime in Portugal was less objectionable than that in spain and was clearly so regarded by world opinion.(b) The Eire Government would probably attempt to securesatisfaction on the partition issue as a condition of their participa-tion in a North Atlantic Pact. The Foreign Secretary said that hewas not greatly concerned at this prospect. It was unlikely thatthey would succeed in obtaining United States support on this issue and, if they persisted in pressing the matter, they could be excluded from subsequent discussions. The Eire Government would,however, have a legitimate grievance if no approach was made tothem at all.(c) The suggestion was made that the Finnish government might wish to participate in the negotiations for a North AtlanticPact. The Foreign Secretary said that any such proposal wouldhave to be treated with great caution; for he was strongly opposedto giving any security guarantees which it would be impossible to fulfil in practice.The Cabinet-(1) Approved  the  recommendations   in  paragraph   14  of, CP. (48) 249 regarding the instructions to be given tothe United Kingdom representative in the negotiationsfor a North Atlantic Security Pact.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to circulate for their informa-tion a paper on the system of government and internal conditions in Portugal.4. The Cabinet next considered the recommendations made bythe Foreign Secretary in CP. (48) 249 with regard to the develop-ment of Western Union.The Foreign Secretary said that His Majesty&apos;s Government had for some time been under increasing pressure to agree to some further move to give concrete expression to the idea of Western Union. this pressure had come partly from France, partly from the United Statesand partly from sections of public opinion in this country; and therecent Conference at The Hague had given impetus to the movement for some form of European Federation as envisaged, for instance,in the French proposal for a &quot;Consultative Assembly.&quot; In his view, the achievements of the past year represented a notableadvance towards European unity; and he thought that the best hopeof further progress lay in adhering to this method of steady andgradual progress. No enduring results were likely to be achieved by the adoption of grandiose paper constitutions for western europe; moreover, such projects ignored the fundamental considera-tion that no such &quot; federal &quot; organs would be effective unless theywere representative of the participating Governments themselves.But it would be inadvisable to adopt a purely negative attitude
The Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendations in paragraph 29 ofC.P. (48) 249 regarding the further development of western Union.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would consult with theForeign Secretary regarding the choice of the UnitedKingdom representatives on the proposed Committee of inquiry.(3) Took note that the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations, in consultation with the Foreign Secretary,would arrange for United Kingdom High commissioners to keep Commonwealth Governments informed of developments in the matters dealt with in CP. (48) 249.Under-SeaOil in thePersian Gulf.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (48) 248) on the proposed exploitation by Britishand American petroleum companies of the oil which was believed to exist under the sea-bed of the Persian Gulf.The Foreign Secretary said that since his memorandum was circulated he had considered the matter further and, in view of thedelicacy of the political situation with respect to Persia, he would prefer to have discussion deferred for the present. Meanwhile, hewould discuss the matter with the Minister of Fuel and Power.towards this movement, particularly in view of the importance attached to it by the French Government. He had therefore sought to devise a scheme which would satisfy public opinion, without involving any commitment to the conception of European Federation.After consulting the Prime Minister, he had suggested to the consultative Council that a &quot; Council of Ministers of western europe &quot; should be established. His idea was that this council should meet at stated intervals, and that it should be composed ofGovernment delegations, the exact Ministerial representationvarying according to the agenda of the Council. A permanentsecretariat might also be created. He had further suggested thatthis system might subsequently be expanded so as to permit the participation of any German or West German Government. Ascheme on these lines would preserve the full sovereignty of the participating States and also the principle of the empirical approach to which he attached so much importance. The reception given bythe Council to this proposal was not unfavourable, and they had decided that a Committee of Inquiry should be set up to study theproblem of closer union in Europe in accordance with their dis-cussions. If the Cabinet endorsed the general lines of this approach,the United Kingdom representatives on the Committee would be instructed to endeavour to secure agreement to these proposals.There was general support for the recommendations made bythe Foreign Secretary. Ministers agreed that our representative should resist any proposals for an elaborate federal constitution, onthe lines of the French proposal for a &quot; Consultative Assembly.&quot;It was unfortunate that the French Government should havenominated as their representatives on the Committee of Inquiry anumber of elder statesmen, some of whom were known to holdextreme views on this issue and none of whom would bear direct responsibility for carrying out their recommendations. The task ofthe United Kingdom Delegation in trying to secure agreement, to ascheme on the lines suggested by the&quot; Foreign Secretary would be complicated by the composition of the French Delegation, and therewas a serious risk that, once again, His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldincur criticism for an excessively cautious approach to closer union.It might be advisable to seek agreement with the Belgian and DutchGovernments on the form of Delegation which they and we should send to the Committee.
The Lord -Chancellor said that he would be glad to discuss with the Foreign Secretary^ legal advisers the questions of inter-national law which were raised in the memorandum.The Cabinet-Agreed that consideration of this question should be heldover for the time being.Abolition cfVisas for united states citizens.(previous reference:CM. (48) 63rdConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (48) 247) proposing that United States citizensvisiting this country should no longer be required to obtain Britishvisas.The Foreign Secretary said that he put forward this recom-mendation in furtherance of his general policy of reducing to aminimum the formalities connected with private travel, and with thespecial purpose of increasing our dollar earnings by attractingAmerican tourists to this country. He was satisfied that this specialpurpose justified a unilateral concession on our part, even thoughthe United States Government were prevented by their immigrationlegislation from making corresponding concessions to all Britishtravellers entering the United States. He hoped, however, that itmight be possible to persuade the United States Government, at alater stage, to abolish the fee charged to British subjects for avisitor&apos;s visa.The Home Secretary said that he raised no objection to theForeign Secretary&apos;s proposal.In discussion the view was expressed that the proposed concession might be interpreted in some quarters as implyingsubservience to United States influence; and that in any event thevisa requirement did not in fact deter the class of Americans whowere likely to wish to visit this country. On the other hand, it waspointed out that seven of the more important tourist countries inEurope had already abolished the visa requirement for United states citizens and that France was likely to do the same. Those responsiblefor promoting tourist traffic to this country believed that someAmerican tourists who might otherwise come here were deterred bythe formality of having to obtain a visa; and it was important thatour tourist trade should not be put at a disadvantage compared withthat of other European countries. As regards public opinion in thiscountry, there had been little complaint about the special concessionsaccorded to tourists in such matters as petrol and clothes rationing,and it therefore seemed unlikely that the visa concession would attract much public criticism.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that United States citizens should no longer berequired to obtain a British visa for the purpose of travel to the United Kingdom or Northern Ireland;(2) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would seek to secure some relaxation of the visa requirements applicable toBritish subjects visiting the United States, on the lines indicated in paragraph 5 of CP. (48) 247.
Germany.socialisation of basic industries.(previous references:CM. (47)16thConclusions,Minute 3, and cm. (47) 42ndConclusions,Minute 8.)7. The Foreign Secretary referred to a memorandum(CP. (48) 251) which he had circulated on the previous eveningdescribing the agreement reached between the British and UnitedStates Military Governors in Germany for transferring trusteeshipresponsibilities for the coal, iron and steel industries from military government to German hands. This agreement provided expresslythat the question of the eventual ownership of these industries (which included the possibility of their socialisation) was one for deter-mination by a freely-elected German Government, and it was agreedthat this term would include a government of Western Germany ifthere was no Central German Government. The Foreign Secretarybelieved that the agreement carried out the policy approved byHis Majesty&apos;s Government at the time of the f conclusion of the Britishand American Zones (cf. the, Cabinefs discussion of 1st May, 1947(CM. (47) 42nd Conclusions) and, subject to his colleagues&apos; views, he proposed to authorise General Robertson to sign the agreement.In a short discussion, several Ministers expressed their supportof the agreement and their, gratification that the United StatesGovernment should be ready to accept an agreement which did not preclude the eventual socialisation of these industries. other ministers, however, wished for further time to study the foreign secretary&apos;s memorandum, particularly in view of the political interest which the agreement would arouse in this country.The Prime Minister said that he would authorise the foreign secretary to give the necessary permission for the signing of theagreement, unless any Minister notified him before 7 p.m. that day that he desired an opportunity for further discussion. In that eventhe would arrange for a special meeting* of the Cabinet to be held for this purpose on Friday, 5th November.InternationalLabonr. Conference,1957.LabourInspection in industry. :(previous reference:C.M.(47)46thConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Labour (CP. (48) 246) covering the draft of a White Paperdefining the attitude of the United Kingdom Government towards a Convention and two Recommendations on. labour inspection whichhad. been adopted by the International Labour Conference at its30th Session in 1947. The proposals described in the draft had beendiscussed with the Departments primarily concerned.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the action described in the draft White Paperwith regard to the Convention and the two Recom-mendations referred to in it;(2) Authorised the Minister of Labour to present the white paper to Parliament in the terms of the draft annexed to his memorandum.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,4th November, 1948.* NOTEpr7me0 AS^F ^^ was*ound *? be necessary; and on 5th November the
