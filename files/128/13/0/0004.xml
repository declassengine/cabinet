(48) 167) covering a proof of a White Paper setting out the text of the Economic Co-operation Agreement between His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the United States Government.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that, when the cabinet had last discussed this Agreement on 25th June, the one questionstill outstanding was whether the United States Government would agree to deal with the question of most-favoured-nation treatment for Japan in a manner which would not involve its being linked withthe Agreement. The United States Government had now agreed(Washington telegram No. 3144 of 26th June) to exclude Japan fromthe proposed exchange of notes on most-favoured-nation treatment;and our representative in Washington had agreed, in return, thatthe arrangement for most-favoured-nation treatment for the occupied areas of Western Germany should extend for a period oftwo and a half years. Thus the way was now clear for us to acceptthe Agreement.The proof annexed to CP. (48) 167 had still to be finallychecked against the text initialled in Washington. That text wouldbe received later in the day, and it was proposed that the white paper should be presented to Parliament during the afternoon of29th June. The Chancellor of the Exchequer was consulting theMinisters directly concerned on the terms of the statement which he proposed to make when announcing the presentation of the white paper.Two minor points were raised on the form of the white paper : (a) The references on pages 1 and 3 to &quot;a Foreword by theForeign Office &apos;&apos; should be omitted.(b) The two sentences in the slip attached to page 13 were intended to be substituted for the first paragraph (not, as stated, thefirst two sentences) of the note from the Foreign Secretary to theUnited States Ambassador in London.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would wish to placeon record their gratitude to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the staffs concerned for carrying the negotiation of this Agreement to a successful conclusion.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the terms of the Economic Co-operation Agree-ment between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the UnitedStates Government;(2) Took note that the text of the Agreement would be presented to Parliament on 29th June in a White Paper in theterms of the proof annexed to CP. (48) 167, subject to the amendments noted in paragraphs (a) and (&amp;) above andto any other minor amendments required to bring thisproof into conformity with the text initialled in washington;(3) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would settle,with the Ministers directly concerned, the terms of thestatement which he proposed to make in the House ofCommons when announcing the publication of this white paper.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that on 22nd june the Economic Policy Committee had approved his proposal thatthe United Kingdom Delegation in Paris should resist the sugges-tion that the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation should itself undertake the allocation of aid between the partici-pating countries. (E.P.C. (48) 25th Meeting, Minute 1.) Theview taken by Ministers on this point had been put to Mr.*Harriman.the representative of the Economic Co-operation Administrator inEurope, who had urged most strongly that our Delegation should-4 B 2
not take this line in Paris. It would, he said, involve the verygreatest difficulties with the Economic Co-operation Administrator;and he had no doubt that there would he grave difficulties in washington if the Organisation for European Economic Co-opera-tion were unwilling to make a serious attempt to assume responsi-bility for allocating aid between the participating countries.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in the light of theviews expressed by Mr. Harriman, it would be inexpedient for our delegation in Paris to take the line approved by the economic policy Committee on 22nd June.The Cabinet-(4) Agreed that the United Kingdom Delegation to theOrganisation for European Economic Co-operation should be instructed to state that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would not oppose the suggestion that the Organisa-tion should assume responsibility for allocating aidbetween the participating countries, though they snouldmake it clear that the assumption of this responsibilitywas likely, in their view, to involve the Organisation ingreat difficulties, which should be more fully explored.Industrial 2.   The Cabinet considered the latest developments in the dockDisputes. workers&apos; strike. They were informed that the position in london dock had not improved.   Outside London, all the dockers at BirkenheadWorkers&apos; and half of those in Liverpool were on strike, and it was possibleStrike. that the strike would spread to Glasgow and Southampton.   There(Previous were no signs as yet of strike action at Bristol or the South WalesReference: ports. The Transport and General Workers&apos; Union were makingC.M.(48)43rd every effort to combat the strike and meetings of their ExecutiveConclusions, and of the National Dock Group had been called for 29th June.Minute 2.) There was, however, a powerful organisation behind the strike andsome reason to regard it as part of a general attempt to createindustrial unrest. It seemed to be the object of the organisers tomake the Dock Labour Scheme unworkable and thus to create astate of affairs in which the movement of goods would be liableto constant interruption through dock strikes. About 5,000members of the Forces with 900 lorries had begun to move wheat and other non-perishable foods in London, and consultations were proceeding about the use of troops at the other ports which mightbe affected. If no further food cargoes were moved, the carcase-meat ration, which would be only 6rf. in the current week, would fall to 4d. There would be difficulty in maintaining the sugar ration after about a week and in about fourteen days there wouldbe serious shortages of bread, bacon, cheese and butter. A strike of flour millers was threatened if troops were used to move wheat and there was still a risk of a strike at Smithneld, though it hadbeen indicated that if the troops were merely used to move meatinto cold storage, as distinct from delivering it direct to the market,the Smithneld workers would continue to handle it.The Cabinet then considered a memorandum by the Parlia-nientary Secretary, Ministry of Labour (CP. (48) 168) proposing that the Dock Labour Scheme should be suspended in the Port ofLondon. It was explained that for this purpose it would benecessary either to proclaim an emergency under the emergency powers Act, 1920, and thereafter make an Order in Councilsuspending the scheme, or to suspend the Scheme by means of ashort Bill which might, it was suggested, be introduced and passed through all its stages on 30th June.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour, said thatthe suspension of the Scheme would bring home to the workers thatif they would not submit to its obligations they must lose itsbenefits. It would also have the advantage of enabling volunteerlabour to be obtained.   The trade union representatives on the
National Dock Labour Board would not agree to recruit volunteerlabour and, in these circumstances, it seemed reasonable to give theemployers freedom to engage such volunteer labour as they could obtain. In his view, the suspension of the Scheme would create a new situation and make it easier for the Government and theUnion to bring about a satisfactory settlement.In discussion it was pointed out that the suspension of theScheme in the Fort of London alone would not meet the situationwhich had now arisen through the spread of the strike to theprovinces. There was no evidence that if the employers were free to recruit volunteer labour they would obtain any large body ofworkers. The suspension of the Scheme would deprive of itsbenefits those men who were still at work in the London docks;and it would be regarded as a victory for those who were exploitingthe strike. For these reasons, the Cabinet rejected the proposal made in CP. (48) 168.The Cabinet then considered what alternative action shouldbe taken to meet the situation. There was general agreement thatall possible use should be made of the Services, even at the cost ofsome temporary interruption of training and consequentialdifficulties in providing reliefs for garrisons overseas. To enablethe troops to be employed to the best advantage it would be necessaryto have power to requisition premises for their accommodation andequipment (such as lorries) for their use; and, both for these purposes and in order to give a firm legal basis for the use of troops,it was desirable that an emergency should be proclaimed underthe Emergency Powers Act, 1920. The Proclamation should be related to the cessation of work in certain sections of the dockindustry, but this would not preclude the making under it of regulations designed to deal with any extension of the emergencyoutside that industry (e.g., a strike at Smithfield). Once the proclamation had been made it would be possible to call for volunteerworkers, but there was general agreement that this should not bedone for the present.In further discussion it was agreed that the Prime minister should announce the Governments intentions in the House ofCommons later in the day and should broadcast an appeal to the strikers at 9 p.m. This broadcast should be repeated at 7 a.m. and a.m. on 29th June. Ministers thought it desirable that the strikers should be given an opening to return to work without lossof face, but they were clear that there could be no question of negotiating with the strikers&apos; leaders or going beyond what thePrime Minister had said in the House of Commons on 23rd Junewith regard to possible modifications of the disciplinary clauses of the Dock Labour Scheme. In his broadcast the Prime minister would accordingly set out the events leading to the strike, indicatethat the strikers were being exploited, stress the benefits conferred on the workers by the Dock Labour Scheme, and point out againthat modifications in the Scheme could be made by use of the recog-nised machinery. He would also explain what steps the Govern-ment were taking to maintain essential supplies and to safeguard the national economy and would end with an appeal for a restora-tion of the sense of discipline., The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that The King should be advised to issue a proclamation under the Emergency Powers Act, 1920,declaring that a state of emergency existed owing tothe cessation of work in certain sections of the dockindustry.(2) Agreed that the maximum use should be made of theServices in order to maintain the movement of goodsboth in London and in the provinces, notwithstandingany interference with military training, and &quot;took note that the Minister of Defence would consult with theService Ministers on the steps necessary to secure this.
(3) Agreed that regulations should be made under theEmergency Powers Act. 1920, to provide any necessary facilities in the way of premises or equipment to enablefull use to be made of the Services.(4) Agreed that for the present there should be no generalappeal for volunteer workers.(5) Took note that the Prime Minister would make a statementof the Governments intentions in the House of Commons,: later in the day and would broadcast an appeal to the strikers at 9 p.m.3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP. (48) 157)which the Minister of Supply had circulated in pursuance of therequest made in the Cabinets earlier discussion on 14th June,dealing with the powers of the proposed Iron and Steel corporation and, in particular, with the suggestion that the Corporation mightbe constituted simply as a holding company.In this memorandum the Minister of Supply set out his reasonsfor thinking that it would be inexpedient to limit the corporation to the functions of a holding company, and recommended that theBill as introduced should define the powers of the Corporation interms of the first alternative Clause 2 in the draft annexed to cp. (48) 123. This would confer on the Corporation the sum ofthe existing powers conferred by the memoranda of association ofall the companies which would come under public ownership. If,during the proceedings on the Bill, this proposal were criticised asconferring excessive powers on the Corporation, the Minister could make a concession by substituting the second alternative Clause 2,which would confer on the Corporation the sum of the existing powers actually exercised by the companies under their articles of association at the date of their transfer to public ownership.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the recommendations made by the Minister ofSupply in CP. (48) 157.(2) Authorised the Minister of Supply to inform the repre-sentatives of employers and workers in the iron and steelindustry that the Government had decided to bring the major part of the industry under public ownership andto communicate to them, in confidence, the substance ofthe scheme which the Government had approved forcarrying this decision into effect.4. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the latest developments in the situation in Germany. In view of the suggestions published in the Soviet-controlled press in Berlin, theForeign Office had issued a statement over the week-end confirmingthe Governments intention to maintain their position in berlin and the United States Government were being asked to make asimilar statement. There could be no question of yielding to Sovietpressure; if the Western Allies were forced out of Berlin, the project of Western Union would be fatally weakened. Every effort must be made to increase the existing food stocks for the civilpopulation in the British sector of the city. This could now be doneby air alone, and steps had been taken to expand the air servicesinto the city. It seemed possible that the Soviet Government mighttry to secure an agreement on Four-Power control of the Ruhr inreturn for permitting the resumption of rail and water traffic intothe Western Zones. There was no foundation for their allegationthat we were failing to carry out the terms of. an agreement on this issue : the United Kingdom Delegation had declined to discussthe matter at the Potsdam Conference on the ground that the
French Government was not represented. The implications of thestatement issued by the Soviet Government at the conclusion of the warsaw Conference were being studied, and he would circulate a paper on this subject to the Cabinet. .The Minister of Defence said that the Chiefs of Staff wereconsulting the Combined Chiefs of Staff in Washington about thesituation. The British Military Governor had confirmed that nothing would be gained by attempting to force through convoysby rail, road or water, since the Soviet authorities could interposeeffective technical obstacles. Attention must therefore be concen-trated on expanding the use of freight aircraft. At the presenttime, the Royal Air Force could bring into the city a daily load of75 tons, but this could be increased very shortly to 400 tons and, by3rd July, to 750 tons. This was the maximum daily load whichcould be transported by this means, and it would not be possibleto maintain this rate for longer than a month. The PrincipalAdministrative Officers Committee were considering to what extentdehydrated foods could be substituted for other supplies. TheUnited States Air Force were at present transporting 1,000 tonsa day by air into their sector. The Military Governor had reportedthat the Soviet authorities might attempt to interfere with air traffic either by fighter aircraft or by barrage balloons : instructions had been given that the risk of interference by fighters must beaccepted but barrage balloons should be shot down.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary andthe Minister of Defence;(2) Approved&apos; the instructions given to the British military governor in Germany regarding the maintenance of aircommunication with Berlin;(3) Took note that a special meeting of Ministers would be heldlater in the day to review the situation in detail.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,28th June, 1948.
