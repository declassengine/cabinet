Palestine. 1.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Foreign(Previous       Secretary (CP. (48) 225) covering the text of the conclusions ofReference:      Part I of Count Bernadotte&apos;s report to the United Nations.CM. (48) 57th Tjte Foreign Secretary recalled that the Cabinet had agreed that conclusions, tne United Nations Mediator should be encouraged to makeMmute 4.) proposals for a settlement in Palestine. His report accepted the factthat a Jewish State would continue to exist and made proposals forpartitioning Palestine broadly on the lines of stabilising the existing situation. The area of the Jewish State would be less than underthe proposals approved by the United Nations Assembly in November1947; but it would contain the most fertile land and form a morecompact entity. It would no doubt be possible to improve on theMediators proposals in certain respects, but Mr. Marshall hadalready announced that the United States Government supportedthem and the right course seemed to be to declare forthwith thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government accepted the report in its entirety. he therefore proposed to make a statement to this effect in the Houseof Commons debate later in the day and to instruct the United King-dom delegation to the United Nations Assembly to support the report. and to press for its early consideration by a special committee ofthe Assembly. He believed that if a prompt declaration in favourof the Mediators recommendations were made by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, the Arab States would be less likely to oppose them.These States were naturally apprehensive that the new Jewish state would later seek to expand at their expense; but it should be possibleto allay this anxiety by making the United Nations responsible forguaranteeing the new frontiers. It was to be hoped that theMediators proposal for merging the Arab territory of Palestinewith Transjordan would be accepted, since it had always been clearthat a separate Arab State would not be viable.-In discussion there was general agreement that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should declare their support of the proposals in Part Iof the Mediator&apos;s report.-  The following points were made : (a) Though the Jews would probably claim Jerusalem, it was essential that the city should be placed under international control,and a satisfactory scheme for this had been worked out.(6) Most of the. coast-line of Palestine would fall within theJewish State, but Haifa would be a free port and there was scope forthe development of the Arab port of Aqaba.  It might also be possible.to reopen with the United States Government the question of makingGaza the terminal of the proposed new Middle East oil pipe-line.(c) It would be desirable to reopen production at the Haifarefinery as soon as possible, even if the crude oil had to be broughtto Haifa by tanker. Proposals for this should not, however, beallowed to prejudice the chances of reaching agreement on theMediator&apos;s recommendations.(d) The Departments concerned would have to consider how the assets and liabilities of the former Palestine Government should be allocated once partition had been effected.The Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to state that HisMajesty&apos;s Government fully supported the proposals madein Part I of Count Bernadotte&apos;s report to the united nations, and agreed that the United Kingdom delegation to the United Nations Assembly should be instructed topress for early consideration of the report by a specialcommittee&quot;of the Assembly.
2. The Foreign Secretary recalled that on 5th July the cabinet had agreed that Field-Marshals von Brauchitsch, von Rundstedt andvon Manstein and Colonel-General Strauss should be tried if theywere fit to stand trial. Since then there had been much criticism of the decision to try these officers and it had been decidedthat he should deal with this criticism in his speech in the foreignaffairs debate. There had admittedly been serious delay and hewould have to express regret for this. He would, however, resist any suggestion that the trials should be abandoned.In discussion it was pointed out that, while there was a prima facie case against these officers, it might in the event prove impossibleto obtain conclusive evidence against them, particularly since muchof the evidence related to incidents in Russia and Poland. On theother hand, if the trials were abandoned, we should have no goodground for refusing to hand over the officers to the SovietGovernment.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should resist any suggestion that the trials of the four German officers concerned should be abandoned.3. The Foreign Secretary reminded the Cabinet of the develop-ments in the Berlin situation up to 7th September, when the WesternMilitary Governors in Berlin had reported to their Governments thethree main points of disagreement which had brought their discussions with the Soviet Military Governor to a standstill. Therepresentatives of the Western Powers in Moscow had been instructed to approach the Soviet Government with a view toresolving these difficulties, and on 14th September had handedM. Molotov an aide-memoire on the points at issue. The Sovietreply of 18th September had been unsatisfactory and had suggestedthat the Soviet Government were seeking to prolong discussions untilthe meeting of the United Nations Assembly was over and theposition of the Western Powers had been weakened throughincreasing difficulties of supplying Berlin during the winter. Hehad reviewed the situation with Mr. Marshall and M. Schuman inParis and had been much encouraged to learn that a realisticassessment of the resources available for supplying Berlinby air showed that supplies could be maintained at a reasonablelevel throughout the winter. It had also been clear that,while Mr. Marshall did not underrate the difficulties of the berlin situation, he was determined not to yield to Russianpressure and believed that the Western Powers must maintain theirfoothold in Berlin while their position&apos; in Western Germany wasbeing consolidated. It had eventually been agreed that a joint noteshould be addressed to the Soviet Government setting out the finalviews of the Governments of the three Western Powers on the points at issue and asking the Soviet Government to state by 29th Septemberwhether they were prepared to remove the blockade measures andto free communications by rail, water and road. This note wouldmake no mention of a possible reference to the United Nations, butit had been agreed that, if the reply should prove unsatisfactory, thematter should be brought before the Security Council, not in anyexpectation that this body would be able to reach a settlement but with a view to focusing world opinion on the Soviet action. the text of the draft note had requested the Soviet Government to statewhether they were unconditionally prepared to remove the blockademeasures, but, after discussion with the Prime Minister, he had suggested that the word &quot; unconditionally &quot; should be omitted andhe now understood that this amendment was likely to be accepted.In his statement in the foreign affairs debate later in the day hewould describe the measures taken to supply Berlin by air and,without going into details, indicate that steps were being taken toensure the continuance of supplies throughout the winter. He would
also make it clear that, on the main issues, the Western Powers had maintained their original position, but would decline to give detailed information about the present state of the negotiations on the groundthat this would be &apos;a breach of the obligations of His Majesty!sGovernment to the other Governments involved.In discussion it was pointed out that, once the outcome of thepresent negotiations was clear, it would be necessary for the Cabinetto consider what policy should be adopted in face of the increasingtension between the Soviet Union and the Western Powers, of whicSthe difficulties in Berlin were a symptom. If the threat of war inthe near future was real, more resources ought to be devoted to defence, including civil defence, and this would play into the handsof the Soviet Union by retarding our economic recovery. On theother hand, it would be fatal to give the Soviet Government theimpression that the United Kingdom would not in any circumstancesoppose them by force.The Foreign Secretary expressed the hope that these difficulties would not lead to any weakening of the Governments attitude.Since 1945 it had repeatedly been shown that any concessions tothe Soviet Union would be exploited to the detriment of the western powers and, unless a firm stand were made now, our position inEurope would be hopeless. He also reminded the Cabinet that theeconomic recovery of Western Germany, which had been promoted by the recent currency reform, should to a considerable extent relieve the strain on the United Kingdom economy.The Cabinet-Endorsed the policy pursued by the Foreign Secretary and approved the line which he proposed to take in the foreignaffairs debate.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,22nd September, 1948.
