The Prime Minister said that members of the Cabinet wouldhave learned with regret that Mr. Joseph Westwood and his wifehad been killed in a motoring accident on 17th July.&quot;&apos;-i&apos;r.

It was the Cabinefs view that such an appreciationshould now be sent: it need not include any forecast of future developments.The Cabinet-(2) Authorised the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations, after consultation with the Foreign Office, tosend to other Commonwealth Governments an up-to-dateappreciation of the current situation in Berlin.Iran andSteel Bill.(previous reference:C.M.(48)44thConclusions,Minute 8.)3. The Cabinet considered a note by the Lord President(CP. (48) 181) covering a revised statement of the arguments infavour of the Iron and Steel Bill prepared by the Socialisation ofIndustries Committee in accordance with the Cabinefs decision of14th June (CM. (48) 39th Conclusions, Minute 5).The Lord President explained that the Annex to CP. (48) 181was primarily i /ended for the guidance of Ministers, including*unlor MinistV ,. It should not, in his view, be circulated until thetill had been latroduced, and he suggested that meanwhile ministers should, so far as possible, refrain from detailed political arguments on the Bill or, if they felt it necessary to introduce such argumentsinto public speeches, should do so only after consultation with theMinister of Supply or himself. He asked the Cabinet to considerwhether it was expedient that public use should be made of the argument in paragraph 7 of the Annex to CP. (48) 181, that the socialisation of the United Kissgdom iron and steel industry was desirable in the interests of the European Recovery Programme andof Western Union. It might be thought that the development ofthis argument would give offence both in the United States and in.:. European countries. He also drew the special attention of theCabinet to the desirability of avoiding arguments, such as thoserV indicated in paragraph 18, whose use might alienate the managersand technicians on whom the Government must rely for the successfulconduct of the industry after nationalisation.35686-2 B 2
The Cabinefs discussion turned primarily on the. questionwhether Ministers would be unduly inhibited in advocating the socialisation of the iron and steel industry if they were precluded from using arguments, of the kind mentioned in paragraph 18 of -the memorandum.. It was suggested that the Government^ case would be greatlyweakened, particularly in steel-producing areas, if Ministers were unable to attack the policy pursued by the industry before the war.It was true that this policy had been supported by the Governmentof the day, but would it not be permissible to attack both the industryancl that Government, who had combined to pursue a restrictiveKlicy ? Again, while it was preferable that individuals should notsingled out for personal attack, the Government&apos;s case could notbe presented effectively unless Ministers were free to refer to particular incidents of the inter-war years. It was also urged that,although in theory the industry was not subject to domination by outside financial interests, in practice those interests had exerciseda very real control over it. Arguments directed to these pointscould be presented in such a way as not to alienate the managers ortechnicians and, unless they were used, Ministers would be deprivingthemselves of useful weapons to counter the bitter attack which theOpposition would undoubtedly make on the Bill.On the other hand, it was pointed out that paragraph 18 gaveuseful guidance to those Ministers who were less familiar with thehistory of the industry and might be tempted to present argumentsbased on the past history of the industry in a way which would beopen to effective retort. Thus, it would be unwise to refer to the partslaved by Sir William Firth without full knowledge of the facts;and, in making accusations of domination by financial interests, itshould be borne in mind that those interests had in fact been largelyresponsible for such modernisation of the industry as took placein the inter-war years.Other points in discussion were (a) Ministers agreed that, from the point of view of ourrelations with the United States and Western European countries,it would be preferable not to use the argument that socialisation ofthe United Kingdom iron and steel industry was desirable in the,interests of the European Eecovery Programme and Western Union.(6) Though it would be undesirable to argue that the presentExchequer subsidies payable in respect of iron and steel were needed to bolster up a bankrupt industry, it could be argued that one reasonfor the subsidies was the existence of high-cost producers who wouldnot have to be kept in production if in the past the industry hadbeen as efficient as was claimed by the Opposition.In further discussion there was general agreement that itwould be inexpedient for Ministers to launch a campaign in favourof the Bill before the Second Beading debate ana that the right course would be for the Prime Minister to send a note to Ministersasking them to refrain for the present from entering into contro-versy on the subject of the Bill. Meanwhile the arguments set outin the Annex to C.P. (48) 181 might be revised in the light of thepoints made in discussion with a view to the circulation of a doeu-ment for the guidance of Ministers at the time when the Bill was published. It would also be desirable that at that stage the Ministerof Supply ahould meet those Ministers who Were not in the Cabinet,including junior Ministers, in order to supplement what was statedin the document.The Cabinet-i  (1) ;,Took note that the Prime Minister would ask all Ministers- to avoid putting forward detailed arguments in support: of the Iron and Steel Bill before the Second Heading- debate. &apos; &quot;(2) Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for the memorandum annexed to CP. (48)181, revised in the light of the
1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTraissport (CP. (48) 184) proposing that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould accept an international Convention for the establishment ofa Maritime Consultative Organisation as a specialised agency ofthe United Nations. The text of the Convention was annexed tothe is:-aorandum.-&apos;&apos; k*&amp; Cabinet were informed that this Convention had beenadopted by a Conference held at Geneva earlier in the year and attended by representatives of eighteen countries, including themost important of the maritime and trading nations. It followed the lines previously recommended to the Cabinet and met satis-faetorily the specific points raised in the Cabinefs discussion on28th November, 1946. The Convention had been presented toParliament in May as a White Paper (Cmd. 7412) and had provokedno comment. The Minister now proposed that the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations should be formally notified that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment accepted the Convention. It would come into forcewhen it had been ratified by twenty-one countries, including sevenwho each had at least 1 million gross registered tons of shipping.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Transport to arrange for theSecretary-General of the United Nations to be notified thatHis majesty&apos;s Government accepted the Convention con-cluded at Geneva on 6th March, 1948, for the establish-ment of a Maritime Consultative Organisation as aspecialised agency of the United Nations.5. The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed theCabinet that there had been no marked change in the situation in malaya in July. Terrorist activities had continued, and over thirtypersons had been murdered by bandits during the month. TheCommissioner-General, South-East Asia, had now reported that hehad conclusive evidence that the Malayan Communist Party wasactively responsible for planning and directing this campaign of violence and terrorism. This was now well-known in Malaya andthe local Government were being criticised for failing to take actionagainst the Party. The Commissioner-General therefore proposedthat the Party, together with certain other political partieswithCommunist connections or sympathies, should be proscribed on theground of their subversive activities. He had made it clear thatthere was no question of imposing restrictions on political opinionsor discussion.The general view of the Cabinet was that, in the light of theinformation received from the Commissioner-General, the MalayanCommunist Party should be declared an illegal organisation. TheHouse of Commons should be informed of this decision in advanceof the debate on Colonial Affairs on 22nd July. The Commissioner-General should be asked to provide fuller information regardingthe nature of the evidence implicating the Malayan CommunistParty in the present wave of terrorist activities.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Commissioner-General, South-East Asia,should be authorised to declare the Malayan CommunistParty, and certain connected parties, to be illegalorganisations.discussion and of any developments during the next threemonths, to be circulated to all Ministers for theirguidance at the time when the Iron and Steel Bill was published; and agreed that at that time tbeMinister ofSupply should meet those Ministers who were not inthe Cabinet in order to supplement the points made inthe memorandum.
(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to ask the-    , Commissioner-General for fuller information regarding.&quot;,&apos;-i&quot;the evidence implicating these parties in the present..&apos; &quot;campaign of violence. .73) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to consult with the Prime Minister regarding the terms in whichthe decision noted in Conclusion (1) above should be, announced in Parliament.Cabinet OMce, S.W. 1,19th July, 1948.
