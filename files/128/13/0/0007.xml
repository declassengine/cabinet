Germany. 1. The Foreign Secretary said that there had been no materialSituation        change in the situation in Berlin.  An exchange of letters betweenin Berlin.       the British and Soviet Military Governors had produced no con-(Previous       elusive results; and it now seemed that there would have to be reference:      negotiations between Governments.. So far, however, it had not beenC.M.(48)46th   possible to get into a satisfactory form the draft note to the SovietConclusions,     Government proposed by the United States Government.    the minute 1.)      United States authorities wished to include in this an offer tosubmit the issue to the United Nations.   Such an offer was likelyto prove embarrassing; but the French Government were unwilling to accept the alternative of offering to discuss the at theCouncil of Foreign Ministers. The Foreign Secretary was now considering whether the other two Governments would be content with a formula offering negotiation between the four Governmentswithout specifying the method by which those negotiations wouldbe pursued. It was desirable that the note should be despatchedthat evening, and it might be necessary that its terms should beconsidered later in the day by the Ministerial Committee on germany.Palestine. 2    The Foreign Secretary said that he had not yet received the(Previous official text of the proposals put forward by the United NationsReference: Mediator in Palestine.

States that they would be well advised not to reject these proposalsout of hand.War Crimes.Disposal ofGermanGeneralsin BritishCustody.(previous reference:CM. (46) 94thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState for War (CP. (48) 151 and 165) and the Attorney-General(CP. (48) 159) about the disposal of Field-Marshals von Brauchitsch,von Rundstedt and von Manstein and Colonel-General Strauss, whohad been in British custody since 1945. Most of the victims of theircrimes had been Russians and Poles and the direct interest of HisMajesty&apos;s Government was limited to the responsibility of Field-Marshal von Rundstedt for an order under which British SpecialAir Service troops had been killed. On the other hand, casesagainst them had been registered with the United Nations war crimes Commission and His Majesty&apos;s Government had been askedto hand over Field-Marshals von Brauchitsch and von Mansteinto the Polish Government and Field-Marshals von Rundstedt and vonManstein to the Soviet Government. A memorandum sent to the attorney-General in August 1947, by the United States authorities had disclosed a prima facie case against them, and the problem oftheir disposal had been discussed by the Foreign Secretary, the LordChancellor, the Secretary of State for War and the Law Officersduring the autumn of 1947. In December it had been agreed thatthey should be brought to trial and that action should be taken toprepare a case against them. The Secretary of State for War had,however, thought it right to have them medically examined, and this had been done first by an Army Medical Board and subse-quently by a Home Office Board of experienced prisonmedical officers. This latter board had reported that Field-Marshalvon Brauchitsch was not fit to be brought to trial, but that the other three officers were fit to stand trial. The Cabinet were asked todecide whether all or any of the four officers should be brought totrial; whether, if they were not brought to trial, those who hadbeen asked for by the Polish and Soviet Governments should be handed over to those Governments; and how any officers not broughtto trial or handed over to the Polish or Soviet Governments shouldbe disposed of. They were also asked to decide whether we shouldcomply with a request that Field-Marshals von Brauchitsch,von Rundstedt and von Manstein should appear as defence witnessesin a United States trial now pending at Nuremberg.35682-2b 2
The Secretary of State for War said that it seemed clear fromthe medical report on Field-Marshal von Brauchitsch that it wouldbe wrong to attempt to bring him to trial. He also doubted whetherit would be worth while to undertake the heavy task of attempting to bring the other three officers to trial. If the trials were to beundertaken it would be necessary to set up a special executive to collect evidence, and it was doubtful whether the Soviet and PolishGovernments would give much help in this task. The total cost ofthe trials might amount to  10,000 and it would be impossible tocomplete them by September 1948, the date by which the OverseasReconstruction Committee had asked him to arrange for the disposalof all cases of suspected German war criminals awaiting trial. he therefore proposed that these officers should not be brought to trial and that they should be retained in this country until 1st Septem-ber, 1948, after which they should be returned to their homes inGermany, where they would have to face the risk of &quot; denazifica-tion.&quot; He also proposed that Field-Marshals von Rundstedt andvon Manstein should be produced as witnesses in the United Statestrial at Nuremberg, on the understanding that they would subse-quently return to this country before they were sent to their homesin Germany.The Attorney-General said that, in view of the information supplied by the United States authorities and the attitude whichwe had adopted to the requests from the Soviet and Polish Govern-ments, he could see no grounds on which we could defend a decision not to bring to trial the three generals who were fit to stand trial.Subordinates of theirs had already been executed for carrying outthe orders given by them, and His Majesty&apos;s Government would beopen to an accusation of bad faith if the generals were not put ontrial.The Lord Chancellor expressed doubts about the wisdom of bringing these officers to trial. It would be a laborious task to collect the evidence against them and they might well be acquitted.Moreover, public opinion in the United Kingdom would regard the trial of these elderly and infirm officers as an act of vengeance ratherthan of justice.The Foreign Secretary said that, although we had not givenspecific undertakings to the Soviet and Polish Governments thatwe would bring these officers to trial, we had allowed those Govern-ments to understand that it was on this basis that we declined to hand them over. From the international point of view he thoughtit necessary that those officers who were fit to be tried should bebrought to trial as soon as possible. Although the Overseas Re-construction Committee had asked that the war crimes trials asa whole should be brought to an end by September 1948, these fewand exceptional cases could if necessary be completed after thatdate.In further discussion Ministers agreed that, as there was a prima facie case against these officers and as we were not preparedto hand them over to the Soviet or Polish Governments, they shouldbe tried if they were fit to stand trial. The proceedings could takeplace in Germany.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for War to take immediate steps to collect evidence and make any other necessary preparations for the trial of all the four officers con-cerned, on the understanding that the question of tryingField-Marshal von Brauchitsch might be reconsidered if,after the evidence against him had been collected, itwere found that he was still unfit to stand trial.(2) Authorised the Secretary of State for War to arrange for field-Marshals von Rundstedt and von Manstein to appear as defence witnesses in the United States trialnow pending at Nuremberg.
4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (48) 174) reporting the results of his consultations with Government supporters on the proposal that the death penalty should be retained for certain specified classes of murder.The Home Secretary said that, as a result of these consulta-tions, he was satisfied that a clause in the terms of the revised draft annexed to CP. (48) 174 would be acceptable to the greatmajority of Government supporters, both those who in the earlierproceedings on the Criminal Justice Bill had favoured the suspension-sion of the death penalty and those who had voted for its retention.He believed that there would be no risk of serious discontent amongLabour Members in the Commons if the Government Whip were used in support of a clause in these terms. In framing the clauseit had been his object to retain the death penalty for those types of murder which most stirred the public conscience. He had testedthe efficacy of the clause by applying its provisions to the 98 persons convicted of murder in the years 1944 to 1947. During that period51 persons had been executed; and 28 of these would not have been sentenced to death if this clause had been in operation. Of the 47who were dealt with by committal to penal servitude or to Broad-moor Criminal Lunatic Asylum, 40 could not have been sentenced to death if the new clause had been in. operation. This examinationindicated that the new clause would have the effect of reducing very substantially the. number of cases in which sentence of death waspronounced.Ministers agreed that the clause annexed to CP. (48) 174 couldbe commended to the House of Commons as a reasonable compromise,and that it should receive the support of the Government Whip.They recognised, however, that there might be more difficulty in persuading the House of Lords to accept this compromise. TheHome Secretary suggested that when the clause had been publishedhe should see the Archbishop of Canterbury and try to enlist hissupport for the clause. This suggestion was endorsed.In detailed discussion of the draft clause the following points were made : (a) Should the death penalty be preserved for persons whomurdered two or more victims on a single occasion ? As the clausenow stood, the sentence of death could not be passed on a man whowrecked a train : and, although a man might be sentenced to deathif he had murdered three women on consecutive days, he could notbe so sentenced if he had collected his victims together and disposedof them simultaneously.(b) It would probably be argued that, if the new clause becamelaw, trials for murders falling within its scope would have to be conducted in two phases. It would be suggested that, after the accused had been found guilty of murder, the jury should be askedto consider separately whether the murder was one for whichsentence of death could be pronounced. It was pointed out, how-ever, that this would be inconsistent with the principle of the clause,which provided that the particular type of murder must be chargedin the indictment or inquisition before death sentence could be passed.(c) There would also be some procedural complications underSection 1 (1) (e) of the new clause. First, it would be necessary toensure that, when a person was believed to have committed morethan one murder, prosecuting authorities should take particular care in framing the indictments. Secondly, if the accused were found guilty on the first charge, it would be necessary to empanela fresh jury to try him on the second. Although his previous con-viction would not be disclosed in the proceedings until he had beenfound guilty on the second charge, it was likely that the secondjury would be aware of his earlier conviction and it could be argued that their minds would be influenced by that knowledge.(d) It was for consideration whether the death penalty shouldbe preserved for murder committed in the course of kidnapping.(c) Section 1 (1) (c) of the new clause provided that the death penalty should be retained for murder &quot; committed by means of,
and in the course of the systematic administration of, poison orany other similar destructive or noxious substance.&quot; The question was raised whether the word &quot; similar &quot; should be omitted fromthis paragraph. It was pointed out, in reply, that it was intended that the paragraph should be limited to murders caused by theadministration of poison or destructive or noxious substances similarto poison. If the word &quot; similar &quot; were omitted, the scope of the paragraph would be extended far beyond poisoning.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the draft clause annexed to CP. (48)174, but asked that the Home Secretary and the Secretaryof State for Scotland, in consultation with the LawOfficers, should again examine it in detail in the lightof the points noted in paragraphs (a) to (d) above;(2) Subject to this further scrutiny of the details, authorised theHome Secretary to publish the clause as a modification ofthe Lords&apos; amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill;(3) Agreed that the clause should be commended to the Houseof Commons and should receive the support of theGovernment Whip.International 5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the MinisterWheat of Food (CP. (48) 172) on the situation resulting from the failureAgreement.     of the United States Senate to ratify the International Wheat(Previous       Agreement.   They also had before them Washington telegramsReference:      AMAZE 9235 and 9236 of 1st and 2nd July from the United King-C.M.(48)40th   dom Delegation to the International Wheat Council.Conclusions, The Minister of Food recalled that on 17th June the cabinet minute 3.) had agreed that the International Wheat Agreement should be ratified. A new situation had, however, been created by the failureof the United States Senate to ratify the Agreement. Congress had now gone into recess and was not expected to reassemble until thebeginning of 1949; in the meantime the United States Governmenthad no power to implement the Agreement. But it could not be effective without United States participation and the Ministertherefore endorsed the suggestion put forward by the UnitedKingdom Delegation that, at the meeting of the International wheat council on 6th July, they should give provisional notice of with-drawal on 31st August next, if the Agreement had not then been ratified by the United States Congress.In discussion, it was pointed out that Article XX of theAgreement provided that any Government might, at the opening ofthe first session of the Council, effect its withdrawal by notificationto the United States Government. The Article made no provision,however, for conditional withdrawal, and it was suggested that anotification in the terms proposed by the Minister of Food would haveno legal validity. As it was, in any event, uncertain what attitude would be adopted towards the Agreement by the new United states administration after the Presidential election in November, it wouldbe unwise to take any risk of incurring a continuing obligation underthe Agreement in default of United States participation, and in thecircumstances there seemed to be no alternative to immediate noti-fication of withdrawal. Care should, however, be taken to make clear to the Canadian Government and to public opinion generally thefact that His Majesty&apos;s Government had withdrawn only becauseof the failure of Congress to ratify the Agreement.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Minister of Food to instruct the UnitedKingdom Delegation to the International Wheat Councilto announce the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto withdraw from the International Wheat agreement on account of the failure of the United States congress to ratify it;(2) Invited the Minister of Food to ensure that suitablepublicity was given to the reasons for this decision.
6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (48) 170) dealing with certain points whichhad been raised when the Cabinet had considered his proposals in cp. (48) 148 for providing pensions for widows and orphans ofcivil servants and for improving the pensions of civil servants re-tired through ill health after short service.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that under thescheme set out in CP. (48) 148 the proposed reductions in gratuitieswould have met half the additional cost of providing the newpensions. In order, however, to bring out the contributory nature ofthe scheme, he now proposed that civil servants should be given an option to make their contribution either wholly or partly by deduc-tions from their pay on the lines indicated in paragraphs 5 to 7 of cp. (48) 170. Appendix I to CP. (48) 170 showed that the maximumannual charges arising from consequential improvements in theprovision made for the widows and orphans of other public servantswould be  1,685,000 on the Exchequer and  965,000 on the rates, andthat the cost of any consequential improvements in pensions for widows of members of the Forces should be considerably less than 1-5 million. In Appendix II he had given examples of certainindustrial schemes which. compared favourably with his proposalsfor the Civil Service.In discussion there was general approval of the modificationsproposed in paragraphs 5 to 7 of CP. (48) 170.The following additional points were made : (a) The scheme would apply to the Foreign Service as well asthe Home Civil Service.(b) Consequential claims were likely to be made for the im-provement of pensions payable to widows of members of the Services.(c) The introduction of the proposed scheme would lead teachersto revive their claim that any period of military service rendered by them before entering the teaching profession should be recognised for superannuation purposes.The Cabinet-Approved the scheme set out in the Annex to CP. (48) 148for providing pensions for widows and orphans of civilservants and for improving the pensions of civil servantsretired through ill health after short service, subject tothe modifications proposed in paragraphs 5 to 7 of cp. (48) 170.7. At their meeting on 1st July the Cabinet had invited theMinister of National Insurance and the Minister of Fuel and power to arrange with the National Coal Board and the NationalUnion of Mineworkers for a modification of the proposed scheme of supplementary injuries benefits for miners which would bring the pension payable to a young, able-bodied, childless widowinto line with the war pension payable to a similar widow.The Cabinet were informed that in their subsequent negotia-tions with the Board and the Union the Ministers had securedagreement that the supplementary pension payable to widows ofthis class should be reduced from 20s. to 5s. It would not have beenpossible to reach agreement on a complete abolition of the differencebetween the amount payable to a miner&apos;s widow and thecorresponding amounts payable to other industrial widows and towar widows, and the Prime Minister had accordingly authorised the Ministers to approve the scheme as modified on the linesprovisionally agreed in the negotiations.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the modification which theMinister of National Insurance and the Minister of fuel and Power had been able to obtain in the scheme ofsupplementary injuries benefits for miners.
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,5th July, 1948.European 8.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that discussions hadEconomic       been proceeding with the United States authorities on the provisionCo-operation.   0f loans under the European Recovery Programme.  The EconomicLoans under   Co-operation Act prescribed that $1,000 million of the total votethe European  for the first year of the Programme should be provided by way of recovery       loans.   The terms tentatively suggested for such loans by theProgramme.    Economic Co-operation Administrator were not unreasonable as a(Previous       basis for negotiation:  it was proposed that the rate of interestEeferenee:      should be 3 per cent., that the loans should be repayable over aC.M.(48)44th   period of 20 years as from 1956, and that there should be a waiverConclusions,    clause similar to that in the Anglo- American Financial Agreements.Minute 1.)     The latest reports from Washington indicated, however, that the administrator, on the advice of the National Advisory Council,would probably decide and announce that, in order to meet therequirements of the Act, all aid under the Programme must be divided between grant and loan in a predetermined proportion for individual countries; and it was understood that, for the UnitedKingdom, this proportion was likely to be three to one. The purposeof this device was to ensure that the loan money was fully used,since there was a risk that Congress would otherwise object to providing further assistance in subsequent years.   But its effect was to make the amount of aid received under the Programmedependent on the willingness of the participating countries to acceptloans according to the prescribed proportions.   In so far as theywere used for the purchase of capital equipment, or even of certainraw materials, the acceptance of loans could be justified, but theadoption of the arrangement proposed might render it impossibleto restrict the use of loan monies in this way.   The United states authorities had provisionally suggested that the amount of theUnited Kingdom loan for the first year of the Programme mightbe f400 million, and the Chancellor proposed that, without prejudice to the ultimate decision on the question, they should be informedthat His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to accept a loan of$100 million for the first quarter of that year.  The whole question would have to be re-examined when the Administrator^ finaldecision was known.The Cabinet .    Approved the proposal made by the Chancellor of theExchequer.
