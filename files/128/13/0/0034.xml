Princess Elizabeth and The Duke of Edinburgh.Birth of a Son.Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.2. The Cabinet expressed their appreciation of the efforts made by the Government Whips to secure so large an attendance ofGovernment supporters for the Division in the Second Reading ofthe Iron and Steel Bill.The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business to betaken in the House of Commons in the following week.Council for wales andMonmouth-shire.(previous reference:CM. (48) 63rdConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Lord President said that in pursuance of the cabinets decision of 15th October he had, together with the Minister ofHealth, the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister ofNational Insurance, discussed the proposed establishment of a council for Wales and Monmouthshire with representatives of the welsh Regional Council of Labour and the Welsh parliamentary labour Group, and there had seemed to be general agreement withthe Government&apos;s proposal. Subsequent discussions with the WelshParliamentary Labour Group had, however, revealed considerabledifferences of opinion among its members. There was no prospectof full agreement, but it seemed that the proposed Council wouldbe more acceptable to Government supporters if the following modifications were made in the constitution outlined in his memo-randum of 11th October (CP. (48) 228) :-(i) Some apprehension was felt lest the Council might not ade-adequately reflect the balance of political opinion in Wales. With this in view, a suggestion was made that the Council might consistentirely of local authority representatives; but it would accordbetter with the constitution already accepted by the Cabinet if localauthorities (instead of local authority associations) selected names,from which the Prime Minister would choose twelve (instead of ten)members to serve on the Council as representing local authorities.(ii) The first Chairman of the Council should be appointed bythe Prime Minister from among the members, but subsequentappointments should, as proposed in CP. (48) 228, be made by theCouncil.(iii) Members of Parliament should not be eligible for appoint-ment to the Council. There was some divergence of view aboutthe representation of education authorities on the Council; but thebalance of opinion appeared to favour having a representative ofthe University of Wales on the Council as well as a representativeof the Joint Education Committee. No useful purpose would be served by further discussion with the Welsh Parliamentary LabourGroup; but, if opportunity offered before the forthcoming WelshDebate in the House of Commons, the proposals should be explained to the Welsh Parliamentary Party.In discussion it was suggested that, on the analogy of theScottish Economic Conference, the Council for Wales and Mon-mouthshire should conduct its proceedings in private.The Cabinets-Authorised the Lord President, in announcing the estab-lishment of the proposed Council for Wales and Monmouth-shire, to make the alterations in its constitution which hehad indicated in the Cabinefs discussion.36205-2b 2
Capital 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomePunishment. Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (48) 270)(Previous setting out revised terms of reference of the proposed Royal Com-reference: mission on capital punishment, together with the draft of a state-C.M.(48)73rd ment to be made in the House of Commons in reply to a QuestionConclusions,    that afternoon.Minute 5.) It was explained that difficulty was being experienced in finding a Chairman for the Royal Commission, but the general view wasthat an enquiry was unavoidable and that an announcement wouldhave to be made before the composition of the Commission was settled.It was suggested that the terms of reference proposed in para-graph 2 of CP. (48) 270 would leave it open to the Commission torecommend that capital punishment should be abolished as a penalty for murder, while retaining it for treason and other offences. Itwas generally agreed that the preferable course would be to restrict the Commission to considering the limitation or modification of theuse of the death penalty for murder.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the terms of reference of the proposed RoyalCommission should relate to the imposition of capital punishment in respect of murder alone.(2) Subject to this modification of the revised terms of refer-ence and of the draft statement in CP. (48) 270, and toother drafting amendments, authorised the Home Secre-tary to announce forthwith the proposal to set up a royal Commission.National 5.   The Prime Minister said that the comprehensive review ofService. the working of the National Service Act, authorised by the Cabinet(Previous on 26th August, had now been completed. The National ServiceReference: Act, 1947, provided that from 1st January, 1949, the period of cm. (48) 57th National Service should be not more than twelve months. If this conclusions, were brought into operation, the strength of the Armed ForcesMinute 2.) (which had been increased by the decision in September last that all men then serving should be retained for an additional three months)would fall from 790,000 at the end of March 1949 to about 615,000by 1st January, 1950. Such a rate of run-down wculd producedisastrous effects on the Armed Forces and would throw them intoa state of unbalance from which it would take them years to recover.Circumstances had considerably changed since it was decided, earlyin 1947, to fix the period of National Service at twelve months. TheMinisters directly concerned had reached the conclusion that, inorder to preserve the minimum efficiency of the Armed Forces overthe next two or three years, it was necessary to increase the periodof National Service to eighteen months. It was proposed to reducethe period of reserve liability from six to four years, but the liability for training during reserve -service would stand at sixty days, asin the 1947 Act. It was probable that, in the course, of the nextfew years, the number of men available for call-up would exceed the numbers which the Forces could absorb, and it was proposedto deal with this by raising somewhat the general standard for menaccepted in the Forces and by deferring registrations from time totime. The necessary legislation ought to be passed through all its stages before 1st January, 1949. &quot;While it was desirable to keep theBill as short as possible, there were one or two other matters (includ-ing a proposal to raise the age-limit of medical and dental studentsfrom 26 to 30 years) which might be dealt with in it. The service departments would wish to have a reasonably firm basis for plan-ning, and it was proposed that a directive should be issued making it clear that, unless there was some striking change in the inter-national situation, the eighteen months&apos; period of service would beretained for the next three years. This directive would not, ofcourse, be published.
Common-wealthRelations.ConstitutionalDevelopmentsin Eire andIndia.(previous reference:CM. (48) 73rdConclusions,Minute 3.)Eire.In discussion it was suggested that, while the matter wasurgent, the Cabinet ought to have an opportunity for discussingsome of its implications in greater detail, on the basis of a memo-randum by the Minister of Defence. This discussion should takeplace in time to enable the Governments proposals to be communi-cated to the Parliamentary Labour Party at their meeting on24th November, the Bill being formally presented to Parliamentlater in the same day. The decision to discuss the matter further in Cabinet need not delay the drafting of the necessary legislation.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Defence to submit for their con-sideration at a meeting on 22nd November a memorandumon the proposed amendments of the National service act, 1947.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP. (48) 272) bythe Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations reporting the result of the meetings held in Paris on15th and 16th November to discuss with representatives of the eire government the consequences of the forthcoming repeal of the EireExecutive Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936.The Lord Chancellor said that at an early stage in these discussions it became clear that, despite the strong appeals made tothem on behalf of the other Commonwealth Governments, the eire government were resolved that the External Relations Act shouldbe repealed and that Eire should not be or become a member of theCommonwealth. The only question then remaining for discussion was how the Commonwealth countries were to react to theseirrevocable decisions of the Eire Government. The Eire ministers had said that they were most anxious to preserve a close practicalassociation with the Commonwealth countries and would not wish,despite the action which they were about to take, to regard thosecountries as &quot;foreign.&quot; The representatives of Canada, Australiaand New Zealand had welcomed this approach to the problem, asbeing fully in accordance with the facts of the situation; and it had become clear to the United Kingdom representatives that, if theypersisted in the view that Eire must be regarded as a foreign countryonce the External Relations Act was repealed, they would find themselves alone in maintaining that view. They had thereforepressed the argument that, if Eire and the Commonwealth countries were not to be regarded as &quot; foreign &quot; to one another, the citizenshiplaw of Eire must be amended so as to accord positive rights of citizenship in Eire to the citizens of all Commonwealth countrieswhich accorded those rights to Eire citizens. The Eire ministers had in the end accepted the understandings set out in paragraph 8of CP. (48) 272, which contemplated an effective reciprocal exchangeof citizenship rights between Eire and the countries of the Common-wealth. The Lord Chancellor said that he had been careful to avoid committing the United Kingdom Government in any way to theprovisional conclusions reached at these meetings; but he himselfbelieved that, in the circumstances as they had disclosed themselvesin the course of the discussions, there was no practical alternative to the solution outlined in paragraph 8 of CP. (48) 272.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said thatit was admitted that a self-governing member of the Commonwealthhad the right to secede from the Commonwealth; and, now that itwas clear that all appeals to the Eire Government to remain withinthe Commonwealth were unavailing, the wise course was to seekmeans of mitigating the effect of the breach. The United kingdom representatives in the recent discussions could not have presented the practical consequences of the repeal as measures of retaliationfor Eire&apos;s secession from the Commonwealth: even if they had wished to take this line, the other Commonwealth governments would have dissociated themselves from it. They had been com-pelled, therefore, to confine themselves to explaining the difficulties36205-2 b 3
which might arise in international law, by reason of the most-favoured-nation provisions in commercial treaties; and the eire ministers had offered, as a means of overcoming those difficulties, todevelop the reciprocal -exchange of citizenship rights. By thismeans we might be able to avert any challenge by a third party, onmOst-favOured-natiOn grounds, of Our treatment of Eire citizens.We could not be equally confident of defeating a challenge directed against the continuance of the trade preferences to Eire; but someof the other Commonwealth representatives had been doubtfulwhether such a challenge would, in fact, be made for some time tocome, and the Eire Ministers had recognised that, if such a challengewere sustained in the International Court, the trade preferenceswould have to be discontinued. The Secretary of State said that hecould see no alternative to the course proposed in CP. (48) 272 :he believed that it could be defended in law and that, from thepolitical point of view, there was much to commend it.In discussion the following particular points were raised : (a) If Eire were allowed to retain all her existing advantagesoh the basis of a reciprocal exchange of citizenship rights; was therenot a grave risk that India and some of the other commonwealth countries would demand the same treatment? By making thisarrangement in respect of Eire, should we not be moving towardsthe conception, which had hitherto been rejected, of an inner ringof Commonwealth countries and an outer ring of associated States ?In reply it was pointed Out that it was not here suggested thatan exchange of citizenship rights should be accepted as a basis for membership of the Commonwealth : Eire was hot to remain withinthe Commonwealth. Moreover, the argument that Eire was not&quot;foreign&quot; to the Commonwealth countries would be based,not merely oh the statutory exchange Of citizenship rights, but alsooh the many ties of blood, history and intermingling of peopleswhich .bouncl Eire to the Older countries of the Commonwealth.These latter arguments could hot be used in support Of a claim thatan Asiatic Country could still be regarded as not being &quot; foreign &quot;to Commonwealth countries after it had ceased to be a member ofthe Commonwealth.(b) If the policy Outlined in CP. (48) 272 were approved, itwould not be necessary to make any change in the domestic law ofthe United Kingdom, unless a claim by a third patty on &quot;most-favoured-nation &quot; grounds were upheld by the International Court.We should, however, be seeking to create in international law a newconception of an intermediate position between that of a Common-wealth country and of a foreign country. From this point of view,it was important that an early declaration should be made to theeffect that, despite the repeal of the External Relations Act, theGovernments Of the Commonwealth countries would hot regard Eireas a foreign State. This declaration should not be deferred untilthe position in international law seemed likely to be challenged. Itshould be made as soon as possible after the Second Reading of theBill for the repeal of the External Relations Act. If possible itshould be made in similar terms by the Governments of all Common-wealth countries.(c) The Government of Northern Ireland should be informed atonce of the course of the recent discussions with Eire Ministers. Itwas possible that the policy outlined in CP. (48) 272 might embitterrelations between the Government of Northern Ireland and the eire government, and it might even prejudice the good relations betweenthe Government of Northern Ireland and the United KingdomGovernment. The British Nationality Act extended to NorthernIreland; but there were local powers under which restrictions couldbe imposed on Eire citizens in Northern Ireland. Thus, we had no power to require the Government of Northern Ireland to extend their local f rahchise to Eire citizens.(d) The Opposition Leaders should also be informed of theCourse of the recent discussions with Eire Ministers.
105 CM. 74 (48)(e) Eire Ministers had indicated that the Act repealing the external Relations Act would not be brought into operation before 1st January. To avoid any doubts about the effect of section 3 (2)of the British Nationality Act, 1948, it was desirable that the dateof commencement of the new Eire Act should not in any event beearlier than 2nd January, 1949.The general conclusion of the Cabinet was that, subject to anyviews which might be expressed on behalf of the Government ofNorthern Ireland, the policy outlined in CP. (48) 272 should beadopted. Ministers reached this conclusion with reluctance, as they felt that Eire would thereby succeed in retaining many of thepractical advantages of Commonwealth membership whilerenouncing its obligations. They recognised, however, that, if theyinsisted on treating Eire as a foreign State after the repeal of the external Relations Act, the practical difficulties would be greaterfor the United Kingdom than for Eire; and, furthermore, that theywould thereby forfeit the sympathy and support of Canada,Australia and New Zealand. From the practical point of view, therewas some reason to believe that, although Eire Ministers wereinsisting on this political gesture of severing the last constitutionallink with the Commonwealth, the people of Eire were moving towards a closer and friendlier association with the United Kingdomand other Commonwealth countries; and it was possible that, as the eire Ministers claimed, a better relationship with Eire might be built up over the coming years on the basis of the factual associationnow proposed.The Cabinet^-(1) Took note that the Prime Minister would at once inform thePrime Minister of Northern Ireland of the course of therecent discussions with Eire Ministers and of the policy outlined in CP. (48) 272.(2) Subject to the results of the consultation to be undertaken in pursuance of Conclusion (1), agreed that the eire government should be informed, in advance of the forth-coming debate in the Dail on the Bill for the repeal ofthe External Relations Act, that the United KingdomGovernment were prepared to proceed on the basis indicated in paragraph 8 of CP. (48) 272.(3) Subject also to Conclusion (1), authorised the Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Relations to consult other Com-commonwealth Governments on the terms of a declaration, tobe made as soon as possible after the Second Reading ofthe Bill for the repeal of the External Relations Act on24th November, to the effect that despite the repeal ofthat Act Commonwealth Governments would not regardEire as a foreign country.(4) Invited the Prime Minister to inform the opposition leaders, before 24th November, of the course which the eire Government had decided to take and of the policywhich Commonwealth Governments proposed to follow in respect of Eire&apos;s future relations with theCommonwealth.The Cabinet were informed that the Lord Chancellor andthe Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations had on17th November held a further discussion with the Prime Ministerof New Zealand, the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and theCanadian Secretary of State for External Affairs on the constitu-tional proposals put forward by the Prime Minister of India andthe Law Officers&apos; Opinion on those proposals (CP. (48) 254). Therepresentatives of the other Commonwealth countries had not regarded those proposals as satisfactory; and had suggested thatthey should join with the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations in discussing them with the Secretary-General of the
Indian Ministry of External Affairs and Commonwealth Relations(Sir Girja Bagpai) who was then in Paris. The Prime Minister had agreed that this meeting should take place, and it was held in Parislater on 17th November. It had then been represented to Sir GirjaBagpai, on behalf of the four Commonwealth Governments, that india&apos;s authority to appoint diplomatic representatives abroadshould derive from the Crown, possibly through The King&apos;s dele-gation of the power of appointment to the President of the IndianRepublic. Sir Girja Bagpai had undertaken to transmit the viewsof the four Commonwealth Governments to Pandit Nehru.The Cabinet-(5) Took note of the representations which had been sent toPandit Nehru through Sir Girja Bagpai, on behalf of theGovernments of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australiaand New Zealand.Cyrenaica.(previous reference:CM. (48) 70thConclusions,Minute 3.)7. At their meeting on lltb November the Cabinet had invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to examine, with theMinisters directly concerned, the draft Trusteeship and otherAgreements for Cyrenaica annexed to CP. (48) 261. They now had before them a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster (CP. (48) 265) reporting the conclusions reached.The Chancellor of the -Du-chy of Lancaster said that it had beenagreed to recommend to the Cabinet that the documents annexed to CP. (48) 261 should be approved, subject to the amendments proposed in CP. (48) 265. The Service Departments and theTreasury were satisfied that their special interests were adequatelysafeguarded. Some doubt had been expressed about Article 6 ofthe draft Trusteeship Agreement, which provided that the administering Authority &quot;shall take all necessary steps to ensureequal treatment in social, economic, industrial and commercial matters for all members of the United Nations and their nationals &quot;;but this provision was common to all Trusteeship Agreements, andthere was no prospect of securing support for its omission from thisAgreement. Some criticism might be made of the failure to placeany time-limit on the restrictions which the Treaty would impose on the AnuVs powers; but it was virtually certain that the general assembly would insist on placing some time-limit on the operationof the Trusteeship Agreement, in which event an automatic limitwould be placed on the duration of the Treaty. The provision inthe draft constitution for female suffrage might not commend itselfto the Amir, and it was proposed that, if he raised objection, weshould give way on this point. There was no obligation to submit the documents, other than the draft Trusteeship Agreement, for theapproval of the United Nations and it was recommended that theyshould not be made public, or communicated to anybody except the amir, unless the General Assembly approved the draft trusteeship agreement. The Governments of India and Pakistan had shown a close interest in Cyrenaica, and it was proposed that the Secretaryof State for Commonwealth Relations should inform them at onceof the broad outline of the proposals, but should not communicate the text of any of the documents to them.In discussion, the following points were made : (a) The Lord Advocate drew attention to paragraph 4 of the note annexed to CP. (48) 261 in which it was stated that Article iii of the draft Treaty provided that for a certain fixed period theBritish Resident should have overriding powers to enact Ordinances
107 CM. 74 (48)having the force of law. He was doubtful whether Article III, as drafted, adequately gave effect to this intention, and it was agreedthat this point should be further examined. He had certain minorcomments on the terms of the drafts which he would communicate to the Foreign Office.(b) The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War saidthat the Chiefs of Staff were concerned at the suggestion that, if theGeneral Assembly pressed for a time-limit on the operation of the trusteeship Agreement, it might be necessary to agree that its terms should be reviewed after a period of ten years. They thought it important that we should have security of tenure for at least twenty-five years. It was agreed that any proposal for placing a time-limit on the Trusteeship Agreement should be strongly resisted; and that,if we had to give way, every effort should be made to secure agree-ment to the insertion of as long a period as possible.(c) It was agreed that advance information of our proposals should also be communicated to the other Commonwealth Govern-ments, including Ceylon.The Cabinet-Subject to the points noted in paragraphs (a) to (c) above,approved the recommendations made in CP. (48) 265.Germany. 8.   At their meeting on 15th October, the Cabinet had approvedReparations. the proposals made in, CP. (48) 234 regarding the line to be taken(Previous in the forthcoming negotiations with the United States government reference: on their proposal that the German reparations programme should become. (48) 63rd reviewed in the interests of the European Recovery Programme.Conclusions, They now had before them a memorandum by the Foreign SecretaryMinute 2.) (CP. (48) 259), summarising the outcome of subsequent negotiationswith the United States and French Governments.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (Lord Henderson) said that the main purpose of CP. (48) 259was to keep the Cabinet informed of the developments which hadtaken place on this question since 15th October. Agreement hadbeen satisfactorily reached with the United States and french governments on the basis proposed in CP. (48) 234. The arrange-ments adopted represented a delicately balanced compromise between two irreconcilable views and, if they gave rise to administrativeor political difficulties, it might be necessary for the Cabinet toconsider a more radical approach to the problem. In the meantime,it was proposed that the Military Governor should be authorisedto suspend at once the dismantling of thirty-five plants in the british zone which were under review by the Humphrey Committee and ought in his view to be retained in Germany. This arrangement would avoid waste of labour and materials, and would preclude the criticism that the British authorities had acted unreasonably in not anticipating the Humphrey Committee&apos;s recommendations inobvious cases.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the position as set out in CP. (48) 259.(2) Agreed that the Military Governor should be authorised athis discretion to suspend forthwith the dismantling ofthe thirty-five plants listed in Annex D to CP. (48) 259.
9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (CP. (48) 266) proposing certain increases in food rations for christmas. .The Minister of Food said that it had been the practice, inrecent years, to make some special increases in food rations for christmas. On this occasion there was little that could be done, buthe proposed to allow an additional four ounces of tea, two ouncesof sweets and half a pound of sugar. It would also be possible to double the normal allocations of manufacturing meat duringChristmas week. He was anxious to announce these increases Isfterthat day. 1The Chancellor of the Exchequer supported these proposals.It would, however, be advisable to give the United Kingdom Delega-tion to the Organisation for European Economic Co-operationadvance warning of our intentions; and the terms of the announce-ment should be agreed between the Ministry of Food and theTreasury.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals made in CP. (48) 266.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,18th November, 1948.Increased -; Rations, for -Christmas.(previous reference:CM. (47) 90thConclusions,Minute 1.)
