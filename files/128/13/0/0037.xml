Licensing 2.   The   Cabinet  were   informed  that   some  government bill. supporters had expressed concern about the application of Part iii of the Licensing Bill to established night clubs in London. It was alleged that the Bill would have the effect of compelling these clubsto close; and it would be said in debate that, as a result of this Bill,London would become the only capital city in the world in whichit was impossible to buy alcoholic drinks after 11 p.m. The organisa-tions responsible for promoting tourist traffic to this country had represented that their work would be seriously prejudiced by theBill. And, to the extent that it had the effect of closing clubs towhich people went mainly for dancing, the Bill would be criticised as an unwarrantable interference with the harmless pleasures ofresidents in this country as well as foreign tourists. The generalpoint was also made that, if Parliament enacted statutes which didnot command the general support of the people, it ran the risk ofundermining that public respect for the law on which the stability of society largely depended.In reply it was pointed out that these provisions of the bill were designed to take the place of powers under Defence Regulationsby which the police had hitherto controlled undesirable bottle parties and refreshment houses. For many years past it had been illegalto.sell alcoholic drinks in night clubs after the ordinary permittedhours; the bottle party had been the latest device for evading thisprovision of the law, and these provisions of the Bill were designedto check that evasion. While some people might deprecate strictercontrol over the sale of alcoholic drinks in London night clubs, other sections of public opinion would be strongly opposed to any extensionof the facilities for drinking in clubs after the hours at which drinkcould be sold in licensed premises.It was the general view of the Cabinet that these provisions ofthe Bill should be re-examined on the basis that no unnecessaryrestrictions should bejplaced on the existing facilities for obtainingalcoholic drinks in established night clubs. Meanwhile, the chief whip should try to arrange that the debate on the Second reading of the Bill should be deferred until the week beginning13th December.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Presidents Committee to review, in thelight of their discussion, the provisions of the LicensingBill affecting the sale of alcoholic drinks in night clubs.Iron andSteel Bill.(previous reference:C.M.(48)64thConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Minister of Supply said that the Chairman of theExecutive Committee of the British Iron and Steel Federation hadtentatively suggested to him that, if the Government were willingto give an assurance that the vesting of assets under the Iron andSteel Bill would not take place until some time after the next general Election, the Federation would seek to secure the con-tinuance of the Iron and Steel Board, would state publicly that theywould press forward with the existing development plan of theindustry and with preliminary work on any subsequent plan, and(on a confidential basis) would give technical assistance in theworking out of provisions in the Iron and Steel Bill such as those relating to the hiving off of assets. The Minister recalled that theBill provided for the vesting of assets on 1st May, 1950, or on suchsubsequent date (not being later than eighteen months from the parliament. 1.   The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business business in    to be taken in the House of Commons in the following week,the House of The Cabinet were also informed that Parliament would beCommons.      adjourned for the Christmas Recess on 17th December and wouldreassemble on 18th January.
Eassing of the Act) as^ the Minister might determine. This datead been inserted in the Bill on the assumption that, if the Houseof Lords passed the Bill in the current session, a period of nine months from its becoming law would give reasonable time to com-plete the arrangements for the vesting; while, if the Bill were rejected by the Lords in the current session and did not become law until the spring of 1950, the Government would be in a strongbargaining position, since the industry was anxious that vestingshould not take place until after the Election. From a technical point of view, and leaving political considerations out of account,there would be great value m the assistance which the Federationwere prepared to give in return for a clear understanding thatvesting would not take place until after the Election. It would bea great convenience to the Department if the Iron and Steel Boardcould continue in Operation. It would be advantageous to theGovernment to have the assurance that the industry would give their full co-operation in maintaining production and pressing on with development plans. And the technical assistance of the Federa-tion in connexion with the Bill would undoubtedly ease the dim-&apos;culties of transition from private to public ownership.In support of an agreement with the Iron and Steel Federation,it was pointed out that the future of this industry was bound tobe made an issue in the next Election. It had always been recog-nised that it would probably not be practicable to complete the vesting of the industry&apos;s assets before the Election. If the Govern-ment had to announce a few weeks before 1st May, 1950, that the vesting date was to be- postponed, this step might be represented asa sign that the Government were weakening in their resolve andwere uncertain about the result of the Election. The general publichad not shown as much concern about the Bill as had been prophesiedin some quarters, and an agreement with the Federation which ledto a smoother transition to public ownership would probably accord with the mood of the country. It would be undesirable to makeany kind of secret bargain with the Federation, since the existenceof such an arrangement would become known and might lead tomisinterpretation : if any agreement were to be reached it shouldbe made known publicly. SO far as the Bill was concerned, an amendment could take the form either of postponing the earliestvesting date from 1st May, 1950, to 1st January, 1951, or of pro-viding that vesting should take pbxce not earlier than eight ornine months after the passing of the Act. A fixed date had someadvantages; but it had the disadvantage that it did not fit very well with the two different contingencies which had to be envisaged,namely, that the House of,Lords accepted the Bill in the current session and the vesting date could be early, or that it was passed in the second session under the amended provisions of the Parlia-ment Act and vesting had to be postponed.The general feeling of the Cabinet was, however, that it was undesirable at this stage to enter into any such understanding withthe Federation. The refusal of various members of the Iron andSteel Board to continue to serve on the Board had not reflectedcredit on the industry, and the Federation might seek to secure the revival of the Board without any concession by the Government.The Federation had at all times tried to avert nationalisation byshowing how much the industry was producing under private owner-ship, and it seemed unlikely that this trend of policy would be reversed. It was not clear how the Federation could combine effec-tive technical assistance on the Bill with intense political oppositionto it, and in any event technical assistance would be of greater valuewhen the scheme had to be put into operation after the Bill had passed into law. If the Government avowed at this stage that theywould await the verdict of a fresh General Election before takingthe industry into national ownership, they might be thought to beweakening in their view that they had secured a mandate for this legislation in 1945; the House of Lords would be given somecolourable excuse for obstructing the Bill; and it would be verj
difficult to explain the position to Government supporters who, bythe large vote given on the Second Reading of the Bill, had shown themselves to he greatly heartened by the introduction of this measure.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Minister of Supply should not enter into any understanding on the lines which had been suggested to him by the Chairman of the Executive Committee ofthe Iron and Steel Federation.Common- 4.   -p^e Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Primewealth Con-    Minister   (CP. (48) 283)   covering  certain  recommendations  onsaltation.        arrangements for Commonwealth consultation which had been(Previous       adopted at the recent Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.Reference: It had been agreed at the meeting that these recommendationsCM. (48)65th should be submitted to Commonwealth Governments for approval.Conclusions, It was proposed that the Secretary of State for CommonwealthMinute 3.) Relations should now be authorised to inform other commonwealth governments that the United Kingdom Government, for their part,approved these recommendations and would be pleased to give effectto them if they were acceptable to other Commonwealth Govern-ments.In discussion, the Cabinet were informed that the Governmentsof New Zealand, Pakistan, Ceylon and Southern Rhodesia hadnotified their unqualified acceptance of these recommendations. Afinal reply had not yet been received from the Australian Govern-ment; but the Prime Minister of Australia had indicated that theproposals were likely to be acceptable to his Government also. the replies received from the Governments of Canada and India were less favourable : both had been unable to accept the specific proposalfor regular meetings on foreign affairs; and, in general, they had expressed doubt whether it was necessary to formalise arrangementsfor consultation which were already working satisfactorily inpractice.There was general agreement with the proposal that other commonwealth Governments should now be informed that theUnited Kingdom Government approved these recommendations andwould be ready to give effect to them. It was further agreed that,as soon as a definite reply had been received from the australian government, the Governments of Canada and India should be pressed to accept these recommendations, subject to the willingness of the other Commonwealth Governments to meet their views onthe proposal for regular meetings on foreign affairs. The cabinet would be consulted again before the recommendations were published.In further discussion, it was confirmed that the existing arrangements for consultation with the Indian authorities on matters affecting the position of Indians in Colonial territories would not be affected by the new proposals for Commonwealthconsultation.The Cabinet-Authorised the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations to inform other Commonwealth Governments thatthe United Kingdom Government accepted the recom-mendations annexed to CP. (48) 283.
Military 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordTraining President (CP. (48) 287) reporting the result of the Legislation(Facilities) Committee&apos;s examination of the question whether the draft MilitaryBUI. Training (Facilities) Bill could be amended to meet the objections(Previous which would be raised against it by agricultural and other landedReference:        interests.CM. (48) 76th The Lord president explained that the Lord Chancellor had conclusions, suggested to the Legislation Committee a number of safeguardsMinute 4.) which might be introduced into the Bill, and the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for War had been willing to accept most ofthese. Nevertheless, it had been the general view of the Committeethat the War Office should continue to operate for the time beingunder Defence Regulation 52; that the agreed safeguards shouldbe introduced into the administration of the Defence Regulation;and that, in the light of experience, the War Office should prepare the draft of permanent legislation, which need not be passed into law before December 1950.The Secretary of State for War said that, while he was preparedto accept this compromise, he wished to make it clear that difficulties might arise on account of a promise which had been given on behalfof the War Office in November 1947 that Defence Regulation 52would not be employed to authorise the temporary use of land towhich it had not previously been applied. The Army would, there-fore, be thrown back on securing the use of land by agreement, andthis might not prove to be enough.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that for the time being the Government should not proceed with the introduction of legislation on the linesof the draft Military Training (Facilities) Bill.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for War to examine withthe Departments concerned the administrative safe-guards which might be introduced into the use of defence regulation 52, and to report on this and on the formof permanent legislation to the Lord presidents committee.Civil Service 6.   The Cabinet had before them two memoranda (E.P.C. (48)Salaries. 87 and 95) which the Chancellor of the Exchequer had submittedto the Economic Policy Committee regarding the recommendationsof the Committee appointed in February 1948, under the chairman-ship of Lord Chorley, to consider the level of remuneration of thehigner posts in the Civil Service. Preliminary consideration hadalready been given to these memoranda by the Economic Policy Com-mittee, and the Cabinet had also before them a confidential record of a discussion held by that Committee on 29th November(E.P.C. (48) 38th Meeting).After discussion the Cabinet reached the following conclu-sions: (1) The Report of the Chorley Committee, of which a proofwas annexed to E.P.C (48) 87, should be published.(2) The Chancellor of the Exchequer should see the representa-tives of the Civil Service grades concerned and should seek to persuade them, as recommended in paragraph of E.P.C (48) 87, to agree that the introduction of thenew rates of salary recommended in the Report shouldbe deferred for the time being.(3) The Chancellor of the Exchequer should consider meansof securing that the interval before the new rates were applied should be the longest possible consistent with the
131CM. 77 (48)Cabinefs decision to adopt them; and should, in particu-lar, consider the suggestion, put forward in the Cabinet&apos;discussion, that scales of salary should be adopted forranks above Assistant Secretary.(4) Great care should be taken in presenting to the public theGovernment^ decision to adopt the recommendations ofthe Chorley Report; and, in particular, every effort should be made to avoid any implication that the white paper on Personal Incomes, Costs and Prices (Cmd.7321) was being set aside.(5) It was noted, with reference to the repercussions discussed in E.P.C. (48) 95, that it would be necessary for theGovernment to review judicial salaries; and that the salary increases for Chief Constables, which had beenaccepted in principle but delayed on account of theWhite Paper on Personal Incomes, Costs and Prices,would have to be brought into operation.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,2nd December, 1948.
