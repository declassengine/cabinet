Receipts andExpenditureof the british transport commission.(previous reference:CM. (47) 67thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Ministerof Transport (CP. (48) 213) on the finances of the British transport commission.The Minister of Transport recalled that railway charges andfares had been increased to 55 per cent, over the pre-war level from 1st October, 1947, in order that the Commission^ revenues mightbe adequate both to cover operational costs and to provide for wast-age of assets, amortisation of capital and the maintenance of asuitable reserve. It had been estimated that these increased charges would yield an additional  65 millions in 1948, but it was now clear that the gross railway receipts might fall short of the original estimate by as much as  3*0 millions. Moreover, additional interest charges amounting to  4^ millions a year had been incurred as theresult of issuing the Transport Stock at 3 per cent. It thusappeared inevitable that, even if no further concessions were madeto demands for increased wages, the Commission^ accounts for 1948would show a substantial deficit. The revenue both from passenger and general merchandise traffic had been particularly disappointing;and there was little doubt that the increase in fares and changes made in October, 1947, had diverted traffic from the railways to road transport. Railway charges had nevertheless risen far lessthan wages and the prices of materials, which were more than100 per cent, above the pre-war levels, and some further increase in charges might therefore prove unavoidable. He proposed to ensurethat the Commission gave close attention to securing the maximumeconomy from unification; but there were also certain directions in which the Government, by adopting a more helpful and sympathetic-thetic attitude towards the Commission, might legitimately assistthe success of this socialised industry. For instance, the competition of road transport made it very difficult for the railways to continueto bear the present burden imposed on them by the extensive systemof differential charges for special types of users. Nor could therailways attract additional traffic if they were not given adequate supplies of steel to enable them to offer increased facilities. It wasalso important that Departments should make the maximum use ofthe railways and, in particular, should not establish or increasefleets of road vehicles for the transport of traffic which could becarried by rail.The following points were made in discussion : (a) The estimate contained in CP. (48) 213 related only tothe railway operations of the British Transport Commission. Ithad been recognised, as part of the case for the socialisation oftransport, that the Commission^ aim should be to achieve a balancedaccount in its operations as a whole rather than in one part of them.The Cabinet could not reach firm conclusions on the issues raised in CP. (48) 213 until they had before them comparable estimates of the receipts and expenditure of other forms of transport con-trolled by the Commission.(&amp;) At the same time, the Railway Executive should be encouraged to make every effort to reduce the defici t, particularly since it was clearly too large to be covered by profits earned by theother Executives. It was not clear from CP. (48) 213 what measures the Commission had in mind for meeting the situation,and they should be asked to submit their proposals.(c) The obligations imposed on the Commission to providefunds out of revenue to cover wastage of assets, amortisation ofcapital, and the maintenance of a general reserve, although anal-ogous to those applicable to municipal trading concerns, constituted a much heavier burden than would be/accepted. by any commercialconcern. There, might therefore be a case for some relaxation ofthe existing requirements for the amortisation of capital.(d) In paragraph 9 of CP. (48) 213 it was stated that changesin organisation were being impeded by difficulties in providingoffice accommodation and houses for staff. -It was not clear, how-ever, why additional office or housing accommodation should berequired as the result of measures of unification. *
(e) The question whether reduced fares for members of theForces could not be made available on a commercial basis was beingexplored. If this should prove impracticable, the possibility -ofcarrying on the Service Votes the cost of travel concessions to members of the Forces would have to be considered.(/) The pressure of road competition could be reduced bydiverting a higher proportion of the output of commercial roadvehicles to export markets.(g) There was general agreement that the railways shouldreceive a fair share of the traffics controlled by GovernmentDepartments.(h) It was pointed out that, in the allocation of scarce materials,the socialised industries might receive less generous treatment thanprivate industries whose demands could not be so closely scrutinised,or whose consumption was less easily controlled. It was important to guard against any such tendency.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Transport, in the light of the dis-cussion and after consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer, to circulate a further memorandum on the finances of the British Transport Commission.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of town and Country Planning (CP. (48) 226) recommending thata proposal to acquire about 1,100 acres of land at Ross Links foruse as an anti-tank gunnery training range should be approved. Apublic local enquiry into the proposal had been held and the reportof this enquiry was annexed to CP. (48) 226.The Cabinet were informed that two of the anti-tank gunneryranges included in the War Departments original programme hadbeen abandoned and that, apart from Ross Links, the only availablerange was at Lydd. It would be impossible .to provide all thetraining required by the use of the Lydd range alone; no other suitable coastal range could be found, and the formation of aninland range would entail the acquisition of some 21,000 acres ofland. Ross Links had been used for anti-tank gunnery since 1942and, until the War Department had proposed to acquire it perma-nently for this purpose, there had been no serious opposition fromthe local inhabitants. The Commissioner who had held the public enquiry was satisfied that objection could not be taken to the pro-posal on the grounds of interference with agriculture, fishing and shipping, tourism or the protection of amenities; and, since adequateprecautions would be taken to prevent any physical interferencewith Holy Island, the objection raised on religious grounds couldnot reasonably be sustained.In discussion it was pointed out that, though local opinion might have acquiesced in the use of Ross Links &quot;for anti-tankgunnery training during the war, there would undoubtedly be strong criticism of the permanent acquisition of the site for thispurpose. On the other hand, it seemed.&quot; clear that the Army&apos;straining programme could not be carried out unless the proposal made in CP. (48) 226 was approved. The precautions which wouldbe taken to avoid any interference with Holy Island and the arrange-ments for restricting firing to five days a week should go some way towards meeting the objections raised and it would be desirable tobring out these points when the decision was announced.The Cabinet-Approved the proposal for the acquisition of land at RossLinks for use as an anti-tank gunnery range.
brussels treaty.Meeting ofMinisters ofDefence.(previous reference:CM. (48) 54thConclusions.)3 The Minister of Defence informed the Cabinet that he had reached agreement with the Defence Ministers of the other signa-tories of the Brussels Treaty on the appointment of Field-MarshalMontgomery as Chairman of the Western Union Commanders-in-Chief in Committee. The task of the Commanders-m-Chief wouldbe to study the technical and tactical aspects of Western Uniondefence Under Field-Marshal Montgomery, a French Generalofficer would be responsible for plans for the use of land forces anda United Kingdom officer for plans for the use of air forces. air marshal Robb had been nominated as the Air Commander-in-ChiefMinisters. A French Flag officer for Western Union would advise on the state of preparedness in western European ports but wouldhot be concerned with naval command at sea for the protection of sea communications.The French nominations would be made after a meeting of theFrench Cabinet on. 1st October, and a communique would be issuedlater on the same day.A Military Supply Board would also be set up. The Ministerof Defence had resisted a suggestion that the chairmanship of this board should rotate and it had finally been agreed that tne board should sit under a United Kingdom chairman for twelve months,after which the question of the chairmanship would be reviewed.A detailed account of the arrangements made would be circulatedto the Defence Committee.-   The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the statement made by theMinister of Defence.and his appointmentDefenceCabinet Office, S.
