EuropeanEconomicCo-operation.Loans under.. the.european recovery &apos;&apos; &apos; Programme. &apos;(Previous&apos;Kef erence:CM. (48) 47thConclusions,Minute 8.)1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the UnitedStates Government had now indicated their proposals regarding the initial amount and the terms of the loan to be provided to theUnited Kingdom under the European Recovery Programme. they proposed a loan of $300 million for the period April to December1948, interest of 3 per cent, payable from 30th June, 1952, andamortisation in 42 equal annual instalments from 30th June, 1956.They further proposed that, in any year when interest was waivedunder Article V of the Loan Agreement of 1945, we should be able tosecure a full discharge of both interest payments and amortisationpayments under this new loan by paying into a blocked account the sterling equivalent of the amounts due in that year.n v ^The Chancellor said that he could not agree to a higher rate of-interest than 2  per cent., which was the rate at which the UnitedStates Government were themselves raising the funds required forthis purpose; Nor could he recommend the Cabinet to accept theproposal for a blocked sterling account. If such an account werecreated the United States Government would be able to press us.to liquidate it when there was any increase in our general reserves,and this possibility would prejudice our prospects of restoring the convertibility of sterling; Moreover, any use of our reserves to meetthe dollar needs of the sterling area might entail demands forequivalent repayment to the United States. And, finally, there wasthe possibility that a United States Government might in the futuretake advantage of this blocked account to propose the purchase ofUnited Kingdom assets.,. : -The Chancellor of the Exchequer therefore proposed that weshould decline to accept a higher rate of interest than 2\ per cent.,and that, as regards waiver of interest and amortisation payments,we should ask for similar arrangements to those applicable underthe Loan Agreement of 1945. This would mean that, if in any yearwe found ourselves unable to meet the payments due in service ofthe loan, we should be able to ask for consultation between the twoGovernments; and he hoped also to secure that payments should be/suspended pending the conclusion of those consultations.&apos; If these two points could be met, the proposals of the UnitedStates Government could be accepted.The Cabinet- 1 &apos;.. ; Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer; and agreed that instructions in the .terms suggested should be sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in washington.Parliament, ;t;      2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theBusiness in &apos;   House of Commons in the following week,the House ofCommons.:criminla justice Bill.capital punishment.(previous reference:CM. (48) 51stConclusions,Minute 2.)3. On 15th July the House of Commons had accepted, by 307votes to 209, the compromise clause, which the Cabinet had approvedon 5th July, providing that the death penalty should be retainedonly for certain specified classes of murder. On 20th July, how-ever, the House of Lords had decisively rejected this clause by99 votes to 19. The Cabinet discussed what advice the Home Secre-tary should give to the House of Commons when this decision ofthe House of Lords came before them later that day.Ministers were not prepared to lose the remaining provisionsof the Criminal Justice Bill by reason of a disagreement betweenthe two Houses on the question of capital punishment. They alsorejected the possibility of securing the passage of this Bill byrecourse to the Parliament Act procedure. Under that procedure Bill could only b passed in the form in which it first left the commons, viz., inci  Ling the original clause suspending for five35686-3b 2
years all the powers of, the civil courts to pass sentence of death:as a penalty for murder, and excluding the valuable amendments which had been-made by the House of Lords in other parts of theBill. Moreover, from the political point of view it would be mostinexpedient, to use the procedure of the Parliament Act on thisquestion, on which public opinion was divided otherwise than onParty lines-particularly at a time when that procedure was likelyto be invoked on a major political issue to secure ,the passage ofthe Iron and Steel Bill.&quot; In these circumstances the Cabinet agreed that the Commons; should be&apos;.&apos; advised : to accept the Lords&apos; decision and allow the criminal ! Justice Bill to pass into law without any provisionlimiting the power of the courts to impose the death penalty. Atthe same time, it should be recognised that the debates in bothHouses had disclosed a widespread desire for some change in thelaw on this point; and an assurance should be given that the Govern-ment would continue their search for some practicable means of, limiting the use of the death penalty. In further discussion it wassuggested that it might be helpful if a small committee were appointed, including persons of differing shades of political opinion,to consider how the use of the death penalty could best be limited.If such a committee were appointed, j.t would be desirable that its terms of reference should be so drawn as to relieve it of the task of considering afresh the general arguments for and against thetotal abolition of capital punishment. Ministers did not, however,think it advisable that the Government spokesman in the debatelater that day should mention the possibility that a committee mightbe appointed. Nor should he commit the Government to introducingseparate legislation on this subject in the present Parliament.The Cabinet- 1(1) Invited the Home Secretary to advise the House ofCommons to acquiesce in the Lords&apos; rejection of the. compromise clause retaining the death penalty for cer-tain specified classes of murder, and to allow the criminal Justice Bill to pass into law without any pro-vision limiting the power of the courts to impose the, death penalty. - - .(2) Authorised the Home Secretary to give an assurance, on; the lines indicated in their discussion, that the Govern-. . ment would continue their search for some practicable:       means of limiting the use of the death penalty.4. The Cabinet were informed that the leaders of the Con-servative Opposition in the House of Lords were not anxious tomaintain their opposition to the British Nationality Bill and wouldprobably refrain from pressing their amendments if a publicassurance could be given that the anxieties expressed in both houses of Parliament regarding the provisions and implications of the bill would be further examined at the forthcoming meeting of Common-wealth Prime Ministers.. .In discussion it was. pointed out that the United KingdomGovernment could not alone determine the subjects to be discussed at these meetings of Commonwealth Prime Ministers, and it wasa convenient rule that the Agenda for such meetings should besettled only by common consent. The United Kingdom Governmentwere not, therefore, in a position to give an assurance that thissubject would be discussed at the October meeting. It would, how-ever, be possible for the Government spokesman in the House ofLords to say that all Commonwealth Governments had received fullreports on the Bill and on the discussions which it had provokedin Parliament, and that at the forthcoming meeting of Common-wealth. Prime Ministers in October these would be available fordiscussion, if desired. The Government spokesman might also recall that this question had been discussed at the meeting of Common-wealth Prime Ministers held in 1946, and subsequently by a con-
parliamentary procedure.Effect of.&apos;   ;Local Govern-.,ment Act;1948.\ (Previous ,   ;reference:CM. (48) 23rdConclusions,Minute 2.)Germany.Situationin Berlin.(Previous:reference:C.M.(48)52ndConclusions,Minute 2.):,! 5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellprof.the Exchequer (CP. (48) 189) proposing certain amendments ofthe Standing Orders of the House of Commons relating to private business. These amendments, which were set out in the Annex to cp. (48) 189, were designed to safeguard the position of theExchequer under the new system of equalisation grants providedfor in the Local Government Act, 1948. Their effect would be toenable the Government to require rateable expenditure authorised by private Bills to be excluded from the equalisation grant calcu-lations, and it would be necessary to explain to local authorities inadvance how it was intended that this power should be exercised.The amendments would be put on the Order Paper during thecurrent session, but no attempt would be made to proceed withthem. No corresponding changes were required in the standing orders relating to public business.&apos;    The Cabinet- &apos;(1) Approved the proposed amendments of the standing orders of the House of Commons relating to private! 1 business set out in the Annex to CP. (48) 189.i- (2) Authorised the Minister of Health and the Secretary ofState for Scotland to communicate the amendments tolocal authorities with an explanation of the manner in:   : which it was intended to exercise the new power con-ferred by. them.     &apos;6. The Foreign Secretary said that he hoped it would bepossible to despatch a note to the Soviet Government that day. in drafting the note he had consulted the Governments of the UnitedStates and France, and he had resisted a United States suggestionthat the Berlin situation should be referred to the Security Council.The note would ask for the removal of the difficulties which hadinterrupted the movement of persons and goods between theWestern: Zones and Berlin, and would suggest technical discus-sions with a view to overcoming these and any other difficulties,such as the currency problem, which were connected with or had.a direct effect on the situation in Berlin. At the same time it wouldmake it clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government were willing to enterinto wider discussions covering, not only the German problem as awhole, but also the problem of establishing firm conditions of peace in Europe. The measures taken to supply Berlin by air, in which;the part played by the Royal Air Force was most creditable, had greatly encouraged our; Allies in Yfestern Europe, and had effec-, tively shown to Eastern European countries that we were deter-mined to stand firm. It was impossible to forecast the results ofthis further note and it had therefore been thought right to explore-with the United States Government what practical steps they wouldbe prepared to take in the event of an emergency. Meanwhile, hewas making every effort to avoid any incident that might lead toa crisis. He proposed to make a short statement about the situationin Parliament later that day and would, in general, follow the line taken in the statement made on the previous day by the UnitedStates Secretary of State. ;   : &apos;&apos; The following points.were made in discussion: (a) The Treasury and the Foreign Office were making a jointenquiry into the currency situation in the western sectors of Berlin.ference of technical representatives from Commonwealth countries,and that the scheme embodied in Clause 1 of the Bill gave effectto the recommendations submitted by that conference to Common-wealth Governments.The Cabinet-, , , . Authorised the Lord Chancellor to make a statement on... these.lines when the proceedings on the British Nationality, &apos;     Bill were resumed in the House of Lords.&apos;
The .Antarctic&apos; i(Previous   &apos;Reference:CM. (48) 8thConclusions,Minute 5.)Palestine.(Previous     ;Reference:CM. (48) 48th-Conclusions,:Minute 5.).&apos;7.-The Foreign, secretary said that, while there was someresentment ? in the Arab countries at the attitude adopted by theUnited Kingdom representative in the Security Council, the mainbitterness was.against the United States. The Governments of theArab States seemed to recognise that we had acted in their best interests, i Since the King of Transjordan was now observing the truce, there seemed to be no justification for withholding the financialassistance payable to him under the terms of the Treaty of Alliance.The Foreign Secretary proposed that payment should now be resumed. The United States Government would be informed inadvance.&quot;      , -   -  - -       ,; The Cabinet- .&apos;     ^  &apos; ,- &apos; . : Agreed that the payments due to Transjordan under the-.&apos; v!-f,f Treaty of Alliance should be resumed.18. The Cabinet considered a memorandum&apos; by the foreign secretary (CP. (48) 185) on recent developments in connection withthe territorial claims of the Argentine and Chilean Governments inthe Falkland Islands Dependencies.     1 .      i. It was explained that on 25th June the State Department had informed His Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Washington that they intendedto propose that.the Governments of the United States, UnitedKingdom, France, Norway, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina andChile should undertake a joint trusteeship of the whole AntarcticContinent and islands south of latitude 600. The State department had suggested that the South Orkney and South Shetland Islandsshould be excluded from the scope of their proposals so that theUnited Kingdom, Argentina and Chile might be left&apos; free to settle,their differences by direct negotiation. From our point of view, aproposal for an international regime offered certain importantadvantages. We had been reluctant to resist Argentine and Chileanencroachments by force, but there was little prospect that agreement could be reached by direct negotiation. If the dispute could be liftedon to a wider international plane, this might enable us to avoid the embarrassment which. would-result from protracted disagreement,&apos; The Foreign Secretarytherefore suggested that he should be authorised to enter into negotiations with the other Powers concerned with a view to the&apos; (&amp;)!&apos;The Soviet Government had offered to supply food to thewhole of Berlin from 1st August, but there was no guarantee thatthey would give effect to this offer, and it seemed likely that anyfood which they sent to Berlin would be at the expense of poland and Czechoslovakia.(c). After consultation with the Foreign Secretary, the Minister, of ^Agriculture and Fisheries had refused to guarantee compensa-! tion for trawlers which might be seized by the Soviet governmentin the event of war.; Trawler owners might therefore be unwilling to send their vessels to the Murmansk grounds and there might be,;some reduction in fish supplies.  Ministers agreed that any claimsi; of;this kind, should.be firmly resisted. ,. &apos;. ,,. -r.; u\y-----\(d) Though the achievements of the Royal Air Force in carryingI, supplies to Berlin : had exceeded all expectations, it. would hence-. form be necessary to look mainly to the United States Air Force for, ;any substantial increase in these supplies. ... -- (e) The fall of the French Government had aggravated thei difficulty of handling the Berlin situation and it was not yet clear whether a new Government would be formed in time to enable theproposed note to the Soviet Government to: be delivered with thebacking of France. ,, , -- ; : The Cabinet-   -;      &apos; .&apos; )      Endorsed the line which the Foreign Secretary waspursuing in dealing with the situation in Berlin.

It should, however, be made clear from the outset that we were not prepared to agree to place the Antarctic under trusteeship, as this would give an opening forSoviet interference.In the first instance,however, we must consult those Commonwealth countries withdirect interests in the Antarctic; and the Canadian Governmentshould be informed at the same time in view of possible reper-cussions on the situation in the Arctic. There was no questionof bringing the Falkland Islands within the scope of an internationalscheme, and we should continue to resist firmly the Argentine claim on these Islands.The Chief of the Air Staff said that, from the strategic pointof view, it was essential that British sovereignty over the falkland islands should be maintained. The views of the Chiefs of Staffon the strategic value of the Falkland Islands Dependencies had,however, changed in the light of the fuller information available as the result of recent surveys; for it was clear from these that no power could maintain an active operational base in the Dependencies.It remained important that arrangements should be maintained for the supply of meteorological reports from the Dependencies.The Minister of Defence expressed concern at the proposal that His Majesty&apos;s Government should agree to enter into negotia-tions for the establishment of an Eight-Power regime in the antarctic. Such action would be interpreted as a surrender toArgentine and Chilean pressure, and the Government would be criticised for the abandonment of British territory. Moreover, a dangerous precedent might be established. We had offered similarlyto submit the dispute over British Honduras to the Court of Inter-national Justice; and the Guatemalan Government might seek to invoke the aid of the United States Government in favour of bringing that Colony under some form of international regime. Inhis view, the right course was to adhere to our proposal that the antarctic dispute should be referred to the International Court.Some doubt was also expressed whether it was justifiable to propose that the Antarctic should be removed from the scope of theUnited Nations authority. Might not an arrangement designed to exclude the Soviet Government from the Antarctic further com-plicate the task of securing a satisfactory European settlement?It was pointed out, however, that no publicity had been given to theoriginal intention of the United States Government to propose a form of international trusteeship for this territory.It v/as the general view of the Cabinet that the procedure nowproposed could be regarded as a reasonable method for the settlementof overlapping claims. The Antarctic Continent was uninhabitedand largely unexplored, and our willingness to enter into negotia-tions for the establishment of an international regime in this area should not be an embarrassing precedent in- relation to claims against other parts.of the British Commonwealth. On the otherhand, refusal to accept the United States proposal would involvemost difficult decisions in regard to our attitude towards argentine and Chilean encroachments, and we should not have the supportof the United States Government in. any action that we might decide to take.In further discussion, the following points were made-(a) Of the Commonwealth Governments concerned Australiaalone was likely to be unsympathetic towards these proposals; but
economic affairs.(previous reference:CM. (48) 48thConclusions,Minute -6.)&quot;Wages.Man-Power.&quot;D wi rl n n +.1 r\mBalance ofPayments.9. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (48) 186) covering a report on the economicsituation.The following points were made in discussion : A disquieting feature of recent wages agreements had Been thetendency to link wage rates with the index of retail prices. It wasimpossible to avoid some fluctuation in the index and under someagreements a movement of as little as one point had to be followedby a revision of wage rates. Though there had been some recentprice increases and the full effect of the removal of clothing sub-subsidies had not yet been felt, it was hoped that the general levelof retail prices would fall. Little progress was being made in intro-ducing the system of payment by results in the building industry,and building workers were now pressing for a further increasein rates. &apos;The Minister of Labour said that experience seemed to beshowing that unduly high levels of employment had been set, in theEconomic Survey, for certain industries and that the apparentlyslow progress in recruiting for the under-manned industries was atleast partly due to their inability to absorb available labour. Inconsultation with the Agriculture Ministers, he was examining thesituation in agriculture, where the demands submitted by county agricultural Executive Committees seemed to have been inflatedand there was a danger that too much labour might be employed ona casual basis.The fall in the output of coal, iron and steel and textiles, thoughdisappointing, was thought to be no more than a seasonal changelargely due to holidays.The decline in gold and dollar reserves had been checked by theprovision of aid under the European Recovery Programme, but our efforts to stop the loss of gold to Belgium had not yet succeeded.The Cabinet-Took note of CP. (48) 186 and of the points made in thediscussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd July, 1948.there would shortly be an opportunity of consulting the AustralianForeign Minister personally in London.(b) Any attempt by the Argentine and Chilean Governments toextend the scope of the United States plan to cover South Georgiashould be firmly resisted in view of the economic importance of the island.(c) United Whaling, Ltd., were anxious to develop theirestablishment on Deception Island at the cost of some  500,000,provided that they could be given a firm assurance of a 21-year lease.Was it possible to ensure that the Condomininum administration would take over and confirm such a lease; and, if so, was it advisable to grant it in advance of the proposed negotiations?The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Eelationsto consult the Commonwealth -Governments concerned, on the proposals in CP. (48) 185.(2) Agreed that, if the concurrence of those commonwealth governments was secured, the Foreign Secretary should pursue the policy outlined in CP.
