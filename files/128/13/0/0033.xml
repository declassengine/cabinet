Her Soya!Highness ThePrincessElizabeth.Birth of a Son.1. The Prime Minister said that he would move an Addressin the House of Commons on the following day, expressing thepleasure of the House at the birth of a son to Their Royal High-nesses, the Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh. an address in similar terms would be moved in the House of Lords.The Cabinet invited the Prime Minister to convey their warmcongratulations to Their Majesties and to Their Royal Highnesses.ForeignAffairs.Germany.(PreviousB&amp;f erence:CM. (48)61s*Conclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister(CP. (48) 269) covering copies of telegrams relating to the letteron the Berlin dispute addressed to the Heads of Governments ofthe four Great Powers by the President of the United nations general Assembly and the Secretary-General of the United Nations.In their letter, Dr. Evatt and Mr. Trygve Lie referred to thei resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 3rd November lastcalling upon the Great Powers to renew their efforts to compose their differences and establish a lasting peace. They pointed out that thePowers signatory to the Moscow agreements of 24th December, 1945,had supported that resolution, and that the world would now expectthem to take active steps to give effect to it. The first step was to resolve the Berlin question; so long as the deadlock on that issuecontinued, the work of the United Nations in every field would be delayed and undermined. In these circumstances the Governmentsconcerned were urged to consider &quot; the desirability of immediateconversations and of taking all other necessary steps towards thesolution of the Berlin question.&quot; The signatories of the letter also expressed the belief that the Great Powers should lend their fulland active support to the efforts of mediation by the President ofthe Security Council. Dr. Evatt had at the same time addressed a personal telegram to the Prime Minister asking for sympathetic consideration of his communication to the four Great Powers.In discussion it was asked why Dr. Evatt should have addressedlmunication to Heads of Governments. He had no doubtfelt that it was incumbent on him, in communicating the resolution of 3rd November to the four Governments signatory to the Moscowagreement of 24th December, 1945, to reinforce personally theAssembly&apos;s efforts to secure a relaxation of tension in the inter-national situation. But it was known that, from the outset, Dr. Evatthad disagreed with the decision to refer the Berlin dispute to theSecurity Council: his attitude was in part due to a genuine con-viction that the smaller Powers ought not to be excluded from theefforts to secure a settlement and in part to his own desire to play a more direct part in the negotiations. It seemed probable, there-fore, that the object of his initiative was to transfer the responsi-bility for this question from the Security Council to the general assembly; and this view seemed to be confirmed by the fact that dr. Bramuglia, the President of the Security Council, had declinedDr. Evatt&apos;s invitation to join him in signing the appeal. Dr. Evatfsintervention might, perhaps, have been justified if he had been inpossession of information which suggested that,a new approach on these lines might produce fruitful results; but he had not con-suited the Western Powers in advance, and neither he nor the Sovietdelegate had so far given any hint that the Soviet government might be willing to modify their policy in any respect. As it was,his letter ignored the repeated assertions of the Western powers that they were not prepared to reopen negotiations under duress;and, in treating the Berlin question as the only major outstandingissue between the Great Powers, it obscured the point that this dispute was only one symptom of the world-wide tension betweenthe Soviet Union and the Western Powers. The letter also ignoredthe fact that the Western Powers had accepted the resolution pro-posed by the Security Council, and that this attempt by the smallerPowers to achieve a settlement had failed through the use of theSoviet veto. The Western Powers had repeatedly emphasised their willingness to resume conversations provided.that the blockade of berlin had first been raised, and Ministers did not think that the36205-1b 2
cause of peace would be served by accepting at this stage a proposalfor direct negotiations which involved the abandonment of thatfundamental condition and the removal of the Berlin dispute fromthe competence of the Security Council.The Cabinet were reminded that an understanding had beenreached in Paris on 27th October between the three&apos; foreign ministers of the Western Powers that they would concert all their actions in regard to any new developments in the Berlin situation;and it was agreed that, as a first step, the proposals contained inthe letter from Dr. Evatt and Mr. Trygve Lie should be discussed bythe Minister of State with the United States Secretary of Stateand the French Foreign Minister. It was clear from the draft replyprepared by the United States Delegation in Paris for submission to the State Department, copies of which were handed to minister during the discussion, that the reactions of the United States Dele-gation to Dr. Evatt&apos;s letter had been very similar to the views expressed in the Cabinefs discussion. Ministers thought, therefore,that the Minister of State should endeavour to reach agreementwith Mr. Marshall and M. Schuman on a reply recalling the readiness-ness of the Western Powers to accept the resolution proposed bythe Security Council, affirming their view that the Council shouldcontinue to handle this question, and emphasising their belief thatthere would be no advantage in holding Four-Power conversationsuntil the Soviet Union had lifted the blockade. In the meantime,the Prime Minister might send an interim reply to dr. Evatt expressing appreciation of his efforts for world peace and assuring Trim of the united Kingdom Governments readiness to examine his proposals sympathetically. Reference might be madeto the continued efforts of the President of the Security Council towork out the basis for a settlement; and, in conclusion, Dr. Evattmight be informed that the United Kingdom Government consideredthat this question should continue to be handled by the foreign ministers, who had already made such prolonged efforts to reach a settlement of the Berlin dispute. The final reply to the letterfrom Dr. Evatt and Mr. Trygve Lie should be sent by, or on behalfof, the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would send an interimreply, on the lines agreed in discussion, to the letter addressed to Heads of Government by the President ofthe United Nations General Assembly &quot;and the Secretary-General of the United Nations.(2) Agreed that the Minister of State should discuss this letterwith the United States Secretary of State and the french foreign Minister, and should endeavour to secure their agreement to the terms of a reply on the lines agreed in discussion.Common-wealthRelations.ConstitutionalDevelopmentsin Eire andIndia.(previous reference:CM. (48) 72ndConclusions.)a 3. The Cabinet were informed that, in pursuance of their discussion of 13th November, the Lord Chancellor and the Secretaryof State for Commonwealth Relations had held conversations inParis on the previous day with the Prime Minister of New Zealand,the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and the Canadian Secretaryof State for External Affairs. They had developed in some detail the practical difficulties which were likely to arise, in consequenceof the most-favoured-nation provisions of commercial treaties, ifEire repealed her External Relations Act and became a foreign state. As a result of these detailed explanations the representativesof the Commonwealth countries had realised more clearly the extentof the practical difficulties which would have to be faced. Theywere, however, still concerned to ensure that, if Eire was to secedefrom the Commonwealth, it should be made abundantly clear thatthis was by her own decision and that the Governments of theUnited Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries had done their utmost to make the consequences clear to her before any irrevocable
step had been taken. It had therefore been agreed to send animmediate message to the Eire Government suggesting that, in con-continuation of the conversations at Chequers on 17th October, further discussions should be held at the earliest possible date and, if prac-ticable, before the introduction of the legislation for the repeal ofthe External Relations Act. The Eire Cabinet had met on theprevious evening to consider this message and had decided to send representatives to Paris that day to continue these conversations with representatives of the Governments of the United Kingdom,Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The Lord Chancellor and theSecretary of State for Commonwealth Relations were returning to paris that afternoon to join in these further discussions.At a second meeting in the afternoon of 14th November theLord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations bad explained the latest developments in the discussionof India&apos;s future relations with the Commonwealth. At that meet-ing the Prime Minister of New Zealand had been present, butCanada and Australia had been represented by their High Com-missioners in London. The representatives of Canada, Australiaand New Zealand had been given copies of the constitutional pro-posals put forward by the Prime Minister of India and the LawOfficers&apos; Opinion thereon (CP. (43) 254), and a preliminary discus-sion had taken place on the legal aspects of the problem. At theconclusion of this discussion it had been made clear that the UnitedKingdom Government would warmly welcome the assistance of thethree other Commonwealth Governments in finding a satisfactory solution of this difficult problem; and the representatives of those governments had been asked in the first instance to consider whetherthey could offer any comments on the political considerations arisingfrom the legal opinion. Further discussions on the Indian problem would be held with the representatives of these commonwealth governments at the end of the forthcoming discussions with eire ministers in Paris.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the progress of the discussions with representatives of the Governments of Canada,Australia and New Zealand on future constitutional developments in Eire and India.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (48) 257) proposing that a dispute with the Nor-wegian Government over the fishing limits claimed for the exclusiveuse of Norwegian fishermen should be referred to the international court of Justice.The Minister of State explained that, since the Foreign Secre-tary submitted his paper, the Norwegian Government had expressed a strong desire for the settlement of the dispute by negotiationrather than by reference to the International Court. At the sametime, the Norwegian Government had made it clear that they would find it difficult to agree to the maintenance of the status quo in the fishing areas, because of a resolution by the Norwegian parliament that the full Norwegian claim should be enforced.In discussion, reference was made to the following points : (a) Arising out of previous claims by Norway, a modus vivendihad been agreed in 1933 on the basis of a line which was outsidethe strict limits of Norwegian territorial waters and made a sub-stantial concession to Norway. This further claim by the Nor-wegians related to some of the best fishing grounds. Eleven percent, of the total catch of white fish by British fishermen was madeoff the Norwegian coast.(6) In any negotiations the Norwegians would doubtless argue that the population of North Norway was almost entirely dependent
on off-shore fishing, and that competition with well-equipped foreignboats had seriously reduced their standard of living.(c) Since the Norwegian Government regarded themselves asbound by the resolution of the Norwegian Parliament in favourof the new claim, it was difficult to see what useful purpose wouldbe served by negotiations. The British Government could not beexpected to accept the view that a resolution of the NorwegianParliament made it difficult to maintain the status quo, pendingeither negotiations or a reference to the International Court.(d) It would be desirable to obtain a formal Opinion from theLaw Officers with a view to ascertaining the strength of the Britishcase. The Attorney-General had agreed that there seemed to beno practical alternative to a reference to the International Court;but the Cabinet would wish to know what were the prospects ofsuccess if the case went before the Court.(e) Any concession to Norway would prejudice the position ofthis country in dealing with the claims of several other countries to control the fisheries and waters off their coasts. It might also have repercussions on fisheries off the coasts of Great Britain.(/) Sooner or later the International Court would have toconsider the law relating to territorial waters, and it was probably in the interests of this country that the situation should be clarifiedat a reasonably early date.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to obtain from the LawOfficers a formal Opinion on the strength of the Britishcase in the Anglo-Norwegian fishery dispute.(2) Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should explore theprospects of securing a satisfactory settlement of thedispute by negotiation, while meantime maintaining thestatus quo.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to take all necessary preliminary steps for a reference of the matter to theInternational Court, so that there would be no avoidabledelay in presenting the case if negotiations broke downand if the Cabinet decided, in the light of the LawOfficers&apos; Opinion, that the case should be submitted tothe Court.Capital 5.   The Cabinet, at their meeting on 8th November, had invitedPunishment. the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland to(Previous submit draft terms of reference for an inquiry into capital punish-reference: ment by a Royal Commission which would not embrace the generalCM. (48) 69th question of the total abolition of capital punishment, together with conclusions.) an appreciation of the prospects of securing, for such a limitedinquiry, the services of individuals whose views would commandpublic confidence.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (48) 267)submitting draft terms of reference and proposing that, in viewof the interest in the matter which was being; shown in Parliament,an announcement should be made of the Government&apos;s intentionto set up a Royal Commission, although the composition had notyet been settled.In discussion the following points were raised on the proposed terms of reference : &apos;(a) The section which related to an inquiry into the law and practice in other countries should not be expressed in a way whichwould invite inquiry under this heading into the question of theabolition of the death penalty. Further, this part of the inquiry should be restricted to foreign countries with a similar traditionand background to our own. These points might be met if the reference to foreign countries came at the end of the terms of
97CM. 73 (48)reference and invited the Royal Commission to inquire and reporton the relevant law and practice in other countries.(6) The terms of reference should relate to Great Britain andnot to Northern Ireland.(c) It was desirable that the terms of reference should bediscussed with the Chairman of the Commission, when he wasappointed.It was explained that it might be possible to secure postpone-ment of a Question on the subject which had been put down for answer on Thursday, 18th November. Postponement of the question might make it possible for the Cabinet to have a clearer view ofthe probable composition of the Commission. The general view ofthe Cabinet was, however, that other Questions might be put down,and that the Government should, therefore, be ready to make astatement in general terms by Thursday, 18th November. Thestatement should indicate the scope of the inquiry but need not give the exact terms of reference.The Cabinet (1) Gave general approval to the action proposed in CP. (48)267.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Scotland, to bring before theCabinet on 18th November the proposed terms ofreference of the Royal Commission, revised in the lightof the discussion, and a draft of the statement whichit was proposed to make in the House of Commons.Laws. 6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor7 of the Exchequer (CP. (48) 256), in which he referred to a statement in his Budget speech of 6th April, 1948, that he was consideringwith the Home Secretary the question of amending the laws relatingto gambling. He now proposed that a Royal Commission shouldbe appointed, with wide terms of reference, to recommend whatamendment should be made in the laws affecting betting, gamingand lotteries.It was agreed that changes in public opinion since the RoyalCommission of 1932-33, and the recent growth of football poolbetting, made it desirable to have a fresh investigation of the whole subject. There was no need for an immediate announcement aboutthe appointment of a new Royal Commission, and indeed therewas some advantage in delay, provided that the necessary steps for appointing the Commission were taken early in the New Year.The Cabinet-Approved the proposal in CP. (48) 256 for the setting upof a Royal Commission on gambling, and invited the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland to takethe necessary steps in due course.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,15th November, 1948.
