industrial disputes.DockWorkers&apos;Strike.(previous reference:C.M.(48)44thConclusions,Minute 2.)1 The Cabinet were informed that in all sections of theLondon Docks that ,morning there had been signs that larger numbers of men were willing to resume work; and at a meeting ofdockers held in the Victoria Park during the course of the morningan overwhelming majority had voted, on the advice of the StrikeCommittee, in favour of resuming work on the following day. it now seemed likely that there would be a general resumption of workin the London Docks on the following morning. Ministers agreedthat the troops who had been working in the docks should be heldback on the following morning until it became clear whether the dockers were returning to work.At Liverpool and Birkenhead there had been some resumptionof work but the position remained uncertain. It was now unlikelythat the strike would spread to Southampton or Glasgow.Ministers agreed that this change in the situation was due tothe issue of the Proclamation under the Emergency Powers Act,1920, and to the speech which the Prime Minister had broadcast onthe previous evening.There was evidence that in some sections of the London Docksthe managements had not been prepared for this change in the situa-tion and had not been ready to take on men who were willing to resumework. This confirmed the view, held by some Ministers, that the dock Labour Corporation was not working effectively. The ForeignSecretory undertook to make enquiries and to discuss with theMinisters of Labour and Transport what changes were required.Ministers agreed that it would be inexpedient to hold any formalenquiry into the causes of the strike, but it was desirable that thereshould be informal consultations with the representatives of manage-ments and men with a view to remedying any defects in the existing organisation which might have contributed to the recent troubles.This opportunity could be taken of ascertaining why the difficulties had been confined to London and Merseyside, and of seeking meansof preventing discontent from spreading to the other ports.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to discuss with the ministers of Labour and Transport means of improving the organ-isation of the Dock Labour Corporation and of forestalling further industrial disturbances in the docks.The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary (CP. (48)166) covering (i) a minute by the Home Secretary reporting therecommendation of the Emergencies Committee that a number ofEmergency Regulations should be made later in the day and (ii)drafts of those Regulations. The Committee had suggested that theRegulations should be published on the following day and should come into force on 1st July.The Cabinet considered, in the light of the latest developments in the situation, whether those Regulations should be made. It waspointed out that there were precedents for issuing a Proclamationunder the Emergency Powers Act, 1920, without subsequentlymaking Regulations under the Act, and there was general agreement that the making of the Regulations should be postponed until it couldbe seen whether there was a general resumption of work. It wasalso agreed that when Parliament met that afternoon the PrimeMinister should first state that from recent reports received therewas a good prospect of a general resumption of work on 30th june and should then inform the House that Emergency Regulations hadbeen drafted and that, if it was still found necessary to make them,they would be made on the following day. This statement would- bemade after the Prime Minister had communicated to the House theoccasion of the making of the Proclamation, and a similar statement would be made in the House of Lords. The Opposition had askedfor an early debate but, in view of the change in the situation, theywere less likely to press this demand and they should, so far aspossible, be discouraged from doing so.
Yugoslavia. 2.   The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of develop-ments in Yugoslavia leading to the decision, announced in a Praguenewspaper on the previous day, that Yugloslavia should be expelledfrom the Cominform.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,29th June, 1948.The Cabinet-(2) Agreed that the making of the proposed Emergency Regula-tions should be deferred and that statements should bemade in both Houses on the lines agreed in discussion.The Cabinet then considered&quot; the content of the draft emergency regulations annexed to CP. (48) 166. It was pointed out that apartfrom Regulation 1, which dealt with the control of traffic at ports, themain effect of the Regulations would be to enable certain offences tobe dealt with summarily and to give certain ancillary powersdesigned to prevent obstruction of the working of the, docks or ofother essential services. The more positive powers to maintain essential services, such as the powers to requisition premises andequipment, were already available in Defence Regulations by virtueof the Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Act, 1945, as extended by the Supplies and Services (Extended Purposes) Act,1947, and it had not been thought advisable to re-enact these powers.In discussion it was suggested that, if the proposed emergency regulations had to be made, it would be advisable in publishingthem to append to them either a copy of the Defence Regulationscontaining the positive powers on which the Government were rely-ing or a statement indicating where these powers were to be found.In doing this it would be desirable to make it clear that the Govern-ment did not propose to use the powers of directing labour or of controlling engagements derived from the Defence Regulations,since this might be thought inconsistent with the spirit of the proviso to Section 2(1) of the Emergency Powers Act, 1920, which provided that no Regulations made under that Act should imposeany form of industrial conscription.The Cabinet-(3) Gave general approval to the draft Emergency Regulationsannexed to CP. (48) 166.(4) Agreed that the powers with regard to the direction oflabour or control of engagements derived from defence regulations should not be used for purposes directlyconnected with the strike.(5) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the OfficialEmergencies Committee to consider how best to make itclear, should the Emergency Regulations have to bepublished, that the powers conferred by them would be supplemented by powers derived from defence regulations.
