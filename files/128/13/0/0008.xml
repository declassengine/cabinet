1. The Prime Minister expressed the Cabinet&apos;s pleasure at mr. Chifley&apos;s being able to attend one of their meetings on the occa-sion of his visit to this country.Mr. Chifley thanked the Prime Minister and said that he was glad to have this opportunity of meeting members of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in Cabinet.Parliament. 2.

The Foreign Secretary said that the Governments of theUnited Kingdom, United States and France had now presented tothe Soviet Government notes of protest against the Eussian blockade of the western sectors of Berlin. No reply had yet been received to these notes; and publication of the notes would be delayed until9th July in order to avoid public controversy while they were beingconsidered. A note had also been sent to the Polish Governmentstating that His Majesty&apos;s Government were unable to entertaintheir protest against the London Agreement on Germany. Mean-while, very satisfactory progress had been made with the arrange-ments for supplying Berlin by air. It was impossible to foresee howor when the difficulties in Berlin might be resolved; and there were some indications of greater activity on the part of the Soviet Govern-ment in fomenting trouble in the Far and Middle East.4. The Foreign Secretary gave the Cabinet a short appreciation of the situation in Eastern Europe. It was impossible to forecastwhat policy the Soviet Government would eventually pursue towardsYugoslavia. Meanwhile, there was no weakening of the support forMarshal Tito in Yugoslavia. It would be convenient if we could take advantage of this confused state of affairs in the Balkans to clear up the situation in Greece.Palestine.(previous reference:CM. (48) 47thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that he had made no comments on the proposals put forward by the united nations Mediator in Palestine, but had urged the Arab States togive them adequate consideration. The Arabs would probably be opposed to the proposed union covering both Arab and Jewish terri-tory. It was in any event unlikely that either side would feel ableto accept the proposals, and it would fall to the Security Council toimpose a settlement. Meanwhile, he had proposed an extension ofthe truce and had pressed the Arab States to agree to this.economic affairs.(previous reference:CM. (48) 40thConclusions,Minute 2.)Production.6. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (48) 173) covering a report on the economicsituation.The following points were raised in discussion : The marked rise in production from the point to which it hadbeen reduced by the fuel crisis of 1947 had continued throughout thefirst quarter of 1948, and very high rates of progress had been achieved in engineering and ceramics. For the future, however,production was likely to increase at a slower rate.The output of deep-mined coal was most disappointing, andthere had been an increase in absenteeism with no sign of improve-ment in output per man-shift. In some areas the recruitment ofEuropean volunteer workers was impeded by the shortage of hostelsand houses : in others, particularly Yorkshire, where &quot;accommoda-tion was available, the miners were refusing to work with European35682-3 b 2
external trade.Balance ofPayments.Retail Trade.volunteer workers. At the annual conference of the National Unionof Mineworkers the Foreign Secretary had stressed the importanceof an increase in coal output in order to enable the United kingdom to discharge her international obligations; and it was agreed thatthe Minister of Fuel and Power should take advantage of the confer-ence to raise with the Union the difficulties which were arising overthe recruitment of European volunteer workers in Yorkshire. Therewas a serious shortage of large coal and it was likely that exports oflarge coal might have to be reduced and economies made in thehome consumption of large coal, including a cut of 15,000 tons aweek in supplies for the railways. It was also proposed to adjustcoal prices in order to encourage the sale of inferior qualities ofcoal. These proposals would be discussed by the Economic PolicyCommittee on the following day and the Minister of transport would then have an opportunity of drawing attention to their effecton the railways. Satisfactory progress was being made with the installation of new haulage machinery in the mines and this shouldyield a good return in increased output at a later date.The planned increases in the output of textiles during the first five months of the year had not been achieved, but the first returnsfor June showed some improvement. Recruitment had hitherto been disappointing, but further efforts were being made to attractchildren into the textile industries on leaving school and the pros-pects of obtaining additional European volunteer workers had improved. It was alleged that workers were still being drawn away from the cotton industry by offers of more attractive employment in less essential industries and services, and it was agreed that theMinister of Labour should verify that the Control of EngagementsOrder was not being evaded in this way.During April and May exports to the United States, Canada,Argentina and South Africa had declined and had formed only 17 - 5per cent, of the total United Kingdom exports as compared with19-4 per cent, in the first quarter of 1948.The President of the Board of Trade said that he believed thiswas only a temporary setback, but he would make special enquiries into it. Despite the dockers&apos; strike, the volume of exports in Junehad been 140 per cent, of the 1938 figure and he was confident thatthe export target for 1948 would be achieved. There had beendifficulties in selling United Kingdom goods in Canada, partly asa result of the Jewish boycott and partly because Canadian buyerswere trying to put pressure on their Government to remove theban on United States textile imports. Every effort was being madeto overcome these difficulties and to raise United Kingdom exportsto Canada to at least their pre-war level.There had been an unwelcome increase in the net drain onreserves in June and the total drain for the first six months of1948 had been  254 million, which compared with the economic survey estimate of  222 million. The United Kingdom deficit,with the dollar area had been about  25 million higher than hadbeen expected, largely as a result of price increases, and there hadbeen additional payments of  10 million to Belgium and  7 million to South Africa: on the other hand, there had been a saving ofabout  10 million on payments on account of the rest of the sterling area. The reimbursement to which we were entitled under theEuropean Recovery Programme in respect of the second quarter of1948 was only slightly less than the net drain of  107 million inthat quarter, but the scale of aid was likely to be lower in subsequentquarters and continued efforts were therefore being made to reducethe drain and to prevent the leakage of gold and dollars throughtrading operations in the Far East. Import prices were still risingand the best available forecasts give no indication of a break foreighteen months to two years. The European Recovery programme would increase the inflationary pressure in the United States.The report included a new section (paragraphs 35-38) on retailtrade, which attempted to assess the progress made in checkinginflation.   There were signs that for some consumer goods the
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,8th July, 1948.inflationary seller&apos;s market might now have been ended. There hadcertainly been a slackening of demand for certain high-pricedluxuries and for inferior goods; and there had been a fall in theprices of certain classes of housing accommodation. These develop-ments gave no grounds for anxiety; they should in fact be welcomedas evidence that the Governments measures for reducing the inflationary pressure were having their effect.Wages. The upward curve of internal prices had now flattened out,and the average level of wage rates had remained steady for the past three months. If it were possible to hold engineering and agricul-tural wages, on which claims for increases were shortly to bedetermined, there was a good prospect that the Government would achieve their aim of preventing a further inflationary movement ofwages and prices. It was possible that agreement might be reached on the appointment of a Court of Inquiry into the engineeringclaim. As regards agriculture, it was suggested that the time wasripe for a further attempt to bring the arrangements for deter-mining agricultural wages into line with the normal machinery of wage negotiation; and it was agreed that the Chancellor of theExchequer should consider this possibility in consultation with theMinister of Labour and the Agriculture Ministers.Oil Stocks. Attention was again drawn to the dangerously low level towhich our stocks of oil had fallen; and it was pointed out that these stocks might be still further depleted by the heavy consumption of aviation spirit in supplying Berlin by air. The Cabinet were informed that the United States Government had already beenasked to give us special assistance to meet this increased drain onour supplies of aviation spirit. The current international situation would, however, provide us with a convenient opportunity to take up with the United States authorities the whole question of oil supplies. On defence grounds it was highly desirable that our stocks should be substantially increased; and we were more likelyto make progress in negotiations on this question with the UnitedStates authorities if we broached it on defence grounds and not onthe basis of economic or commercial considerations.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of CP. (48) 173 and of the points raised in thediscussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Minister of Labour and the agriculture ministers, to consider whether the arrangements for determing agricultural wages could not now be broughtinto line with the normal machinery for wagenegotiation.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary, after consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Fuel and power and the Minister of Defence, to seek the assistanceof the United States Government in building up the oilstock available for use by the United Kingdom.
