1. The Lord President informed the Cabinet that he had thought it advisable, in view of the speculations contained in theObserver on the previous day, to issue a statement to the Press tothe effect that there was no foundation for the reports that thepresence in Eire and Northern Ireland of the Prime Minister andother Ministers would be the occasion for discussions with the Eireand Northern Ireland authorities with a view to a general recastingof relations between Northern Ireland and Eire and the UnitedKingdom and Eire. The Prime Minister of Northern Ireland had subsequently issued a statement to the same effect. These rumourshad been repeated in the Daily Herald that morning, but the editor had given an assurance that this was due to an oversight.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Lord President.2. The Lord President said that public opinion was seriously disturbed at the extent of the traffic in cigarettes by unauthorisedpersons, and he thought that the Government ought to take any stepspossible to suppress such activities. It was an offence underSection 13 of the Tobacco Act, 1842, to sell tobacco without a licenceand anyone convicted under this Section was liable, on conviction, toa fine of  100. He understood that the police had from time to timereported offenders to the Board of Customs and Excise, but that the penalties awarded by the Courts were normally too small to consti-tute an effective deterrent.The Cabinet were informed that stolen cigarettes were the mainsource of these illegal activities. There was little evidence ofconnivance by retailers; under present conditions, however,cigarettes which had been purchased in the normal way couldprofitably be sold on the black market. The situation might be improved if the police could take more vigorous action against thepersons engaged in this traffic. It might also be considered whetherwholesale tobacco firms could exercise closer control over retail saleswith a view to diminishing the extent of illegal sales.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for more vigorousaction to be taken by the police against persons concernedwith the illegal sale of cigarettes.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to considerwhether the wholesale tobacco firms could exercise closercontrol over retail sales of cigarettes.3. The Cabinet were informed that the printing trade unions had decided to instruct their members employed in the London area by the Stationery Office or by contractors printing for the stationery office to refuse to work overtime from 23rd August. The unions had taken this decision as a result of the further difficulties whichhad arisen over the printing of the Polish Daily. A similarthreat had been made earlier in the year; but, following discussionof the question by the Cabinet on 5th April, a satisfactory agreement had then been reached between the unions and thepublisher. The latter had, however, given notice on 22nd June to terminate the agreement and negotiations for a fresh agreement hadnot&apos; been successful. The unions had taken the view that theGovernment had a special responsibility for the agreement concluded in April and had asked that Government action should be takento compel the publisher to adhere to trade-union conditions. TheMinister of Labour had pointed out to the union representatives thatthe Government were in no way concerned with this agreement andhad suggested that the right course was to arrange for the dispute to be referred to the National Arbitration Tribunal.   If the trade
unions adhered to their decisions to stop the working of overtimeon Government printing, the consequences would be very serious.The industry was undermanned and extensive overtime was regularlyworked. By stopping overtime the unions would prejudice thework of Departments generally; they would make it impossible to print the new Electoral Registers by 15th October; and, if the embargo were maintained into the new Session, they would gravelyhamper and delay the work of Parliament.The Cabinet were further informed that the unions hadterminated a long-standing agreement under which the compositorsemployed in the Stationery Office press at Westminster were temporarily employed elsewhere during the Parliamentary recess.As this press could be used only for the printing of Parliamentarypapers, the compositors concerned would either have to be dispensed with or retained on full pay during the long periods when noprinting was required for Parliament.Ministers were greatly concerned to learn of the decision of the printing trade unions, which amounted to a threat to use industrialpressure to compel the Government to take administrative action ina trivial and irrelevant dispute, and there was general agreement that the consequences of their decision ought to be emphaticallyexplained to the representatives of the unions concerned. It shouldbe made clear that the Government would not be coerced in this manner. They had no responsibility for the publication of thePolish Daily; if a settlement of that dispute could not be reached,it should be referred to the Central Arbitration Tribunal. Butthat dispute had no relevance to the arrangements for working over-time on Government printing, and it should be emphasised that theGovernment were not prepared to admit any relation between thetwo. As a first step the Stationery Office should send, that evening,a strong protest to the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation onthese lines. A copy of this letter should be sent to the Ministry ofLabour, and officials of that Department should see representativesof the unions as soon as possible on the following day in order toemphasise the views of Ministers. If necessary, the unions might beinformed that the question had been submitted to the Cabinet. TheMinistry of Labour should consider urgently whether, on receipt ofthe Stationery Office letter, the matter could be treated as a disputeunder the Industrial Courts Act, 1919; in that event, the unionscould be informed that, if they persisted in their decision to place an embargo on the working of overtime, the Minister would set upa Court of Enquiry under the provisions of that Act.The Cabinet-Agreed that action should be taken on the lines suggestedin discussion.Siamese Bice. 4.   The Foreign Secretary said that the export of rice from burma was likely to be much affected by the increasingly disturbedstate of the country. In these circumstances, there would be a strong demand for Siamese rice, and Siam was likely in consequence to accumulate abnormally heavy sterling balances. Unless some assurance could be given that a reasonable proportion of this sterlingcould be used for the purchase of capital and other goods, there wasa risk that Siam might in future demand payment in dollars for herrice exports. He suggested, therefore, that the possibility of meetingSiam&apos;s requirements for sterling goods should be examined urgently.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the President of the Board of Trade, to consider howfar it was possible to meet Siam&apos;s requirements for sterlinggoods.
5. The Foreign Secretary said that he hoped the new dutch government would be able to secure the early enactment of theIndonesia Bill to implement the terms of the Linggadjati Agree-ment. It was important that a settlement should now be reached ofthe long-standing Indonesian dispute, and he had made every effort,through the diplomatic channel, to persuade both parties to adopt a moderate attitude in the final negotiations. He had also pressed the United States Secretary of State to use his influence with theDutch Government for the same purpose; and he had similarlysuggested to the High Commissioner for Pakistan in London thatthe Pakistan Government should impress on the Indonesian Govern-ment the importance of making a special effort to conclude asettlement at this stage.. In discussion, the view was expressed that a similar approachought also to be made to the Government of India, and the foreign secretary undertook to take the necessary action.6. At their meeting on 13th August (D.O. (48) 16th Meeting,Minute 3) the Defence Committee had agreed that immediate, arrangements should be made for the despatch of an additionalbrigade to Malaya. The Cabinet were informed that a report ofthis decision had appeared in the Press that morning, and that theWar Office considered that a formal Press announcement on thesubject ought to be issued as soon as possible. Ministers were generally in agreement with this proposal: in their view, the right.course was to state definitely that it had been decided to send anadditional brigade with ancillary troops to Singapore as soon aspossible.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Defence  to arrange  for anannouncement on these lines to be issued to the Press.7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (48) 203) on the future level of German industry.The memorandum recalled that the Potsdam Agreement had provided in general terms for the industrial disarmament ofGermany by the prohibition of certain industries and the limitationof others. Quadripartite agreement had been reached in March 1946on a Plan for Reparations and for the Level of the Post-WarGerman Economy, but this had fallen into abeyance as a result ofthe failure of the Soviet Government to implement the assumptionson which it was based. In August 1947 a new level of industry for the Anglo-American Zone of Germany had been agreed with theUnited States authorities, and this had provided a basis for theBritish reparations programme of October 1947. No reference wasmade in this plan to the industries prohibited under the quadri-partite plan of March 1946; and neither plan had specified the duration of the restrictions to be imposed on German industry, since it was thought that this could best be settled in connection with theGerman peace treaty. The question of the prohibited industries hadbeen discussed at the recent London Conference on Germany, whenit was agreed that a tripartite working party should be.established in Berlin to recommend which industries should be prohibited and what should be the duration of the restrictions to be imposed. Itwas essential that agreement should be reached as soon as possible on the outstanding questions relating to the level of German indus-try, and the working party had been instructed to report by 1stSeptember. It would not, however, be easy to reach an agreedcompromise between the divergent views of the Western Allies onthese issues; in particular, the United States authorities were anxious to go substantially further in relaxing the restrictions on german industry than was acceptable to the French Government. Itwas clear that, in the absence of Four-Power agreement on Germany,
sthe French proposals were excessively rigorous : the importance ofGermany to European recovery and the necessity for holding out tothe German people the hope of a sound economic future dictateda more liberal view. The Chiefs of Staff had advised that continu-ing restrictions on industrial production needed for war but alsoessential to the German economy and European recovery need notbe regarded as essential on security grounds. In these circumstances the Foreign Secretary proposed that the restrictions imposed on certain industries should be modified to the extent suggested in annex A to CP. (48) 203.In discussion, the criticism was made that even the revised pro-posals put forward in CP. (48) 203 were excessively restrictive. Itwas not essential, on grounds of security, to impose restrictions overa wide range of industries; adequate safeguards could be secured by prohibiting or restricting a small number of industries essentialto the country&apos;s war potential. It was most unlikely that even theless rigorous restrictions now proposed could be effectively main-tained for any length of time; on the other hand, the immediate effect of these restrictions would be to prejudice Germany&apos;s eontri-bution to European recovery and to throw an added burden on the occupying Powers and on the participating countries in theOrganisation for European Economic Co-operation. It waspointed out, in reply, that this was not a question on which theBritish Government could reach a unilateral decision. agreement had to be sought with the United States and French Governments,and the detailed proposals set out in the Annex to CP. (48) 203represented a compromise which seemed most likely to be generally acceptable. Any decisions reached at this stage woiild be subjectto revision in the light of later developments. In the meantime,and indeed for some years to come, the decisive factors in theeconomic position of Germany were, not the restrictions imposed bythe Occupying Powers, but the figures of steel and coal output.In further discussion, the following points were made :  (a) It was proposed that the manufacture of ball and rollerbearings should be prohibited. This proposal would involve an ultimate German import requirement of  9^ million a year, andwas for that reason likely to be strongly criticised by the UnitedStates authorities. Moreover, it was hard to justify the artificialrestriction of German capacity at a time when there was a worldshortage of ball bearings.(b) One argument for imposing severe restrictions on german industry was the risk that she might at some time fall wholly underthe control of the Soviet Union. On the other hand, German resistance-tance to Communist pressure would largely depend on the prospectsoffered by the Occupying Powers of a reasonable standard of life in Western Germany.(c) The Soviet Government had proposed that the approvedlevel of output of the German steel industry should be increased to14 or 15 million tons a year. In making this proposal, they hadin mind the possibility of obtaining substantial reparations from current output. If the level of industry proposed in CP. (48) 203were approved, there would be no scope for payment of reparationsout of current production to the Soviet Union.(d) The Ministry of Supply were anxious that certain machine tools, which had been the subject of discussion with the ForeignOffice, should be included in the list in paragraph 2 of Appendix Ato CP. (48) 203. They also considered that the production ofphosphorus should be prohibited and that the production of calcium carbide should be strictly controlled. The former was an importantconstituent in certain forms of gas and the latter in the productionof synthetic rubber. The Foreign Secretary undertook to examine these proposals.(e) The Ministry of Supply considered that the production of synthetic ammonia should be restricted to the quantity necessaryfor peace-time \ise. The general view, of Ministers was, however,that it would not be practicable to impose such a restriction.
(/) The Ministry of Supply considered that the production ofoptics and precision instruments, except for medical uses, shouldbe restricted to the level of 1936. This industry was vital to theGerman war potential and, if it was re-established, would become a damaging competitor in the overseas markets to which the pro-economising British industry was at present sending exports at therate of  1 million. The loss of these markets would in turn damage the British war potential. Against this, it was pointed out thatprecision instruments were an essential factor in most industrial production, and the limits proposed would seriously prejudiceWestern Germany&apos;s efforts to achieve viability. Moreover, these restrictions could be made effective only by an elaborate system of inspection. Nor was it likely that the United States authorities would be prepared to support such a proposal, since they wouldargue that the British industry should have had adequate time toestablish itself on an economic basis. It was, however, made clear in Annex A to CP. (48) 203 that it was not proposed to free this industry from restrictions until surplus capacity above the level cf1936 had been removed.(g) The Minister of Defence said that he was prepared to acceptthe proposals contained in Annex A to CP. (48) 203 subject to thepoints noted in paragraph (d) above.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider, in consultationwith the Minister of Supply, the points noted in para-graph (d) above.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1), approved the proposals regardingthe future level of German industry set out in Annex Ato CP. (48) 203.Cabinet Office, S.W..1,16th August, 1948.
