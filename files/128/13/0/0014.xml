82A3V00&quot;IB  2-3H164;flflofcaSoviet Polio;in Europe.-.Germany.(previous reference:CM. (48)53rdConclusions,MinuteTAe Foreign Secretary made a statement to the Cabinereviewing the international situation.Over the past three years the Soviet Government had pursuea determined policy designed to bring the countries of Central and astern Europe under Communist control. The efforts made byHis Majesty&apos;s Government to establish a stable democratic govern-ment in Greece had been hampered by Communist interference, andthe Soviet Government had created a deadlock in the negotiationsfor an Austrian Peace Treaty by their demands for the surrender to them of so-called German assets in Austria, by their efforts toprevent Austria from establishing an adequate police force or Armyand by their support for Yugoslav claims on Carinthia. The latestSoviet proposal in these negotiations had been that agreement should first be reached on the question of German assets, the question ofthe frontiers of Austria being left for settlement later. Thisproposal was, however, unacceptable; and there was, in any event,reason to believe that many Austrians would regret the withdrawalof British troops which would follow the conclusion of a Treaty.We had agreed to the formation of an international zone at Trieste,but the negotiations for the appointment of a Governor had been rendered abortive by Soviet obstruction and we had eventually pro-posed that Trieste should return to Italy. The Soviet Governmentseemed to regard this proposal with favour, but had been prevented from accepting it by the objections of Yugoslavia. In Roumania,Bulgaria, Hungary,&apos;Czechoslovakia and Poland the Soviet Govern-ment had failed to carry out their international obligations and hadencouraged these States to disregard British rights.The Soviet aim had always been to establish Communismthroughout Germany. To counter this we had made proposals fora federal German Government under which there would be a numberof Land Governments with considerable powers, and this schemewas now being discussed with German representatives. It seemed clear that the full scheme approved by the Three-Power conference would not be acceptable, but there was good hope that a provisionalGovernment, developed from the present Economic Council, wouldbe established. We nad resisted demands from the Soviet Govern-ment that they should share in the management of the ruhr industries and had made arrangements under which, in association with&quot;France and the Benelux countries, we exercised a general super-- vision over the allocation of the products of these industries. Wehad also continued to oppose the Soviet demand for reparationsfrom current production: this was not justified by any promisesmade during the war and to concede it would be economicallydisastrous. &quot;&apos;As regards Berlin, it had been felt that to yield to Sovietpressure there would lead to further withdrawals by the western allies and in the end to war. On the other hand, if we maintaineda firm attitude, we might reckon on ten years of peace during whichthe defences of Western Europe might be consolidated. There wasnO difference between His Majesty s Government and the UnitedStates Government in their determination to remain in Berlin; andthe United States Government were in general agreement with the. terms of the proposed United Kingdom reply to the Soviet note of14th July, which was designed to enable the Western Powers torecapture the initiative in establishing conditions of peace in Europe.Discussions with the United States representatives were, however,still in progress on the procedure to be adopted for delivering the reply. There was no reason t0 suppose that the new French Govern-. ment which was now being; formed would not also approve theproposed reply,, and it was hoped that it could be delivered withinthe next day or two.
I:&apos; &apos;      ^S9SfiSS^M^S/^S8 CM. 64 (48)     591 Brussels : The Foreign Secretary undertook to circulate to the Cabinet a&apos;! Treaty, i       report on the proceedings at the recent meeting of the Consultative;j Meeting of     Council at The Hague. The meeting had been primarily an occasion    &apos;i Consultative   for reporting progress and no important decisions had been taken,j: Council. : v   There was still a general failure to appreciate the magnitude ofi (Previous  -   Europe&apos;s balance of payments problem, and much further work wouldBeferehca:     have to be done on this by the Finance Ministers of the countriesC.M;(48)29th concerned and by the Organisation for European Economic Co-Conclusions,    operation.   There had been evidence of a keen desire to developj Minute .2.)   , cultural exchanges among the Western European Powers and it hadbeen suggested that action should be taken to promote, the circulationj !: ;t--in Europe of a British newspaper which would give an accuratef : .&apos;:: account of conditions in the United Kingdom.   The Military! Committee were continuing their study of the war potential of the:     Western Union Powers and it was hoped that the idea would gain/ ;&quot;strength of building up a powerful Western Union which would notbe completely dependent on the United States and would present astrong front to Soviet expansion.   M. Bidault had, on theinstructions of his Government, proposed the establishment of a federal Parliament for Europe on the lines advocated at the unofficial Hague Conference on European Federation; but there hadbeen little enthusiasm for this suggestion, which had been referred *. to the member Governments for their consideration. His own view,with which M. Spaak had agreed, was that Western Union mustbe consolidated by action on the part of the member governments and that any attempt to set up a Federal Parliament would merely &apos;; open the way to Communist propaganda.In discussion the following points were made (a) The effectiveness of the arrangements made for conveyingsupplies to Berlin by air had surprised the Soviet Government, andthe Foreign Secretary was disposed to think that these arrangements could be successfully continued throughout the winter. On the otherhand, the Chiefs of Staff were doubtful whether it would be possibleto sustain for such a long period an operation which called onpractically the whole of the transport resources of the RoyalAir Force.(bj The Foreign Secretary had foreseen the difficulties whichwould arise from the reform of the currency in the western sectors of Berlin but had considered it necessary, as a matter of principle,to insist on the use of western currency in these sectors. He proposedto discuss the latest developments with the Military Governor, whowas coming to London on the following day.(c) The Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement suggested that, even -though a settlement of the Berlin situation could be reached, allthat the Western European countries could look forward to wasa period of some ten years of preparation for eventual conflict withRussia, during which their economies would be crippled by defence preparations and thus more prone to Communist influence. Couldnot this bleak prospect be avoided by taking a very firm line in thepresent crisis, in the knowledge that the Soviet Government were atpresent in no position to carry on a war in Western Europe ?(d) The Defence Committee would consider on the following day the state of the country&apos;s defence preparations and whether anyprecautionary steps ought to be taken. If we were to undertake a substantial programme of rearmament without special UnitedStates aid, we should merely hamper the economic recovery on which our capacity for waging war must in the last resort depend. More-over, it was undesirable that any overt measures should be taken inadvance of corresponding action by the United States Governmentand before it was known what results were achieved by the-communication which was about to be addressed to the Soviet-Government.(e) One of the proposals which would be considered by the ,Defence Committee on the following day was that the release ofmen from the Armed Forces should be temporarily stopped.  TheForeign Secretary was disposed to think that this might be done to
.M.0 w&quot;. 166c&quot;;i ti^-M)&apos; a limited extent. It was also suggested that a limited suspension ofi^i^no!;-releases might be announced as designed merely to relieve the/&quot;additional strain imposed on the Armed Forces by the measures: . I   token to supply Berlin by air.f,.: :(ft-. A Parliamentary debate in the present veek was embarrassing--f.       .&apos;; iassingand it woud be specially awkward if the debate took8&apos; lace before a reply had been given to the latest Soviet note. Theipposition might be willing to agree that the debate should at leastr:h,yA ;-&apos;be postponed until 29th July. The debate should be opened by theOpposition; the Foreign Secretary should speak second, and theii;:      :^Pnme Minister should wind up.(g) The Prime Minister had undertaken to discuss with thei  Leader of the Opposition whether a statement en defence could usefully be made in this debate.  Both he and the Minister of. Defence were satisfied that no such statement should be made and... it would bo necessary to communicate this decision to the Opposition.(A) There had been very little discussion of the problem of-coordination of colonial policies by the Brussels Treaty Powers,and the Foreign Secretary would consider with the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies what further action could be taken in this matter.; The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statement made by the Foreign Secretary.(2) Invited the Lord President to explore the possibility of postponing until 29th July the proposed debate on the.  international situation.(3) Agreed that the Opposition Leaders should be informed thatthe Government could not make a full statement on defence matters in the debate.Cabinet Office, S.W. I,2Uk July, 1918.
