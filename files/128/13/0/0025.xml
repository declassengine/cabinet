1. The Minister of Pensions said that, although he had beenable to resist successfully the campaign for an increase in the basic rates of war pension, he was now faced with pressure for theappointment of a Select Committee to consider war pensions and allowances and notice of a Motion for the appointment of such aCommittee had been given. Efforts had been made to discourageGovernment supporters from adding their names to the Motion, butit was clear that, unless the Government gave a strong lead, these efforts would not succeed, and he must therefore seek guidance fromthe Cabinet on the matter. His own view was that, so far as thewar pensions scheme itself was concerned, the recommendations ofany Select Committee that might be appointed were not likely tobe embarrassing, but he recognised that the repercussions on thenational insurance schemes would probably be serious. If the demandfor a Select Committee was to be resisted, these wider considerations would have to be the justification.In discussion there was general agreement that it was inprinciple undesirable to appoint a Select Committee on a matterinvolving Government expenditure so directly and that the appoint-ment of a Select Committee on war pensions at the present time would be most inopportune. The Government should, therefore,make it clear that they would oppose the Motion and should stronglyadvise their supporters not to add their names to it. Meanwhile,every effort should be made to disseminate full information aboutthe improvements in the war pensions scheme which had been madeby the Government, some of which still seemed to be insufficientlyknown to the local branches of ex-Servicemen&apos;s associations.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Motion to appoint a Select Committee toconsider war pensions and allowances should be opposed;and invited the Minister of Pensions to consider what further steps could be taken to give adequate publicity tothe improvements already made in the war pensions scheme.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (48) 238) suggesting how effect might best be givento their decision that there should be some restoration of private members&apos; time in the 1948-49 Session.The Lord President recalled that the Cabinet had favouredmaking time available for Bills rather than Motions. He accordingly proposed that between Christmas and Easter seven Fridays shouldbe given for.Second Readings of Private Members&apos; Bills and thatafter Whitsuntide three Fridays should be given for the remaining stages of any of these Bills that might get through Standing Com-mittee, it being understood that the three Fridays after Whitsuntidewould not be made available unless they were in fact required. Hehad rejected the original proposal to make available six Fridaysbefore Christmas, since there was likely to be criticism of such alimited offer and since it would not give Private Members adequatenotice to enable them to take advantage of the facilities. He assumed that the Cabinet would not wish to revive the practice of allowingPrivate Members to seek leave to bring in Bills under standing order No. 10. His colleagues would realise that the decision togive time for Private Members&apos; Bills might mean some reductionin the Governments Legislative Programme, particularly if, as seemed most desirable, the Whitsuntide Recess was extended.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposal that in the 1948-49 Session sevenFridays should be made available between Christmas andEaster for Second Readings of Private Members&apos; Bills&quot;   and that three Fridays should be made available, if. necessary, for the remaining stages of. any such Bills as might have passed through Standing Committee.-2 b 2
(2) Agreed that the practice of allowing Private Members tomove for leave to bring in Bills under Standing order no. 10 should not be revived in the 1948-49 Session.(3) Took note that the restoration of Private Members&apos; timemight involve some reduction in the Governments Legis-lative Programme for the 1948-49 Session.Meeting of 3.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the terms ofCommon- the Press Communique which had been agreed at the final Sessionwealth Prime of the Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers earlier that day.Ministers. ihe discussions had been maintained at a high level throughoutthe Meeting, and he was confident that valuable results had been achieved. A notable contribution had been made by the representa-tives of the three Asiatic countries of the Commonwealth; and ithad been particularly encouraging to observe in their remarks the underlying assumption that their countries would continue to be members of the Commonwealth. Considerable progress had beenmade towards securing agreement on the development of consultation between Commonwealth countries on foreign and economic affairs,defence and other matters of common concern; and it was particu-larly satisfactory that, in the field of defence, the attitude of theCanadian and South African representatives had been more forth-coming and helpful than had been expected.The Lord President said that the Cabinet should know that,at their final meeting, the Commonwealth representatives had expressed warm appreciation of the manner in which the PrimeMinister had presided over the discussions and of the hospitalitywhich they had received and the efficiency of the arrangements madefor the Meeting.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the statements made by thePrime Minister and the Lord President.economic affairs.(previous reference:CM. (48) 53rdConclusions,Minute 9.)4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (48) 232) covering a report on the economicsituation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in recent monthsthere had been a substantial improvement in the balance of payments,which had for some time been the main cause of anxiety. unfortunate-nately, this had not been matched by an equivalent expansion ofproduction and the static condition of the home economy wasdisturbing. The general level of output in 1948 had been verydisappointing, and, since long-term plans were based on the assump-tion of a continued expansion of output, every effort must be madeto promote the efficiency of industry. He hoped that the work ofthe Anglo-American Productivity Council, which was due to holdits first meeting in the following week, would lead both sides ofindustry to concentrate on this problem.Substantial progress had recently been made in disposing of outstanding problems connected with the European BecoveryProgramme. The Cabinet would note from CP. (48) 243 that agree-ment had been reached with the Export-Import Bank at Washington,as agents of the Economic Co-operation Administration, on the termsof a Loan Agreement covering the first nine months of theProgramme. The Convention establishing the Intra-European Pay-ments Scheme and Trade Rules had now been approved by theCouncil of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation;and the United Kingdom programmes for 1948-49, 1949-50 and1948-52 had been submitted to the Organisation. He thought thatthe Cabinet might at this stage appropriately record their appre-ciation of the work of the United Kingdom Delegation to the
45CM. 65 (48)Organisation. A large part of the success so far achieved by theOrganisation was due to the exertions of the Delegation, and theburden of work thrown upon it had been very great indeed. TheOrganisation would shortly have to undertake the even more difficult task of ensuring that actual effect was given to the programmes ofeconomic co-operation. He had recently attended a meeting of theFinance Ministers of the signatory Powers of the Brussels Treaty,but no decisions of major importance had been taken at this meeting.The following points were made in discussion : It was disquieting to note that there had been further increases in the numbers employed in distribution, consumers&apos; services andthe public service and that the numbers in these sectors exceeded theEconomic Survey estimates of the distribution of man-power at theend of 1948, whereas the numbers employed in basic and manufac-turing industries were still below the end-1948 estimates. TheMinistry of Labour had, however, filled all the first preferencevacancies notified to them and in many areas the only result of preventing workers from entering less essential industries or services would have been to create unemployment. There was some reasonto believe that the estimates of the man-power required in certain industries were inflated and that to concentrate unduly on obtainingadditional workers for these industries might militate against the campaign for higher productivity. The Minister of Labour was considering the question of the continuance of the Control of engagement Order and he had it in mind to circulate a memorandumon the general question of the distribution of man-power.It was suggested that, in order to counter the fear of unemploy-rnent, which was still strong, the Ministry of Labour should, whenpublishing the unemployment figures, emphasise the number ofunfilled vacancies and the fact that many of those recorded asunemployed were out of work only for very short periods. It wasalso pointed out that there were indications that, as a result of the raising of the schooi-leaving age, far more children leaving schoolwere choosing to go straight into industry.Coal output was most disappointing, and absenteeism was higher than it had been for fifteen months. Unless more deep-minedcoal was produced the amount of high-quality coal available forexport would be insufficient. Textile, output had also fallen short of expectations, and production and export targets were not likelyto be reached, except in so far as exports of cotton goods could bemaintained at the expense of the home market.The level of exports had further increased, but during thepast year there had been no increase in the share going to hard currency countries. There was great scope for improvement inour selling methods in countries like the United States and Canada;and this matter was being examined urgently in consultation with industry.There were grounds for thinking that the culminating pointin the post-war rise in world commodity prices might have beenreached. The most significant development had been the fail ingrain prices, but there had also been reductions in the prices ofoilseeds, cotton and wool, and in shipping freights. In the UnitedKingdom both import and wholesale prices had been stable; and,since export prices had continued to rise, there had been a welcomeimprovement in the terms of trade.Though the recent advance of 5s. a week in the wages of engineer-ing workers would raise the index of wage rates by one point, therewas good hope that the stability of wage rates would be maintained.It was important from this point of view to keep down the cost of. living, and&apos;the situation should be eased by the fall in import prices.On the other hand, it had been necessary to keep down the cost ofliving by increasing food subsidies and there was a strong case for making some reduction in these as soon as possible.
Cabinet Office, S.W.I.22nd October, 1948.Bilateral It would soon become urgent to initiate negotiation^ on Anglo-Negotiations. Argentine Trade in 1949; but Seflor Miranda had again postponedhis intended visit to the United Kingdom, and it was not likely that this would now take place before the end of November.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of CP. (48) 232, and of the points made in discussion.(2) Agreed that&quot; a message should be sent to the United kingdom delegation to the Organisation for European Economic!Co-operation expressing the Cabinets appreciation of 1the work done by the Delegation.
