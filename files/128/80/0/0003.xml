SECRETCopy No I  of 4 CopiesMOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORD TOCC(84) 5th Conclusions Thursday 9 February 1984The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C(84) 5) on economic strategy.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the 1984 Budget would set the tone for the remainder of the present Parliament.    The background was one of falling inflation and rising output.    In both respects, performance in 1983 had been better than forecast.    The prospects for the year ahead were encouraging.    Output was expected to rise by 3 per cent, and inflation, a|ter rising to about 54 per cent in the early summer, to fall to about 4 ^per cent by the end of 1984.    Although the recovery had initially been based on higher consumption, it was now broadening to include exports and investement, both of which were expected to increase twice as fast as consumers&apos;  spending in 1984.    There were, however, risks from external factors.    First, the size of the United States budget deficit continued to exert upward pressure on interest rates.    Secondly, a sharp fall in oil prices would be unhelpful to our balance of payments and tax revenues in the coming year.    Domestically, the main risk lay in excessive wage settlements.The Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR)  in 1983-84 was still expected to show an overshoot of some  1.8 billion compared to the 1983 Budget forecast of  8.2 billion.    It would be important for market confidence and the credibility of the Government&apos;s economic policy that the overshoot should not be carried forward.    As a minimum, the Government must be seen to be returning to the path set in the 1983 Medium Term Financial Strategy (MTFS), which envisaged a PSBR of  8 billion for 1984-85. There were indeed arguments for aiming at a lower figure.    1984-85 was the peak year for North Sea oil revenue, and could therefore be expected to feature a low PSBR.    Asset sales, which had smaller effects on interest rates than a reduction in public expenditure, would play an unusually large part in reducing the PSBR.    It would certainly be wrong to provide for a PSBR higher than  8 billion, and probably right to aim for a slightly lower figure.    Fortunately, the fiscal prospects for 1984-85 had improved since his Autumn Statement; and the risk of tax increases being required in March was slight.    He therefore expected the 1984 Budget to be broadly neutral; he would welcome the views of his colleagues on the appropriate balance between different taxes in that context.    Looking further ahead, there was a prospect of worthwhile tax reductions in 1985-86 if the Government adhered to its published expenditure plans.The continuing success of the Government&apos;s economic policies had confounded its critics and should have a good effect on expectations. Expectations would also be conditioned by the MTFS.    The present MTFS expired in 1985-86.    Figures should now be published, extending to 1988-89 and so covering the remainder of the present Parliament.    The Government&apos;s ultimate objective should be price stability.    This required monetary growth to be brought down, preferably without recourse to higher interest1SECRET
SECRETrates.    It was therefore necessary to aim for lower Government borrowing. The Government had already decided on expenditure plans for 1986-87. The same real level of public expenditure should be used as the basis of the MTFS for 1987-88 and 1988-89.    It would be made clear that this was only an assumption and did not pre-empt policy decisions, which would be taken in the usual way in future Public Expenditure Surveys.In discussion the following main points were made -a. There was general agreement that there was no case for a relaxation in fiscal and monetary strategy.    Some members of the Cabinet argued that the Government&apos;s fiscal stance had in practice been more relaxed in &gt;the last two years than its rhetoric suggested, and so had contributed to the speed of economic recovery; and that it was unnecessary to treat the level of the PSBR, so long as it remained below the psychologically significant level of  10 billion, as crucial.    Others, however, disputed this interpretation of events, pointing out that it could now be seen to have begun to increase as early as 1981.    This underlined the need to continue to pursue the prudent policies which had secured the Government considerable credit at home and abroad.    The Government&apos;s policies were succeeding, but were inevitably at risk from external events.    Both factors counselled stability and caution in fiscal and monetary policy, on the lines suggested in C(84) 5.b. Some members of the Cabinet considered that such resources as could be made available for reductions in taxation in 1984 should be devoted primarily to reducing burdens on industry, such as the National Insurance Surcharge.    Although company profitability had improved dramatically, it was still extremely low and needed greatly to be increased.    The United Kingdom depended on industrial and commercial enterprises for its economic future.   Many of them were still in a parlous financial condition.   Most members of the Cabinet, however, took the view that priority should be given to increases in the income tax thresholds, which were still too close to social security benefit levels.    Poor wage-earners paid too much income tax. They should be helped, for both social and economic reasons. Moreover, increases in the income tax thresholds might have a useful effect in moderating pay settlements.c. While it was in general undesirable to introduce more complexities into the tax system and indeed preferable to reduce them, there was a case for continuing to give encouragement to the development of small businesses and to the participation of employees in the future success of their companies, for example through share option schemes.d. There was general agreement that the MTFS should be rolled forward as proposed in C(84) 5.    It also seemed inevitable that this should be done on the basis of an assumption that public expenditure in real terms would be held at the same level in 1987-88 and 1988-89 as in 1986-87: it might be possible to give a range of assumptions, but this would reduce the effect on expectations, which it was one of the main aims&apos;of the MTFS to secure.    Nevertheless, it would be important to make it clear in public that the assumption regarding public expenditure was only an assumption and did not pre-empt policy decisions.2SECRET
SECRETe.     Careful consideration should be given in the MTFS to forecasts of the &quot;fiscal adjustment&quot;.    Experience suggested that such forecasts tended to exaggerate the room for tax reductions and so built up expectations that could not in the event be fulfilled.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet overwhelmingly supported the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s judgment, as set out in C(84) 5: in particular, they endorsed his judgment of the appropriate PSBR in 1984-85.   He would no doubt take account of the views that had been put forward in discussion in reaching final decisions on the overall balance of his Budget and in considering particular tax changes. The Cabinet agreed that the MTFS should be extended to 1988-89.    It should be based on the assumption that the real level of public expenditure would be the same in 1987-88 and 1988-89 as in 1986-87; but, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer had made clear, this was not intended to pre-empt the decisions that Ministers would take in due course on public expenditure plans in the annual Public Expenditure Surveys.    Enquirers from the media about the Cabinet&apos;s discussion would be told that the Cabinet had considered the economic situation and the approach to the Budget, noting the firm prospect of continuing steady growth and low inflation and the importance of keeping effective control of Government borrowing.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take account of their discussion in preparing his forthcoming Budget.3SECRET
