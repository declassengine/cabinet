CONFIDENTIALCopy No A,   of 2 CopiesMOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORD TOCC(84)  1st Conclusions Thursday 12 January 1984HANDLING OF        At the conclusion of Cabinet on 12 January 1984 the Prime Minister DOCUMENTS reminded her colleagues that, where officials from the ConservativeCentral Office were associated with departmental discussions of policy, Ministers should be scrupulously careful to ensure that they were not given access to classified material.    This could require careful handling in relation not only to documents but also to detailed oral discussions.THE MINISTER OF STATE, DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT, MR GUMMER, said that in one recent case an official of the Conservative Central Office who had been involved in departmental discussions of policy had resigned his appointment at Central Office to take up an outside appointment in which his foreknowledge of Government intentions could be of privileged value to him.    He had acted very properly in agreeing that there should be an interval between his giving up his appointment with the Conservative Central Office and taking up his new appointment. Arrangements were being made to change the contracts of employment for people employed in the Conservative Central Office to make it easier to ensure that in such circumstances a reasonable interval elapsed between two appointments.The Cabinet -Took note.CONFIDENTIAL
