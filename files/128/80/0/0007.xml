CONFIDENTIALMOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORD TOCC(84) 36th Conclusions Thursday 8 November 1984Copy No X of 4 CopiesECONOMIC SITUATION AND PROSPECTSTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the annual Autumn Statement would be published on Monday 12 November.    It would take full account of the decisions which the Cabinet had just taken on the 1984 Public Expenditure Survey.    On the general economic situation, it would show that output was expected to grow by about 2  per cent in 1984 and 3  per cent in 1985 as the economy recovered from the effects of the coalminers&apos; strike.    Inflation would decline from 43/4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1984 to about 4  per cent in the fourth quarter of 1985.    The balance of payments on current account, which had been seriously impaired by additional oil imports and other consequences of the coalminers&apos; strike, was expected to improve from bare balance in 1984 to a surplus of between  2 billion and  3 billion in 1985.    The underlying rate of increase of earnings was likely to remain undesirably high, at about 7i per cent in 1984 and 7 per cent in 1985.    He had agreed with the Secretary of State for Social Services that the rates of National Insurance contributions should remain unchanged, subject to revalorisation of the upper and lower earnings limit.    Employers would, however, enjoy the benefit of a full year&apos;s freedom from the National Insurance Surcharge, which had been abolished with effect from 1 October 1984.    The Public Sector Borrowing Requirement in 1984-85 was expected to be  8  billion: this had already been publicly indicated.    On the basis of the Government&apos;s spending plans and the usual assumptions regarding revenue and borrowing, current projections suggested that there might be room for a fiscal adjustment in 1985-86 in the range of  1-1   billion. The Autumn Statement would make it clear that it was assumed (but not predicted) that the strike would not last into 1985; and that the unemployment assumption given to the Government Actuary for the purposes of his valuation of the National Insurance Fund and advice on appropriate National Insurance figures related to Great Britain, excluded school leavers and, as in previous years, was conventional.A minor point, of which his colleagues should be aware, was that it would be announced that printing of the  1 note would cease at the end of 1984, saving  3i million in public expenditure in a full year. This decision would need careful presentation.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office 15 November 1984CONFIDENTIAL
