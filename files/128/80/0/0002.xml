SECRETOne Copy OnlyMOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORD 0ne Addi^ &quot;^, C Py,j,q made on 16/2/84CC(84) 5th Conclusions to S/S Employment.Thursday 9 February 1984THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT reminded colleagues that the Conservative Party 1983 General Election Manifesto had drawn attention to concern about the way in which the right of individual trade union members not to pay the political levy operated in practice.    It had set out the Government&apos;s intention to invite the Trades Union Congress (TUC) to discuss the steps which trade unions themselves could take to ensure that individual members were freely and effectively able to decide whether or not to pay the political levy; and indicated that, if trade unions were not willing to take such steps, the Government would be prepared to introduce measures to guarantee freedom of choice.    The Trade Union Bill currently before Parliament required trade unions to hold ballots before establishing political funds and subsequently membership every 10 years if they wished to continue operating them.    Pending the outcome of discussions with the TUC, however, it made no provision for contracting-out to be replaced by contracting-in.    He had been discussing this matter with the General Secretary of the TUC and the Chairman of the TUC&apos;s Employment Policy Committee (EPOC).    The General Secretary was clearly anxious to improve the trade unions&apos; general working relations with the Government and had been making considerable efforts to ensure a satisfactory voluntary undertaking on the political levy.    As a result a draft agreement had been prepared which the General Secretary wished to put to EPOC for its approval on 15 February.    If it were approved, he would then formally consult the Secretary of State for Employment about its contents, so that the Government&apos;s immediate reaction could be made known when the document was put before the TUC General Council the following week.    He felt that the terms of the draft agreement were the best which the Government might have been expected to secure under a voluntary agreement.    It required the unions to review existing procedures to ensure that adequate information and guidance was given to members about their right to contract out and that effective action was taken to remove any obstacles to contracting out.    If the General Council approved it, all trade unions would be expected to comply with its terms.    He considered that the agreement could be accepted by the Government as a basis for agreeing not to legislate u on contracting-in.    In view of the delicate timing considerations, it would be helpful to have colleagues&apos; agreement now, so that he could indicate the Government&apos;s position if the General Secretary was able to secure the approval of EPOC on 15 February.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that the Cabinet agreed that a voluntary agreement would be preferable to legislation, provided that its terms were satisfactory and that it was honoured by the trade unions.    They were content to accept the Secretary of State for Employment&apos;s judgment that an agreement on the lines indicated was acceptable.    It was clear, however, that it was not sufficient to obtain only the formal endorsement of the TUC General Council for it.    If, for example, the leaders of two or three major trade unions indicated that1SECRET
SECRETthey would not comply with the agreement in practice, or remained silent initially but did not actually comply later on, the agreement would be of little value.    It would therefore be unwise for the Government finally to abandon at this stage the option of legislating, even though legislation on this subject, which would affect the funding of the Labour Party, would create great unease and should not be entered into lightly.    The attitude of the TUC so far justified proceeding as the Secretary of State for Employment proposed, provided that it was made clear that the Government expected its own pledge of good faith to be met with equal good faith by the trade unions, and that the Government would continue to reserve the right to legislate if the voluntary agreement broke down in practice.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Secretary of State for Employment to be guided accordingly in his further discussions with the Trades Union Congress.2SECRET
