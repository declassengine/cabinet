ICONFIDENTIALPARLIAMENTARY   l.     The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the HouseAIRS of Commons during the following week.jjeport of the   THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Appeal Committee of the House of Lordsfilamentary   were to hear on 11 February an application on behalf of the Leader ofundary the Labour Party for leave to appeal against the refusal of the Courtemission        of Appeal to grant an injunction preventing the Parliamentary Boundaryr England       Commission for England from submitting its report.    If leave to appealp     , were refused, he would lay the Commission&apos;s report, together with the^    lQus draft implementing Order in Council, as sson as possible after it wasC   RrenC6: received.    There would then be no difficulty about having the Order^ 2nd        made at the Privy Council arranged for 16 March.    If leave to appealMinC^US^ nS&apos;     were granted, he was advised that the House of Lords could take up toute 1 a month to deal with the substance of the case.    There would then beno chance of making the Order on 16 March, and indeed the report mightnot be submitted to him until after Easter.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that, if leave to appeal were granted, itwould be open to the Treasury Solicitor to apply in open court for anexpedited hearing.    To avoid further delay, it would also be possiblefor counsel to ask for the decision of the House of Lords to beannounced in advance of the delivery of the detailed judgment.^port of the   THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that the Parliamentary^ ilamentary   Boundary Commission for Scotland was expected to submit its report to^undary him in tne week beginning 14 February.   The Stirling District Council^Kimission        were expected to challenge the Commission&apos;s recommendations in ther Scotland     Scottish Courts on the grounds that the proposal to transfer certainsafe Labour wards to a safe Labour constituency would be damaging tothe Labour Party.    The Council would probably apply for an interiminterdict to prevent the Commission from submitting its report. Thoseproceedings might take a week or two.    The substantive hearing of theCouncil&apos;s case might not be completed for two to three months, butunless an interim interdict was granted, which was unlikely, there wasno reason why the Government, Parliament and the Privy Council shouldnot go ahead with action to implement the report in the meantime.Even if the decision at the substantive hearing was in the Council&apos;sfavour, a decision of Parliament to approve the draft Order in Councilcould not be overturned.The Cabinet -Took note.?i flagCONFIDENTIAL- 4G
CONFIDENTIALFOREIGN 2.     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the MoroccanRS Foreign Minister, Monsieur Boucetta, had called the previous day onthe Prime Minister to convey King Hassan&apos;s decision to postpone theMiddle East       proposed visit to London by the Arab League Delegation.Monsieur Boucetta had emphasised that the King regretted the postpone-Previous ment, which he had decided on for internal Moroccan reasons; that heReference*        hoped it could be reinstated soon; and that the Moroccan GovernmentCC(83) 2nd        adhered to the view that Palestinian interests of the PalestineConclusions      Liberation Organisation should be represented on the Delegation by aMinute 2 representative of the West Bank Arabs, not by a representative of thePalestine Liberation Organisation.   Despite these professions ofintent by the Moroccans, it was beginning to appear doubtful whetherthe visit would in the end take place.^Ikland THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that it appeared thatan s Argentine ham radio operators were transmitting from the South Orkneysp     . and the South Shetlands.    An approach was being made to the ArgentineRefVl US Government about this through diplomatic* channels, and a firm warningCC(RrenCe: WaS keinS conveyed against any unauthorised incursions into thej,q   ^ 2nd territory of the Falkland Islands or their dependencies.    The first of^nclusions,     the warships being built by Bl8hm and Voss of Hamburg for the Argentinenute 2 Navy was now being handed over to the Argentines:  it contained one ofthe two sets of Rolls-Royce engines which had been delivered to theGerman manufacturers before the Argentine invasion of the FalklandIslands.    Bl8hm and Voss had agreed to release Rolls-Royce from theircontractual obligation to provide a British engineer to be present onboard during the sea trials with the Argentine Navy.Nl8eria THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the NigerianGovernment&apos;s decision to expel illegal migrant workers from the countrywas causing serious concern.   Deadlines had been fixed of 31 Januaryfor unskilled workers and 28 February for others.    There were reports,as yet unconfirmed, that some 800,000 refugees had crossed theneighbouring country of Benin; and the influx of expelled Ghanaiansinto Ghana was likely to have a catastrophic impact on the Ghanaianeconomy.    The United kingdom was participating in the EuropeanCommunity&apos;s programme of emergency relief and was also helping throughthe Red Cross and other voluntary organisations.    So far the BritishGovernment&apos;s concern about the situation had been expressed onlyprivately to the Nigerian High Commission in London; but it mightshortly be necessary to make a public statement.ArmC(^s THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had publiclyj^ntr l and      welcomed President Reagan&apos;s offer of a Summit meeting with the FirstSarmament       Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, Mr Andropov, to sign anj&gt;     , agreement banning all intermediate nuclear forces (INF) , which had beenRefVl0us announced by Vice-President Bush in West Berlin.   This was a somewhatCCf renCe: clumsy attempt by the United States Administration to regain the       . tc    3) lst propoganda initiative, and it was doubtful whether it had helped tojj. clusions,     reinforce the Alliance&apos;s negotiating position on INF in the eyes ofute 2 European opinion.    Vice-President Bush would be visiting London in the^ CONFIDENTIAL 47^1
ICONFIDENTIALfollowing week, when there would be an opportunity to explain theGovernment&apos;s views to him on the handling of the INF negotiations andto discuss the state of British and European public opinion on thisissue.The Cabinet -Took note.COMMUNITY 3.     THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that theIRS European Court was expected to make known its decision about the UnitedKingdom&apos;s procedures for restricting milk imports the followingUltra-heat-      Wednesday, 9 February.    It was expected that the Court would decidetreated that the United Kingdom&apos;s measures were excessive and therefore anImports     impediment to trade.    Their decision would have to be accepted, butsome other regime would need to be substituted, and this would requireprimary legislation.   The immediate problem was that the Governmentwould need a power to control imports in the period between the Court&apos;sruling and the enactment of new legislation.    Two possibilities wereunder examination, both of which raised problems.    He was consideringurgently with the other Ministers concerned which of the possiblecourses of action presented the fewest risks.Community THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the European Parliament werel9So6t: Co cons:i-der the 1983 Supplementary and Amending Budget at theirRefunds     Plenary Session beginning on 7 February.Previous The Cabinet -|!eference:C(83) 2nd Took note,fusions,Minute 3^USTRIAL        4.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR* THE ENVIRONMENT said that the AdvisoryRS Conciliation and Arbitration Service had held further discussions withthe employers and union representatives in the water workers&apos; dispute,^ater The employers were sticking to the offer they had made on the basis ofindustry pa       t*ie mediator&apos;s recommendations, stressing their willingness to explore^e8 tiations     t*ie possibility of productivity-based improvements.    The union sidehad so far refused to respond or to exercise its right to go torevious arbitration.    There was consequently a temporary standstill on theReference- negotiating front.    The impact of the strike on water supplies^C(83) 2nd        throughout the country appeared to be relatively stable.   There hadConclusions      been no significant increase over the past week in the number of^nute 4     &apos;     properties which were without water; some 6i million people were beingadvised to boil their drinking water as a precautionary measure. Thewater authorities had been unexpectedly successful in keeping thesystem going, and with certain exceptions emergency cover was being .3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALmaintained.    This was sharpening the frustration of the union side,who might therefore be contemplating more aggressive action.Meanwhile, in certain parts of the country management and supervisorystaff were carrying out emergency work on a volunteer basis. Therewere some tentative indications of workers beginning to think ofstarting to return to normal work.    He would be making a statement inthe House of Commons that afternoon emphasising the fairness of theemployers&apos; offer and the fact that the water workers could obtain nomore money by strike action but only through productivity agreements;and calling for an early return to work.The Cabinet -Took note.^NOMIC 5.     The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of theKATEGY Exchequer (C(83) 5) on economic strategy.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER introduced a discussion of the economicsituation, as a background to the decisions which he would be takingfor his Budget to be presented on 15 March, and every member of theCabinet contributed to it.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that there wasgeneral agreement on the assessment of the situation, on the outlookfor the future and on the course to be followed.The Cabinet -Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take account ofthe discussion in preparing his forthcoming Budget.VCabinet Office3 February 1983CONFIDENTIAL
