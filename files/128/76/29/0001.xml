i;^ [confidentialI HAFF^g? 1 .     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had attended the- f^yy\        General Assembly of the United Nations in New York from 25-30 September.^ted^vTxS      ^S sPeecn ^n tne general debate on 28 September had enabled him to putNati0n t&apos;ie British view on major world issues including the relationship ofGeneral t*ie British and French nuclear deterrents to current arms controlAssembl     x^y) ne8otiati ns and tne Falkland Islands.    He had called on the Secretary^oheneral of the United Nations, Senor Perez de Cuellar, and had made a\0\y^riety of other useful contacts including bilateral meetings withX^tt&apos;/Foreign Ministers and with President Kyprianou of Cyprus.    It had beenr/j^hlkfor the Prime Minister to have a separate meeting with the Primem^nLarj^r of India, Mrs Gandhi, rather than to be among the small numberof&lt;Wes^rn leaders who had attended Mrs Gandhi&apos;s Summit meeting, whichhad &lt;{&amp; ivjsA disorganised and unfruitful.    Speaking in the general debatethe Arg^rtLne Foreign Minister, Senor Lanari, had deployed the standardArgentm^krguments about the Falkland Islands, and Argentina wasworking \rard to muster support for a resolution favourable to its cause.In contacts with his colleagues he had reinforced the British lobbyingcampaign but the attitudes of the French Foreign Minister,Monsieur Cheysson^xand the Italian Foreign Minister, Signor Andreotti,were unhelpfulHe) had made this clear to the Italian Ambassador,Signor Cagiati r^2nrfZ3^t would be necessary to maintain pressure on allmember Governments^of/jthe Community.Ik I3nd Armment        THE F0REIGN AN0 COMMONWEACJH)SECRETARY said that the new American^Otlti&quot;ol proposals in the Strateg^^y^vs Reductions Talks announced byPresident Reagan on 4 Oct^tfej/(centred on the &quot;build down&quot; concept whereby^teviou at least one  ld warhead orT ^r would be removed for every newReferen strategic missile warhead or\^t^regic bomber deployed.    This was a^^3) f^i sensible concept, consistent w^w/xhe trend away from land-based strategicCoticiUs- missiles with multiple warheads fl^ayowards small single-warhead mobile^nute 2 nS&apos;       missiles.    Following closely on cWh^ American proposals aboutintermediate range nuclear forces Sarmtfunced on 26 September, thislatest move would also enable the w kfc-23^ maintain the initiative on thearms control front. yOTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE saidN^hat the reduction in the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organisation&apos;s tactical nuclear arsenal, on whichagreement was about to be reached within the Alliance, would be a furtherpositive factor in this connection.   The public/^lations aspect of thedecision would need careful handling to ensuref(thatjz it made the maximumimpact on world opinion. ^~(^^)THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the c^^Cr%re in thej,revious Lebanon was holding as well as could be expected.    The Sepd&amp;ity CommitteecefereriCe. established to strengthen the ceasefire had made some us&amp;w Vy:ogress,CC(83) 2g* including the reopening of the airport.   But there was noNXg^einent yet^?nclUs o h        on observers, without which the&quot; ceasef ire was unlikely to la^&lt;V&gt;ThellUite 1 nS&apos;       Syrians, with Soviet backing, were objecting to United NatioNk^w^ervers,and various alternatives were being explored.   At the United R^t^Lfors,confidential] %
^ [confidential! H&lt;yj the United Kingdom was playing a leading part in seeking to promote alyy\        resolution in favour of United Nations observers which would command&lt;yS^\      the requisite nine votes in the Security Council, in the hope that theSoviet Union (and the Syrians) would back down if faced with the need to&apos;Cyyss. veto such a resolution.   Meanwhile the British contingent in the\w) multinational force (MNF) was providing a standing guard for the meetings^^VW the Security Committee and winning golden opinions from all sides.\OoCt2\would however be desirable for this responsibility to be shared by theM^Wer MNF contingents on a rotational basis.flffi^i^ME MINISTER commended the skill with which the United KingdomViiarsiary^to the United Nations was working to secure a Security Councilreso^i-jfift which would oblige the Syrians to accept observers from theUniteOYrati^ns Truce Supervisory Organisation, which alone could providea disciplined and effective observer force.   The problem was tooutmanoeuvre the Syrians, who did not want to be dislodged from the strongposition which they had now established for themselves in the Lebanon-.Va THE FOREIGN AND^)MM^WEALTH SECRETARY said that the general election inKenya on 26 Septefa^ejTAjad passed off peacefully.   Within the one partysystem there had bee^i/wide choice of candidates, but turn-out had beenlow.   President Moi^Aiew&gt; Cabinet appeared to represent a reasonablebalance of interests v^p&amp;jafy the Kikuyu and the other tribes; and thenew Minister of Finance, iMr/Saitoti, was said to be a well qualifiedtechnocrat.   Mr Charles the former Minister for ConstitutionalAffairs, was still in 1 imb^axmXting the judicial inquiry intoallegations that he had sougti^&lt; &gt;c\ undermine the position of the President.The Queen would be visiting Kenya/from 10 to 14 November.% Iltliste i THE PRIME MINISTER said that her recpj r visits to Canada and the Unitedi8ita t s States had gone well.    She had been&lt;^m5* ^sed by Canada&apos;s enormousCanada     potential and also by its relative isolaxi^n: for example, the Canadian^shin ^nd Prime Minister, Mr Trudeau, had told he^that their exchange at0n Williamsburg had been the first thoroughydiscussion of nucleardeterrence and its implications which he had ever had with another Headof Government.   Canada needed to be encouraged to play a fuller part inthe Alliance and in the Western community of na^ralas.    Contacts betweenthe United Kingdom and Canada should be intens(^e&lt;dand there should bemore Ministerial visits between the two countri5-s^~B\iring her own visitshe had focused attention on the damage which CanMiajk^olicies oninward investment were doing to British companies a^Prttfad beeninstrumental in securing a decision by the Canadian ua&amp;jtfj&amp;t to overridea recommendation by the Foreign Investment Review Age^^S^d allowUltrama to purchase two Canadian petroleum retailing chaiR&lt;&amp;% Mr Trudeauhad also said that Canada would abstain on the Argentine^^kov^ptionabout the Falkland Islands at the United Nations. x~&gt;&gt;&lt;\confidential! %
(r\ 1 confidentialm^n the United States, before a meeting in New York with the Secretaryl/y General of the United Nations, she had had talks in Washington withPresident Reagan, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of theFederal Reserve Board and Senate Foreign Relations Committee. PresidentReagan had shown a firm grasp of all the main issues and her privateW^j) talk with him had been frank, friendly and valuable.    Both with the\r^/President and with the Secretary of the Treasury, she had made it clearw^chjat the American position on unitary, taxation was unacceptable\&gt;y$fv would in the long run damage United States interests.    She had^mph^sised European anxieties about the United States deficit and thed(aitiaglng effects of American extra-territorial legislation.   The Foreignand^?ommpnwealth Secretary had also made these points to the UnitedStatejt^gjisxetary of State, Mr Shultz.    On the Middle East, she hadimpre^sk^/on President Reagan the importance of not undermining Jordanand King/mSsein, who was a good friend of both the West and Israel.She had xdTso been able to explain to the Vice-President, Mr Bush, theposition reached in the negotiations with the Chinese Government on thefuture of Hong Kong.On East-West re/LaTions, it was apparent that the United States maintained Iregular contacc^-wifehvthe Soviet Union, despite the action they hadtaken - and had efyecthd their allies to take - to show disapproval of theSoviet invasion orv7*flwwf^nistan and the shooting down of the Koreanairliner.   Once ind ig^M&gt;i&gt;n over the Korean airliner had subsided, itwould be desirable fo ^ n^United Kingdom also to resume working contactswith the Soviet admin iwfr^t) en and seek if possible to influence therising generation of SovierJ^x^aders.   On arms control, it was clear thatthe remarks by the Vice-PraSiaant about the inclusion of the British andFrench nuclear deterrents rn- ia\Geneva negotiations had been misinter-preted.    The argument that Bf^^stLand French weapons should be includedin the Strategic Arms Reductiou^^lks (START)  if they were excluded fromthe intermediate nuclear force A/!fe^x\jegotiations was misconceived: theUnited States was precluded by tnre J^kson amendment from entering intoany arms control agreement with the^&apos;Sotflet Union except on a basis ofparity.    It would be inconsistent wifitC^jjis for the United States to agreeto an equation which made allowance f-O^^ritish and French weapons atUnited States expense: such an approac&amp;&apos;xpald lead to pressure on Britainand France to scale down their deterrensXor abandon them altogether.The French had made it clear that they would not allow the size of theirdeterrent to be determined by the United States; nor could the UnitedStates allow the size of their capability to be^-djipendent on France orthe United Kingdom.   The right position for the/^ri^ish Government wasthat the British national deterrent was a red h^jsr^S&amp;v in the currentnegotiations, since Britain disposed of only 128h^r^iegic warheadsas against 9,000 Soviet warheads: if however the W*^^ States and theSoviet Union could reach agreement through the INF anyd/^ART negotiationsdrastically to reduce their respective nuclear arsenaijKYfcfoe time wouldthen come for the United Kingdom to consider what contrfibto&gt; on it couldmake to the nuclear arms control process. ^vv^ViThe Cabinet - . i&apos;xc^1.

(C^ [confidential!

There had beenRefer ^\    general endorsement of the need to maintain anti-inflationary policies^(83) Ce&lt;j /\ calculate&lt;i t0 sustain the world economic recovery which was now clearlyConc^u un&lt;ier way.    On the question of access to IMF funds, the United StatesMiiiuteS^0n x^vx?pngress had still not ratified the Bill implementing the new quotas,^s^wich the United States Government had agreed to earlier in the year.\ypg ) a British compromise proposal for interim arrangements covering theMla  OJ2 months had been agreed, and President Reagan&apos;s undertaking togx^ve.h\s strong personal backing to the passage of the quota Bill throughCoQ^resjkhad been warmly welcomed.    There had been widespread concernabout/&amp;T&lt;j^ability of the present Brazilian Government to carry throughthe sCj^tJ&amp;ent measures required by the IMF as part of its reliefpackage^/^rj^ the possibility that a future Brazilian Government mightrepudiate&lt;yBrazil&apos;s debts could not be ruled out.    But the United Statesand otherVLndustrialised countries were giving Brazil a substantialmeasure of financial support, and contingency plans to cope with aBrazilian debt repudiation were in hand.    There had been little supportat the meeting/^vak from France, for the idea of a new Bretton Woods Iconference.    Bu^_a Saajority of Commonwealth countries was in favour of it,and the idea woiaTd/pTobably be pressed by the Prime Minister ofNew Zealand and otSQei^^t the forthcoming Commonwealth Heads of GovernmentMeeting. &lt;yj&apos;I/}The Cabinet - &lt;^^yy2.

On the Unit^dV^Cngdom&apos;s own request for anextension of the less favoured areas there was almost no difficulty ofsubstance.
