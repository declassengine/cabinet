The House would rise forvx\        the Summer Adjournment on Friday 29 July and return on MondayProcVlS-ng&lt;^^^E L0RD PRESIDENT 0F TEE COUNCIL said that in 1966 the House of Lordsin t^e^ings\^^jad passed a motion in favour of their proceedings being televised forof i 6 ^0use    Am/aS^perimental period, and an experiment on closed circuit had takens ^lac^^Ln 1968.   A number of Peers wished to raise the matter again,afwLt/was possible that there would be a debate in the autumn andtha&lt;foSifr&gt;the House approved a further experiment, the SoundBroaocSrer^ag Committee would hold discussions with the televisionauthorities.The Cabinet -Took note^^ ^^^^F *EIGN (QUAppAl^ 2.     THE FOREIGN ftNjErXOMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Thames Television___ had made a film of^?njp^ftd.al in Zimbabwe of a number of officers of theZirabajj Zimbabwe Air Force w^wm accused of treason.   The film, which wasWe believed to comment cric*p^lly on the conduct of the trial, was to bePtevi broadcast that evening.&lt;xmevsverdict in the trial had not yet beenRefer Us delivered.   At the requesXjjf/the defending Counsel, Lord Goodman had(83)n e* approached the Government trtxs^^whether action could be taken to^ ncl ?^tn prevent the film being show^l^/this juncture, since this could onlyMinuteSl0ns      be prejudicial to the interes^ ^j* ^the accused, several of whom werecitizens of the United Kingdom My^J^l as of Zimbabwe.   He was satisfiedthat it would be an act  of  grotes^da^irresponsibility by ThamesTelevision to show the film as plami^a.    Even if the film went aheaddespite representations from the Gq^eiarfent, it would be helpful thatthe Zimbabwean authorities should berort that such representationshad been made. \&lt;THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that by showing the film Thames Televisionwould be putting the lives and liberties of their fellow citizens atrisk for no legitimate reason.    If the trial rff* \taking place in theUnited Kingdom, those responsible for showingHthayfilm would be liableto proceedings for contempt of court: but no re^i^ction could betaken against them in respect of a foreign tria\L_^fo^was not awareof any case in which filmed comment on a British Tj^&amp;Xhad been shownabroad before the trial had finished. //v^\In discussion it was pointed out that Lord Goodman had jfrj^adyapproached the Independent Broadcasting Authority (lBAX wp/fo\ alonehad power to prevent the film being shown, and had recerv^ad^X^replyfrom the Deputy Director General declining to stop the broa-d is^; butit did not seem that he had made a direct approach to the Crap^n,who might be more receptive.   Home Office officials were in toWaJ^with[confidential! I

Conveying the views of the Cabinet&lt;^v/\       to the Authority might be interpreted as political interference: butv^X/\    it might be appropriate to apprise them of the legal implications\())   that would ensue from showing such a film in respect of a trial inx^^Xthe United Kingdom.    It would however be important to avoid creatingw^v^che impression that the Government was endorsing the conduct of the\w^yial or the actions of the Zimbabwean authorities in relation to it.&quot;uprfpfaxxsoxvs, might also be made with televised commentaries on the^txxptyS. of dissidents in the Soviet Union and elsewhere to which noex^^jons had been taken.THE wtfME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that, subject tothe vi^^/of the Attorney General, it would be desirable to endorsethe app^^ach already made to the IBA by Home Office officials; and tostate puVlicly that the Government had asked for the film to be seenby the Chairman and senior members of the Authority before a decisionwas taken on whe-fcher to show it as planned.The Cabiir^1.

He had seen the PresidentPrevi  ^ t*ie United States, the &gt;^e^Rresident and senior members of theRef,; us Adminis tration, all of whomvnaoExpressed their satisfaction at theCC(82)nCe: outcome of the British Genera^Blrection and their admiration for^ nclu ?^&quot;st       Britain and for the Prime Minisjce^oersonally.    It was clear thatMinut s^ons,     Britain&apos;s standing in the Uniteo^St^^s was high, and that there wasa fund of goodwill towards Britainoi^which judicious use should bemade.   He had been able to discuss&lt;4&gt;i^he principal issues of mutualconcern to the two Governments.    TheymLad States Secretary of State,Mr Shultz, and the Secretary of the Tir^^sury, Mr Regan, had made itclear that they had opposed the recent^Aecision by the United StatesGovernment to impose import restrictions on special steel; and theyhad insisted that these measures should not be seen as a step down theprotectionist road following the Williamsburg ,Ci2&gt;oomic Summit. Despitethese disclaimers, however, he feared that furatheq) protectionistmeasures might follow.   He had raised the matbe^/^ns&apos;the Foreign AffairsCouncil of the European Community on 18 July, an^^He^Community wasproposing to pursue its right in the General AgreeTj&amp;wtf on Tariffs andTrade vigorously.   He had expressed the British Govf^wtw^fit&apos; s concernsto the United States Administration on unitary taxatrfoj^O^n whichMr Regan had expressed agreement) and on the Export Administration Act.He had not been altogether reassured by his conversatio^^^rout theAmerican economy with Mr Regan and Mr Volker, the Chairmsm^^xXheFederal Reserve Board, which had given him the impress ion j^ &lt;f\^heAdministration lacked the necessary policies and resolution^o^efoalconfidential! %

The Americans had made no reference to the dispute arising fromthe United States anti-trust actions against British airlines. On&lt;^\&gt;/\      foreign affairs, the United States Administration saw little hope of&lt;//y\   progress in the Middle East and would probably be less active there&lt;^j)  as the Presidential election approached.   On East-West relations theyK^/^were pleased that the re-election of the Christian Democrat-Free^Pv.Hfemocrat coalition in the Federal Republic of Germany and of theXV^jonservative Government in the United Kingdom made it possible for the^A&amp;SUnce to maintain its firm policies towards the Soviet Union. Theysf^ceXNgreat difficulties in Central America, where their genuinecqpcermat the advance of Soviet and Cuban influence was involvingthem^jj^-aupporting some unattractive regimes.    President Reagan andMr S^nXr^: had urged on him the importance of maintaining the Britishgarris^n/^n Belize.   On the Falkland Islands, the American attitudewas conditioned by their concern at the prospect of the elections dueto take place in Argentina in October producing a left-wing Governmentthere, and they were looking to the United Kingdom for help in avertingthis outcome.    Ha^had made it clear that the United Kingdom wouldwelcome normaY/ e7i\tions with Argentina, but that there could be noquestion of negefi 1sing with the Argentines about sovereignty over theFalkland Islands ( H^J had also sought American help in applyingpressure on Argenci^^hrough the International Monetary Fund to enddiscrimination agaiira^Eritish banks and firms.    The question of anti-trust legislation haq^OiNbeen raised.   Almost all his interlocutorsin the Administration^an&amp;Ho the Senate had expressed interest inIreland and had welcomed/ fo \resumption of high-level contacts betweenthe British and Irish Gov^efnraants.   There was some feeling that thefailure of this year&apos;s StNfe* r^k&apos;s Day Parade in New York todemonstrate support for they a^s^.of the Provisional Irish RepublicanArmy might mark a turning povhi^yn Irish-American opinion, althoughthis was probably over optimistLz^^He had expressed appreciation ofthe action taken by the United Htara&lt;k Administration to clamp down onarms sales to Irish terrorist organisations and had urged that thispressure should be maintained. v^^^THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND MmSTRY said that he had seenthe United States Trade representative&gt;\Mr Brock, in London on 18 July,who had warned him that the United States textile industry was becomingrestive and that President Reagan was likely to come under pressure forprotectionist action in this area.    It was important to impress on theUnited States Administration, as he had done fcm      Brock, that theUnited States would have nothing to gain by su&amp;y^E&amp;ion, which wouldre-open the whole question of low cost imports andifcriously damagetrade relations between Britain and the United Sisals/confidential! %

Although^^SS^yy      it contained nothing dramatic, it marked a further step in theprev&gt;   &lt;^yC\   Helsinki process, which gave the West useful leverage against theKef Soviet Union on human rights.   The document was due to be signed byCQ/o^nc^V_^/!\Foreign Ministers in Madrid on 7-9 September, which would provide anCon      22n&lt;^&lt;P\y^jportunity for him to talk privately to the Spanish Foreign Minister,Mir,       onsVVX^ior Moran, about Gibraltar.uinute 2 ^llyyC^OVie Cabinet -C/L^s Took note.^OMMUNITY 3,     THErOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, at the meeting___ of the Council of Ministers (Budget) which was continuing today, the.Commu .

In the discussion in the CouncilKing^ so far other memberijtates had not raised too many difficulties aboutRefUn m the net figure.   MSwrctf^sion had not yet begun about the allocation tospecific budget liiWy^fXto Chapter 100.    There was, however,Ptevj difficulty over the fcrov^^ion in the 1983 supplementary budget for theRefer Us refunds due to the Unrce&apos;tt^ngdom under the 1982 risk-sharing arrange-(^(83) ment.    The Commission&apos;s &lt;^^p^sal was on the payments basis which had^ nclu ? been used before and whidh^JapUnited Kingdom supported. France,Minute ^0ns&gt;     Germany and Denmark, however^^^re arguing for a different basis ofcalculation (the so-called x^sm&amp;tte&apos;&apos;) which would reduce the paymentsto the United Kingdom.    The G^^fe/Chairman of the Council had alsosuggested that the Commission s/txgQre should be reduced by 100 millionecu.    The Financial Secretary haa^rjan^ clear that this was unacceptable.If necessary, the United Kingdom wouKKseek to postpone the vote untilSeptember.    Contacts had already bev  n--j 3 le with the Federal Chancellor&apos;soffice with a view to influencing  tHeXderjnan position.    It was notrecommended that the United Kingdom stwuXa use the Luxembourg compromiseto block the supplementary budget at trc^ stage.In discussion it was pointed out that it was unsatisfactory that, whenagreements such as the 1982 risk-sharing arrarKjSStent had been reachedby Heads of Government, some member states sought(Jto whittle them awaywhen they came to be implemented.   The German p^ t-v*&gt;n was the key tothe present dispute.    It would be preferrable tlmina FinancialSecretary should not have explicitly to invoke tne~%Wembourg compromise,but he should do everything possible to prevent the &gt;aw ption by theCouncil of an unsatisfactory supplementary budget.  /s\vTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY also reported th^J^the specialCouncil of Ministers on 19 July he had outlined the main^J-^pjWts oftwo papers which the United Kingdom would be submitting on ^p^^udgetarysafety-net and on the strict financial guideline for agricu^tuM^expenditure.

T1    SECRET    | HOUTLgE^^ The Cabinet considered the following memoranda:EXpENDrl^^ A memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C(83) 23)^?^^k       on economic prospects;ii.      a memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury (C(83) 26)^R^ n objectives for public expenditure;\4^^9L.     a memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury (C(83) 24)on Civil Service numbers after 1984;iv.     a memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury (C(83) 25)on privatisation and contracting out. ^^^fl^sp^t        THE CHANCELL0^0^|P EXCHEQUER said that the United Kingdom economy wasand Py^.       likely to grow aj^Wjmle more rapidly than forecast at the time of the^Pendit^     Bud et.    Output v^|J||^ly to increase by perhaps 2j per cent in 1983Ure    and at a similar r^^^ 1984.    The prospects for inflation had alsoimproved since the Inflation was likely to be running at about5i per cent by the end of 1983 and at a similar rate in 1984. Againstthese favourable develc%neT^, the prospects for the world economy haddeteriorated.    Recovery i^pHkope and Japan was relatively slow. Outputwas growing strongly in the United States;    but the very high budgetdeficit there was a cause for concern.    It would put upward pressure onUnited States interest rates, which would unfavourably influence interestrates in this country.    Financial developments in the United Kingdom weregiving cause for concern.    The inora^e in Lhe money supply since  I Aprilhad been running at an annual rat^Jp^bout 17 per cent, some way abovethe 7 to 11 per cent target.    Public expenditure and borrowing had alsobeen well above planned levels.    Itlku^A^ential that the Government shouldcontinue to pursue a responsible and c^pl^ent monetary and fiscal policywithin the framework of the medium-term%^M^ial strategy.    This requiredfirm control over public spending and bor^i^Mg.    The budgetary prospectfor 1984-85 was not easy.    There was a casqpK^ktrying to reduce publicexpenditure plans for that year below the ld^K^bublished in the White Paperon the Government&apos;s Expenditure Plans 1983-8^fcoJm85-86 (Cmnd.8789); buthe was not seeking this.    What was vital was ncJ^^o^exceed the publishedPlans, while maintaining a contingency reserve of  3 billion in order tobe able to cope with such uncertainties as lower than expected shortfall,overruns of demand-determined expenditure programmes, excessive expenditureby local authorities, uncertainties about the refund from the EuropeanCommunity, and the effects of the recently-introduced sch^^ of end-yearflexibility on central Government capital programmes. m^^ATHE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that for the reasons se^H^Jby theChancellor of the Exchequer the objective for the  1983 Publrcj^Rmnditure Survey Ishould be to adhere to the planning totals for 1984-85 and  19^jS||3ublished inCmnd.8789   and   to keep the total at approximately the same real*0^^L in1986-87 ,  including adequate planning reserves.    Looking further ^P^J^the aim should be to hold the total of public expenditure, in cost teri^,UP to 1988-89 at the level of about  103 billion at 1980-81 prices^lcjktreached in 1982-83 and which Cmnd.8789 projected for 1985-86.    If anni^^^^^^^ |    SECRET ~~| 21 I H
|    secret    | H&amp; Ieconomic growth averaged 2\ per cent up to 1988-89 this would permit the^^?^   ratio of taxation to the gross domestic product (GDP)  to be reduced to aboul364 per cent.   For 1984-85 Departments had proposed increases in expenditure^^^ktotalling some  6.1 billion over existing plans.    The figure for 1985-86 was^^^^6.8 billion and for 1986-87  7.0 billion.    Some of the bids wereunavoidable.    He estimated that bids totalling about 12\ billion would have^Bfc^e accepted for 1984-85.    Savings elsewhere of that order would be^eeAd simply to stay within the published total.    Reductions of at leastth^^Wie order would be needed for later years.    He proposed to discusswith colleagues bilaterally how these savings might best be achieved. Hewould report the results to the Cabinet towards the end of October.In discussion, there was general agreement with the assessment presentedby the Chanc#^lor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary, Treasury. Itwas not ea^i;!^ spending Ministers to commit themselves to achieving aspecified level of savings over the totality of public expenditure programmeswi tliout an ind^HfcJyi, which inevitably could not be given at this stage, ofthe detailed im^lcwions for their own programme.    Some members of theCabinet also too^^ra^iew that the Government&apos;s priority should be tostimulate economic growth;    and that the best way of doing so was by mountinga substantial programme of capital investment to improve the nation&apos;sinfrastructure, coupled with encouragement of private investment. TheGovernment had however%^u^kt the General Election campaign on a platformof financial responsibili^^%nd firm control of public expenditure withinthe plans published in Cmnd.8789;    and it was vital to the Government&apos;scredibility to adhere to those plans.    It would strengthen the confidenceof commerce and industry if the Government was seen to be adhering to asteady and pre-determined course on public expenditure.In further discussion, the following uiain points were also made -a.      It was essential, and par^k^^urly appropriate at thepresent stage in the life of a Ps^^ ent, for Ministers tohave a fundamental review of long^fcaAorospect s for the economyand public expenditure.    There were^i^A conflicting considerationsto be weighed.    It was a matter for 3p^4^&gt; that the trend towardsincreased consumption in the public s^fl^ip tne expense of capitalinvestment had continued, though admitt^lTy^^r from all publicsector capital projects were economically^^^bctive.    There was astrong case for reducing the proportion of national output absorbedby the public sector and so reducing the burden of taxation.    On theother hand, the Government was also committed to, and people wantedto see, the maintenance of social services of a high quality.Demographic trends, such as the rising number of ^^^pld people,would add to the cost of honouring that commitmenn^Jp^: to abandonor weaken it would raise very great political difficulties.    It wouldhe helpful to stimulate an informed and construct ive^^^^c debate,perhaps by such means as commissioning appropriate rese^rcrMfromacademic bodies.    This would allow radical ideas to be ^jejgtaoreeasily, and with less political embarrassment, than studi^^^khinGovernment.I |    secret 1 212 H
|    secret    | H^ I .     Tne expenditure plans for 1984-85 assumed that the&apos;GDP deflator&apos; would increase by 5i per cent.   But it should bepossible to secure a smaller increase in that part of the plans whichwas accounted for by pay.    The lower public service pay settlements,the greater the capital investment and the higher the standard ofservice that could be afforded within published plans.    It would be^^^^k highly desirable to make this point in public discussion:    an early^^^^pportunity to do so would arise if the Government, as was currently&apos;^J^oposed, made a statement in early August on local authority^^current expenditure in 1984-85.c.     It would be easier for spending Ministers to find the necessaryamount of savings if they were allowed greater flexibility to switchexpenditure between programmes and if there were more flexibilityin dealing with receipts from the sale of assets.    Such sales would beencour%j|j0|y those responsible for them received some benefit inadditior^^^^eources for their programmes.    This was seldom possibleif, as cu^rjgl^practice appeared to require, receipts were allowed tooffset higr ^ Mpenditure only if they occurred in the same financialyear. ^^j^ketviCe TttE CHIEF SECRETARY, Tm^mk said that the Cabinet had agreed inNuuk^ December 1982 (CC(82) 53w Conclusions, Minute 8) that targets forCivil Service numbers should be set for April 1988.    The total was to bebuilt up from individual figures agreed for each Department, so that thenumbers matched more closely the needs of the work.    Departments hadaccordingly been asked for a statea ct of their likely manpower needs from1984 to 1988 and the scope for ft V% reductions.    There was already agood prospect of reducing the sizlandbbe Civil Service to 605,000 by1 April 1988, provided that the Royal Ordnance Factories were hived off.He believed that it should be possib^^fc|o further and to reduce theoverall target to below 600,000.    He pwpaBed to pursue the possibilitieswith his colleagues as part of his bilateral discussions of expenditureprogrammes.    He asked the Cabinet to agree that the general aim should betto secure rather larger reductions than thlj^H^far offered, but^r-?C ntrac .andtln8   THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that the Government was committed totivat^        reducing the size of the public sector.    Some functions could be transferredSation completely to the private sector.   Others, though necessaj^.y retainedwithin the public sector, could be contracted out to prAAi^ enterprise.Up to December 1982 savings within central Government n^jP^4ka achieved ofnearly 15,000 staff and at least  9 million a year.    Furti^H^oposals wereunder consideration.    The Local Government, Planning and ^t^P^L 1980required local authority direct labour organisations to bid ^ 1substantial proportion of their work against competitive tendffraji^omPrivate contractors.    In consequence, staff numbers had falien^^Mr^per centbetween April  1981 and October 1982.    Regulations which would su^y^flmallyincrease the proportion of general highways, new buildings and marStffcv^hceWork which had to be put out to competitive tender (or given to conrr^J^rs)had been laid before Parliament.    Otherwise, the Government&apos;s efforts^T the8 |^__I    secret |_
j 1    secret    | H&amp; Ilocal authority field had focused on exhortation.   To go further would,^^?k\    f r the most part, require legislation.    He would discuss with the Ministerslj  principally concerned how best to make progress.    In the National Health^k^AService (NHS) about  160 million worth of work was contracted out. Butthere was substantial scope for an increase.    The Secretary of State forj^jki-a&quot;L Services was actively pursuing possibilities with health authorities.Under commercial pressures, and financial and other pressures from central^^e%|ment,  the nationalised industries contracted out a wide range ofsej^H^s.    He proposed that Treasury and Departmental officials shouldcontinue in the course of annual corporate planning discussions to press theindustries to increase the amount of work contracted out and report theresults.    He proposed to pursue possibilities for contracting out work inGovernment Departments as part of his bilateral discussions with spendingMinisters;   tf^eith Ministers should continue their policy of increasingthe amountftmWojitracting out from the NHS.    With the other Ministers concerned Ihe intended&apos;R^fcke a further report in twelve months&apos; time.THE PRIME MINlyM^mumming up the discussion,  said that the Cabinet endorsedthe Chancellor o^^roevEx chequer&apos;s appraisal of economic prospects and theChief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s proposals on the objectives and conduct of the1983 Public Expenditure Survey, Civil Service numbers after 1984, andprivatisation and contracting out.    It was essential that the Government should Iadhere to the expendi^Lanning totals published in Cmnd.8789, on whichthey had fought the last^f^fl^tion.    Ministers should take every opportunitypublicly to emphasise the united view of the Cabinet on this matter.Ministers with spending responsibilities should rigorously examine theirprogrammes for possible economies, and should actively review the functionsand staffing of their Departments.    Some areas of activity  might need morestaff;    but there were undoubtedLv^^iy others where economies could be made.It might well be necessary to establish early retirement terms which wouldfacilitate premature retirement frW^^^k higher  ranks of the Civil Servicewhere that would improve the promot^^^S^spects of talented younger staff.The Cabinet clearly wished to have a f^^Sgntal review of longer-termprospects for public expenditure and the^^Mpmy.

0 [confidentialTops^LREViem^j7^     6-     THE PRIME MINISTER said that, following the resolutions passed by thellEPoRTg^/v^  House of Commons on 20 July on Parliamentary pay and allowances, it would be~-. .    ^x&gt;^\ necessary to seek Parliament&apos;s approval for a draft Order in Council relatingt Salarie    4^^\&gt; t^e salaries of Ministers and other office holders.   After consultation1 ^iste     \\y/t^ a sma-&apos;--&apos;- SrouP  f Ministers, she had concluded that the right course^ oth S     v^Wi be to follow the pattern established for increasing the pay ofOffiCe   r        &lt;$m$&amp;rs of Parliament (MPs) by five instalments, the first in July 1983,Aiders ^$/f/e remaining four on 1 January of the years 1984 to 1987.    In thel gpj /^&gt;  previous Government statements, however, the percentage increaseprevi0u forv^iev5irst instalment should be less than the 5.5 per cent&apos;^eferenc incrag e^)&amp; MPs;    Cabinet Ministers would receive only 4 per cent and the-C(83) increas^e/f^Cs junior Ministers would be in the range 4.7 to 5.4 per cent.^nciUs- rd       SubsequSaS^nstalments would involve the same percentage increases as those^niite ^ ns&gt;     for MPs, per cent on 1 January 1984, declining to 4.5 per cent on1 January v$7.   There would be no provision for Ministerial salaries toparallel than, in the resolution on MPs&apos; pay for a further increase inJanuary 1988 to be determined by the movement between 1983 and 1988 of acivil servant&apos;s saLaxv currently at or about  18,500.   The salary of theLord Chancellor WitpTcvjneed to be treated differently.    At present theLord Chancellor&apos;s\ngti ^al salary was at the same level as that of theLord Chief Justice. /Vih^jTop Salaries Review Body Report No 20 hadrecommended that thex^yja&apos;^Chancellor&apos;s salary should be fixed at a level 2,000 above that of ttfeTLVjsd Chief Justice to mark the Lord Chancellor&apos;sposition as head of the (ygjf&amp;Lary, and this recommendation should beaccepted.    The Lord Chand^T^jpvwould however elect to continue toreceive, as now, the same MifuOTerial salary as other Cabinet Ministersin the House of Lords. &lt;\\j)In discussion it was pointed otfV^b^t Ministers would be criticised forchoosing to receive the same peroe^age increase as MPs had voted forthemselves, and for appearing to BaK^jattern of pay increases forseveral years ahead of around 5 pep^cerpNwhen the Government&apos;s policy wouldbe to secure a lower level of pay sevtfleia^nts.    It was however desirableto maintain the differentials between &lt;M^--aalaries of junior Ministersand that of an MP.    It would be diff icu^^C^or, the Government in futureyears to bring forward Orders in Council (jhey&lt;A- ding for increases inMinisterial salaries when no parallel resolution would be required inrespect of MPs&apos; pay.    There was much to be said for taking this opportunityto settle Ministerial salaries for the period up to 1987.    If circumstancesarose in future years which made it desirable for^Mioisters to forgo theincreases already provided for by Order in CouncizL, yiis could be doneby administrative action and would have greater pilijLiJI^impact than if theGovernment confined themselves now to dealing only (njtW)l983 and refrainedfrom tabling new Orders in Council in future years.V_x^&lt;yThe Cabinet -1.

^ [confidential! HRe^^^^6S     THE PRIME MINISTER said that the one remaining Review Body Report on which^eP0rt/M^^s.     decisions were still outstanding was Report No 19 by the Top Salaries n       C&apos;VvV*  Rev*&quot;ew B dy (TSRB) on the salaries of senior civil servants (UnderSalary G^^&gt; Secretaries and above), senior officers in the armed forces (Major Generalro$2 X^and equivalent and above) and the judiciary.    She had instructed thePtevi0us    &lt;\?^7ecretary  f che Cabinet to circulate a note (C(83) 27) , which set out^ferenc     ^-^P^options for dealing with the Report.    Option A was based on theCC(83)   !|:      Mf^^vfciple of consistency with the treatment of the 1983 Report of theConciUs. r^v/rs anc* ^ent;i-sts Review Body.   The current year increase of 6.9 per centMinute 1 ^&apos;     w u^^  paid from 1 April 1983.    The abatement of the TSRB&apos;s earlierrec^mTmejp^ations amounting to just under 5 per cent would be restored witheffe&lt; rfj?&lt;$in 1 January 1984.    The cost within the financial year 1983-84would l^&gt;45r\1 million (8.2 per cent).    Option B followed the principleof cont sS2ng^the percentage increase in cost within the current financialyear at approximately the same level as the percentage increase in MPs&apos;pay withinN^he current financial year.   The increase of 6.9 per centwould be paid from 1 August 1983 rather than 1 April 1983.   The abatementof just under 5 per cent would be restored with effect from 1 January 1984.The cost within the-^ii.nancial year 1983-84 would be  2.9 million(5.85 per cent). f(rhqje was a strong case for ensuring that in April 1984the TSRB was able\irjD^j5arke recommendations for the top salary groups withouthaving to deal with(any/backlog.    Option B, which she favoured, securedthis result at a modes^^ost within the current financial year, althoughit would involve postp^em^ra^Lt of the current year increase for the topsalary groups for four m^wuf^beyond their normal date for a salary review.She had it in mind to annouhterj&gt;the Government&apos;s decision later that day ina Written Parliamentary Anaj J^^\The Cabinet -2. Agreed that the Goverm^rf/s\ response to Report No 19of the Top Salaries Review Body/6r \top salary groups shouldbe on the lines of Option B as s^^out in C(83) 27.3.
