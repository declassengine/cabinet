I CONFIDENTIAL | Hj^^^AMOITARY   1.     The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House^**3$&amp;fl of Commons during the following week.   The House would rise for thelyy\    Christmas Recess on Thursday 22 December and return on MondayJanuary.^OREIGN ^^c^^V^ THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the consultations**FAIRS \h|pi&lt;7ken the Foreign Ministers of the four countries contributing to the. IW^kSjational Force (MNF) which had taken place in Brussels one anon 8 Q e&apos;epjp r had been unsatisfactory.   He hoped that it would be possiblep   ._ to a^remge a further round of consultations in the margins of theevious Forei^jJ/^tfcairs Council on 19 December.   From his conversations with^ference:        the UnSSSj^States Secretary of State, Mr Shultz, and the United Statesc(83) 36th      Special rap^esentative in the Middle East, Mr Rumsfeld, it appearedinclusions,     that the American view was diverging from that of their fellowinute 2 contributors.   The Americans maintained that moderate Arab opinion wastaking a calmer view of American actions in the Lebanon, but Britishinformation suggested that the MNF was increasingly coming to look tothe Arabs like aVco^atant force.   The forward posture adopted by theAmericans and Frwlctt^although understandable in terms of the heavycasualties they hao^suyfered, was difficult to reconcile with the MNF&apos;speacekeeping role. ^?fflre^French approach to the President of the Lebanon,Mr Gemayel, to .persusajt/^^a to agree to a scaling down of the Frenchcomponent appeared to Vraa^een unsuccessful, but the French ForeignMinister, Monsieur Cheysson/^md told him that the French componentwould nevertheless be red&lt;^e&amp;7yvalthough the reductions would be fewerand slower than originallyN^Lmjped.   The Italian Government was alsounder increasing domestic pre^sift^ to withdraw its component, but&gt; adhered for the moment to theX^a^^ion that withdrawal would take placeonly when the reconciliation tadJfes^i&amp;d been completed.   The issueswould need to be thoroughly disc^eiejfrNLn the four-power consultationsforeseen for 19 December.THE PRIME MINISTER said that she had^^^ved President Gemayel inLondon the previous day.   He had offerw/^considered, well-&apos;informed , %and realistic view of the situation, although on some points he hadbeen more optimistic than the facts seemed to warrant.   He had stressed.   the crucial importance of maintaining the MNF in place and his beliefthat-it would be impossible for the reconciliation talks to succeedif the MNF were withdrawn.   He had explained tfaat}) although thereconciliation talks had been indefinitely adje&gt;ina^3\ representativesof the various participants were in touch with oA|_another behind thescenes and he was hopeful that they would reach a^sjf i cient measureof agreement to enable the reconciliation talks to Y^snajk the followingweek.   But he would not reconvene the talks if there^^^Cnjp basis foragreement in sight.   He had also been optimistic about tne^erformanceof the Lebanese armed forces, which were maintaining thM^xftihesiondespite the fact that about 50 per cent of the officers a^dx^-sper centof the other ranks were Moslem.   There was to be a meetingCeasefire Commission that day in Damascus which could have a^urinbrtantbearing on the future of events. ^^^^^ fl^^CONFIDENTIAL | H
confidential | H(OX. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that President Gemayel&apos;sS^f/ tribute to the performance of the British contingent to the MNF(BRITFORLEB) , confirmed the high regard in which the British troopswere held by all the parties on the ground.   This did not howeverY/Xdiminish the risk to which they were exposed from terrorist action&lt;^/Adesigned to prevent any improvement in the situation in Beirut. TheN^/^ttilding occupied by BRITFORLEB remained highly exposed, but the^C^OTmanding officer was strongly of the opinion that his force shouldVstaj^ there.   Alternative accommodation would be available onfiMSYp^terless, and the British Embassy compound was available for usebyOrfemVkrs of the force who were off duty.   But the decision whetherto m^e^Kie troops and, if so, to which location was best left to theopera^^^al judgment of the commanding officer.    Three Britishsoldie^*^jraiohad accidentally fallen into the hands of a localmilitia rad/neen immediately released when their nationality had beendiscovered  Four shells had fallen near the BRITFORLEB building onthe previous day.   It appeared that these might have been deliberatenear misses, to register, while the Lebanese President was in London,that he was not tjTgsonly force to be reckoned with in the Lebanon.He had himself m^de|)immediate telephone contact with the Druze leader,Mr Jumblatt, whcN3vk[^3hidertaken to do everything possible to preventany further bombaramejzjlv   So far there had been no recurrence.The Cabinet -1.     Took note, Iran/Iraq THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWFJu^ThS^OT^ARY said that officials were inclose and continuous touch witK^op^miericans about the situation inthe Gulf.   It would be essentialC*6^rvsure that the Governemnt was ina position to react promptly and egivcfevely in the event of a closureof the Straits of Hormuz, and continj efi   planning was well in hand.% He would be circulating a memorandum^Sfl^nis jointly with the Secretaryof State for Defence for consideratiqn^^colleagues the followingweek.   The United States Ambassador had\iuggested that a major Iraqiattack on Kharg Island might be imminent^ which would greatly heightenthe risk of escalation of the war.   Although there was no collateralevidence for this,  the situation was clearly f^a^ht with danger.Ar8entina THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that^^^Lamentary opinionj&gt;r had understood the distinction between the Americarroi^^slon to^ evi0us recertify Argentina as qualifying on human rights gre^ds\for armsCrvrence: sales and the question of actual arms sales, on which tiv^J&amp;ited Statesq ^3) 36th Administration recognised the need to take account of B ir gn interestsions, before any major sales took place.   There were some indic^tipjas thatlriute 2 the new Argentine President, Senor Alfonsin, was against aw^Mpr armspurchases; but he had maintained since the election his eleo^o^^confidential [
confidential | Ha. Irhetoric on the Falkland Islands and was vigorously pursuing theyyll previous Argentine Government&apos;s campaign at the United Nations.Reports from Buenos Aires suggested that the Argentines were inclined^^\V^&gt;   to see the exchange of messages between the Prime Minister andyyy. Senor Alfonsin on the occasion of the latter&apos;s inauguration as^XXXtopening the way for an improvement in bilateral relations.    It would\^y%J\ important that the Argentines should be left in no doubt that there/x^S^d be no question of talks about sovereignty, without giving an\jmp^ssion of intransigence on other issues.   Although the Argentinesw r^ tosisting that the construction of the Falkland Islands airfieldshWldyhe discontinued as part of the price for a formal cessationof h^itHities, they might be prepared to explore other possibilitiesthroug^K^jiiormal contacts.   The question of resuming contacts withArgentSnS^lt official level could be explored through the Swiss. Itwould be^raaature to look for Argentine co-operation in jointventures x  exploit offshore mineral resources in the Falkland Islandsarea.   The possibility of establishing a 200 mile Fisheries ProtectionZone around the Falkland Islands, as recommended by Lord Shackleton,needed further comsLderation: but it would be impossible to police;and to seek to e/ta^lish such a zone unilaterally would be seen as afurther challengaZ^^Srgentina on sovereignty.   The new ArgentineGovernment should aisprihe reminded of the outstanding British offerof a properly orgath^KyAext-of-kin visit to the islands.THE PRIME MINISTER, suli^^\vup a short discussion, noted that Argentinedetermination to establistr^r&amp;rereignty over the Falkland Islands wasundiminished.   There coul^ 3j v\o question of any secret talks with theArgentines or of negotiatis^-^yvformula with them which could beinterpreted as compromising th^S^vernment&apos;s position on Britishsovereignty over the islands/^^^rmal cessation of hostilitiesmust be the pre-condition for ajro^p^aumption of diplomatic relationswith Argentina or lifting of the(^ e &gt;ent Exclusion Zone around theFalkland Islands.The Cabinet - ^V/ ^2.     Took note. \\.jajkland THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said th^tT^rtiile the Lord^siands Chancellor could issue a certificate authorisi\^*p3t. documents shouldec rds remain closed beyond the normal period for releas^^to&apos;the PublicRecords Office (PRO), it had become apparent that^-^&amp;Ta certificatewas not issued and documents were released, however^mjts^kenly, therewas no procedure by which such a mistake could legalV^ke\rectifiedand documents mistakenly released recalled.   Documents co^. bewithdrawn temporarily from the PRO for Departments to us^^nytheirwork, and certain papers relating to the Falkland Islands^hafl^-vn factbeen withdrawn using this procedure.   They could not, howev&lt;&lt;  ^ retained indefinitely on this account, and it was becoming i^jex^singlyconfidential
confidential |% I((?)) difficult to justify not returning them to the PRO, in the face of^~y^t) requests from academics and others who know of their existence and^jfyy      were seeking access to them.   On the other hand, their release now(^Vvs.   could be very damaging to United Kingdom interests by making ity\ necessary to disclose prematurely arguments which would need to be&lt;^xX^deployed if a case on Falkland Islands&apos; sovereignty came before the^^/international Court of Justice at the Hague.   This was a particular^-^a*)! ktance of a general problem about the recall of documents mistakenly\\r Leiesed to the PRO, and it was for consideration whether, despite the^^f^aulties in such a course, early legislation should be introducedto/jma&amp;le the recall of documents, including the papers he had referredto, jtfrs&amp;eh circumstances.In dis&quot;OT 5^bn it was argued that the release of the Falkland Islandspapers cWp^ned could cause great harm.   On the other hand, one ofthe docunrafts would shortly become available to public access inAustralia^^and it was likely that most of the arguments and viewscontained in the papers were already known or guessed at by those mostinterested in the^issues. . Furthermore, there would be considerablesuspicion of theyGoyjernment&apos;s motives in introducing legislation andwidespread oppos^ipft-vto it.    It could not be certain that legislationwould be carried, mJ| were seen to be related to this particular case.It would be betterMl^^turn the documents to the PRO, preferably alongwith other papers thw^ep them in their proper context.THE PRIME MINISTER, sutn^Th^^p the discussion,  said that the Cabinetagreed that the question g ^eNjislation on the general issue shouldbe considered in the norad^ oyrse of business, and that, in themeantime, the Falkland Islarrd^^nroers concerned should be returnedto the PRO.   The precise timrogMipd manner of this would need to becarefully considered.   Ministe^^fA^charge of Departments should takecare to ensure that their Deparm *r al arrangements for reviewingdocuments before release to the PRO^rodk adequate account of the needto insure against inadvertent release^ef documents which ought to bewithheld and could not be recalled oqSTj?^^ leased. &apos;The Cabinet - &lt;T&lt;T &apos;3.

This wouldK^lted     &lt;^Xx^fot *&quot;n itself prevent the payment of the refund by the end of March 1984Xngdom     vOy^Ht it would make it more difficult.   In discussion it was pointed outefunds      ^-^1&gt;ftkt the Budget Council had correctly included the refund of 750 millionp    t \\eeu^net on budget lines and that there was no dispute with the Councilevious ^srfr/tpAs point.

The United Kingdom fishing industry was able to support.   the settlement.   This agreement would now allow all the other elementsof the common fisheries policy to fall into place.

All members of the Committee agreed that thereshould be an increase in competition for the provision of theseservices, but ttfiirentfas disagreement about the method by which suchan increase shouvtd&gt;s&gt;brought about.    The matter had become moreurgent because of rane)9econd Reading on Friday 16 December ofMr Austin Mitchell^SI^ylHouse Buyers Bill.    It was therefore necessaryfor Cabinet to reach&lt;&lt;a/&amp;&amp;ision at its present meeting.   There werethree alternative choiv^^/VvThe first was to carry further the courseof action pursued for siome^fc^e by the Lord Chancellor in persuadingthe Law Society to ease t# ^vrestrictions on competition. TheLord Chancellor had alread^Kjj^a^considerable success in this fieldand he wished to be allowed^C^cfctatinue the process.   The second .option was to allow solicitor .wh*0were employed, eg by banks orbuilding societies, to undertaH^yWjajyeyancing for third parties.This would increase competition ^5^&quot;&gt;K the legal profession, butwould ensure the maintenance of stjj d1rcds and therefore of consumerprotection.   This was a point to whLe^the Lord Chancellor attachedconsiderable importance.   The third qgt&amp;m was to allow non-legallyqualified persons to undertake conyeyanrwj^, subject to suitablesafeguards as regards competence, probiwand indemnity.   In this .case it would be for consideration whethw: the extension should berestricted to conveyances of registered land.   Although opinion inthe Committee had been divided, there was a cleaj^majority in favour.  of a firm decision of principle in favour of lraC&quot;&quot;aWond option, butwith consultation about precisely how it shourd^jjje^mplemented.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he wished his colleBftjjfclD to be in nodoubt that a decision to extend the right of convey^anpi^g could havea most serious impact on the legal professions and OTy^n^Government&apos;srelationships with them.   He was in any case strongly^^pYp^ed to theHouse Buyers Bill, because even if one were to accept tlji^&amp;inciple ofextending the right of conveyancing, many of its provisi^ms^are inhis view either unnecessary or misconceived.   As far as the&quot;^t(okpsalto extend conveyancing to non-legally qualified persons was\\:ofte^rned,| confidential | ^ l
j||yjjconfidential]H\ ~/J/\  e had to point out that the Royal Commission on Legal Services inyyf] England and Wales (Benson) had concluded, after exhaustive//^v      consideration, that operations in this highly technical area shouldy^XS^   continue to be restricted to legally qualified persons. Thej//&gt;*. Commission could not see how adequate safeguards on competence and&lt;^x/Vprobity could be maintained, without setting up a new profession,\\^/ihose overheads would be similar to those of solicitors. There&gt;/  Sv$.d therefore be no advantage to the consumer in the form of lower\\pji )es.   He thought that it would be quite wrong for the Governmentwf^yfcrturn without any further inquiry or consultation the cogentlyex^res^d view of a Royal Commission.   The arguments about theexte$ lcm&gt; to employed solicitors were different.   There were problemsabout^dnflict of interest which would have to be carefully considered.BensonCjJtfj^/come down against such an extension, but the argumentationon this yytfxt had been more cursory than that on the extension tonon-legaTw qualified persons.   On the other hand, Benson had indicatedthat there was no evidence that the building societies or otherswished to enter this field.   He therefore considered that the firststep must be to o  sult with the professions about whether such anextension couldn^eb)perated without there being damaging conflictsof interest. He^? a^E&amp;ly recommended that the Cabinet should notcommit itself to w^s/aqurse of action without prior consultation.In discussion the forlyqjWMc points were made -a. It was importanr^t^ensure that the operation ofconveyancing, and th^^KoAllary operations with whichsolicitors were also 6&amp;B j?oed, should continue to besubject to professional^TOMvision, discipline and ethics.There was no reason to bWraft that this would be weakenedby an extension to solicilfifrra^faployed by banks orbuilding societies.   IndeedCrf^jaisght be strengthenedthereby, since such instituti^rejpere likely to insist onstandards at least as rigorous ^ir^Jaose required by theprofessional bodies. ^v/ s\b. In the case of extension to employed solicitors, itwas essential thafthe use of an employed solicitor shouldnot be able to be imposed as a condition of a loan forhouse purchase or offered as a loss leader^ja an attemptto secure business.   Further consideratiqwslymld be givento the question whether any types of emplsjoer^^Ceg builders)should be excluded. \S^sJs\c. Although the conveyancing of registered rirfd^fas asimpler operation than the conveyancing of unregd&amp;tter&gt;edland, the associated problems which might arise in tne^.course of the transaction were similar and might s&lt;Mfe twesbe no less complicated.   Legal expertise was require^_ft&gt;5^\the full appreciation and resolution of these problems^\0^confidential. , 337 m
confidential ^^^^^^^^^^^^M\\J)y. d.     The Government&apos;s primary obligation must be to^&quot;syn protect the consumer and not the professions.   There wasno reason to believe that the creation of a sub-profession^XsS^&gt;  ^ conveyancers could not provide proper protection foryX. the consumer.   The increase in competition which would&lt;/^A\ result would be entirely consistent with the Government&apos;s\S-Ss/\ general policy.\0vO e.     There was a political need for a commitment now. Any&lt;/^/Suggestion that consultation would be about the principle{/jj^\whether a change should be made would weaken the^eovkrnment&apos;s position and run the risk of considerable delay.rC^^/Che Law Society had now supported the proposal from theRoj^/pommission that a Standing Committee of the LawCommission should be set up to consider technical aspects ofland law in relation to conveyancing.THE PRIME MINISTER^summing up the discussion, said that there was aclear majority tint^e Cabinet in favour of an immediate announcementof the Goverrmien^s^E&amp;mmitment to the principle of extending the rightof conveyancing tcuempioved solicitors and to consultation about howthis should be done^myAiow risks of conflict of interest should beavoided.   There was slBf^Aycle&amp;T majority in favour of the view thatthere should be consuT^ fM^ on the principle of extending the rightoutside the legal prof essrorf^.    The timing and method of this furtherconsultation would requir^^^ahussion, but the use of a StandingCommittee of the Law Conmiis&amp;i/y^&apos;was one ppssibility.    In additionevery effort should be made td^Med up the land registrationprogramme, and the Cabinet ve wfo0 indications given during thediscussion that it might be po W&gt;^ to find additional manpower forthis purpose.

I    secret    | Hp^cJ^ICITY       5.     The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of State for| 1 Energy (C(83) 36) about electricity prices.Jrevious THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that following the Cabinet&apos;srvv*^^^.      discussion on 10 November he had pressed the Chairman of the^ 3)  r      Electricity Council to secure the agreement of the 12 Area Electricitynclus^^s^L  Boards and the Central Electricity Generating Board to a price increasexnute 4 ^^Jof 3 per cent from April 1984.    He had reinforced this by pointing outQ ^hfcat tne Government had published an external financing limit (EFL)^Kwk 1984-85 which would require the industry to pay  740 million to^^th^^xchequer.    The Electricity Council was ready to accept this EFL riras confident of its ability to meet it; but it was opposed to theprice increase.   Part of the background to this was that as recentlyas the spring of 1983 the Government had urged the industry to reducethe element in its prices attributable to future investment.   A targetrate of return of 1.4 per cent on current cost assets had been agreedfor the ^#bars 1983-84 and 1984-85; this target was lower than theElectricmm^Wicil had proposed.    Since then, the industry had donebetter than its target.    It was under heavy pressure from industry andconsumer innfc^^^to avoid price increases or to give rebates.Instead of tlTMp^me increase of 6 per cent in 1985-86 which it hadearlier forese^^jAe Electricity Council now thought an increase ofonly 3 per cent would be needed; this removed the likelihood of asevere price increJKdkn 1985-86.    Against this background, theindustry saw the Government&apos;s request for a 3 per cent price increasein 1984-85 as incons^ite^k with the financial framework which theGovernment itself had ^Bwlished.    The industry should be managed byreference to financial targets; the Government should avoid varyingthose targets at short intervals; and price determination should beleft to the industries within the financial framework determined bythe Government.    Some of his colleagues had expressed concern abouthow the electricity industry wou^^etay within its EFL in 1984-85; andthey were anxious that it should noWvdo so by running down coal stocks(which would reduce power station endurance) or by engaging in end-year switches of money.    The ChaiM^^g  the Electricity Council hadassured him that he had no intention fpesorting to these devices.There would be no rundown of power s^fc3iLcoal stocks, although theremight be some modest rundown of the co^^^^tal stockpile which theTreasury had favoured.    The Council was ^Kgfcready to propose a priceincrease during the year if this proved A^PlW^y to stay within theEFL; the industry&apos;s progress would be moni^re closely by theDepartment of Energy.   The industry had a re^p^o^if keeping its. promises.   He therefore concluded that it should be left to minimiseprice increases within its exigent EFL for 1984-85.    Even without anyincrease in tariffs, there would be a small increase in prices toindustrial consumers under fuel price adjustment clauses; this wouldbalance a small reduction in 1983-84.In discussion the following main points were made -a.      In previous discussions, Ministers had been anxTJ^^^o avoidthe uneven pattern of price increases which would hav^jejgltedfrom a standstill in 1984-85 followed by an increase of^^Acent in 1985-86.    If a price increase of only 3 per cent would beneeded in 1985-86, even after a standstill in 1984-85, tha^^^altered the balance of argument.   On the other hand, what p f?e^Lincrease would be needed in 1985-86 would depend not only oneconomic and other factors which could not be accuratelypredicted now but also on the industry&apos;s financial target forio       . flBj[   secret    |_34q J

When it. |ml was set, there would be good arguments for requiring a^?^^k substantially higher rate of return on current cost assets than1.4 per cent, and the EFL for 1985-86 would need to reflect this.? b.     The industry&apos;s latest figures were open to doubt.    It was^^^dk surprising that they had not been put forward at an earlier stage^^kJl of the public expenditure discussions.   Even now, they provided0k      inadequately detailed information.   Moreover, the improvements inthem appeared to derive largely from changes in economic and?    Jkother assumptions and not from improvements in efficiency.^^?Nationalised industries were not slow to ask for changes in theirfinancial targets and EFLs if external circumstances movedagainst them.    It must equally be open to the Government topropose changes if external circumstances moved favourably. Onthe other hand, it was argued that it was wrong to impose newrequirements on a nationalised industry once a policy and anappropriate set of targets had been agreed with it.    Such actionwould be contrary to all good precepts of management.    It wouldbe damaging for the Government to be seen to be interfering witha nationalist industry in this way, and particularly with a viewto f orcinp^h&gt;Augh a price increase.c.

It would be unfortunate if domestic electricity prices werefrozen while industrial prices rose: industrial consumers, whowere already critical of the allegedly excessive price ofelectricity in this country compared with other countries inWestern Europe, would regard this as an unjustif^^^cross-subsidy, and would not be mollified by the f act Wa^here hadbeen reductions under the fuel price adjustment clauses in1983-84. ^kt Wf .     The Government had no statutory power to require^(^e3^Lelectricity supply industry to impose a particular pric^P^^increase; but nationalised industries usually responded to viewsexpressed by Ministers.

psecret ~THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet|ml sympathised with the difficulties faced by the Secretary of State forEnergy.    They were not, however, willing to agree that there should be^^^m no increase in electricity prices from April 1984: this would run too^^?^     great a risk that undesirably large increases would be needed later,either in 1984-85 or in 1985-86.   The Cabinet were also anxious that^t^pY it should not appear that industrial consumers were facing price^^^^ increases, through the operation of fuel price adjustment clauses,while domestic consumers were not.   The Secretary of State for Energy^^%wkuld tell the Chairman of the Electricity Council that it was the^coj^^dered view of the Cabinet that domestic electricity tariffssticuTd be increased by 2 per cent from April 1984; but that industrialtariffs should not be increased otherwise than by the operation of theprice adjustment clauses.   The Cabinet saw no reason why theElectricity Council should reject this view, or why legislation shouldbe needed to enforce it.   As proposed in C(83) 36, it would, of course,be necess^^^:o monitor the electricity supply industry&apos;s financialprogress%nd to ensure that, while all possible savings from genuineimprovements in efficiency were pursued, the industry did not staywithin the p^W^aed EFL for 1984-85 by undesirable or artificialdevices. ^^^BThe Cabinet^KmTook note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summingup of their dis^ssMn, and invited the Secretary of Statefor Energy to be ^kravd accordingly.\ I\ ICabinet Office15 December 1983 kwk12^ [    secret I
