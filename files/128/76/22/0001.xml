QL also recommended four Scottish Bills andnine Bills whose intrd#u^ Yon would be conditional on the Opposition&apos;sagreement to their beins^aicesn under the Second Reading Committeeprocedure in the House ot^oramons .    The Bills recommended by QL were set ut in the Annex to C(83) NtSxa^H, their proposed contents were summarisedin C(83) 20.    No other Bills^^^d be added if there was to be any hope ofcompleting the programme withou^ytfhe need for a spillover in the autumn of1984.    It was important to avm^/t^e if the Bill to abolish the GreaterLondon Council and the MetropolMfar&gt;/ hunty Councils was to be given anearly start in the next Session. &lt;*^/^/&gt;In discussion the following main po^T^^ejre made -a. A Government-sponsored Bill ccKcontrol offensive video tapes(&quot;video nasties&quot;) was likely to be taken up by Mr Graham Bright MP,who had drawn first place in&apos;the ballot for Private Members&apos; Bills.b. The possibility of expanding the Co-/Vpe^tive Development AgencyBill to include changes in the legislatioSfac^K&amp;gional DevelopmentGrants (RDGs)  should be considered when thefp^oLicy ort RDGs had beenagreed.    The changes could save up to  150 mtH^flvt a year and wouldrelate payment of grant to the number of jobs &lt;cy$i^d.c. Although the Dock Work Regulation Bill had not^b^n included inQL&apos;s recommendations, it might be necessary to legKM^^aXon the docksin this Session, for example to deal with the f inanc^JVap-s it ion ofthe Port of London Authority.    This legislation might p^v^Y^o be moreextensive than the Dock Work Regulation Bill as previouwy\ef)visaged.. ._. \\A [confidential! ^ H
^ [confidential] H^-yCj d.      The Pollution (Protection of Food and Marine Environment) t3i111&apos;       L/y was not i-n the recommended programme.    Its purpose was to providecontrol powers which might be necessary in the event of an accident^\&gt;^&gt; such as that at Three Mile Island in the United States.    The issuemight be raised at the Sizawell inquiry.    It was suggested that, inSSj) Cne event of such an accident, it might well be possible to invoke\Z^y\      the powers of the Emergency Powers Act; but there might be a need for&lt;( naV&gt;    new legislation in due course.^&quot;yA^e.     There was a danger that the Agricultural Holdings (Amendment)which was due to be introduced in the House of Lords, would be{^substantially amended there, but the overall management of the&lt;r^^Vj-amme made it necessary for this Bill to start in the House of I1^/? ?f. V\It was still hoped to persuade a Private Member to take up theCrowir Land (Planning Permission) Bill.    Otherwise the Bill might beconsidered for the Second Reading Committee procedure in the Houseof Commons; lint it was very uncertain whether the Opposition wouldbe prepare^pToAagree to that.g. The legislation required to permit the transfer of the NationalBus Company cq^^ &gt;private sector and to enable the capital recon-struction of Br&lt; cLs&gt;r&gt;Airways to take place prior to privatisation hadnot been recommei^ ^3W QL for inclusion in the programme.   The saleof the National BiisXjp^kany would produce up to  150 million in theyear of sale, but the^^as not room for this legislation in theprogramme for the cuir mt)JSession.h. There might be neeei^rxy^a Bill to prevent personation inelections in Northern IrebtfjAI    It had been reported that up to25 per cent of the Sinn Feirr^^CT? had come from personation. Changesin election procedures in the Ufl&gt;^ d Kingdom as a whole were beingconsidered but would not be rs^dy/ or introduction in this Session.i. The Tourism (Overseas Promoxiwj^Scotland) Bill had not beenrecommended by QL.    It would be a vahpfft measure arising from acommitment in the Scottish ManifestNX and would be generally welcomed.The possibility of adding this Bill to the programme might be leftopen, although it&apos;might be decided to legislate on a Great Britainbasis in a future Session.The Cabinet - ^^(^O)1.

I    secret    | h% I.^UbI^^ T^e Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of thet f      Exchequer (C(83) 21) on public expenditure in 1983-84.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that public expenditurewas running well ahead of the figures published in the White Paper^R^^the Government&apos;s Expenditure Plans (Cmnd 8789). Demand-relatedprogrammes - particularly agricultural support and social security^Kwits - were growing rapidly.   Local authority currentexpenditure and borrowing by the nationalised industries werelikely to be higher than envisaged.    Expenditure on cash-limitedprogrammes was running ahead of profile;    although the limits werenot expected to be exceeded, it was now estimated that shortfallwas likel]^%D be only about  600 million instead of the  1,200 millionassumed ^Jraad 8789.    These developments were reflected in highrates of public borrowing.   The central Government borrowingrequiremenlfc^^^he first quarter of 1983-84 would be published on11 July.    ItTj^^^ikely to be about  5,400 million, nearly one halfof the amount^^yjg^ged at the time of the Budget for the whole year.The public sect^^jrrowing requirement was running in a similarway.    The marketsJ^j^l react adversely to the publication of thesestatistics, and LrJ^^^fc    rates would rise, unless the Governmenttook early correcti^p a^^.on.   An increase in interest rates wouldhave serious implicati^l^^for economic recovery and the Government&apos;sstrategy.    Action was therefore required to bring public expenditureback within the planned total.    The Ministers responsible for demand-determined programmes should consider what action they could taketo correct the increases now emerging.    It would be necessary tosupplement this by action on ^^^limits.    He proposed that thenon-pay element of all centramA^Mrnment cash limits should bereduced by 2 per cent and the elements for pay and generaladministrative expenditure by 1 W^^t.    Action on the pay elementswas necessary in order to ensure t^^c^wie whole burden of thenecessary adjustments did not fall ^fcfljk provis ion of services andprivate sector suppliers;   but it was necessary to take account ofthe pressures on the pay side from the Government&apos;s previous decisionto finance the non-industrial Civil Ser^R^%ay increase from theoriginal provision.    The external financing Amits (EFLs) of thenationalised industries should be reduced j^^fferegate by 2 per cent;the reduction should be allocated in proportion to turnover. TheRate Support Grant should be excluded, as should local authoritycapital expenditure.    To help Departments manage their programmesmore efficiently, and to reduce the customary surge in expenditureat the end of the financial year, which had probably Jfcatributed tothe present problem, he proposed that a scheme of dBA^ar flexibility,broadly on the lines described in the note by of f ic^ffiMLrculated tothe Cabinet by the previous Chief Secretary, Treasury^J^^T coverof C(82) 29, should be introduced. It should apply only^j^^krryforward of underspending, and to central Government capi^j^^jdequivalent programmes.As an alternative to these proposals he had considered usin^; theregulator&quot; to increase indirect taxation.    In his view, this ^plAbemistaken.    The markets would be concerned if overruns in publicexpenditure were accepted.    Higher taxation would imperil economicrecovery.6^^^^^^ |    secret    | ^ g ^
I    secret    | h&amp; IThe proposed reductions in cash limits and EFLs should save about^^kV  500 million in the current year.    The scheme of end-year flexibilityshould save a further  100 million, though it would tend to increaseM        expenditure in later years.    He also intended to increase the^^^^L     programme of disposals of public sector assets with a view toraising a further  500 million.    This would produce a package of|^over  1 billion, apart from any savings that could be found in^^^memand-determined programmes.    In his judgment,  the markets would? ^Jteard this as adequate.    It would be presented, not as a reduction^Ki&apos;public expenditure, but as evidence of the Government&apos;sdetermination to hold to the expenditure figures which they hadpreviously published.   He proposed to announce the Government&apos;s decisionsin general terms that afternoon;    it would be important to followthem up as soon as possible with a more detailed statement of thechanges^^^.ndividual cash limits.The present problem arose in part because of unreliability inf orecasts^^^^es of spending, especially towards the end of thefinancial yeJ^r^^Detailed proposals would be put forward at officiallevel for imp^fcyjifce the flow of financial information from departmentsto the Treasur^^V^k hoped his colleagues would give those proposalstheir support, fIn discussion, some^tinj^ers queried the case for action on the linesproposed in C(83) 21^^TT the loss of control of public expenditurewas serious, the savings proposed might be inadequate to restoreconfidence.    If it was not serious, the financial gains from theproposals might be outweighed by the political penalties.    Against thatthere was a wide measure of agreement that it was vital to doeverything possible to prevengj^Mgher interest rates, which wouldjeopardise economic recovery.    The Government&apos;s credibility dependedon its maintaining firm control of public expenditura.    Although theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s pr^ra0|Ls would create difficultiesin some areas, the alternatives *early worse:    in particular,it would be wrong to increase taxaWkn^^In further discussion, the following p^^M^were made:a. It was regrettable that the CaWne^jhad been askedto take decisions at such short notic^^rhe Cabinet hadbeen put in a very difficult position by the reports inthe newspapers that morning, which would have createdexpectations that it would be dangerous to disappoint.Whatever the source, the unauthorised disclosure^on whichthose reports were based were much to be deplcj^Bm None-theless, even if those reports had not appeared,imminent publication of unfavourable borrowing ^dtv^? wouldhave made some action necessary. ^2^^b. Although the need for speedy action was undenia%kg^^Lta                                          was unsatisfactory that C(83)  21 did not include importantitems of information which were relevant to the Cabine^^^W? discussion.    Much of this information had presumably bee^^m^kavailable to the Treasury for some time.   Ministers ^^JWcollectively should be kept informed of the economic situat^RTas it developed.7qsecrej_j
I    secret    | h^^^[L c.      It would be important in public presentationof the Government&apos;s decisions to avoid any impression^0^^ that there was a crisis.    The appropriate stance was^  # that the Government was taking corrective action in^^flfl^ good time in order to make savings to prevent athreatened overrun in public expenditure and so adhere^gWWw^        t0 Its previously published figures.? d.     It would be important for the management ofexpenditure programmes to have some flexibility toallocate the total savings required between cash limitswithin programmes.    There might also be a case forallowing some limited flexibility as between cash-limitedand non-cash-limited expenditure.&quot;e.^J^^^ould be important to avoid any suggestion thatcertain programmes were being singled out for largerreduc%yro ^han others:    the reductions should apply ona simiYi^rtrais, as proposed in C(83)  21,  to all cash-limit ed^^oa^kmmes .THE PRIME MINIST^Bikmming up the discussion, said that theopinion in the Cabinet was in overwhelming agreement with theChancellor of the B^chcJ^er&apos;s proposals.    It was a matter for thegravest concern that^Ktmsive indications of those proposals hadappeared in the press:    it was vital to maintain the confidentialityof the Cabinet&apos;s discussions and to observe instructions regardingthe handling of Cabinet documents.    The Chancellor of the Exchequershould announce the Government &quot;^.decisions, in general terms, by aParliamentary statement that |Afnoon.    This should include anindication, also in general terms, of the Government&apos;s intention toincrease the disposal programme by some  500 million:    the overallpackage would then be of a suffi^ag|^ize to  reassure the markets.It should not be presented as a paKagB of cuts in expenditure butas a package of savings to contain^fco^^pective overrun of publicexpenditure in order to remain withi!^m*previously publishedexpenditure totals.    Ministers respons^K^ltpr spending programmesshould now agree detailed reductions wi^^%U%kChief Secretary,Treasury:    the resulting figures should WjJJLished as soon aspossible.    So long as the general pattern d^^reductions within eachprogramme conformed to the approach described in C(83) 21, somemeasure of flexibility between individual cash limits and betweenpay and non-pay elements would be acceptable.    The possibility ofreductions in non-cash-limited expenditure to replace^reductions incash limits was not wholly excluded;    but there weij|Vviousdifficulties in substitutions of this sort;    and th^Jpy^for eachwould need to be fully made out.    In no circumstances shoved anyproposed reduction require new primary legislation. ^^^1^^ The Cabinet - ^^^^1. Approved the proposals in C(83)  21, subject to the^&amp;flksy made by the Prime Minister in her summing up.2.

^ I CONFIDENTIAL ]JJV^^-RI2S       6.      THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that, following the Cabinet&apos;s discussion&apos; &apos;^Cftf0^\Y        C^e Previ us week, he had conducted soundings of all parties aboutv^A\        Report No 20 of the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) on Parliamentary?raViQ     sO anc* aii wances5    che Chief Whip had also carried out extensive&amp;8fete ^&apos;Oy^\   soundings among the Government&apos;s backbench supporters.    It wasfc(83) desirable to devise a response to the Report which would be consistentCohm   . 3^--^x^with the Prime Minister&apos;s statement to the House of Commons on^ucgSl0ns&apos;YO^^s ^a^ indicating chat the salary increases proposed by theX^^SSRB were far too high, but which would also command sufficient supportaj^che House of Commons.    To meet these requirements the response^hojA^in his view contain the following elements:    acceptance of theTSBS&apos;s^recommendations on allowances;    acceptance of the proposalfor&lt; ^ d5^:er accrual rate for Parliamentary pensions- but with anincre^2/in the contribution from 6 per cent to 9 per cent ratherthan 8vp^!r cent as proposed by the TSRB;    and a salary increase of10 per aant compared with the increase of 31 per cent recommended bythe TSRB.    If the same 10 per cent increase applied to the salariesof Ministers and other office holders, it could be demonstrated thatCabinet Minis te^Nhad foregone 4/5ths of the increase of 47 per centwhich the TSRB[/nad)jrecommended for them.    There was a good prospectthat proposalsXJav^S^se lines-could be carried in the House of Commons.The Chief Whip&apos;sf^oundings suggested that it would be much lesslikely that the Govexfment would be able to carry a motion for asalary increase of mw^. per cent.In discussion the foiraw W&gt;nain points were made -a. The soundings IreqCak^n place before che&apos;sCacement onpublic expenditure wh^r^^hNa Chancellor of the Exchequer would bemaking that af ternoon. \\Itv&gt;^he light of that statement there mightbe a greater readiness on^^le/oart of the Government&apos;s backbenchsupporters to accept an inzt^e-a^. of 4 per cent.b. It might be better for tne/yovernment to accept defeat ona motion for a 4 per cent incn^$5 ^rather than to be identifiedwith a proposal for an increase^aVh^gh as  10 per cent;    on theother hand, if implementation offull TSRB recommendationswas secured through the votes of Ch# Government&apos;s own backbenchsupporters, it would-be difficult for the Government Co discanceicself from Chis ouccome.c. Ic was likely chat there would be ailuof social Labour Partyamendment calling for full implement at ion rr^f?te TSRB&apos;srecommendations.    It was not clear what woulu_^ajroen if both thisamendment and the Government&apos;s substantive motiaVyare defeated.Much would depend on what other amendments were/gu^down and thearrangements for voting on them. &lt;/V&gt; &gt;-\d. Acceptance of the proposed 4 per cent salary wx rlf^e mightI                                        be made easier if Che Government accepted the TSRB r^&amp;eraj^ndationfor an increase in pension contributions of only 2 per&lt;^s*ic^this would however have undesirable repercussions on tn^fcavprnment&apos; st mA efforts Co secure more realiscic pension conCributions in^tfj^Xf public sector.._&apos; %\CONFIDENTIAL ^
^ [confidential!e.      Junior Ministers in the House of Lords had to makeCol/\ considerable financial sacrifices in accepting Ministerial(//\ office because they did not, unlike their Commons colleagues,Co^o receive 58 per cent of the Parliamentary salary;    it might//y\ therefore be desirable to find a way of increasing their salaries\S^J\ ky more than 4 per cent.^/^WTHE prime minister, summing up the discussion, said that it was agreed\\ Yx^iat the Government should accept all the recommendations in&lt;x/%^b Report No 20 except those relating to salary increases. In(j&gt;a&apos;r lcular the increase in the pension contribution should be 2 per centa^aC^e^ommended by the TSRB.
