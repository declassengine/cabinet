CONFIDENTIALAFpLlA*&gt;&apos;I-ENTARY    1 .     Tne Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the*^ House of Commons during the following week.Ad!Stl nS on     111E PRIME MINISTER said that it seemed unnecessary to haveD3ys rnraent       Question Time in the House of Commons on the days on which the Houseadjourned for the Easter and other Recesses.    It would be helpful ifsoundings could be taken of the Opposition parties on the possibilityof changing the practice for the future.The Cabinet -1.      Invited the Lord President of the Council, inconsultation with the Parliamentary Secretary, Treasury,to hold consultations through the usual channels on thepossibility of dispensing with Questions for oral answeron the days on which the House of Commons adjourned for theEaster, Spring Bank Holiday, Summer and Christmas Recesses.LawEnf0r THE HOME SECRETARY said that there was an increasing tendency in theement       Press and elsewhere to attack the Government both for alleged inadequacy inlaw enforcement and for seeking the powers needed for the effectivecombatting of crime.     He was likely to face further ill-informed criticismon the interception of telephone calls during the proceedings onthe Telecommunications Bill in the following week and the BritishMedical Association (BMA) were continuing their campaign against thenew disclosure provisions of the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill.The Bill already provided for medical records to be made availableto the police only after a successful application by a senior policeofficer to a circuit judge.     The medical profession were nowdemanding that the application should be to a High Court judge.The Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice had confirmed that thiswould involve serious practical difficulties and in any case theimplied lack of confidence in circuit judges was unacceptable. Theneed for the disclosure provisions could be substantiated by theconsiderable volume of evidence in his possession of deliberateobstruction of police investigations by individual doctors, and hewas prepared to consider making this publicly available if the BMAdid not adopt a more reasonable attitude;    but he hoped that acompromise would be reached.      In the meantime, the Government Whips&apos;Office had sent briefing on the point to all Conservative Members ofParliament to ensure that there was no misunderstanding of theGovernment&apos;s position.     When the passage of the Police and CriminalEvidence Bill through the Commons had been completed, it might beworth considering an approach to editors to point out the inconsistentstance    of many newspapers on law enforcement matters.The Cabinet -2.      Took note. ,1CONFIDENTIAL^_ tos M
CONFIDENTIALAFF\tgn- 2-      THE MINISTER 0F STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE (MR HURD). said that Britain&apos;s position in the Middle East had improved as aresult of the visit to London of the Arab League delegation headed bye East       King Hussein of Jordan which had taken place on 18 March. The&apos; Pre . European Council&apos;s statement on the Middle East issued in Brusselsftej   0Us on 21 March should also contribute to good relations between BritainCc(o^?nce: and the Arab countries without creating difficulties with Israel.ConM .0thThere was a good deal of ground to be made up with the Arab countries,MlUtjj s*0ns&gt;     especially on defence sales, over the next few weeks.    The Foreigne 2 and Commonwealth Secretary would shortly be visiting Saudi Arabia,and the Secretaries of State for Energy and Trade were alsocontemplating visits to Arab countries before long.     On theArab/Israel problem King Hussein was not yet in a position to cometo the negotiating table because he had insufficient cover from hisArab partners;    and the United States was not yet prepared to bringpressure to bear on Israel to halt its settlements on the West Bank.THE PRIME MINISTER confirmed that the talks with the Arab Leaguedelegation had gone off well, and its members had spoken in reasonableterms.    But the Arab countries had no confidence that the United StatesAdministration was pursuing President Reagan&apos;s peace proposals withsufficient urgency.    King Hussein felt that he was receivinginsufficient support from moderate Arab Governments and wanted to enterinto negotiations supported by a representative of the Palestinianswho was not a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation.King Hussein had said that progress was held up because thePalestinians were waiting for a signal that the United States wouldprevent further Israeli settlements on the West Bank, while Washingtonwas waiting for a signal that King Hussein was ready to enter intonegotiations.      The European Council&apos;s statement set out theconclusions of the participants on the Arab/Israel    problem in aneven-handed way.    It was necessary to impress on the United StatesAdministration the need for urgency in pursuing a settlement of theMiddle East problem.     Meanwhile the United Kingdom&apos;s relations withthe Arab world were back on course, and relations with Israel hadnot been damaged.*ittlbabve      . . . mmTHE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE, said thatt&gt; .....vious two-thirds of Zimbabwe was calm and the indiscriminate killings by^6fereti^ security forces in Matabeleland appeared to have come to an end.r*(83) But dissidents were still active in the area and had lately beenw^lus&quot; attacking Whites.     The British High Commissioner at Harare had askedute 2 nS&apos;       tbe Zimbabwean Government for a briefing on the situation and for anassurance of protection for British nationals.    The decision of theZimbabwe Opposition Leader, Mr Joshua Nkomo, to leave Zimbabwe wouldprobably encourage the Prime Minister, Mr Mugabe, to move furtherin the direction of one-party rule.    Mr Nkomo had so far maintaineda reasonably low profile during his stay in the United Kingdom, wherethe Government had had no formal contacts with him.2^ CONFIDENTIAL . A n^___ 106
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER said that President Kaunda of Zambia had told her&apos; &apos; the previous day that there could be no prospect of reconciliationbetween the conflicting parties in Zimbabwe unless Mr Nkomo returnedto.the country.     President Kaunda was trying to pass a messageto- this effect to him through the Commonwealth Secretary General.There was little doubt that his life might be in danger if he returned,and it would be reasonable for him to seek protection from theZimbabwe Government.      She noted that the Foreign and Commonwealth Officewould be investigating the possibility of the CommonwealthSecretary General negotiating Mr Nkomo&apos;s return to Zimbabwe on thebasis of adequate guarantees of his security from the ZimbabweGovernment.      It would be undesirable for the British Government tohave to extend the one month period for which Mr Nkomo had been givenpermission to remain in the United Kingdom.&apos;Ial5ysi, ^1d THE PRIME MINISTER   said that as a result of a very successful privatePrevi visit to London by the Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr Mahathir, thereRefe    s had been a notable improvement in relations between the United KingdomCC(83) anc^ Malaysia.     Dr Mahathir had been treated with the importance due&apos;-oriel   l^tb        to his position as Head of Government of a friendly partner country.Hinut^S^0ns&gt;       It had been agreed that the relationship between the United Kingdomand Malaysia should be on the basis of a partnership of equals.One of the lessons to be drawn was the importance of accordingappropriately high level treatment to visiting Ministers fromCommonwealth and foreign countries. ibraltardr THE PRIME MINISTER said that the talks on Gibraltar which she and thePtevi0us Foreign*and Commonwealth Secretary had had with the Spanish^ erenc Foreign Minister, Senor Moran, in London earlier that month had been^3) in particularly difficult.    It had become clear that the Spanish Government&apos;s.^ nclu . was to renegotiate the terms of the Lisbon Agreement which it wasMitiutg 2 nS&apos;       claiming was without obligatory provisions and was not a treaty. Ithad been made clear to Senor Moran that Britain regarded the Agreementas binding and was prepared to implement it.    It would be necessaryto stand firm on this position.     Meanwhile it seemed unlikely thatthe frontier between Gibraltar and Spain would be opened completely.This was regrettable, since the present arrangement benefitted Spainat the expense of Gibraltar.      She noted that the Governor of Gibraltarwould be returning to London shortly for consultation and thatHer Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Madrid had been instructed to explainto King Juan Carlos and to the Prime Minister of Spain, Senor Gonzalez,the reasons why Spain should not resile from the Lisbon Agreement.sUrids THE PRIME MINISTER said that the application from an Argentine citizen. called Destefanis to take a party of alleged next-of-kin of Argentinej^evious soldiers buried on the Falklands to the Islands at the same time as aC^fitence- party of British next-of-kin were due to go there via Uruguay wasC     ) 8th presenting difficult problems.     The application had been made through i,,0riclusio t*ie International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) , but many of the&apos;^ut,^, deta ils were still obscure, and efforts were being made through the .3
CONFIDENTIALIHICRC to find out more about the background.     Destefanis claimedto have no direct connection with the Argentine Government and hispapers were not fully in order.      The Civil Commissioner in theFalkland Islands, Sir Rex Hunt, believed that the Islanders wouldbe&apos; opposed to the visit by the Destefanis group, but if the membersof the group were genuine next-of-kin it would be difficult to seekto prevent them visiting the graves of Argentine dead in theFalkland Islands under ICRC supervision.Ite n Atlantic    THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the recent six-monthly0r&amp;   J meeting of the Nuclear Planning Group (NPG) of the North Atlanticlsation       Treaty Organisation (NATO)  in Portugal had passed off uneventfully.Progress on implementing both tracks of the North Atlantic Council&apos;sdecision of December 1979 (pursuit of arms control negotiationsand readiness to deploy Pershing lis and cruise missiles inWestern Europe if the negotiations made insufficient progress) wassatisfactory.     A working group of the NPG was due to report nextOctober on the number of warheads allocated to NATO nuclear forceswhich were already deployed in Europe, with a view to seeing whetherthere was scope to withdraw more than the 572 warheads which were dueto be withdrawn when the Pershing lis and cruise missiles were deployed.The Cabinet -Took note.i4
I CONFIDENTIAL^Fair1^ 3&quot; PRIME MINISTER said that the United Kingdom had done a gooddeal of preparatory work for the discussion of budgetary problems at! Comn.   . the European Council on 21-22 March.      She had invited the Presidentl ^Ut-getlt^&apos;  ^ tbe Commission, Monsieur Thorn, for a working dinner in Londonwhen it was clear that the Commission were not making adequatePrev- efforts to prepare for discussion of the issue at the Council. HeRefpl0US had taken the view that the European Parliament wanted a long-term??CC(83) settlement and that the Commission could do nothing about theConcju kth interim period until at least an outline of that had been agreed.^nuteSl nS&gt; nad Pointed out that the United Kingdom had been promised anarrangement for 1983 by November 1982, that the United Kingdom hadnever previously had to wait beyond May for a settlement and that itwas essential, both for political reasons and so that provision couldbe made in the 1984 Community budget, for an agreement to be reachedin June.      She had subsequently reinforced this message with theFederal Chancellor, Dr Kohl.     At the European Council itself, aftera difficult first day, the United Kingdom had done better than mighthave been expected.      Dr Kohl had been a strong and effectiveChairman, and the German Presidency had tabled some helpful draftconclusions.    President Mitterrand had not played a substantial partin the proceedings, no doubt because his attention was concentratedon France&apos;s domestic political and economic problems, and reservationsby Denmark, Greece and Ireland about a reference to budgetary imbalanceshad not affected the final result.     The Council of Ministers(Foreign Affairs) had been instructed to examine specific proposalsfrom the Commission on the future financing of the Community, includinga lasting solution to our budget problem, and to report back to theEuropean Council in June, and to take decisions on an interim solutionfor the United Kingdom for 1983 and later and report these to theEuropean Council in June.    It had been agreed that provision for the1983 rejrunds would be incorporated in the draft Community budget for1984.      The negotiations to achieve a settlement in June were stillgoing to be very difficult, but the formula used for the 1980 to 1982refunds was perfectly good, and the real argument would be over amounts.Tnetar THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the dispute about the^stern realignment of currencies within the European Monetary System duringthe weekend of  19-21 March had been over the distribution of thePtevious desired gap between the Gei-man mark and the French franc, rather thaneferenc t over the size of the gap itself.     There had been considerable tension^(82) 2/,&apos; between the French and German representatives, and at one point the\|?tlclusi0 atmosphere had become very difficult, with France threatening toute a    S&apos;       introduce widespread protectionist measures if an arrangement,satisfactory to them, could not be obtained.     Agreement had finallybeen achieved when he and Commissioner Ortoli had held separatebilateral consultations with the French and the Germans.     The FrenchFinance Minister, Monsieur Delors, had explained that the FrenchGovernment was determined to continue the fight against inflation,and needed the help which a modest devaluation of the French francwould afford in dealing with France&apos;s large balance of paymentsdeficit;    the Government were proposing measures designed to eliminatethe deficit within two years.    The recent decline    in   the value ofCONFIDENTIAL1 .iKwi&apos;A HUH  iwiilTT %
CONFIDENTIALsterling against the United States dollar was due largely to asubstantial strengthening of the dollar, although the fall of oilprices and uncertainties about the outcome of the nextGeneral Election had also affected the rise in recent weeks. Overthe last four years sterling had declined against the dollar butnot against European currencies.      Since March 1979, when theEuropean Monetary System had started, the value of sterling againstall other reference currencies, taking 1975 as 100, had risen from83 in March 1979 to 103 at its peak, and had fallen to 78 today.The corresponding figure for sterling against the dollar had been92 in March 1979,  109 at its peak, and was 69 in February. Againstthe European Monetary System currencies it had been at 84 inMarch 1979,  111 at the peak, and was at 94 in February.     Only theDutch guilder (plus 3 per cent) and the German mark (plus 7 per cent)had increased in value against sterling since March 1979; theFrench franc was down by 22 per cent, and the Italian lire and theIrish punt by even more.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet would wish to congratulatethe Chancellor of the Exchequer on the leading role he had played insecuring a satisfactory settlement.&apos;383 ilgSfarm pr. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD reported that the&quot;&apos;loti   ^6 three day meeting of the Council of Ministers  (Agriculture) whichatlons       nad originally been scheduled for 28-30 March to reach a settlement?revi0us  ^ tne 1983 price fixing would now be restricted to 28 March as a^eferen result of Ministerial changes in Germany and France.    The successor^(83) to the German Minister, Herr Ertl, was likely to be Herr Kiechle,^hclu . a Bavarian dairy farmer, who had previously criticised Herr Ertl^iriutg 3 nS&apos;       as not standing up strongly enough for the interests of Germanfarmers.    Madame Cresson&apos;s successor in France was Monsieur MichelRocard, who had been Monsieur Mitterrand&apos;s rival for the Socialistnomination for the Presidency.     He was hoping to have bilateralmeetings with both new Ministers shortly.    Their appointments mightwell mean, however, that this year&apos;s farm price settlement would bedelayed until May.steel |HTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTY reported that the previous dayD^ious he had finally obtained the Commission&apos;s agreement to a further^efereriCet instalment of Government support for the British Steel Corporation.C    2) 51 g The difficulties had been primarily created by the Commission&apos;sw?tlclusi St        adverse reaction to the announcement that Ravenscraig would not be&apos;ltlute 3   S&apos;       closed.    The presentation of any further announcements of this kindwould therefore need to be very carefully handled.i6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALVisu o&apos;fCommis SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT reported that he had invitedRicjlar^loner       Commissioner Richard to the United Kingdom for a discussion ofemployment and social affairs.     He had made very clear theUnited Kingdom&apos;s doubts about the Fifth Company Law Directive andthe Vredeling Directive.      Positions had, however, been closer onthe reform of the Social Fund, and he saw prospects of reaching an vagreement on this satisfactory to the United Kingdom during theFrench Presidency in the first half of 1984.The Cabinet -Took note.^AlRs THE SECRETARY 0F STATE FOR TRADE said that the trade figures forFebruary, which would be published that afternoon, were significantlyTrade p* better than those for the previous month.     They would show a deficit^-gures     on visible trade of only  138 million, as compared to  491 million^tevious *&quot;l&gt; ^anuarY  anc^ a surplus  n current account of  42 million, as againstSerene 3 ^e^:&apos;-c^t  ^ ^311 million in January.     Total imports had beenCC( 3) ,e&quot; marginally lower than in January, and there had been a big improvementCor,cl    . n in exports of non-oil goods,v- iUsions,In discussion it was suggested that a major factor in the adverseJanuary figures had been an increase in imports in that month.    In partthis might have been due to manufacturers rebuilding their stocks afterhaving run them down in order to get their end-year balance sheetsright.    It was noted that imports of basic materials had increased2i per cent in February, which was in line with the more favourabletrend in manufacturing production in January.      It was also noted thatSir Ian Gilmour MP had been incorrect in his reference to the balanceof payments position on manufactured goods during the Budget debatein the Commons;    the Secretary of State for Industry was planning towrite to Sir Ian Gilmour to set the record straight.HCes THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that his objective was to inject!reviou increased stability into the oil market.     The recent agreement by theeferen Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was being viewedp^83) c : with some scepticism, though it was in fact holding up reasonably wellw?nclus&apos; so ^av .    A recent statement by the new United States Energy Secretaryute 4 nS&apos;       predicting a further sharp fall in price had been unhelpful;   he had,however, subsequently acknowledged this, and it was hoped that futurecomments from the United States would be more statesmanlike.      The recentaction by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in under-cuttingOPEC&apos;s price had also put a strain on the market.     He had recentlyseen Sheikh Yamani, who realised that there would have to be a changeby the British National Oil Corporation (BNOC)  in the price for oilfrom the United Kingdom continental shelf, and he had told him that he7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL, &apos; hoped to hold the present price as long as possible this month.In practice there would need before the end of the month to bethe minimum reduction consistent with selling North Sea oil. Hewould be seeing BNOC next week to work out what the change wouldhave to be.    In the longer term the prospect was for continueduncertainty during the difficult summer period, when demand was weak,and the market was unlikely to firm up before the autumn.In discussion, the following main points were made -a. The Russian action was likely to have been motivatedprimarily by a need for hard currency but perhaps also by anopportunistic perception of the possibility of politicaldisruption.b. While it was inevitable that the United Kingdom&apos;s greatersecurity of oil supplies should affect the parity of sterling,the balance of payments, and the revenue, it would bedesirable, if possible, to discourage the widespread beliefthat the pound was a petro-currency.     Attention could be drawnto the fact that the revenue from North Sea oil representedonly 5 per cent of the Gross National Product.ADCASTING       5.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT said that theIndependent Broadcasting Authority had made it clear to TV-AM thatit was not acceptable to have an active politician as Chief Executiveexcept as a short-term interim arrangement.    Mr Aitken had confirmedthat it was his intention to relinquish the post as soon as a permanentappointment could be made.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office24 March 19838 !|||||CONFIDENTIAL
