~^ [confidential! Hf^^SP 1.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that, y7/&gt; following the discussion by the Cabinet the previous Thursday, the?teViL^o\ Council of the Stock Exchange had now agreed to recommend to their^efv/i        membership certain changes to their rules.   These dealt with three( (83) issues of major concern to the Government:    the rules prescribing^lusi minimum scales of commission would be dismantled by 31 December 1986;&apos;iiiute 4 I^^/\ tne rules prescribing the separation of capacity of brokers and&lt;(^V?vjobbers would, as the Government wished, be continued; and steps\s&gt; y^f&amp;xe. to be taken towards liberalisation of the rules of entry. Inv&apos;^f^turn the Stock Exchange would look to the Government to take action(/wh)&gt;oh would bring an end to the proceedings in the Restrictive^acrpices Court.    On the following day they wished the Governmentto/^K^a statement in the House of Commons which would provide themwitjS^feounds for applying to the Court for a temporary adjournmentof tj^/xr^oceedings for a period of four months.    This would providetime f^jr them to secure the agreement of their members to changesin the whiles.   At that point it would be for the Government to bringan Order before the House exempting the Stock Exchange from theprovisions of.the Restrictive Trade Practices Act.   The StockExchange woul^^tnen make an application to the Court for sine dieadjournment.Earlier that moKn^pg^he had seen the Director General of FairTrading, Sir Gordo^r^p-rsrie, to ascertain whether he would opposethe two applicatior^/CoThe Director General had said that,although he would no^^^se an application for a temporaryadjournment, he would owwe the application for a sine dieadjournment.    In the Di^et^r General&apos;s view an exempting Order,which would not have rerKttspkicN;ive effect, would not relieve himof his statutory obligatic^j^o^mrsue the case in the Courts. Theonly circumstances in which\ &gt;ra/director General would agree to sinedie adjournment would be if tnjeAjJcWernment introduced primarylegislation to exempt the StocxEjrcftange from the ambit of theRestrictive Trade Practices ActJ/^hu?&gt;demonstrating the exceptionalposition of the Stock Exchange.   ^^th^&gt; Director General opposedan application for sine die adjourrahSiAcV^it was not clear what view .the Court would take.    There was a cvp^roerable risk that theproceedings would continue.   He therefore proposed to make astatement in the House of Commons the following day saying that, inthe light of the proposals made by the Council of the StockExchange, the Government would take action to^gxempt the StockExchange from the Restrictive Trade Practice(s^Aqt) either by Orderor by primary legislation. v3^j ^^^^In discussion the following main points were maae-^wa.     It was highly desirable to try and settle^raV^atter outof Court, both to avoid further legal expense and^jaOavoidcontinuing uncertainty.    If the case were to contd^^v\theCourt&apos;s findings would probably be difficult to imWemmt, therewould be disruption in the securities market and the~ ^Vaknmentwould eventually be faced with the need for primary^ confidential \&gt;
^ ICQNFlDENTIALl H^^?\ b.      It would however be a major step for the Government to&lt;y/lly. commit itself, without a very careful examination of theimplications, to the introduction of primary legislation which&lt;^0\^ would exempt the Stock Exchange from the Restrictive Trade^\X&gt; Practices Act.   Although such a Bill would be short, it would&lt;^yyy\ be contentious and might attract criticism from some of thexC^aK Government&apos;s own supporters, especially if, as seemed likely,the Director General of Fair Trading made it clear that\?v &gt;?)       he was not satisfied with the changes in the rules which thexyl y\     Stock Exchange was prepared to introduce.yyS^c.     It was arguable that the proposals made by the Council^//bf the Stock Exchange had not gone far enough in liberalising^/^fRfe rules of entry.THE PxTME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet was not prepared, at this stage at least, to agree thatprimary legislation should be introduced to exempt the StockExchange from the ambit of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act. Itwas neverthel^&amp;Sxdesirable to continue to try and settle the matterout of courtf/ A&lt;? a first step the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry shou^d/m^nye a statement the following day which wouldprovide the baaLi/R an application for a temporary adjournment.The statement snBTi^/npt refer to the possibility of primarylegislation but snou^axsay cba minimum necessary about theGovernment&apos;s intenti^^/S^o ensure that the Stock Exchange wouldmake, and the Director ye^ral of Fair Trading would refrain fromopposing, an applicati^^arer that week for a temporary adjournment.The Secretary of State iS^r&gt;Tj?ade and Industry should urgently preparethe draft of such a stateme^T^n consultation with the AttorneyGeneral.    She would, in con\u^t^tion with other Ministers primarilyconcerned, consider the matt^r^^ther when the draft of thestatement was available. \s s\HThe Cabinet - //^\1. Took note of the Prime Min^srar&apos;s summing up oftheir discussion.2.

The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet&quot;^UtIp (C(83) 28) to which was attached a note by officials on the choice^^SK  ^ a Defence Suppression Weapon for the Royal Air Force.?JP\        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the Royal Air ForceW        needed a missile capable of suppressing the more sophisticated^^^^L     radar-controlled defence systems which were being introduced bythe Soviet Union, in order that the new Tornado aircraft, equipped^F^Lwith the airfield attack weapon JP233, could destroy Warsaw Pact^P^kirf ields.    The requirement was for 750 missiles.    The choice lay? ^l^ween an existing and proved United States missile, HARM, which^^oTld be produced by Texas Instruments in partnership with LucasAerospace, and a new British missile, ALARM, to be developed byBritish Aerospace in conjunction with Marconi Space and DefenceSystems.    Both missiles would be capable of meeting the Royal AirForce&apos;s requirements.    The critical factors determining the choicewere tte^jrservice date (ISD) , the cost, the employmentconsequences and, in his view most important, the effect on thetechnology base in British industry.    The ISD for HARM would beJanuary l^^^fcd the full order for 750 missiles would be completedin early lybj^T^he ISD in the proposed contract for ALARM would beAugust 1987, and deliveries would be completed in September 1989.Ministry of VejKcM of f icials advised that the ALARM programmewould almost certainly suffer some delays; but a delay of up to18 months would s^P|^%Leave completion of the order for 750 missilesno later than voul^bejkchieved with HARM.    British Aerospace hadoffered a fixed pric^^or 97 per cent of the work, subject toincreases due only to inflation.    The company would incur afinancial penalty of  0.4 million if they failed to deliver thefirst 100 missiles on time, and would also incur cost of up to 3 million for each month by wj^Lch the agreed programme wasdelayed.    In the event of th^VBRM programme running into seriousdifficulty, it would take between 6 and 12 months to adapt theTornado to operate HARM, although some minimum capability could beachieved in 6-8 weeks if the Un^ejfl^^tes offered assistancesimilar to that which they had gi&apos;wi  ring the Falklands crisis.There had originally been a wide dif^ejjjc^e in cost between the twosystems, since Texas Instruments had TB^JIble to offer HARM at a 1price which reflected the fact that the^M^d States taxpayerhad already met the initial development ^&apos;SJjJ^ The price for750 missiles had been  254 million for HAM^nd  388 million forALARM; but following press reports of the options both bidders hadrevised their proposals.   British Aerospace had reduced the pricefor 750 missiles so that it exceeded the price for HARM by only 37 million.    Texas Instruments and Lucas had offerej^dditionalhigh technology work for British industry and a hom|tKkead repairdepot in the United Kingdom at an additional cost of  26 million.If these offers were accepted the cost difference between the twosystems was only around  10 million. ^M^^ALARM would generate some 9,400 man years of work in Bri^aj(l^industry, mainly in the London area, the south of EnglandLancashire, with a few jobs in Scotland and Wales.    On the Basisof the latest offer, HARM would generate about 4 ,650 man yearVfcf^kwork, mainly in Lancashire and the West Midlands. ^fc^^3 JUM
|    secret    | hThe most important factor affecting the choice was in his viewkWk technology.   The use of missiles which sought their target through\j *a the characteristics of the target itself was now in the forefrontof the development of warfare,   The United Kingdom could not^^^L afford to be without this technology, and Marconi was the onlyBritish firm with a major capability in this area.    If thiscapability were lost, the United Kingdom would be unable to offera basis for collaboration with the Americans.    To preserve thei^^capability it was necessary to demonstrate that British industry^dVwas able to develop and manufacture complete systems:    it was not.^^s^ficient to show a capability for research and initial development^f^&apos;    There was no guarantee that British firms would participate^Tn the United States HARM programme other than for the small partof it which would meet the British requirement.   He believed,therefore, that the balance of the argument pointed to an earlydecision in favour of ALARM.In disc^^^^i, the following points were made -a. ^^%^e period covered by the Public Expenditure Survey,the ABW^^fccogramme would cost  98 million more than HARM.The def^g^jbjidget would have to absorb this extra cost. Butdefence accounted for  2,300 million of theadditional bids above existing plans which Departments hadproposed for5fche survey period.?b. It was far J0&amp;%- clear how British Aerospace proposed tofinance the ALAM programme.    The latest price quotedappeared to be a loss leader.    It was unlikely that the companywould secure any export orders for the missile. BritishAerospace would seek to recover their money from the Governmentin other ways,    since the^kvernment could not afford, eitheron defence or political ^^ut^s, to allow the company to fail.Participation in HARM would give Lucas a real prospect ofsecuring export orders.c. The arguments for retain^gjAnational base for areas ofdefence technology should be studied interdepartmentallybefore Ministers were faced with further decisions whichinvolved choices between purchasing foreign weapons and enteringinto national development programme^ ^^made no industrialor economic sense for the United KingJ^^%o develop itself thefull range of weapon systems which the Armed Forces required.d. Past experience suggested that British Aerospace couldnot hope to complete the development and production of ALARMin the timescale they had offered.    Nor was the^p^npany likelyto be able to meet any sudden requirement for additionalmissiles, whereas the choice of HARM would give access to alarger supply of missiles available to meet unfo%^^B^requirements.e. The Government would face serious difficulty iftried to justify a decision in favour of the American weaponby casting doubt upon the delivery programme offered by^P^kBritish industry and backed by industry&apos;s own money. ?
