THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the general~~-C^v\        Western reaction to the shooting down by the Soviet Union of a KoreanKoreail^\^/\      civil airliner in August had been to see the incident as revealingI ^rUn   &lt;^^  \   t^e true nature  f tne Soviet system, while at the same timer &lt;(/))   recognising the need to continue with efforts to reduce East-West\^VX\tension.    The President of the United States, Mr Reagan, had allowed&lt;^A/%nns control negotiations to proceed, but had sought the widest^ &gt;&lt; c^ssible international backing for condemnation of the Soviet action.&quot;v/T^eOBritish Government shared this approach and was actively(s^j^rting moves by the Korean Government in the International CivilAv^ftrjki Organisation (ICAO) and the Security Council of theUnitizations to obtain an independent investigation into theincirl^tfj^r   to secure compensation for the victims, punishment ofthose ^es^ansible and an apology from the Soviet Union;   and to bringabout (granges in rules and practices so as to prevent any recurrence.Despite the refusal of France, Greece and Turkey to take part, aclear majority of Western countries had agreed to ban commercialflights betweenjtheir countries and the Soviet Union, and overflightsby Soviet airo^aTtV ,for a period of two weeks.    This was less thanthe United Sta^e^uanted, but represented the widest obtainablemeasure of agreerfikntu  Vigorous   diplomatic  action had succeededin mustering theMjec^s^ary nine votes in the Security Council fora resolution which&lt; kfiA pviet Union had been obliged to veto, butthere had once again^w ef\a worrying tendency on the part of neutraland non-aligned count?*e^Tn balance hostility against the Soviet Unionwith a show of hostility/w^he United States.THE PRIME MINISTER, summihgr^^the discussion, noted that before theGovernment&apos;s two week ban o&lt;v1sAr hts to and from the Soviet Unionhad been announced the Britisja/^rlines Pilots Assocation (BALPA)had decided on a 60 day ban, prip^kXy out of legitimate concern forthe safety of crews and passengWs .ANlt was desirable that the banoperated by BALPA should be coter3 fnaH&gt; with that imposed by theGovernment, and it would be necessa^ * lte\ consider how best to bringthis about.    Internationally the ma?nXWjjective must be to p&apos;ressfor an apology and compensation by th4^S^viet Union and to.securechanges in Soviet regulations and practices which would prevent anyrecurrence of the incident.The Cabinet - x-N1.

They believed thatMr Andropov, who had himself served in Hungary, would not overlook^?CO\       the lessons of the Hungarian experience for the Soviet economy.^/p&gt;     On foreign affairs they had stuck closely to the Soviet line, buthe had been able to put the Western case across to them on a number f major issues including disarmament and the Korean airliner. The^--^Vvtate of play on the proposal for a trade agreement between HungaryxCva^d the European Community was due to be considered further at the^^pjtKt meeting of the Community Council of Ministers, but it would beavptttult to find ways of admitting Hungarian products into theGomjHtJjv^ty without damage to the industrial interests of the memberco^tr^s.% ITHE FORE^N AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the militaryPrevi0u situation in the Lebanon had not changed significantly since the^e erenS various militias had moved to occupy ground vacated by the Israelis.CC(83) 2ft: T^e Le^anese Arwj^was holding up better than expected and had notCoticiu . been dislodgednfro^) -a number of vital positions around Beirut.Hinute 2 ns&apos;       Intensive attemp^ba^S^re being made at mediation in which Saudi Arabiawas now participating 1!   and President Reagan&apos;s Special Representative,Mr McFarlane, was\fervfyyng hard to find the basis for a cease-fire.The Minister of StareY/jjSreign and Commonwealth Office, Mr Luce,was due back later tr^v^ea\ from a visit to Beirut, and his reportwould be very relevantrti^cfecisions about the future of the British. element in the Multinati^HM^\Sorce (MNF) - the only contingent ofthe Force which had not ^^f^ysustained casualties.

Western forces could notallow themselves to become a buffer between Israel and Syria. Atthe same time, there was an evident risk that withdrawal couldX^V^recipitate the fall of the Lebanese Government and might seriouslyx^vO^mage relations with the United States.

V-^yV\ElECTORAT &lt;^1i0ABUSE tn The Ca inet considered a mMerandum by the Lord President of the^RTHERN Council (C(83) 29) on electoral ab^s^in Northern Ireland.tRELANL /sL^THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL s^id^fc)iat the increasing use ofpersonation (stealing a vote by preteh lr&gt; &gt; to be a person on theelectoral register and other electorar^malpractices) by ProvisionalSinn Fein in Northern Ireland was reaching dangerous levels. TheSecretary of State for Northern Ireland had put proposals to theHome and Social Affairs Committee for early legislation to introducemeasures aimed at making such abuses more diff^e^it, includingprovision for identification to be required bejEory voting took placeand the indelible marking of thumbs to preventSvyc^ n\ more than once.The Committee had recognised that this was a dif\Mc Zjfe\ problem but hadbeen unable to agree that these proposals were tne^^jt^.answer to itor that early legislation was required.    They also no^^Nthat theHome Secretary was under pressure to legislate on otr^roeiiectoralmatters (votes for holiday makers and Britons living abro^p^ ana&quot;thought that the Secretary of State for Northern Irelan^^/ryquestshould be viewed in this context.   For his own part, the^ar^&gt;Rresidentthought that legislation against electoral abuse in Northeiay^re^andwas necessary but that it should not be introduced in the pl^s^rCt)session, which was already crowded.   He saw advantage in legivldxiftoon both electoral issues in the 1984/85 session, but having tvdy&apos;y\Bills, so that the Northern Irish measure could proceed quickly.,_*-. %\a confidential \v
^ [confidential! H^ I^jLy THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that the securityforces had recently had considerable success against the Provisionalv       Irish Republican Army.    Provisional Sinn Fein, which had many of thesame leaders, was increasingly concentrating its efforts on theYV&apos;y}  political process.   At the recent General Election they had used\^-^/^antimidation and personation on a large scale - probably 25 per cent/&gt;X^ their vote had been personated.    If, by such means, they could\\ VSj^cure more than 50 per cent of the nationalist vote - a possibility&lt;yy^^\ could not be excluded - they would be in a position to destroyRecredentials of the Social Democratic   and Labour Party (SDLP)ai^/t^xlaim that they were the true representatives of tnenati^fiklist minority in Northern Ireland.    This could have verydest^jT^^sing consequences on both sides of the border.   Both theSDLP a^d^tjSe Alliance Party had asked for the electoral law to betighter^Iup.   He still believed that action must be taken quickly,but now thought that he had been mistaken to propose marking ofthumbs as well as proof of identity.   The former would be verystrongly opposed by the civil liberties lobby, and he was notyet satisfied -rfjr~the modalities of its operation.   He was advisedthat the idenuityJpxpvision on its own might reduce personation tosomething like y?pe&quot;rYfcent.   He therefore proposed legislation onthat basis alone V^^iyxin as possible, in order to have the newprovisions in force^^ror/the European elections in June 1984. Hewould like to sound au&amp;Xhe other parties in Parliament with a viewto securing rapid prog^eAswith such a Bill.    If such agreementwas not forthcoming he wp^&gt;d\accept that legislation could not beintroduced until the foT&gt; e&apos;w n)a session.    But even in that case hefelt that it would need ta^^^eparate from any Home Office legislation.The following points were ma^i^discussion -(a) Mr Enoch Powell MP hbstp&amp;i the Prime Ministerthat the Government had unde^ik^ that the next electionfor the European Parliament sM^^be on the same basisthroughout the United Kingdom..Cjfi^assumed that thismeant that the single transferab^e^^re system (STV) would notbe used in Northern Ireland for th^t election.   This wouldrequire legislation.   Members of tne Cabinet could recallno such undertaking.   The Boundary Commissions wereconsidering a realignment of European constituencies withnew ward boundaries in Great Britain, butyt/RiNs would notaffect Northern Ireland for the European\^4ej t-i on, becauseit was a single constituency for that purposje.^J(b) There was considerable pressure for leg fiW^ on onelectoral matters for the United Kingdom as a v^/rw aresult of the recommendations of the Select CommVfo^e^pnHome Affairs.    These matters were to be discussed a^rakParty conference.    If there were to be earlier legislationon   electoral abuse in Northern Ireland, it would be^--y^S.important that a clear statement should be made of theMT\&gt;HsGovernment&apos;s intention to legislate on other electoral \&gt;/^/matters in Great Britain.    So far Ministers had argued tna&amp;^/&lt;\there was no time in the present sesssion for electoral yy\&gt;legislation, but it would be difficult to maintain this &apos;view if legislation for Northern Ireland was introduced. V-&lt;^),_&apos; %&gt; ?v confidential %
^ [confidential!^1 Legislation for Northern Ireland did not sit wellC^y\ with the sort of legislation for the United Kingdom which&lt;^\&gt;/\ tne Home Secretary might introduce.    Two Bills would be/yy\ preferable, and there was a case for their being distanced,&lt;r*/j\ and dealt with in separate sessions.\SS\\&gt;       (d)     The urgency of the Northern Ireland legislation^ Sy)     arose from the date of the European elections and the&lt;^/&gt; possibility that Mr John Hume, the leader of the SDLP,C/^/Vould not otherwise secure re-election.    Conceivably&lt; this^/^wauld occur anyway, because of the way in which the STVXxfould operate.   Other measures to reduce malpractice couldCo^Sibly be explored, for example a requirement to show aI/axjrpnal Insurance number on the electoral registrationTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinetagreed that the_degree of personation and other electoral abuse bythe Provisiona^Sitin Fein in the recent General Election wascompletely unaK epta,b 1 e and that action must be taken.    There could,however, be no gju^rantee that even the Bill now proposed by theSecretary of Sta^e^* pr^ Northern Ireland would have a quick passagethrough Parliament^^oVeA if the Party managers were prepared toagree it.   The Cabine^Weref ore agreed that a separate Bill shouldbe introduced at the &lt;&amp;eg iming of the 1984/85 session.    This wouldgive more time for furth-er^Tfaought about the most effective counter-measures, and could be I^yroYpe in time for the local governmentelections in 1985.    The Holiie^S^cretary should consult colleaguesfurther on what should be sriw^it the forthcoming ConservativeParty Conference about the r^mirar of legislation on electoralreform generally in response zo/f^^\recommendations of the SelectCommittee on Home Affairs.The Cabinet -1. Invited the Secretary of So^j^/tor Northern Irelandto consider further the most effective counter-measuresto personation and to prepare legislation for introductionat the beginning of the 1984/85 session.2.

[confidential!PE^gW/^pCTOR     4.     The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of thev^Yv&gt;        Exchequer (C(83) 30) on public sector pensions.PreviouQ yyReferen  &lt;$V^\ THE CHANCELL0R 0F THE EXCHEQUER said that the Government&apos;s ElectionCC(82) ^an:Lfest0 had stated that public sector pensions would continue toCoUc1 Us Js^--^&lt;^he protected against rising prices on the basis of realisticMinute 4 nS &apos;vTwpJPtributions .   Considerable progress had already been made in thisNy^^wrection:    the notional or actual pension contributions paid by^V/M^emen, firemen, members of the Armed Forces, and Members offerLiament had been raised.    It was now necessary to consider howtc&lt;^pniy the policy to other groups.   His proposals were as follows:.The financing arrangements of public servicep4jw &lt;m schemes should be reformed to bring out more clearlyth^xtotal costs of the benefits provided and how they weresplrx between employer and employee.   Making the PrincipalCivil Service Pension Scheme (PCSPS) contributory was anessential eiement here.(b) Allx^bt-i-c service pension schemes should&apos;be reviewedto settle a/diAtroduce appropriate realistic contributionrates. v^xjO(c) The Gover^p^f&amp;Nshould start from 8 per cent (thecurrent amount d e1m^r&gt;to be paid by civil servants) as the&apos;realistic&apos; contribiiV&amp;x\rate for schemes providing normalaccrual of benefits ^Vih)i|s would entail increases in thepension contributionsVj^x^Xyeral large groups of publicservants, such as scho^V^^achers, staff of the National HealthService, and manual and^rM^ecollar workers in local government.In principle, increases in employe^l^pension contributions wouldproduce significant savings in puvllc/expenditure;, how large thesewere in practice would depend on th^par^icular arrangements thatcould be negotiated in individual serfw^eSy and the effects on paynegotiations.   His proposals related soiy^to public service pensionschemes over which the Government had direct control.   The Governmentdid not have such control over the terms of nationalised industrypension schemes.    It would be necessary to consider how thenationalised industries might be brought to foHww the lead ofthe public services. (( {)If the Cabinet agreed with these proposals, offMia^sshould beinstructed to prepare a detailed programme of acc-tej^atad to reportback to Ministers with specific proposals. TreasuryV/&gt;  icialsshould co-ordinate this work.   When Parliament Tetuw^YwieGovernment should announce its intention to proceed as prpjjjosed inIn discussion the following main points were made - ^vv?Y&gt;(a)     There was general agreement that it was necessary^fcW/^tackle the problem of public service benefits and contribu^o/f^s.But some members of the Cabinet argued that a more fundament^ry^^ ^^^^^^^^ [confidential] &lt;^ I
^ ICONFIDENTIALl H% I&lt;y1 ys. review was necessary than that contemplated in C(83) 30.IJyy^\ The private sector was increasingly coming to doubt whether&lt;^\y\&gt; it was right to base normal pension provision on an annualy//&gt; accrual rate as high as l/60th of final salary;   but private&lt;^yy^s\ sector schemes would not be able to reduce their rates ofSs^yjy^ accrual of benefit unless the public sector gave a lead./y\ The option of reducing public service pension benefits\\v/\        should be considered by Ministers before officials were&lt;y^liy\      instructed to undertake detailed work.    On the other hand,/^/ys.   it was argued that in previous discussions the Cabinet hads^\&gt; taken the view, reflected in the Government&apos;s Election^ .//Manifesto, that it was right to approach the problem, at least&lt; ^&lt;^h the first instance, by seeking to secure adequate employee^M^oirfributions rather than by reducing benefits.^b)     The suggestion that the PCSPS should be madecontributory raised particular problems.    Members of theCivil Service and the Diplomatic Service were deemed to makea total/p^nsion contribution of 8 per cent, and this wastaken fimto(}account in determining their rates of salary.If they^we^evrequired in future to make actual contributionsof a s imiUajyamount, they would expect to see their salariescorrespona^rrtgW increased.    Not only would this raise thebase on whiciy/m^sion benefits were calculated but it wouldalso affect p&lt; y V&amp;^ted allowances and overtime rates.Arrangements to ayjp&gt;d adverse financial effects from thesechanges would be&lt;^0j pAicated and hard to negotiate.    It wasopen to doubt wh&amp; ej?Jthe advantages of making the PCSPScontributory for arT^^h\fits would outweigh the resultingproblems. xO/O(c)     Some public serviz^p^ksion schemes would not be ableto make changes of the sopt/e\wisaged in C(83) 30 withoutprimary legislation.    This&apos;ha^Kimplications for the timescaleon which changes could be im^etC^/THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the V^scussion, said that the Cabinetbroadly approved the principles set c^t in paragraph 3 of C(83) 30.In particular, it was clearly necessary to bring public servicepension benefits and contributions into better balance than was nowgenerally the case;   and an employee contri^h^Kon rate of the orderof 8 per cent seemed reasonable, especially(inv^he light of therecent increase in the pension contributionVT^rraNby Members ofParliament.    The Cabinet were not, however, p^rjjilVd-ed that it wouldbe right to make the PCSPS contributory.    They^Jfetfneeded to considerin more detail how the approach which they favourM/MKprinciplefor other public service pension schemes could be &lt;g rt \fcito practice,and it would not be right to make any announcement of/t k Government&apos;sintentions until this had been done.    In this considera i?ay the scopefor adjustment in benefits need not be entirely ruled \u4V/but theGovernment&apos;s decision on broad policy, reflected in the &gt;femX sto,to proceed by seeking realistic contributions should be r^pp^fr mind.The Chancellor of the Exchequer should now arrange for offvc^i^ toundertake further work as a basis for consideration by Minisy&gt;errs^\._. % II confidential! %

If it couldnot be sustained, its value as a constraining influence on expenditureplans would be much weakened.    A higher Tigure, on the other hand,would be taken as implying that the Government expected a level ofpay settlements much the same as in the previou-e-spay round. Theassumption would determine the provision in taeaggregate pay Billfor 1984-85 and later years for increases in p^3^ra^es and allowancesderiving from settlements up to March 1985.

This wotj &amp;\\produce savings of about  400 million a year.    The Governme\ t\*i/vdecision would need to be disseminated widely for operational^fWsonsand would become public knowledge.

The Government&apos;s decision should beannounced later that day on the lines proposed by the Chief Secretary,Treasury;    it/tfetkkl be desirable also to bring out that higher payincreases woui6 lead to lower employment.
