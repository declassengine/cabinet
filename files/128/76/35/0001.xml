This had arisenlary \&gt;^ama.reports in the press about contact between a senior civil servant anda/afpmber of the judiciary to discuss future legislation.   He had alreadytakeXxv^e matter up with the Minister concerned.   He could not emphasisetoc^strongly that the doctrine of the independence of the judiciaryprecwjiiejEythem from giving advice to the executive about policy proposals.He asKeyoaLk his colleagues to observe this principle for the future.He shouYQ^se consulted in any case of doubt.The Cabinet -1. Took P$E^vEff* 0n THE SECRETARY OF STASK^OR DEFENCE said that the film &quot;The Day After&quot;HUcj   s  f        depicting the effectVyW^vnuclear attack on a small town in Kansas, which4tta6fr was to be shown on ino^^a^nt television between 9.15 pm and 11.30 pm onDecember 10, would attractr^fcdespread Parliamentary and public interest.The film had already beenC^Kptra in the United States, where ithad attracted a very largewu^zence.   At the end of the transmission there,the United States&apos; Secretary &gt;c^s\ate, Mr George Schultz, had given hisGovernment&apos;s point of view. \&amp;.imarll group of Ministers had consideredthe Government&apos;s response to tl^^neying of the film in this country. Theyhad concluded that there could b^&gt;afo^uestion of the film not being shown,and he had already said that people^afwuld watch it.   The group had felt,however, that it would be appropriate/ or the Government to ask for anopportunity to present its case at u^er^nira of the transmission. Hetherefore proposed that he should ask cKfe/T&gt;dependent BroadcastingAuthority (IBA) if he could be interview*! immediately after the film. Thiswould not be a Ministerial broadcast.   H&amp; message would be that theGovernment&apos;s policy of deterrence was designed to prevent, and in fact hadprevented, events of the kind portrayed from happening in reality. TheHome Secretary had indicated that, if the IBA y^fTj^ed this request, hewould be prepared to raise with the IBA whetheKdiey^were fulfillingtheir duty to provide balance.   In addition otherTiSp^ortunities to putacross the Government&apos;s point of view in the mediaJ^-Jmrti before and afterthe film, would be fully exploited.The Cabinet -2.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Sovietdelegation had withdrawn from the Geneva talks on Intermediate RangeNuclear Forces (INF) on 23 November after the West German Parliament hadJld voted in favour of the deployment of Western INF the previous day. LettersC0      vJ^V^S   from the Soviet leader Mr Andropov had been addressed to a number of1 -Western Heads of Government, including the Prime Minister, transmittingpt   .        ;/&lt;\l Soviet statement describing the counter-measures which the Soviet UnionW l0US    vTv^auild be taking in response to Western INF deployment.   These were onCC(R-&gt;\nce:    &lt;yfr^%cte^ lines and suggested some Soviet concern not to provoke furtherC0_      34th      Afegrfcrn counter-measures.   He had seen the American INF negotiator,^in  Usi0ns      nr/Far^J. Nitze, the previous day who did not know whether the Russians weree 2 Iv^ehyto return to the INF negotiations; he thought they might in duecouwJd-^Xftopose a new negotiating framework linking INF with the StrategicArasT oucAions Talks and the Mutual and Balanced Force Reductionsnegotiiu^ons.   Meanwhile the Government would stress that the Sovietwithdrawal from the talks at the first sign of Western deployment .contrasted with the West&apos;s willingness to negotiate with the Soviet Unionon INF throughout the period when the Soviet Union had been deploying itsown INF; and tb^EN:he West remained ready to resume the talks at any time.hcus ^ FOREIGN AND CCWKWVfeALTH SECRETARY said that the United Nationspre . General Assembly resaMtt  m on Cyprus sponsored by the United KingdomW   0us following the unilatewi(c^claration of independence by the Turkish CypriotsCc(g *nce:        had commanded general supj&gt;&lt;j t and helped to contain pressure for economicC0n      34th      sanctions.   Within the ECri^ewi Community, suggestions for economicHin    si ns,     sanctions against Turkey a^d/zhe Turkish area of Cyprus had not been pressede 2 but it had been agreed that&gt;&lt;3raalHjnity aid should be for the benefit ofthe people of Cyprus as a wm&amp;evjORepresentatives of the European Commission Iwould be visiting Nicosia shor^dj^tjv discuss this with the Government ofCyprus.   He had made two approaej&gt;eys^o the Greek Government to take partin tripartite consultations with t^eftkitish and Turkish Governments inaccordance with the 1960 Treaty of G^a^ntee without success; but it waspossible that there might be some cngra&amp;&apos;in the Greek position as a resultof the forthcoming meeting between Pre^ld^t Kyprianou of Cyprus and theGreek Prime Minister, Mr Papandreou.   Meanwhile the Government was urging.the Secretary General of the United Natrons, Senor Perez de Cuellar, toappoint a successor to Dr Gobbi as United Nations Special Representative onCyprus and was encouraging the United States to^use its influence withthe Turks and the Turkish Cypriots to show gre^tesNflexibility. TheCommonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Ne^^jjihd had also set up anaction group on Cyprus, of which the United Kingdaim~&quot;whuld not be a member.It was to be hoped that the group&apos;s efforts would^jj^ranplementary tothose of the Secretary General of the United Nation^^dj&gt;would help todiscourage other Governments from recognising the Tutjf^o^Cypriot state.It would not be in the United Kingdom&apos;s interest to be^o^e^nvolved indetailed mediation between Greece, Turkey and Cyprus. ^y/\? w| confidential! ^

The Minister of\^&amp; ):e, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Mr Luce, would be visiting SyriaC&amp;prt&amp;y.   But the prospects were not hopeful.   Lack of co-ordinationb4*we rv the four countries contributing to the multinational force (MNF)was^arcjxitinuing cause of concern.   The unilateral French decision tofollotf/f^iael1s example in retaliating against terrorist installations inthe BeJu^/valley had particularly upset the Italians, who were pressingfor con^ L irtion between the four contributing Governments.   The fourForeign ministers concerned were likely to meet in the margins of theNorth Atlantic Council meeting in Brussels the following week.   There mightalso be a draft statement about the Lebanon for consideration at theEuropean Counciljaeeting at Athens from 4-6 December.THE SECRETARY O^T&amp;IE FOR DEFENCE said that the British contingent to theMNF was now in a veryjlsolated position.

It had beennecessary to work hard to ensunf/m*^. the Western point of view waseffectively presented.   In the emI^&gt;aftVpite the non-aligned flavour of thelanguage, the communique had been wfoa&amp;y satisfactory both on worldsecurity and on economic issues.   No^^jaBitment had been made either to anew Bretton Woods conference or to trSe^jreedf or new economic institutions.There had been exceptionally bitter deaAt^both on Grenada and on Namibiabut the United Kingdom had not been a main target of criticism.   It hadbeen clear from the discussion on Grenada^that unless United Statesforces were withdrawn from the island as soon as possible there would bedeep disillusionment with the West on the part of- the non-aligned nations.It had been agreed that there should be an exaratnanLon of the securityproblems of small states.   The Prime Minister ooA&gt;tfStralia, Mr Hawke, hadmade effective contributions to the discussions OR^tHe economy, Namibia andthe Middle East.   She had had useful bilateral meetwJ&amp;D with other Headsof Government including the Prime Minister of Zimbal we^dr Mugabe, as aresult of which a number of misunderstandings had beay^rOTttved.

^ [confidential! H% . I^//yy first-hand insight into the preoccupations of a wide range of Governments -(J/yCS.       48 countries had been represented, 33 of them by Heads of Government.C/^^    Although it had gone on too long, it had been an interesting and veryuseful Meeting.\wa      The Cabinet -XWW   Took note.ijNlTY 3.   &lt;;*^F0REIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, reporting on the Special^IRS Councd^^t Ministers of 28-29 November, said that it was not possible toEu say nov^/wh cher an overall agreement would be reached at the EuropeanCQu Pean Council      Athens on 4-6 December.   The most positive aspect was that many4^n51^  f        member stlrtes considered that failure to achieve agreement at Athensecember    would be damaging to credibility and would prejudice the normaldecision-making at the European Community.   On new policies and onstructural fund^Tlvfere were no great problems.   On enlargement, there was Isupport for our\^*i w-&gt;that the accession negotiations should be completedwithin a fairly s|Y$rt)jtimescale.   In the agricultural sector there weredifficult problems&lt;2K^arilk, cereal substitutes and monetary compensatoryamounts but these c *JrLq^bjR resolved if agreement on the whole package wasin sight.   On the con j ^f agricultural and other expenditure a legallybinding guideline on a^cl^uuural spending alone was not negotiable. TheFrench, however, had now ijwjihd a proposal for control of all Communityspending which involved re* nfljthe amount of available revenue beforefixing the expenditure prog&amp;rom&amp;.   If they held on to these ideas, thequestion of control of expen^l^r4. might be manageable.   On the correctionof the budget inequity, progre^sj^had been made towards agreement thatthere had to be permanent correcY/^e&lt;^arrangements on the revenue side.Beyond this, member states were Vlso^ready to solve part of the problembut there would be great difficuley&apos;^ip/^ersuading them to accept that thenet contribution was the real issue&lt;^d^fhat the whole of the problem hadto be solved. X*In discussion it was pointed out that a\ afety net was the essentialprotection against an excessive net contribution by the United Kingdom.The safety net would operate by reducing the amount of Value Added Tax (VAT) Iwhich the United Kingdom contributed to the Comrondty.   It was alsoimportant, however, that the gross contributicc/sh^uld not riseunreasonably and that expenditure decisions shoJiid&lt;5j&gt;t pass unjustifiablyfrom national to Community competence.   For this (rea^An the United Kingdomhad argued and should continue to argue for better-ej^omrol of Communityspending.   It had been made clear at Stuttgart that^rh^^nited Kingdomwould not consider the Community&apos;s requirements for otifrr&amp;kpurces, unlessthe budgetary inequity was corrected and there was an efr^p^ive controlof agricultural and other expenditure.   If unexpectedly &lt;j roSis factorysettlement on the correction of the budget inequity and cOTtroL of spendingwere to emerge at Athens, it would be necessary to consideV^^rtWrease inconfidential] %
^ [confidential! H^/L/y the Community&apos;s own resources by increasing the VAT ceiling.   This would(/.v\     be required in order to pay for the costs of enlargement and, in certain^\yy\    circumstances, to allow the other member states to finance the relief foryyy\ the United Kingdom.   The ceiling might be lifted from 1 per cent to a&lt;(yj) figure of the order of 1.2-1.A per cent.   This would be an increase of\^&gt;v^5-25 per cent in the Community&apos;s total own resources.   If a safety net(Yw&amp;te in place, the actual VAT contribution of the United Kingdom would\&gt;j&gt;^ysubstantially below the ceiling.   If the United Kingdom did not get a^sdLp^u net, there should be no increase in the 1 per cent VAT ceiling.THBC^PkJHP MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that she had laiddown&lt;jPr^a*. conditions at Stuttgart before the United Kingdom would considerthe CSarffiraity&apos;s requirement on own resources.   It remained essential toobtain q/l^sting correction of the budget inequity which took account ofthe Unit&amp;f Kingdom&apos;s excessive net contribution.   It was also necessaryto have effective control of agricultural and other expenditure in theCommunity.   If these conditions were met, the United Kingdom would be&apos;ableto consider a smail increase in the VAT ceiling, particularly since throughthe operation of/ajkafety net the United Kingdom&apos;s contribution of VAT Iwould be substaiitiaiiv below this ceiling.   She would arrange for a shortfact.sheet to be /frculated to members of the Cabinet showing theCommunity&apos;s total ^EE H$ces the estimated increase for each 0.1 per centincrease in the VAT ^Miftg and the United Kingdom&apos;s share of thefinancing. Y^&lt;\\Jjjamity THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHKJIKR^keported that at the Council of MinistersUni?6^ and on 22 November the Economic $V ^ ary, Treasury had been successful in*~ persuading the Community to reoeM/the European Parliament&apos;s proposal to^efu   m put tiie Un*-ted Kingdom&apos;s 1983 rifntfKin the reserve chapter of then&lt;*s 1984 draft budget.

^ [confidential! H^^^AL        4.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the dispute between |J-JL^/X       the National Graphical Association (NGA) and Mr Eddie Shah, who printedNat&quot;  &lt;^\^y     ^ree newsPaPers i-n tne North West of England, was primarily about theGt enforcement of a closed shop   rather than, as had been asserted in theAss   .Cav/nme&lt;^a  about the reinstatement of six workers.   Industrial action takenD:   ClatioK_^/^y the NGA against Mr Shah had been found unlawful by the courts. Thehad ignored an injuction granted to Mr Shah and this had led to fines^A. Mn&lt;ft a sequestration of the NGA&apos;s assets.   A temporary limit placed by the&lt;yaitAy: of the Rolls on the-amount of assets to be sequestered had now beenlAj ee^\although it would be open to the NGA to pursue the question of alimi^M. the court in Manchester.   Meanwhile NGA assets amounting to 2 mii^ion had been identified.   Although the General Secretary of theTrade^Jnftm Congress (TUC) and more moderate members of the TUC GeneralCouncilVpta^&gt;argued that the TUC should exert pressure on the NGA to abideby the c^tfrt ruling and pay the fines, this view had not prevailed. TheNewspaperOPublishers&apos; Association had been divided in their response tothe NGA&apos;s action the previous weekend to stop the publication of nationalnewspapers.   They had however secured interim injunctions and hadpotential claim^P&quot; f they chose to pursue them, of  3 million.   The &apos; IAdvisory, Cone ilia o^an and Arbitration Service (ACAS) had been in closetouch with the NrayanaNMr Shah in recent weeks.   Negotiations about apossible agreemenn^ow^ive basis that a post-entry closed shop would beconceded, that exist^ra/wjrkers who.were not :members of the NGA would notbe required to join, aw xhat the six workers dismissed would be employedin a separate company, ^Hko^wo far been unsuccessful.   Mr Shah might wellfeel, after the extent an^xw^lence of the picketing at Warrington,disinclined to make furtht^e&apos;raorts to seek an accommodation with the NGA.He would be making an appli^epwJH to the courts the following day-aboutthe NGA&apos;s continuing refusal/ra&amp;tesist from unlawful industrial action.THE HOME SECRETARY said that he^fi^^ade a statement in the House ofCommons the previous day about tae^itffton by the police to maintain law andorder at Warrington.   He had made  *c&amp;ar that the Chief Constable ofCheshire had, and would continue to ^rarg^shis full support. Theallegations about methods used by thjS^&amp;tce, for example, in relationto the NGA&apos;s communications van, were ra^wnded, although care had to betaken in dealing with them because of tKjifprocedures relating to complaints.against the police.   He had stressed thatrthe violence that had occurredwas, and always had been,, a breach of the criminal law and that masspicketing was inherently likely to lead to such iiiolence. Similardisturbances might occur on Tuesday of the follpwTnfe week when Mr Shah&apos;snext edition was to be printed and distributed^^JJ^??^ was however thepossibility that the widespread condemnation of thp violence which hadoccurred and the effectiveness of the police actioin^B^reventinginterference with the printing and distribution of M^^mrt^&apos;s newspapermight discourage further mass picketing both in WarriQgwiNand elsewhere.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion said that pjj^^kle oflaw had to be seen to prevail.
