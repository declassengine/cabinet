0 [CONFIDENTIAL! HAFptfW 1-     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the situation inj__7 /&gt;        the Lebanon continued to give cause for serious anxiety.    There wereleh nJ&lt;\\\    w rrying signs of divergence between the positions of the four powers&quot;^N^J^.   contributing units to the Multinational Force (MNF) and in particularI    Prev&apos;   ^v/\vv3etWeen t*16 EuroPean contributors and the United States.    On the ground,r6  el0U \\y)-he Lebanese Army still held Suq el Gharb, but United States naval forces0C(ftT&quot;inc --^^erating under different rules of engagement from the other componentsCorici   7^^KV^ vthe MNF had intervened in defence of the Lebanese Army in a way which^ut^Sl nsAVa^Tiifficult to reconcile with the strictly peacekeeping character ofe 1        rM/^:ce.    Efforts to negotiate a ceasefire continued and Saudi ArabiawaV^pM^ing an active part, but it was difficult to be optimistic aboutthe&lt;^ap^ES of success.   Recent visits to Beirut by the Minister ofState^^^edgn and Commonwealth Office, Mr Luce, and the Minister ofState %^he Armed Forces, Mr Stanley, had confirmed that the Britishcontinge^vp^as highly regarded there and the MNF still had a role toplay.    BuVTthere was an increasing risk of rebel retaliation againstUnited Stares warships leading to progressively greater United Statesinvolvement in the fighting.    Spokesmen for the Labour Party werebeginning to advopa-te the withdrawal of the British contingent and theLeader of the Sc/a^anDemocratic Party, Dr David Owen, while not . Ifavouring withdrqwa&gt;jHaad privately expressed concern about the Americanposition.    He had Mso)jargued for the establishment of a joint commandstructure for the Mlv^iit this would mean putting the other contingentsunder United States &lt;^smdp^k and could only increase the dangers. Inconsultation with the FjP^n^K Foreign Minister, Monsieur Cheysson, andthe Italian Foreign Minvs&apos;t^rv^Signor Andreotti, he had agreed that thethree European Governments/ p&lt;&amp;ributing to the MNF should warn theUnited States privately (ar ftoi)gh the French had characteristically doneso publicly) of the risks itm^eak in the present American policy &quot;andshould question the wisdom of\Vn$wnerican tendency to isolate Syriaand treat it as a front for tha^i^^et Union.    There were signs that theAmericans were now paying more atzepc&amp;on to Syria as a result.   At thesame time it had been agreed to urge/Jl^e, Syrian Government to exerciserestraint, and to impress on the Le^6anej e Government that the MNF wasnot a blank cheque: the Lebanese Govfi^fynetrj; must make serious efforts toachieve reconciliation and create a sttS&amp;tipn in which an eventualceasefire could result in a lowering ofC^Hsion and in a reduction inthe size and role of the MNF.    The UnitedAStates was concerned to defendthe Lebanese Government and saw the credibility of United States policiesin the Middle East as being at stake.    For the time being withdrawal ofthe British contingent was not a realistic option^but the Governmentshould give full support to current efforts to teehi^ve a ceasefire whileusing their influence with the United States to^isrp^hrage deeper Americaninvolvement.    Meanwhile it had been decided to acc^^deyio an Italianrequest to be allowed to station a small number of^aj^oyaft at theBritish base at Akrotiri in Cyprus, in order to ^ro^cM/^kx cover forthe Italian component of the MNF.    The Government of (w^dV^had privatelyexpressed understanding of what was proposed, although ltH^a^likelypublicly to express its dissent; the Italians would be st&lt; kgf$&amp;g to theCypriots that their aircraft would be stationed at Akrotir^WJictly fordefensive, peacekeeping purposes*.    A request had also been re^^V^ed fromthe French to be allowed to stage troops through Akrotiri en \ ot t &apos;\tothe Lebanon.    This would require careful consideration, as wou^d/W/&gt;confidential! %

H^^^7 request from the Lebanese Government to buy six obsolete Hunter aircraftl^y\       from the United Kingdom, partly as replacements for those destroyed inthe hc&apos;St-ili-ties .^j^^VTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that from his recent talks in\V^H/ashington with senior members of the United States Administration it^-y^S. clear that the Americans felt that they could not extract themselvesM^X^om the conflict in the Lebanon without serious international humiliation,believed that the Druze rebels were backed by Syria, which was intajfir^acked by the Soviet Union.   The French Government, supported byFr nck/^blic opinion, also saw France&apos;s involvement as a matter ofhond*rr\/2the Americans justified their bombardment of Suq el Gharb on thegroundxSfeNChe town&apos;s strategic position and the danger of counterbombaramSZtto which American forces would be exposed if it fell intorebel hati4sx   To withdraw the British contingent at this juncture wouldseriouslyWamage relations with Britain&apos;s allies.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that alliesparticipating in .-eh* same operation naturally looked to one another forsupport and wouVd&apos;bf^ rightly indignant if it was refused.    At the same Itime requests toVcree^lSie British base at Akrotiri were in danger ofgiving Britain a ht he&gt;)profile in the conflict than was desirable,especially bearingS^a-^n|rtd the small size of the British contingent.The Lebanese Governmefly^^equest to buy six Hunters presented particulardifficulties and, if ag^^\ would heighten the risk of rebel attacks onthe British contingent wnrojvbad so far suffered no casualties.

There had been wide internatT^vkl support for measures against^(83) t*le Soviet Union in the civil aviation fi^ld, a strong resolution hadC: nclu been adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organisation and theMinut S*0ns&gt; Soviet Union had been obliged to veto a condemnatory resolution in theUnited Nations Security Council.

0 [confidential! H^&quot;^^7 regretted that the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr Gromkyo, had in effectl//&gt;       been given an excuse by the Americans not to attend the United NationsGeneral Assembly.    The primary British concern was to keep the alliestogether.    Private visits from the Soviet Union were being allowed to/X^Vproceed, but not governmental ones, although the line was sometimesw^yflifficult to draw.   The refusal of visas to prospective Soviet visitors^-^fe^trtinued to be made on security grounds only.    The forthcoming visit&lt;^V\^^ctober of a Soviet Deputy Prime Minister to the United Kingdom at the\hx^J:ation of Imperial Chemical Industries would need further consideration,Sl^/o^balance it would probably be right to allow it to go ahead.THE &lt;SEC ETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that while the Government banon AeTfttjjz&amp;y flights would expire on 28 September, the British AirlinePilots&apos;C^^ociation (BALPA) action on flights to the Soviet Union wouldcontinueCw^Il 7 October (he understood it was unlikely to be extendedfor a further 30 days after that).    The Transport and General Workers&apos;Union at Heathrow Airport had imposed a ban on handling Aeroflot flightscoterminous with BALPA&apos;s action and this meant that Aeroflot flightswould not be able^o use Heathrow Airport until the BALPA action ended,even though the (yov^Tnment&apos;s ban expired earlier. ITHE PRIME MINISTER^/rep\&gt;rting on a series of recent bilateral meetingswith other EuropeanvH^d^ of Government, said that she had been impressedby the personality of/^Vgnlbr Craxi, the new Socialist Prime Minister ofItaly.   He took a robu4t^6*w of the Soviet Union and was determined tostick to the timetable forotpe deployment of cruise missiles in Italy.The Netherlands Prime Mini^Jrc^ Mr Lubbers, had explained that hisGovernment had been unable&lt;(to Jizree to a ban of more than 14 days onflights to and from the Sovre-fe^mion because of the fear of losingairline business to the Nethe^a^o^v&apos; competitors.   He expected greatdifficulty in mustering supponsX^tfcruise missile deployment in theNetherlands, but he and his Forei6ft^M&lt;inister would do their best tostand firm.    The West German Chanr^Lipr^ Dr Kohl, had as always beenvery firm on the issue.

[confidential! H^P^^TY       2.     THE PRIME MINISTER said that her discussions with the Italian andDutch Prime Ministers and with the Federal German Chancellor hadCommuj ft \\    indicated that the chances of final agreement on budgetary reform atBud ^&gt;^Sv^/&gt;  the European Council at Athens in December were not promising. TheUnif6*; a52/^\Italians certainly did not consider it possible within this time-scale.Kin&apos;h     vTy/  e ^utcn Prime Minister had continued to stand firmly with the BritishReft! ^ ^-/^W^ition on the guideline for controlling agricultural spending but wass      wp^oking for a partial result on budgetary reform rather than the fullprev- N^BjrwLsh safety net proposal.    She doubted whether the Germans wouldRefe  US r^pd^wf irm on the control of agricultural spending.^(83)^7^Concl    . THE&lt;POREJpSN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, reporting on the meeting of the^inutUS1 nS&apos; Specia^KCowcil on 20 September, said that agreement at Athens would beextreme-i^difficult.   Nonetheless, the situation in the Community wasvery diff^r^nt from that in the recent past.    It was clear from thediscussion^ in the Special Council that all member states now acknowledgedthat there was a budgetary problem.    So far only the Germans supported,the British proposals for a safety net scheme, but all member stateswere supporting oae-oproposal or another to correct the budget situation.It would be impc^tant to continue to insist that there could be no Iquestion of an rRCYe^s in the Community&apos;s own resources if the UnitedKingdom did not obtairyk satisfactory result on correcting the budgetinequity and on contxe^af agricultural spending.THE FOREIGN AND COMMON^E^k SECRETARY reported that at the Council ofMinisters (Foreign Affarr^V&amp;s 19 September the United Kingdom hadraised the question of the^^ra&amp;re in the 1983 draft supplementary budgetfor the additional payment^&lt;zo)ihe United Kingdom under the 1982 risk-sharing arrangement.   ThereHta^K^ken no support from other member states.It was probable, however, tha\&lt;^&gt;e -issue would come back to the BudgetCouncil when the European Parli^J^ytjiad taken a position on the draftsupplementary budget. ^^^^Measu&quot;110        THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to torS^pspng attitude to publicin q6 es        expenditure which the Dutch and German bfo^rnments were showing.    In theand t many     Netherlands not only were rates of value\^dded tax being increased butNeCh.e ? t*le Government was proposing a substantial percentage cut in salariesiands   and benefits paid from public funds.    In Germany there would be a freezeuntil 1985 on salary increases in the public sec^SKand even pensionerswere being asked to bear additional charges.     (( &lt;JThe Cabinet - \^y)[confidentTalI ^ I
1^ [CONFIDENTIAL.! HQ^-^^ATION   3.     The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of State forAUTWm^^       t*ie Env:i-roriment (C(83) 32) on the Association of London Authorities (ALA) .&lt;&apos;v^/&gt;  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that 11 Labour-controlled(^x/\London boroughs,  together with the Greater London Council (GLC), hadw^JJestablished the ALA, primarily in furtherance of the campaign beingv_-^ iWlucted by the GLC and other left-wing authorities against GovernmentyO^oT^Lcies on local government, and to provide a vehicle by means of which\&gt;ra^payers&apos; money could be used to finance the campaign. Althoughno^p^sXly open to all London authorities, membership of the ALA wase&amp;recM^ely restricted to Labour authorities by the objects, of theAss&lt;$j Taipicn, which included the retention of the GLC.    The ALA hadreque^^d^epartments formally to recognise them and to include them inconsultations in the same way as the existing London Boroughs Association,from whi^m/^even of the member councils had resigned.    He had statutoryobligatioi^i to consult local authority associations and the Law Officershad advised that the ALA must be included amongst those to be consulted.The Law Officers had also warned against the dangers of any form ofconsultation which-could be challenged in the Courts as being less thanwholehearted.    HVriaa. therefore concluded that the ALA would have to beinvited to statU&apos;Qnry^j^int consultative bodies, such as the ConsultativeCouncil on Local Go^erwnent Finance.    Failure to do so would almostcertainly result irr-C^jl^t/action which could hold up the process ofdetermining the rate &lt;TWt grant settlement.   He had now heard that twoConservative-controlle4^o^raon boroughs, Bromley and Westminster, wereabout to commence a CourxSrc&amp;^on against the GLC, which would aim toprevent it from using mon^/rc^m rates levied upon their ratepayers tofinance its subscription t\&lt;tty)kLk.    This altered the position, andmeant that final decisions shejH^Nnot be reached now.    He would, however,still like to have the views M^mHeagues about what should be done.His own view was that the ALA mXs^/be brought into the statutoryconsultation arrangements.    At th/e^ame time he should make a statementexplaining the Government&apos;s position/an^ deploring the politicalpolarisation of the London boroughs^hi^n had taken place.    The statementshould also say that discussions wouM^-b g)Ln with the other localauthority associations to prevent simiTsyValarisation and that, ifnecessary, the Government would legislaE^ko that the ALA would not haveto be consulted.    He felt that legislatio^ would be the only long-termsolution, although he was advised that it would be very difficult todraft legislation which would be effective and also acceptable toParliament. /^&quot;^In discussion the following points were made - ^&quot;^^^j^a.     In view of the Court case which the Councii^af the LondonBoroughs of Bromley and Westminster might bring, /tfft^^overnmentshould say and do as little as possible, and only^WKyas unavoidablynecessary, at this stage.   No statement should be madVJ^pr the timebeing.    Phrases like &quot;recognition&quot; or &quot;formal recogrrf^^yfy, shouldbe[confidential] I
^ IconfidentIalI H^^^7 b.     Many Conservative London Members of Parliament and localauthority leaders would be looking for a firm Government response.They might expect legislation or the setting up of a purelyvy\ Conservative association.    The latter would however prejudice aneventual return to a bi-partisan association if the Bromley case\CJ)        led to the winding up of the ALA, and such action would not bex-^\    appropriate at this stage.XV/^y c.      Statutory requirements to consult varied in their precise///%&amp;xms; there was also a considerable amount of consultation which3*9&lt; \undertaken on a non-statutory basis.    Work should be done toC^eVt^blish precisely what minimum consultation would be requiredt&amp;js&amp;r&amp;X. the legal requirements and this alone should be undertakenwrtw/che ALA.    No consultation other than that required by statuteshcv&gt;d/f&gt;e undertaken with that body, although it might on occasionbe necessary to consult the individual boroughs.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinetagreed that the Government should be careful not to take any action whichwould prejudice nfne^autcome of the Court case to be brought by theCouncils of the v^KdjirvBoroughs of Bromley and Westminster. Neverthelessthe Government musc^comply with the law and undertake the minimumconsultation with rhe^^A which the law required, both in form and scope.It should not go beyow^fci&amp;t minimum.   Urgent work should be undertakento establish precisely(vj a^vwas required in this respect.   At this stageno formal statement shoul^dvbe&gt;made; nor should any action be taken to setup a rival association or^es/f^lk to the other local governmentassociations.   Legislation&lt;^s(noJid not be ruled out for the future, butit should not be publicly trrr-eirf^ved.    There would need to be furtherdiscussion in the light of th&lt;eC^t)2ome of the proposed Court action bythe London Boroughs of Bromley^raZ/Westminster.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, w &amp;-^ ?ime Minister&apos;s summingup of their discussion and invitedy^ne^Secretary of Statefor the Environment to be guided abradingly.2.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that he did notbelieve the resolution on Northern Ireland approved by the Liberal\     Party conference the previous day and which included a commitment to&lt;^x&gt;/\  the principle of a united Ireland as a long-term objective needed to betaken too seriously; but it was not helpful to the Government&apos;s policiesS^j\nd would upset Unionist opinion in the Province.
