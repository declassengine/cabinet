CONFIDENTIALPARLIAMENTARY     1.       The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House of&quot;IRS Commons during the following week.^REIGN 2.       THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the speech by the&quot;IRS First Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party Mr Andropov on- 21 December 1982, followed by the Warsaw Pact Declaration of 5 January 1983,had focussed public opinion on arms control issues.   The right publicms Control       response for the West was to maintain pressure for the zero option; toidentify those elements in the Warsaw Pact offer which were positive whilelsarmament        pointing out the flaws and inadequacies;    to ensure that the substance wasproperly considered in the negotiations in Geneva on intermediate rangenuclear forces (INF);   and only when this had been done to pronounce onthe merits.   There was no prospect of the Soviet Union accepting the zerooption, as had been made clear once again during the recent visit to Bonnby the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr Gromyko;   but it remained important topress for it.   A solution which fell some way short of the zero optionwould be worth having provided that, as the Prime Minister had emphasisedin the House of Commons, it reflected a true balance and was based ongenuine figures.    The United States Administration had kept the BritishGovernment fully informed about the course of the INF negotiations,including the private talks which Mr Nitze, the United States chiefnegotiator, had had with his Soviet opposite number in Geneva during thesummer.   At the moment there was some disarray in Washington following therejection by the Congress of President Reagan&apos;s proposal to deploy MX missilesland the difficulties which had arisen over the defence budget.   The forth-coming visit to the United Kingdom of the United States Vice-President, mMr. Bush, which would focus on nuclear issues, would therefore needparticularly careful handling.    The latest developments highlighted theimportance of the domestic debate about deployment to the United Kingdom Iof American ground-launched cruise missiles (GLCMs).    This was a &quot;heartsand minds&quot; operation.   Opinion polls suggested that public opinion wasbasically sound, but the campaign to put the Government&apos;s policies acrossto the public needed to be moved into higher gear.In discussion it was pointed out that supporters of the Campaign forNuclear Disarmament (CND) and the Peace Movement were likely to createproblems for public order out of proportion to their numbers, and that thiswas an increasing cause of concern to Chief Constables.    Protests werelikely to focus on GLCM deployment but would cover the whole range ofnuclear issues, civil as well as military.    The forthcoming debate in theChurch of England Synod on&apos; the Bishop of Salisbury&apos;s working group reporton &quot;The Church and the Bomb&quot; could have an important impact on publicopinion:    a large number of the younger clergy were against nuclear weapons. ilOn the other hand recent public opinion polls showed that 72 per cent of theelectorate were against Britain relinquishing its nuclear deterrent as longas other countries retained their nuclear weapons;   and reactions to arecent television debate between Mr John Selwyn Gummer MP and the secretaryfor CND, Monsignor Bruce Kent, had shown that the public overwhelminglyendorsed the Government&apos;s policies when these were effectively presented.Another recent opinion poll had shown a significant increase in publicconcern about defence issues;   but the reasons for this required furtheranalysis, which was in hand.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Government hadan excellent case and a majority of the public was sympathetic to it. Itwas important that all members of the Government should present that caseas vigorously and effectively as possible. (1CONFIDENTIAL ?
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -1.     Took note.^ Lebanon        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the advance party of thep    _ British contingent which was joining the multi-national force in theevious Lebanon would arrive there on 2 - 3 February and the main party on&quot;   erence: 8-9 February.   The British contingent would be stationed in a south-^ 2) 53rd        eastern suburb of Beirut next to the United States contingent. Negotiationsnclusions,       between Israel and the Lebanon about withdrawal of foreign forces from thenute 2 country had begun and Mr Philip Habib had returned as United States mediator. IProgress was likely to be slow and difficult.Middle East        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the problem of the proposedpr   f visit to London by an Arab League delegation remained unresolved.evious King Hassan of Morocco had proposed the inclusion of Mr Milhem as thepp erence: Palestinian representative in place of a member of the Palestinian^ 2) 53rcj        Liberation Organisation (PLO), and was keen that the visit should take place^nclusions,       on 7 and 8 February.    But other Arab leaders had not endorsed this proposal:nute 2 Mr Arafat had said that it was not acceptable and King Hussein of Jordanwas unenthusiastic.    A meeting between Mr Arafat, Mr Milhem and the ArabLeague representative in London was taking place that day in Tunis.Meanwhile Britain was floating the possibility of a meeting between theMinister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Mr Hurd, andMr Khadoumi of the PLO, to take place in a foreign capital quite separatelyfrom the delegation&apos;s proposed visit to London.    It was important that thisidea should be put on the table while the other Arabs were still making uptheir minds about King Hassan&apos;s proposal:    it would have no value onceKing Hassan&apos;s proposal had been rejected.   Meanwhile there was still nohard evidence of damage to British commercial interests in the Arab world,although there was some damaging speculation on the subject in a number ofArab newspapers.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Saudi Arabian FinanceMinister, whom he had seen two weeks earlier in Riyadh, had expressedserious concern about the impact of the affair on Britain&apos;s relations withthe Arab world and the obstacles it had created for Saudi efforts toestablish a group of moderate Arab countries.   The Saudis wanted to seethe problem settled.   But,&apos; although the Saudi Minister had echoed Britishhopes that economic and financial relationships with the United Kingdomwould not be affected, he had not been able to give any assurance to thateffect.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that his Department was about toembark on a major defence sales promotion project (FLOATER) which wouldinvolve sending a ship with a variety of armaments on board on a salestour round the Gulf.    The ship was due to reach its first port of call on6 February and thereafter to call at most of the Gulf countries, includingSaudi Arabia.   All the arrangements had been made and were well known tothe governments concerned.   Cancellation would therefore present majordifficulties and on balance it seemed right to allow the project to goahead.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, noted that there were certainindications of possible trade discrimination against the United Kingdom onthe part of Arab countries (eg Bahrain), and that contracts still undernegotiation might be adversely affected, if the uncertainty aboutPalestinian representation on the proposed Arab League delegation was notresolved fairly soon.   As against this there was no hard evidence of overtArab action to interfere directly with British trade or cancel existingcontracts.   Against this background and in view of the fact that thearrangements for FLOATER were public knowledge throughout the Gulf it wouldbe right for it to go ahead as planned.The Cabinet -2. Took note.al^land THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the publication of1 s^ands Lord Franks&apos;s Report had been warmly welcomed by the Diplomatic Service,_ which had suffered a great deal of unjustified criticism in recent months^vious both at home and abroad.    Meanwhile there was evidence that the^terence: Argent ine authorities might be planning acts of harassment against BritishCo       49th        forces and installations on the Falkland Islands.     This evidence had toElusions,       be read in the light of a number of bellicose statements by Argentinenute 2 military leaders which had been reported in the Argentine Press. Therewere also separate indications of possible Argentine military action againstBritish scientific bases in the Antarctic which, if it materialised, waslikely to produce a severely critical reaction from world opinion. TheGovernment were taking all these indications seriously. Representationshad been made in a wide range of foreign capitals to enlist the help offriendly governments in discouraging Argentina from embarking on anyfurther military adventure.    A message had been sent to the ArgentineGovernment through the Swiss warning them against any action   against theFalkland Islands Dependencies;   and instructions were being sent to theUnited Kingdom   representative to the meeting, currently taking place inWellington, of the signatory states of the Antarctic Treaty to givewarning of the risk of Argentine military action in the Antarctic area.Parallel representations would be made in capitals.   Military contingencyplans had also been carefully reviewed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the present Falkland Islandsgarrison had been established with a view to meeting the sort ofcontingencies which it now faced and the Chiefs of Staff were satisfied thatit had the necessary equipment to deal with the limited threat whichArgentina was likely to be able to present over the next three or four years. IThereafter, however, account would have to be taken of the build up ofArgentine forces and the increasingly sophisticated equipment which theywere acquiring.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that considerationhad been given to the possibility of retaliatory action in the event of actsof military harassment by Argentina.    But, in the light of legal advice itwas difficult to see how retaliation which went beyond self-defence would beconsistent with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.   The mosteffective way of deterring Argentina was to ensure that any Argentine actof harassment was decisively repulsed.The Cabinet -3. Took note. ,3CONFIDENTIAL 23 I
CONFIDENTIALJnternational     THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the meeting of the Group of Tenfinancial Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors which he had attended in1tuation Paris on 18 January had been one of a series of meetings designed tostrengthen the resources available to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)and thereby help to steer the developing countries and the internationalbanking system through the present nexus of debt problems. Suggestionsthat the United States was taking the lead in this process and the UnitedKingdom was dragging its feet were the opposite of the truth: Britainwas taking the lead in pressing for an increase in the IMF&apos;s resources,while the United States Government was uncertain of its ability to obtainCongressional approval for such measures.   Recent statements by seniorUnited States officials had appeared to call for new internationalfinancial arrangements;    steps had subsequently been taken to correct theimpressions to which the statements had given rise, but they had arousedexpectations, notably among developing   countries, which the United StatesGovernment now found itself obliged to resist.   At the Group of Tenmeeting, however, agreement had been reached on increasing the GeneralArrangements to Borrow (GAB), which was a supplementary resource of theIMF;   and in his capacity as chairman of the IMF&apos;s Interim Committee he.haddecided to bring forward the Committee&apos;s half-yearly meeting from April toFebruary, since this seemed to offer the best prospect for bringing theUnited States and the developing countries together and reaching anagreement to increase the IMF quota on an accelerated timescale.The Cabinet -4.     Took note.^IMMUNITY 3.       THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the EuropeanAIRS Commission had made new proposals to the Council of Ministers and the- European Parliament for solving the problem created by the Parliament&apos;s^ rejection of the 1982 Supplementary and Amending Budget.   The proposalsg ^ Community raised a number of problems for the United Kingdom which would be discussedI9s^6t: at a meeti-nS  f tne Ministers most directly concerned later in the day.^ Refunds       The Chancellor of the Exchequer would report the results of that meetingp to the Prime Minister.,revious^erence:rC&lt;82) 53rdElusions,Mmute 3gev Zealand THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that, at the Councile^tter and of Ministers (Agriculture) on 17-18 January, the French Minister of^Ports to Agriculture, Madame Cresson, had continued to oppose the implementation of^ ^ Soviet last year&apos;s agreement on imports of New Zealand butter into the Community.tll n She was embarrassed because she had, it was thought, made a deal with theh     t Soviet Government that Community butter would be supplied to the Sovietg ^vious Union.    The Commission subsequently had invited tenders for the purchase(v, erence: of surplus Community butter and the Soviet Union had not made an offer.q (, 2) 53rQ        Madame Cresson&apos;s line had been strongly opposed by the Commission and all^?nclusions,       the other member states, except Ireland, and, on the second day of thexnute 3 Council, she had spoken more moderately.    Meanwhile, New Zealand buttercontinued to be admitted on a monthly basis.iCONFIDENTIAL ^ i^ 24
CONFIDENTIALAgricultural       THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that the samtrices of the Agriculture Council had had a first discussion of the Commisprice proposals for 1983-84 which would produce an average increase c4.4 per cent in farm prices for the Community as a whole and 4.1 perfor British farmers.   The significant feature of the discussion was th.the United Kingdom was alone in advocating greater restraint, particular*,for those commodities in structural surplus, and got no support fromGermany.The German Presidency clearly did not want the negotiations on farm pricesto reach their decisive stage before the German General Election on6 March;   but they had arranged an intensive programme of meetings in thesecond half of March with the intention that the price package should beagreed by 1 April.Common THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that the CommissionJ-sheries had been holding discussions with the German Presidency and the Danish llcy Government to find a formula which would enable Denmark to accept theCommon Fisheries Policy without changing the agreement reached among therevious other nine member states.    Some new ideas had been worked out whicheference: Danish Ministers were presenting to their Parliament.    If they wereC(82) 53rd        successful in securing sufficient Parliamentary support, the Common nclusions,       Fisheries Policy would be agreed at the meeting of the Fisheries CouncilMlnute 3 on 25 January.In discussion it was remarked that public opinion in the United Kingdomwould be very much more favourable to Community membership if it werepossible to solve the problems of fish and the Community budget.The Cabinet -Took note.i5CONFIDENTIAL ^
CONFIDENTIALINDUSTRIAL 4.       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the trade unionsA*RS in the water industry had consulted their members about the 4 per cent offer- by the employers and had been given authority to reject the offer and taker. industrial action.   A ban on overtime and emergency work outside normalrater Industry hours had been imposed from midnight on Tuesday 18 January and an all-outay strike had been called from midnight on Sunday 23 January.    The Advisory,  tiations Conciliation and Arbitration Service was having separate talks with bothp    _ parties.    It was possible that a marginal increase in the employers&apos;revious offer, as an earnest of willingness to negotiate,   would facilitate mediation,   erence: and subsequently a reference to arbitration to which the employers had^ 2) 53rd unilateral access under the arbitration agreement but which the trade unions I^elusions, had so far resisted.   The outcome might then be an arbitration award, whichnute 4 would be binding, at a tolerable level.    The employers would press for thethreat of industrial action to be lifted during mediation and arbitration.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Civil Contingencies Unit (CCU) had metat Ministerial level on 18 January to review the possible need for serviceassistance.    It had been agreed that the servicemen required under therelevant contingency plans should be at 24 hours notice to move frommidnight on Sunday 23 January.    They would not however be deployed unlessand until service assistance became necessary and specific Ministerialauthority had been given.   The CCU would be meeting again on Monday24 January to review the position.In discussion it was noted that there might be some doubt about whether oneof the main trade unions involved, the General Municipal Boilermakers andAllied Trades Union (GMBATU) had proper authority to take industrial action. IAs a newly merged union the GMBATU had not yet published a rule book but itspredecessor for the water industry, the General and Municipal Workers Union(GMWU), required a two-thirds vote of members in favour of cessation of workwhereas the figure appeared to be some 59 per cent.    It was likely that, inthe event of an all-out strike, the Press would draw attention to this.The Cabinet -1. Took note.^   Ish THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that the House of Lords had unanimously. rPorts rejected the appeal by Air Canada and other airlines against an Appealh rity Court ruling upholding the. Government&apos;s claim that certain documents,including communications between Ministers and proceedings of the Cabinetand Cabinet Committees, should not be disclosed on public interest grounds.This decision, which had wide implications, was most welcome.The Cabinet -2.

They hadasked H Committee to give further consideration to the scheme put forwardby the Solicitor General, on the basis that the addition to publicexpenditure in 1982-83 should be kept to about  20 million, and that thescheme should be linked to a review of the costs and fees in civil legalaid cases and to progress towards improved control of costs.   C(83) 3 setout the details of the revised scheme agreed by H Committee.   He believedthat this met the conditions laid down in the previous discussion, and heinvited the Cabinet to endorse it.    Subject to the Cabinet&apos;s approval,the Solicitor General intended to announce the scheme and the associatedconsultations with the legal profession in a &quot;low-key&quot; written reply toan arranged Parliamentary Question.   The announcement would contain noreference to the cost of the scheme in 1982-83, or to other factors fromwhich the cost might be deduced.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that the Cabinetapproved the proposals set out in C(83) 3.    The interim scheme representedthe partial meeting of an existing liability, and was, therefore, differentin kind from other additions to planned public expenditure in 1982-83.There was a risk that the nature of the proposed payments would bemisrepresented in the Press and elsewhere.   The Cabinet agreed that theSolicitor General should announce the scheme by means of a written replyin the terms already agreed with the Chief Secretary, Treasury; butthere should be no accompanying Press conference, and care should betaken to avoid any statements which might create expectations that thescheme would necessarily be put on a more permanent basis in the future.The Cabinet further agreed that, subject to agreement between theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Chief Secretary, Treasury on thedetails, a similar scheme should be introduced in Scotland.The Cabinet -Approved the proposals for a scheme of interim payments forcivil legal aid work as set out in C(83) 3.CONFIDENTIAL 2 ^ I
CONFIDENTIALPARLIAMENTARY 6.       The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of theONTROL OF Exchequer (C(83)2) about the Parliamentary Control of Expenditure (Reform)XPEND1TURE Bill.    They also had before them a note by the Secretary of the CabinetREFORM) BILL (C(83)4) to which was attached a copy of the text of the Bill as it hadp     _ been published on 18 January.    Their discussion and the conclusionsrevious reached are recorded separately. MReference:JC(82) 53rdConclusions,|Mmute 6^CAL 7&gt;       The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Home Secretary (C(83)1)VERNMENT to which was attached a report by the Ministerial Group on LocalAl, ANISATION       Government Organisation and Finance (MISC 79) .^ FINANCETHE HOME SECRETARY said that MISC 79 had held extensive discussions oflocal government organisation and finance. Their main recommendationswere as follows:i.     The Greater London Council (GLC) and the Metropolitan CountyCouncils should be abolished.ii.     Public transport in the London area should be reorganisedby making the London Transport Executive responsible to theSecretary of State for Transport (instead of the GLC) and byconverting it, in two stages, into a Metropolitan TransportAuthority.    It would co-ordinate, and distribute Governmentfinancial assistance among the London Underground and buses andthe South Eastern commuter services of British Rail.?iii.     A scheme of discounts on domestic rates should be introducedfor households consisting of a single person.   This would provideflat-rate discounts of the order of  1.50 a week on rate bills ofover  3 a week;   or 50 per cent of smaller rate bills.    The costwould be about  140 to  170 million a year.    In presenting the schemethe Government should say that provision for it would be made in theRate Support Grant settlement each year.In addition, MISC 79 recommended a number of relatively minor reforms inthe rating system;    these were discussed in more detail in their report.They recommended no change in local authority electoral arrangements.There were two matters on which MISC 79 had been unable to reach agreement.iv.     The Inner London Education Authority (ILEA).    This wasformally a special committee of the GLC.    If the GLC was abolished,new arrangements would have to be found for organising education ininner London.   Most members of MISC 79 thought that a single bodyshould be retained but reconstituted as a joint board of the innerLondon boroughs.    A minority considered that education should becomethe responsibility of the inner London boroughs.v.     Measures to restrain local authority current expenditure.Most members of MISC 79 thought that the Government should notintroduce new measures to control local authority current expendi-ture or rates.   There was minority support in the Group for canvassing, Iin a consultative document or elsewhere, a system of selective central I8CONFIDENTIAL rt I
CONFIDENTIALcontrols on the current expenditure or rates of English and Welshlocal authorities;   or for &apos;capping&apos; increases in non-domestic rates.Either measure might be associated with a requirement that localauthorities which wished to spend or rate highly should hold a &apos;townpoll&apos; or offer themselves for re-election.Virtually all these matters would require primary legislation.   There wasno prospect of legislating in the present Parliament.   The Governmentshould, however, be ready to legislate as quickly as possible after aGeneral Election.   Legislation to set up a Metropolitan Transport Authorityand on rating reform could probably be ready for introduction in November1983;    legislation to abolish the GLC and the Metropolitan Counties wouldbe complex and would take a long time to prepare but could probably be readyearly in 1984 provided that preparations began and announcements were madeearly.   MISC 79 were aware that their recommendations on rates might dis-appoint the Cabinet.   They had perhaps identified problems rather thansolved them.   Nevertheless, he had to warn the Cabinet that the problemswere intractable:   certainly there were no easy answers.Q CaI In discussion of local government organisation, the following main pointsVernment were made:r anisationa. As the report by MISC 79 made clear, there were objections tothe proposed abolition of the GLC and the Metropolitan CountyCouncils.    Relatively few members of the public took much interestin local government or would expect tangible benefits to flow fromreorganisation.   On the other hand, the GLC and the MetropolitanCounties had few duties, and those duties oould be satisfactorilydischarged by alternative arrangements;    they were unpopular intheir own areas;   and many, even among the Government&apos;s politicalopponents, would welcome their abolition.b. Whether the GLC was abolished or not, transport in Londonshould be reorganised on the lines proposed by MISC 79.   This couldbe done by separate legislation.c. Views were divided on the arrangements which might replace theILEA if the GLC was abolished.   On the one hand, there were educationalarguments for retaining a single body to run all local authorityeducation in inner London.   Not to replace the ILEA by a single bodywould provoke a campaign of criticism by educational interests ofthe sort which had proved effective in the past.    On the other hand,the educational arguments for giving responsibility for education tolarge bodies were open to doubt.    In other metropolitan areas thedistricts were responsible for education;    and they discharged theirresponsibilities well.    Similarly, in inner London the boroughs, orperhaps groupings of boroughs, could be responsible for education.d. If the Government were eventually to decide upon the abolitionof the GLC and the Metropolitan Counties, an announcement should befollowed as quickly as possible by legislation in order to minimisethe period during which the authorities to be abolished continued toadminister their functions.    It was clearly impossible to legislatein the present Parliament.    Even legislation presented in January 1984CONFIDENTIAL 2Q
CONFIDENTIALcould probably not effect abolition earlier than April  1986.    It wasopen to doubt whether January 1984 was a realistic target in any event;Bit would certainly require early announcement of decisions so thatthe preparation of legislation could be put in hand and outsideinterests could be consulted.e. An announcement that the GLC and the Metropolitan County Councils Iwere to be abolished would lead to pressure for other changes in local Igovernment organisation.    This would have to be resisted.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the proposals in C(83)1 for the reorganisation oftransport in London.    The Secretary of State for Transport should arrangefor the work to give effect to this decision, which was independent of theother matters before the Cabinet, to be put in hand.    The Cabinet were notyet ready to decide whether the GLC and the Metropolitan County Councilsshould be abolished.    Before they could do so they would need to studyfurther the detailed consequences of abolition for the services for whichthe GLC (including the ILEA) and the Metropolitan County Councils werecurrently responsible.    The Secretary of State for the Environment shouldarrange for the necessary studies to be carried out within Government.These studies should help to ensure that the period required for thepreparation of legislation would be shortened, if the Cabinet eventuallydecided upon abolition.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of this part of their discussion.2. Approved the proposals in C(83)1 regarding the organisationof transport in London.3. Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment toarrange for officials of the Departments concerned to carryout studies of the detailed consequences of a possible decisionto abolish the Greater London Council and the MetropolitanCounty Councils on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister,and to report the conclusions of the studies in due course.4. Took note that the Prime Minister would consider howfurther Ministerial discussion of this subject could best bearranged.*ef0r^ In discussion of rating reform the following main points were made:f.     There was widespread and justifiable dissatisfaction withthe rates as the sole form of raising revenue for local government.Apart from the disadvantages of any form of property taxation, theywere seen as not sufficiently closely related to ability to pay;the distribution of the burden of rates was, and was seen as,inequitable;    and as the system had developed there was not asufficient correlation between taxation and representation. Ithad to be accepted that it had proved impossible to identify amore satisfactory form of revenue raising for local Government.    It waspolitically imperative, however, to limit the burden of local rates.1 CONFIDENTIAL_____ 30M
CONFIDENTIALUnless the Government succeeded in doing so it would be accused ofbetraying its pledges.   Action might have to be taken graduallyover a long period, perhaps a decade or more.    Further study shouldbe given to such approaches as freezing rates at their existing level(or drastically limiting increases in them) in combination with, forexample, giving local authorities additional sources of revenue,defraying a larger part of local expenditure through the Rate SupportGrant, relieving local authorities of some of their statutoryobligations, or transferring certain responsibilities from local tocentral Government.    Some of these alternatives would entail increasesin the taxes levied by central Government.   This would not be popular,but it might be less unpopular than further increases in local rates.g. Such an approach might also need to be coupled with centralcontrol of expenditure by individual local authorities.   A schemeon these lines was discussed in the MISC 79 report.    It wastechnically feasible;   but it raised serious constitutional andother difficulties and had not found favour with the majority of theGroup.   Nevertheless, it could be developed further if the Cabinetso wished.h. There was now widespread acceptance among informed opinionthat local rates could not be abolished.   But it might well bepossible to find ways of supplementing them by new methods oflocal taxation and so allowing their burden to be limited.Another approach might be to make the incidence of rates moreequitable in terms of ability to pay, for example by extending thesystem of rate rebates.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the recommendations of MISC 79 on local rates were aninadequate response to the demands of the situation.    It was essential to gofurther.    She would arrange for the issues to be considered by the Ministersmost closely concerned.   Until they had been resolved it would be wrong toproceed with consideration of the minor recommendations on   reforms to therating system recommended by MISC 79.The Cabinet -5.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT XCOPY NOCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(83)  1st Conclusions, Minute 6Thursday 20 January 1983 at 10.00 amCq^Ia^NTARY The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerEXPf   L  F (C(83)2) about the Parliamentary Control of Expenditure (Reform) Bill.(REp   ITURE 111 ey also had before tnem a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (C(83)4) RM) BILL to which was attached a copy of the text of the Bill as it had beenpv   . published on 18 January.RefVl USCc(grence: THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that following the Cabinet&apos;s previousC0    &apos; 53rd        discussion he had held several meetings with Mr Norman St John-Stevas MP^nclusions,       and other promoters of the Bill.   The Bill contained many technical defects,nute 6 which had been drawn to the attention of Mr St John-Stevas.    Its substancewas also in many respects incompatible with the position taken by theGovernment.   On the appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor General(C &amp; AG) Mr St John-Stevas had previously given the impression that theBill would provide for advice to be tendered to The Queen on a Motion bythe House of Commons moved by the Prime Minister after consultation withthe Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).    In fact, the Billprovided that it should be moved by the Chairman of PAC, and made nomention of the Prime Minister.   This raised the serious possibility thatconflicting advice might be tendered to The Queen by the House of Commonsand the Prime Minister.   The Bill also left doubt about the independenceof the C &amp; AG from directions by the House of Commons or its Committees.The Bill, in accordance with indications previously given by Mr St John-Stevas, did not provide that the C &amp; AG should &apos;follow public money whereverit went&apos;:    it did not provide for him to be able to investigate the affairsof all recipients of public funds.   But it still provided for access to thebooks of the nationalised industries, of publicly owned companies, and ofany company of which more than 50 per cent of the voting shares werepublicly owned.   This access appeared to extend to matters of policy. Hehad told the Bill&apos;s supporters that although the Government did not intendto oppose Second Reading, &apos;a wide gap remained between the Bill&apos;s provisionsand the Government&apos;s views of what was desirable, not least in the interestsof promoting the efficiency of the nationalised industries.   He had prepareda note setting out the Government&apos;s arguments;   the text had been circu-lated to the Cabinet with his letter of 17 January addressed to theSecretary of State for Industry.    It had also been given to those among theGovernment&apos;s supporters in the House of Commons who were sympathetic to theGovernment&apos;s position on the Bill.   There was a case for sending it to allthe Government&apos;s supporters in the House of Commons;   but on balance hedid not favour this course.   Ministers should consider how to handleCommittee Stage after the Bill had received its Second Reading:    there wouldthen be a better measure of the support for the Bill.    In preparation,officials should be asked to draft amendments to remove technical faultsand to implement the Government&apos;s views on the clauses where there weredifficulties of substance..1CONFIDENTIAL ^
V CONFIDENTIAL?THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinetbroadly endorsed the proposals in C(83)2 for handling the Bill. TheCabinet agreed that it would not be appropriate for a Minister to sendbriefing material on the Bill&apos;s defects to all the Government&apos;s supportersin the House of Commons;   but the Chancellor of the Exchequer shouldconsider whether such material could be disseminated by other means.The Government should at this stage avoid a frontal attack on the Bill:it would be better to concentrate on criticisms of detail.   But theParliamentary tactics were difficult and would need careful consideration.She would set up a small group of Ministers, under the chairmanship of theChancellor of the Exchequer, to co-ordinate the Government&apos;s tactics. TheLord President of the Council and the Parliamentary Secretary, Treasury,should consider who should speak for the Government during the passage ofthe Bill:    there might, in particular, be advantage in having one or moreMinisters from the Departments with sponsoring responsibilities fornationalised industries on the Committee which considered it.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summingup of their discussion and invited the Chancellor of theExchequer to be guided accordingly.2. Took note that the Prime Minister would consider howMinisterial discussion of the co-ordination of the Government&apos;stactics could best be considered.3. Invited the Lord President of the Council and theParliamentary Secretary, Treasury, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and other Ministers concerned,to consider who should speak for the Government during thevarious stages of the Parliamentary Control of Expenditure(Reform) Bill.Cabinet Office21 January 1983CONFIDENTIAL
