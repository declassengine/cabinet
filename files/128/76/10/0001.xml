CONFIDENTIALAFpAT^^^TARY    1 .     The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the. &apos; House of Commons during the following week.     The House would rise forthe Easter Adjournment on Thursday 31 March, and return on Monday11 April.AFpAlRQ .     raE F0REIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that in the talks he___ was having in London with the Spanish Foreign Minister, Senor Moran,^ibra.L tbe latter was seeking to make one-sided changes in the Lisbon Agreementtar which&apos;were unacceptable.    If the agreement were not implemented it wouldPrevi have a damaging effect on confidence in Gibraltar and would mean thatRefo&gt;.0US the United Kingdom would have to provide Gibraltar with additionalCC(83) 7 economic assistance.      It would also be bad for relations between Spain^ nclu . and tbe ^nited Kingdom and would create complications for theMinut s^ ns,     North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.     He would be taking a very firm linewith Senor Moran, as would the Prime Minister who would be seeingSenor Moran that afternoon.     Meanwhile he was continuing to statepublicly that Britain adhered to the aim of implementing theLisbon Agreement.- cast       THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that for the first time it?revl0u appeared likely that the Arab League delegation would be coming toRefe    s London as planned under the leadership of King Hussein of Jordan. HeCC(83) ft6&apos; would be meeting the King that evening.      The most useful part of the^ nclu . delegation&apos;s visit would probably be King Hussein&apos;s meeting with theHitjute 2 ns&apos;     Prime Minister, which would be an opportunity to establish whether theKing thought he could carry Mr Arafat and the Palestine LiberationOrganisation (PLO) with him in the Middle East peace negotiations.The Palestinians&apos; representative on the delegation, Mr Walid Al Khalidi,was an academic who spent much of his time in the United States and hadno close connections with the PLO.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Prime Minister ofMalaysia, Dr Mahathir, had apparently been very pleased with his recentvisit to London and his reception by the Prime Minister.      It looked asif the visit might mark the start of a welcome thaw in relations betweenMalaysia and the United Kingdom.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Mr Joshua Nkomo, therGvi0us leader of the Zimbabwe African People&apos;s Union who had escaped arrest ineEerc&quot; Zimbabwe, had been admitted to the United Kingdom on 13 March. He483) g / appeared to be relatively inactive and was attracting little publicw?nc-lusi attention.     Mr Nkomo himself was appreciative of the way his admissionn^te 2 nS&apos;     nac* heen handled and the Government of Zimbabwe was also content.Although military activity in Zimbabwe appeared to be at a reducedlevel, the risk of tribal warfare leading to civil war remained.    For themoment the right course was for Britain to continue to give support #where appropriate to the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe, Mr Mugabe, therebyhelping to pre-empt the risk that he might seek support from Communistgovernments.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE HOME SECRETARY said that Mr Nkomo and the two friends who hadaccompanied him would be given permission to remain in theUnited Kingdom for four weeks from 13 March and their passports wouldbe returned to them.    Great care would be taken to avoid any actionwhich might give Mr Nkomo any right to remain in the United Kingdomat the expiry of the four-week period.     But he had a wide range ofinfluential friends here and the possibility of complications over hisdeparture could not be excluded.     Mr Nkomo had declined an offer ofsecurity protection while in the United Kingdom and his precisewhereabouts were not known.     Meanwhile,    the former Prime Ministerof Rhodesia, Mr Ian Smith, had applied for a British passport.Roinani =THE HOME SECRETARY, commenting on reports that a Romanian national hadbeen denied permission to remain in the United Kingdom as a refugee,said there was no evidence that the person concerned had been involvedin any form of political activity in Romania or would be more at riskthere than any other returning national of a Communist country. Thecountry would be flooded with refugees if all the many Communist andother foreign nationals who applied for refugee status were granted ituncritically.     A difficult judgment had to be made in each individualcase and he was satisfied that the decision in this case had been right.lteland . .a THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that no officialrepresentations had been made to discourage the Archbishop ofNew York, Cardinal Cooke, from attending that day&apos;s St Patrick&apos;s Dayparade in the city since such representations would have been counter-productive.     There had however been unofficial approaches to him throughRoman Catholic channels.     The controversy surrounding this year&apos;s paradeand the refusal of leading Irish American politicians to attend it hadbeen damaging for the Irish Republican Army&apos;s cause in the United States.The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office, Lord Gowrie, would bevisiting the United States shortly for talks with political and otherleading figures including representatives of the media.     This would helpto counterbalance the publicity being given in the United States to theIrish Foreign Minister, Mr Barry, and the leader of the Social Democraticand Labour Party, Mr John Hume.The Cabinet -Took note.2CONFIDENTIALiqi m
CONFIDENTIAL    ? k$mtm^^NITY 3&lt;     XHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Council___ ,&apos; of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) had adopted the regulations necessaryC0Unc. to ensure that the United Kingdom received the refunds due in respect^nia      ^ of the 1982 Community budget.      The payments should now be made before(For -ers the end of the United Kingdom&apos;s financial year.kft 8n14/15 MarchC uncii c^nist THE MINISTER 0F AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that the Council(Agr  e^s of Ministers (Agriculture) had, at last, adopted the regulationjH/ir     ture)       prescribing the butter import quota for New Zealand for 1983.MarchTrade   states       THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that he had licy        visited the United States on 9/10 March to warn the United StatesAdministration of the dangers of a trade war with the European Community.He had found that most of the United States Departments were anxious toavoid a trade war;    in particular the United States Treasury andthe Secretary of State, Mr Shultz,  shared this view.     The problem wasthat the President&apos;s political advisers in the White House appeared tothink that it would be to the advantage of the Republican Party tosubsidise agricultural exports in competition with the EuropeanCommunity.     This would be a risky course for the United States whichexported #9i billion of food products to the Community.Smut*:*Pendi THE SECRETARY 0F STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that he had been greatlytheltUre embarrassed by the statement by Commissioner Tugendhat in support of^ited v t^e allegation that the Government was dragging its feet on proposalslngdom     for Community expenditure in the Highlands.     He understood that thetruth of the matter was that the Commission had decided that there was -no money in the Community budget for this purpose so thatCommissioner Tugendhat&apos;s statement had been misleading as well asunhelpful.In discussion it was pointed out that this was not an isolated incident.Representatives of United Kingdom local authorities were often giventhe impression by the Commission that the United Kingdom Governmentwas standing in the way of a flow of Community funds to their areas.The Government would need to consider what steps should be taken to putthe record straight.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office &apos;17 March 1983CONFIDENTIALA ...... m M
