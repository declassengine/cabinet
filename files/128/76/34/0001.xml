[confidential! HI^P^Z^p^TARY     1 .     The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.^FATpN THE F0REIGN ^ COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the vote at the___ s       xV^l&amp;iited Nations General Assembly on the Latin American resolution aboutpaj^ \&gt;X&amp;be Falkland Islands had been broadly the same as in the previous year,^sla rr$^!$^ ^n ^avour anc* 9 against and 5A abstentions.   The United Kingdoms ^d^one well to achieve this result.   As in the previous year thePfe . UiCrted^States had voted in favour; but all the Community countries hadftefe  US aDs&lt;^ ned, Greece having switched from a vote in favour to abstention.Cc(o^xnce: Desprt^their earlier moves to promote a draft which Community countriescould ^niMort, both France and Italy had abstained; President MitterandHinut^s^0ns       of Fran\^ had been particularly robust.The Cabinet -1.     Tool//noVe . that the Prime Minister would be sendingmessages xfc&amp;ajJEreciation to President Mitterand and alsoto the Prime/MiMsters of Italy and Greece, Signor Craxiand Mr Paparhi^mp  &quot;tina THE FOREIGN AND COMMONW^iffgNSECRETARY said that the Prime MinisterPfe . designate of Argentina, $*nqjf)Alfonsin, and several of his colleaguesftefe  Us had used uncompromising lan Mk about relations with the United KingdomCc(gosnce: over the Falkland Islands i&amp;ffc&amp;e^-run up to the debate in the UnitedConc^   33rd        Nations General Assembly.   Bo^me-advent of a democratically electedHinu1;Usi0ns       Government in Argentina was boiM/ro&gt; increase international pressuree 2 on the United Kingdom to make conc^jBi&amp;ons on the Falkland Islands issue.While formally resisting such pr surjp, it would be important to makeit clear to the incoming ArgentinevJov^Pnment, using Swiss and otherchannels, that Her Majesty&apos;s GovernmSny^wAs ready to resume normalcommercial relations with Argentina a uK^to co-operate in arrangementsfor a properly prepared visit to the Fa^cland Islands by Argentinenext-of-kin of those killed in the conflict.    It had become clear thatthe United States Administration would shortly be going ahead with itsproposed recertification of Argentina as a couffEfry qualified on humanrights grounds to buy arms from the United Stfa^teslj but the UnitedStates Secretary of Defense, Mr Weinberger, ha3\dj e^ared publicly on10 November that the Americans would not supply(Argentina withsophisticated weapons that could be used in a rerrejjea/attempt to invadethe Falkland Islands.   The Government&apos;s aim shoulaf^b^^.build on thishelpful statement so as to ensure close consul tat iotV^^w^en theUnited States and British Governments about the types orJ&amp;ms which mightbe supplied to Argentina, and to seek to postpone any awlfe/lsjbppliesfor as long as possible.   He was in touch with the Chanc^lJ^V^of theExchequer about the implications of a resumption of Americar^Vfctossupplies for the participation by British banks in internao^otmi^loansto Argentina, and they would shortly be making agreed recomm^ct^ijpnson the handling of this problem.

r^ [confidential! HIn discussion it was pointed out that the international loan to\S/y\        Argentina agreed in August was conditional on Argentine readiness tov^^^^      implement measures required by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)yyy\   and that, as a result of Argentina&apos;s failure to meet the IMF&apos;s&lt;yy\  requirements, no drawings had yet been made on the loan. AlthoughX^v/Nparticipating British banks were contractually bound by the August^VKreemetit and primary legislation would be required to relieve them of^&gt;&lt; feir obligations, no legislation would be required to enable the&lt;^&amp;p* rnment to prevent British banks from participating in any futureUxJansV   It was suggested that, since a decision by the United Statest&lt;^rec rtify Argentina for the purpose of arms sales would be likelyto pravoke fierce criticism in the United Kingdom, it was importantthatX^fa^Government should be able to demonstrate that it had doneeveryt^lpj^possible to dissuade the Americans from this step.   At thesame tirait was recognised that care should be taken not to prejudicethe prospects for close consultation with the United StatesAdministration about the scope and timing of any arms supplies, or tocreate the impression that a recertification decision by itselfrepresented a/^fgaificant set back for British policies, given that sucha decision seeded ^inevitable and given the reassurance contained inMr Weinberger&apos;s  at nent.The Cabinet -2.     Took note. &lt;^^^&gt;s THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWFJU-WS^METARY said that the unilateralPtev. declaration of independence^V/^e Turkish Cypriots on 15 November had^efe  US been in prospect for some monrnY/&apos;^he Turkish authorities, who hadCc(o^6riCe: sought to dissuade the Turkish vyj^r^ts from this step, appeared to havefy^ci   30th        been taken by surprise by the tii^ n&apos;g/&gt;which coincided with thehinutUSl ns,       interregnum in Ankara; but, the de^fpa*^on having been made, thee 2 Turkish Government had felt obliged^&apos;^C^Kidorse it.   The United Kingdomwhich, with Greece and Turkey, was on^^Kthe three Guarantor Powersunder the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee, ha^vLnitiated action at the UnitedNations and had called for tripartite consultations with Greece andTurkey.   The Turks had agreed, but the Greeks were so far willing tohave consultations only with the United Kingdoj -r-&gt;. The Foreign Ministersof the Community would be meeting the f ollowi/ttgday to seek to establisha European view.   The Government&apos;s aim shouldSvks^jpi\avoid being drawninto escalatory measures such as economic sancti^ns)keainst Turkey andto prevent the introduction into Cyprus of addirCSajfrL/Greek or Turkishtroops which were already very substantially in ex ^4^f the numberslaid down in the Treaty of Guarantee.   Although the(jjir^sXwere claimingthat the Turkish Cypriots&apos; action simply confirmed tfreNst}&amp;us quo andmight open the way to progress towards a confederal str^ j f^e in Cyprus,it was bound to be divisive in the North Atlantic Treaty^drranisationand in the European Community.&apos;   It would also be raised aV- fi \\Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in New Delhi the ^Anioying week.^ [confidential] I
^^^SiliHillHHIHHHHHi^p\ IconfidentialI H% I&lt;^/ll/y Greece would have strong support both within the United States and(//\        within the United Kingdom.   The Government would need to steer aC^\^S&gt;       careful course to avoid alienating Turkey and to prevent any furtheryyy\^   deterioration of the situation in Cyprus which might pose a threat to(Vjjj   the Sovereign Base Areas.   He would be making proposals to this end\r^/Nshortly.?6 anon &amp;fu^SREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the recent IsraeliJ pr   . a$^ra*d on the Bekaa Valley had been directed at the base offtej    Us IslaMc^Amal, the organisation suspected of responsibility for theCQ/^ence: earK^L^/omb attacks on Israeli, United States and French troops. ThereC0   i   33rd        had be^xfio news so far of the outcome, but the Americans had stressed1^    Usions,       that trtere had been no United States involvement.   The level ofe ^ ceasefire violations in Beirut continued to fluctuate, but there wasstill some prospect of progress in the reconciliation talks in Genevawhich were due La resume shortly.   The faction of the PalestineLiberation OrgmTaytion loyal to Mr Arafat appeared to be on the pointof extinctions^       Syrians.   It was too early to assess the prospectsof possible retaLfatwry action by the United States for the terrorist,attack on the AmeQ&amp;an^marines:    the Government had continued to urgethe Americans to d^/fvowjing which might jeopardise the reconciliationprocess and to take Qp^kakion which could not be justified in terms ofself defence.   Meanwh^e^aU. possible steps would be taken to protectthe British contingent te^^ft^ multinational force which was atheightened risk.ada THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SFXftE^RY said that the United States hadPte . advanced the date for withdrawiSnt^ij^ troops from Grenada. TheR6f l0us Governor General&apos;s Advisory Cound^h^ii been established and six of itscC(R^nce: members sworn in, although Mr Alis j^Mc)[ntyre, the Grenadian DeputyCoup-,   ?3rd        Secretary General of the United Napro^^Committee on Trade AndHin  Usions,      Development, had still not finally acw^ed the invitation to assumee ^ the chairmanship.   The Governor General\ Sir Paul Scoon, had issued.   a proclamation restoring the rule of law.   The British Development Aidteam which had visited Grenada had not yet submitted its report.Present indications were that the United Kingdem^would not be asked tocontribute troops to a peacekeeping force thenfe, ^out would probably beasked for help with police training. \^3^^^andarUament THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that th/^^Kt and Unitedc nt States delegations to the intermediate nuclear forceHlOT/&gt;negotiationsto1 were still in Geneva.   The Russians were expected to rajj  &amp;\t leastPtev until after the debate in the West German Bundestag onRefel0Us 21 and 22 November.

The United&lt;/^v       States negotiator had tabled a proposal for a global ceiling of420 missile warheads for the United States and for the Soviet Union, ofwhich the Americans would deploy only two-thirds of their share in&lt;^^7fiE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that, as he had announced in&lt;^/^ 3&gt;iament, the first cruise missiles had been delivered in the Unitedys^sjahm on 14 November.   This reflected a last minute change from the &quot;ag^ecp-date of 15 November which had been leaked to the press the previousweek^ra^. The change of date had been made entirely at Britishinit?3^ Ve, with American agreement.

There/Ma\been intensive discussions on all the^it    anc* issues for decision at ra&amp;^European Council in Athens oniCin 5 and 6 December.    Some ptb&amp;p&amp;e had been made on the central problem^efu ^  ^ tne budgetary safety net^aVbJjough there was still a long way to go.s In spite of the Commission&apos;s\un*^fl.pful attempt to redefine the size ofPte . the problem, the United Kingdomtt^td/ke en reasonably successful in keepingRefe  Us the discussion on the basis of ^e^e^i sting figures.   He felt that itCc(o^fnce: could be possible to put togetheiC^a&apos;pApkage at theEuropean Council whichC ncl   ?3rc*        would meet British objectives in t^c^^ya.   On the strict financialHinutUslons&gt;       guideline, while there was a genera^\ Mognition of the need for an ,e ^ effective constraint on agricultural qpepding, it was likely to bedifficult to secure a commitment which\vould be legally binding. Itshould however be possible to secure the substance of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s objectives.   The Greek Presidency   had proposed an increasein own resources on the basis of a value added^feax as high as1.8 per cent, but had proved unable to justif/y^TrJjwhen challenged. TheUnited Kingdom&apos;s position that we would not agjee-^ta an increase in ownresources unless our two conditions were met waa^cliarly understood.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD re&lt;p6^^a thatAgriculture Ministers at the Special Council had disWswd a Presidencypaper and had looked at a revised version in the Coun^vJ^.Ministers(Agriculture) on 15 November.   The aim had been to set ^jjrp^&amp;he issuesfor the European Council with the minimum area of disputSaQ^yBhe UnitedKingdom had therefore sought to reduce the Presidency&apos;s uhv^eioydocument by concentrating on the major issues and eliminatikgsitpssewhich were better left to the price fixing negotiations.

H&lt;^I^ greatest difficulty seemed likely to be milk, where the European Council p^pMlyy\ would have to decide whether to deal with the surplus through the&lt;^\C\&gt;        price and guarantee threshold, as the United Kingdom wanted, or throughSsy.     the super-levy supported by other member states; a particular area of^X/v\   difficulty for the United Kingdom would be the base period.   On cerealsthere was agreement that Community prices should be brought closer to/XVither production areas such as the United States.   The United Kingdom^o/^w&amp;s strongly opposed to the proposed limitation on imports of&lt;/te^al substitutes; on his recent visit to the United States, it had$ emVlear that the United States would retaliate if suchlwifrtations were imposed.   He was hopeful that with German, Danish andDutcK/sjopport the United Kingdom would succeed in killing the proposalfor^^re on imports of oils and fats, and that the European Councilwould^nop/fee asked to consider individual commodities other than milkand cex^ls.   The proposed elimination of monetary compensatory amounts,on whicn^France felt strongly and where the United Kingdom was opposedto the inflationary German suggestion that they should be realigned onthe strongest currency, would however have to go to the EuropeanCouncil. /fX\THE PRIME MINISTfe^Fi^id that it was desirable that the European Councilshould concentrat^e_-oV^the major issues like the budgetary safety net,the strict f inaneiad&gt;mi^ieline and milk, on which there werefundamental disputes/^/^Je was glad to hear that work had already begunto prepare contingen&lt;^/j&amp;aiis in the event of a breakdown of thesediscussions in Decembery^^\THE FOREIGN AND COMMONwT^$TH&gt; fiCRETARY reported that when the Commissionhad considered the regulati^h^giving effect to the United Kingdom&apos;s1983 Budget refunds the prev^pu^aay three unidentified Commissionershad blocked them,   apparentlyvt^a^der to hold them up for politicalreasons until after the Europed^TOyBhcil.
