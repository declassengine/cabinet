CONFIDENTIALPARLIAMENTARY   l.     The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the HouseRS of Commons during the following week.||ePorts THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Opposition had adopted a policy ofpar . deliberate obstruction in the House of Commons the previous evening toBo   lamentary   prevent the approval of the draft Order implementing the recommendationsndary of the Parliamentary Boundary Commission for Wales.    A long time had1ssions      been taken up with spurious points of order and other delaying tacticspre . before the debate began, and further points of order had been raisedRef X US during the debate itself, for which 90 minutes had been allowed. InCCfRrenCe&apos; the end the Deputy Speaker had agreed not to put the question and the&apos; 3rd        debate would consequently be resumed on Monday 21 February.    It wasMinC^US^ nS&apos;     clear that the Opposition intended to deploy similarly disruptiveute 1 tactics when the English and Scottish draft Orders were debated. Pointsof order on the handling of the English Boundary Commission&apos;s reportwere expected to be raised that afternoon.   He believed that he couldshow that it had been handled with complete propriety throughout. InDecember 1982, he had acceded to the Commission&apos;s request for authorityto arrange for the eventual printing of their report by the StationeryOffice.    When, on 25 January, the Court of Appeal had dismissed theaction brought by the Leader of the Labour Party, Counsel for theCommission had told the Court that the report was then ready forsignature.    The Court had taken note of this without comment, but hadgranted a further temporary injunction restraining the Commission fromsubmitting their report to him, in order to allow the applicants topetition the House of Lords for leave to appeal.   The report had thenbeen signed and printed, and put into a secure warehouse.   After leaveto appeal had been refused by the House of Lords on Friday 11 February,the Commission had submitted the report formally, and he had seen it ,for the first time the following day.    He had read it in its entiretyover the weekend, and had decided that he should not propose anymodifications.    The Attorney General had confirmed that his decision tolay the report and the draft implementing Order before Parliament onMonday 14 February was in strict accord with the law, which requiredthe documents to be laid &quot;as soon as may be&quot; after receipt of the report.There might be some criticism of the fact that the draft Order had beenprepared and printed before the formal submission of the report; butthe substance of the Commission&apos;s recommendations had been publicknowledge since November 1982, and there was no reason why advancepreparations should not have been made.    The allegation made in a letterfrom Dr Edmund Marshall MP to the Lord Chancellor that the Home Secretaryhad had advance knowledge of the decision of the Appeal Committee of theHouse of Lords was entirely without foundation and should be robustlyrefuted; he had been informed by his office of the Committee&apos;s decisionby telephone late on Friday 11 February.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the failure tosecure approval for the Welsh draft Order would be greeted by theOpposition as a major success, and would encourage them to continue theirdisruptive tactics during the resumed debate on the Welsh draft Order,and on the subsequent draft Orders for England and Scotland.    The HomeSecretary and other Ministers concerned had behaved with completepropriety throughout, and no opportunity should be lost of stressing1CONFIDENT! Al
CONFIDENTIALpublicly the undemocratic nature of the campaign being mounted by theOpposition.    The Lord President of the Council, in consultation withthe Home Secretary and the Chief Whip, should consider further, in thelight of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion, the handling of future debates onthe Boundary Commissions&apos; recommendations.The Cabinet -1.

THE SECRETARY 0F STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES drew attention to articlesDoc ensit^ve     in The Guardian that morning which included a detailed report ofents discussions taking place in the Family Policy Group.    The same newspaperhad earlier carried reports clearly based on inside information ofpapers circulated to the Ministerial Group which was considering proposalson a scheme for educational vouchers.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that there wouldbe an inquiry to try to establish the source of these leaks.    In themeantime it was of the utmost importance that Ministers should take stepsto keep to an absolute minimum the numbers circulated in their Departmentsof copies of documents on sensitive issues issued by her Office and bythe Cabinet Office.    Cabinet Ministers should make themselves personallyresponsible for the security of any such documents sent to their PrivateOffices, and should lay down firm rules for their protection. Ifnecessary, officials who had to advise on papers of this kind, should berequired to read them in Private Offices.The Cabinet -i 2.     Invited all Cabinet Ministers to review the arrangement-sfor protecting sensitive documents in their Departments, asindicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of theirdiscussion.&apos; p0RElrMApRATp 2&apos;     THE PRIME MINISTER said that, with the Cabinet&apos;s concurrence, she&quot;&quot; proposed to send the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Malcolm Fraser, amessage in which she would convey their deep sympathy on the tragic lossUstralian         f life and extensive damage to property caused by the current bushUsh Fires        fires in Southern Australia.The Cabinet -1.

CONFIDENTIALMxd&lt;Ue East       THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE, MR HURD saidprev&gt; that there was no progress to report in the negotiations for the with-Ref l0US drawal of foreign troops from the Lebanon.   The British contingent toCCfRr?nCS 1 t*ie multinational force in Beirut was now operational and had establishedCo   1 a satlsfact;ory liaison with the adjacent Israeli units.   At the wish ofMin ns      the Lebanese Government there would be some small increase in the areaute 2 of the city for which the British contingent was responsible, followingthe Lebanese Army&apos;s assumption of control over East Beirut. Thearrangments for the proposed visit to London by the Arab League delegationheaded by King Hassan of Morocco remained uncertain.   King Fahd ofSaudi Arabia had not reacted as helpfully as had been hoped to the PrimeMinister&apos;s message, and was still withholding his agreement for visitsto Saudi Arabia by the Secretary of State for Trade and the Secretary ofState for Energy as well as by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.There would be an opportunity to explore the way forward withKing Hussein of Jordan when he visited London in the coming week.Meanwhile, although there was still no hard evidence of damage toBritish commercial interests in the Arab world as a result of thedifficulties which had arisen over the Arab League delegations&apos;s visit,the situation remained uneasy.Jj ^let THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE, saidn that one of the Deputy Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, Mr Ryzhov,p,.   . was making a routine visit to London for official talks with his oppositeftej   0us number in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Sir Julian Bullard.CC(Ro\nce: Such contacts had taken place regularly in previous years, although thereCon i had been none in 1982 in the aftermath of the declaration of martial lawUsions,      in Poland.    He would himself be seeing Mr Ryzhov.    Their talk woulde 2 concentrate on arms control and disarmament.   Other matters which wouldbe raised with Mr Ryzhov were the position of Mr Sakharov andMr Scharansky, and the payment of rates on the premises of the Soviettrade delegation in the London Borough of Camden.    The visit woulddemonstrate that working contacts with the Soviet Union were taking placewhich enabled the British Government to put its views to the Soviet Unionclearly and robustly.Isia     d THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE, said that theMinister for Overseas Development, Mr Raison, accompanied by members ofPrev- both Houses of Parliament (including Lord Shackleton and Lord Buxton ofR6fel0us Alsa), would be visiting the Falkland Islands for the forthcomingCc(o^fnce: celebrations to mark the 150th anniversary of the Islands coming underCon&quot;i   3rd        the British Crown.Illusions,1 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that some 600 next-of-kin (andtheir families) of servicemen killed in the Falkland Islands campaignwould be visiting the Islands from 9 to 11 April.   They would be flyingto Montevideo and completing the journey by ship.    There was likely tobe keen Press and media interest which would require careful handling. #The Cabinet -2.

CONFIDENTIAL^ternational   THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the meeting in Washington theSit nC!&quot;a^ previous week of the Interim Committee of the International Monetaryation Fund (IMF) had gone well.    The tactic of advancing it had provedprev. successful and made it possible to reach agreement much sooner thanRef l0US could otherwise have been hoped for on a number of useful measures. InCC(R^enCe: addition to the decisions taken in Paris in January to expand the GeneralCo   i    ^St        Arrangements to Borrow (GAB) from SDR 6.5 billion to SDR 17 billion, theMin    slons      meeting had agreed to increase the IMF quotas from SDR 61 billion toUte ^ SDR 90 billion; and, provided that the United States Congress agreed, thequota increase would be implemented by the end of 1983, which was twoyears ahead of the previous schedule.   As a result of his recent visitto Riyadh, the Saudi Arabian Government would also be making additionalfunds available in association with the enlarged GAB.   The effect of allthese arrangements would be to double the usable facilities availableto the IMF to help countries facing serious debt problems such asMexico.    The part which the United Kingdom had played in achievingthese arrangements would demonstrate to public opinion that theGovernment was taking effective action in response to the concernsexpressed in the second Brandt Report.The Cabinet -3.     Took note.aX?NITY 3-     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE reported that the Community hads reached an export restraint agreement with Japan covering a wide rangeof products.    There would be specific ceilings for video cassette^aPan recorders and large colour television tubes, but only a general under-taking on export moderation for other products such as machine tools^vious an&lt;* fork lift trucks.   At the United Kingdom&apos;s insistence, the agreement^ference* permitted the import of the kits that were needed to start manufactureCc(82) 50th       ^ video cassette recorders here.    It was of course welcome that theInclusions       Commission had taken any action, but the agreement did not amount to much,*&apos;llnute 3 and certainly did not justify ending the Community&apos;s complaint againstJapan under Article XXIII.2 of the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT).* IIn discussion, it was noted that the agreement would not affect theUnited Kingdom&apos;s existing voluntary restraint arrangements, although itwould provide some minor reinforcement.   The Japanese agreement to pricetheir exports at a level with Community products should not apply tovideo cassette recorder kits, because this would remove any incentive toimport them into this country.   The television manufacturers were likelyto be disappointed that the specific ceiling was restricted to largetubes, since this was likely to be of greater benefit to manufacturersin France and Germany.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinetagreed that the result of the Community&apos;s talks with Japan was unlikelyto bring very much benefit to this country and that the Commission wasnot entitled to take much pleasure in the outcome.    The Community&apos;saction against Japan under Article XXIII.2 of the GATT should bemaintained. &apos; IThe Cabinet -1.     Took note.ACONFIDENTIAL n _ I
CONFIDENTIALTrade with        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE reported that, after very heavy pressuren had&apos;been brought to bear on the Spanish Government by his officials, inpfe . the absence of any effective action by the Commission, a possible dealRef l0US between the European Community and Spain to improve access to the BritishCCf renCe:        markef&apos;for British cars had been reached the previous day.   This providedp    -&gt;.&gt; 2nd for duty quotas for the Community for two categories of cars:fusions, .lnute 3 10,000 cars of 2,000 to 2,600 cc at a reduced tariff of25 per cent instead of 36 per cent;4,000 to 5,000 cars of 1,300 to 1,600 cc at a reduced tariffof 20 per cent instead of 36 per cent.As a quid pro quo the Spaniards wanted the Government to persuadeBritish Leyland to discuss future industrial collaboration with theirSpanish subsidiary, and to do its best to prevent any interference withfuture exports of Sapanish cars here; they also sought an undertakingthat the United Kingdom would not raise any new issues relating to the1970 Agreement.    The arrangement had been deliberately aligned to favourBritish Leyland as against French and German manufacturers, and Spainhad indicated that they were ready to give British Leyland some preference.Overall, however, the proposals were very disappointing; they appliedonly 15,000 cars from the whole Community, and there would still be largetariff disparities, since the Community&apos;s tariff was only 4 per cent.The agreement would be worth accepting only if it were likely to beregarded by the industry and trade unions here as reasonable.    If it wasnot, an attempt would have to be made to secure a better deal, thoughhe saw little prospect of pushing the Spaniards further.   The problemwas that the United Kingdom had no independent ability to do anythingabout the inequalities under the 1970 Agreement; action had to be takenby the Community, and the Commission had probably been pushed as far aswas possible.    The only alternatives were those which had previously beendiscussed of either legislating to secure the necessary powers to act or Itaking illegal action.In discussion, it was suggested that, while it was something to havewrung any deal out of Spain, the present proposals were unsatisfactory.There had been skilful negotiations on the type of cars that would becovered, which would be helpful to the United Kingdom, but the quotasthemselves were small and the tariff disparities still too great. Itwas also noted that nothing had been done for automobile componentswhose manufacturers were also very concerned and on which there werealso tariff disparities.   The agreement could not be presented asoffering any assistance to the automobile industry in the West Midlands.It was suggested that a further effort should be made to improve theagreement; the United Kingdom had potential sources of leverage in theSpanish desire for British help in their accession negotiations withthe Community, in substantial British imports of Spanish wine andhorticultural products, and in the importance to Spain of tourists fromthis country.    Since the prospects of success were not good, as theMadrid Embassy had noted, it was important that public expectations ofsubstantial results should not be aroused. , I?5 HCONFIDENTIAL
IffCONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said the Cabinet agreedthat the Spanish proposals represented an inadequate response to theinequalities in the Community&apos;s 1970 Agreement with Spain which wouldnot be acceptable to the interests in this country, and that officialsshould press for further improvements, both on the size of the quotasand on the tariff reductions to be applied.The Cabinet -2.     Invited the Secretary of State for Trade to arrange fornegotiations between the European Community and Spain to bepursued with a view to securing improvements in the Spanishproposals, as indicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing upof .the discussion.^PAIRRIAL        4&apos;     THE SECRETARY 0F STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that a Committee of__ Inquiry on the water industry pay dispute had now been set up under theauspices of the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS).ater The Chairman was Dr Tom Johnston, Principal of Heriot-Watt University,^dustj-y Edinburgh; the member nominated by the employers was Mr Michael Bett,^ay the industrial relations board member of British Telecom; and the member^e8 tiati0ns     nominated by the trade unions was Mr Bill Keys, Joint General Secretaryof the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades.    It was hoped that the revious Committee&apos;s findings would be made known on Sunday 20 February, and thatTerence* a final meeting of the National Joint Industrial Council would take place&lt;&quot;C(83) 4t^        the following day to resolve the dispute and restore normal working.Inclusions      ACAS had secured assurances, which had been made public, from thelnute 4 employers and the trade unions that both would accept the resolution ofthe dispute through the process of the Committee of Inquiry.    In viewof the past history, however, it remained to be seen whether the tradeunions would abide by the assurances which they had given. Meanwhilethe number of households required to use standpipes had been increasingsteadily and had now reached 72,000; the number of those advised to boilwater was remaining at around 1{ million.In discussion, there was general agreement that it had been right toavoid the appointment of a judge as Chairman of the Inquiry.    It washoped that the employers&apos; nominee, although drawn from the public sector,would be made aware of the very different pay climate in many parts ofthe private sector, which was illustrated by the recent agreement ofworkers at the Hyster plant in Scotland to take a pay cut in order topreserve jobs.    It was regrettable that two Wages Councils had recentlyproposed high awards, on which representations were now being considered.Their Chairmen would need to be reminded of the link between pay levelsand employment.    The recently published average annual increase inearnings of 8.25 per cent was still too high by comparison with payincreases in West Germany and Japan.i6CONFIDENTIAL
