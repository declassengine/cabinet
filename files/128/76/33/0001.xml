The Prime Minister had made the&lt;y11^      British Government&apos;s views clear to the United States Assistantryy*\   Secretary of State, Mr Kenneth Dam in London, on 7 November.    In a&lt;y \&gt; public statement later that day President Reagan had said that there^/^would be no large-scale action:   any retaliation would be limited and^^/&apos;yarected against a specific and pinpointed target.na TftEAM^USTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE, said that thePtevi0u mi](vu Xjurita in Buenos Aires had announced its intention of handingRefere s over&lt;p&lt;5w^ to an elected Government headed by Senor Alfonsin onCC(83\ ^ Decgra&amp;Pv seven weeks earlier than originally planned.

In the forthcoming debate on theFalkland Islands^at^ie United Nations General Assembly, support for theBritish position \*a&gt;r^e5tpected to be on much the same scale as in the1982 debate.   Greec^j/aecision to abstain was an improvement which wouldbe helpful in encourajf^ag Italy and France to follow suit.   Mr Dam hadexpressed the view in^ORj^R that Argentina&apos;s recertification by theUnited States Administr^p^irKi&gt;as qualifying it to buy arms from theUnited States was now a forWSne conclusion, but that this did notnecessarily mean that Unit&quot;elKsrates arms supplies to Argentina would beresumed in the near future .\&gt;--^/\In discussion it was emphasise^tM^ an American decision to resumearms sales to Argentina would ha^y ^Lamaging effect on British opinionin the context of cruise missile iepj^ment.

The Chief^itiute 4 nS&apos;      Secretary, TreasurJK^nute of 18 October to the Prime Minister hadreported on progress towards those objectives.    Although good progress hadbeen made, there wer^^st^^ at that stage gaps to be bridged of some 1.1 billion in 1984-8^^.7 billion in 1985-86 , and  2.5 billion in1986-87.    There were outstanding issues on defence, agriculture, foreignaffairs, education, arts and libraries, and the nationalised energyindustries; and agreement had not been reached on local authority currentexpenditure in 1985-86 and 1986-87.   The Prime Minister had set up theMinisterial Group on Public Exp ^*k:ure (MISC 99) under his chairmanshipto try to resolve outstanding C(83) 34 reported the results ofthe Group&apos;s work.   Agreement had beefl^reached on all outstanding issuesother than the education and scieX^^^gramme .    The basis of theagreements was described in Annexes*^ral&quot;| B to C(83) 34.    The Cabinetwould wish to note in particular wha^j^^Lfceen agreed for the defenceprogramme.    It should also be noted th^Cm agreed savings on thenationalised industries for which the Department of Energy was responsibleassumed that the price of domestic gas would be increased by 5 per cent on .1 January 1984 , and the price of electrici^rbj^ per cent in 1984-85 and1985-86.    The Secretary of State for Energy b^^old MISC 99 that he woulduse his best endeavours to persuade the industries to make these priceincreases; but that he could not guarantee that they would agree.    If theydid not, -the Government had no statutory powers to force them to do so.One option would be to take such powers.   MISC 99 had not ruled out thatoption, which would however be a matter for the Cabine^fco consider. Hisown view was that, although legislation to take such powers would no doubtbe controversial, it was essential to keep open the possibility that itmight be introduced if it were needed.    To abandon the |E|jOTility wouldunnecessarily weaken the Government&apos;s negotiating positicM^^^k theThere were two issues on the education and science programme: Jf5PCtgrants, and university current expenditure.    The proposals originally putby the Secretary of State for Education and Science to MISC 99 fm*s^kLngsin this area had included the abolition of the minimum award. MISC^^P^thought that this was unlikely to be acceptable to the Cabinet and Tiadinvited the Secretary of State for Education and Science to advance
^ 1    SECRET    | H? lu alternative proposals.   These were described in Annex C to C(83) 34. They^T^Bl involved halving the minimum award, steepening the scale of parentalcontributions, and increasing the current value of student grants by 1 per^^?W      cent a year less than provided for in existing expenditure plans. These^ p     changes would be controversial, but the savings were essential; and he and^^^k the other members of MISC 99 were satisfied that the proposals were the^^^Mbest that could be devised.    On university current expenditure, MISC 99W^kelieved that reductions of  50 million a year in 1986-87 were feasible.^Pmfc baseline provision was nearly  1 ,450 million.    The Secretary of State^To^^ducation and Science agreed that reductions were feasible, but dida 1r%3nsider that the figure of  50 million was realistic.    The Secretaryof State for Education and Science also considered that such savings aswere achievable should be used to offset unavoidable cost increases and tofund improved provision elsewhere in the education programme.    The Cabinetwould need to decide this issue.If the raciimmendations in C(83) 34 were accepted, the objectives agreed bythe Cabinet would have been very nearly achieved.    Some small gapsremained; bl^^^^nderstood that Treasury Ministers considered that theycould be bricP^^y%hough admittedly with difficulty.    He wished to paytribute to all^^c^Wwho had taken part in the work of MISC 99 and toMinisters in charge of spending programmes for the hard work and spirit ofco-operation whichJB^made this result possible.;&apos;ati0n . ^fVergy   1S6d     THE MINISTER OF STATE, APARTMENT OF ENERGY, said that he and his^dustr. officials had had informal consultations with the gas and electricityles        supply industries.    In the light of them, he thought that the gas industrywas likely, although not yet certain, to agree to increase the price ofdomestic gas by 5 per cent as ^tffed by the recommendations of MISC 99.The electricity supply industrylMs^iikely to raise greater difficulties.It had recently been making very high profits, beyond what was required byits financial target, and was undefc^^^sures both internal and externalto reduce prices.    Until substantive^^ tiations with the industry hadbegun, it would be impossible to ass^^Jg^ serious the difficulties were.The Secretary of State for Energy woul^p^ rally use his best endeavoursto persuade the industry to accept the GJPjjfcment&apos;s view on prices. Buthe had no statutory power to require it to do so; and he wished to havediscretion to agree to proposals from the ^louMry which would produceequivalent savings: for example, the industr]j^Hyit be able to reducecosts through greater efficiency.In discussion the following main points were made -a. The electricity supply industry&apos;s current  ii^hcial target hadbeen set at a level which took full account of tBem^commendationsfor lower prices in a report by consultants.    Recent developments inthe economy might justify a more demanding target .^Rlj^^inly thelevel of profits in the industry was not high in rersj^roTto eitherturnover or capital.    On the other hand, the current  yrMtal targethad been set only a year ago; and it was undesirable to changetargets once they had been set.b. It would be wrong to attach too much importance to the^ps^ceof statutory powers over prices. Ministers had no power to s&amp;^r%external financing limits or financial targets for many of the
I I    SECRET    | Htit nationalised industries; but they did so, and the industries acceptedtheir actions.    To limit Ministerial activity to matters for whichI^ft^ there was specific statutory authority would be too restrictive.%_ %) c.     It would be important to keep open the possibility of legisla-^^^L tion, if that were needed to give effect to the Government&apos;s^^J) decisions on prices.    If Ministers appeared to concede that theycould not or would not legislate in this area, it would weaken the^P^^k   Government&apos;s standing with all the nationalised industries.    But it.   ?   jLwould be better to apply pressure through financial targets than by^^^?taking powers over prices.d.     It was open to question whether the electricity industry couldmake savings on a scale sufficient to replace the  210 millionadditional revenue in 1984-85 that would flow from the price increaseimpLi^^ in the recommendations of MISC 99.    It could be argued that,if M ^^vings were feasible, the industry should make them anyway,as a matter of good management, and still impose the price increase,which ufc^^^nore than was justified economically.THE PRIME MINI^jjraAsumming up this part of the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed ti^^e savings recommended in C(83) 34 in respect of thenationalised industries, for which the Department of Energy wasresponsible, must be found.    Although they noted that the Secretary ofState for Energy wis^a^^have some discretion in the way in which thesavings were achieved, J^^^ considered that the increases in gas andelectricity prices envisaged by MISC 99 were fully justified. Inparticular, the proposed electricity price increases avoided the risk,inherent in a price freeze, that subsequent price increases would have tobe more severe than was desirable.   The Secretary of State for Energyshould make strenuous efforts t^^^rsuade the gas and electricityindustries to accept the Government&apos;s views.    The difficulties likely to beencountered with the electricity industry were noted but theGovernment would, if necessary, hak^^^seek a revision of the financialtarget.    It was part of the industry^li^der standing with the Government,as reflected in the letter sent to t^^cj^irman of the ElectricityCouncil on his appointment, that its p^^Mshould be determined within thefinancial framework set by the Governmena^flbe possibility o  legislationshould not be excluded; but it ought to be feasible, as in many othermatters affecting nationalised industries       t^Lpast, to secure theGovernment&apos;s objectives by persuasion.    Any a^R^ional savings which theindustries were able to offer through increased efficiency would bewelcome but the Cabinet was not ready at this stage to regard them as asubstitute for desirable price increases.The Cabinet -1.     Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion and invited the Sec^^^^Lof State for Energy to be guided accordingly. k^^matld ScJ0n THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE said that the^^P^xence       recommendation in C(83) 34 for a reduction in university current^^expenditure of  50 million in 1986-87 was impracticable.    Some sav^^^^were feasible.    But they would be needed to offset unavoidable cost3
* I    SECRET |? 111 increases.    Savings on the scale proposed would require a combination of^^d|k the following measures: closing university departments: closing one or twouniversities; and cutting non-pay costs, which constituted only 35 per^^?^     cent of total current costs.    Legislation would be required to close a^ 1     university.    Alternatively, it might be possible to make savings by^^^k reducing staff.    But that would entail spending some  90 million in^^kAcompensation; and there was no provision for such expenditure. Whateverthe approach adopted, the universities would be certain to go back on^^%3^j-r agreement to take an additional 3,500 students within existing?exSbditure provisions.   He was committed to searching for all possible^onWnies and to raising private finance to defray the general expenditureof the universities, and not only specific items of research. Eventuallythese measures would lead to reductions in public expenditure.    But theycould not provide savings of the size or on the timescale proposed in0(83) 34.    If the Cabinet approved those proposals, it would be necessaryto announc^^rithin a matter of weeks, reductions in student numbers andlegislati^^kt^^close universities.In discussiok^j^^lollowing main points were made -e. Some^gj^p^rs of the Cabinet pointed out that the savingsproposed by MISC 99 amounted to only 3i per cent of the existingprovision.    It was not plausible to suggest that savings of this, order could not be found, especially as the universities would havethree years in l^icAto plan for them.    On the other hand, it wasargued that the u ^Vsities faced inescapable cost increases; andthat it was notoriously difficult, because of academic tenure, tomake reductions quickly in the university pay bill, which made up65 per cent of total current costs.f. It was argued that the estimate of  90 million redundancy costsput forward by the Secret MS*State for Education and Sciencemight be overstated.    It appeared to assume that all reductions fellon the pay bill.    Moreover, nkraM^wastage, even among academicstaff, was understood to be at  e^ate of 3 per cent a year. Ifonly one-third of the resulting^^cjAcies were pot filled, therewould be significant reductions i^P^Apay bill after three yearswithout redundancy costs.    Such an approach did not seemunreasonable:  it was, for example, t^PK^Kt that the student/teacherratio was lower in universities in th^k c^kntry than elsewhere inthe world. ^^^VTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposals in C(83) 34 on student grants.    Before adecision could be taken on the appropriate level of university currentexpenditure in 1986-87 more information was needed,   fjl^fc^ould discuss theissues separately with the Ministers most closely coim ^^.    It wasimportant to resolve them quickly, so that the Public Expenditure Surveycould be completed. &quot;^^^^LThe Cabinet - ^k^k.2. Approved the proposals in C(83) 34 regarding studentJ^pVgrants. V^w3. Took note that the Prime Minister would discuss with ^^^kthe Ministers most closely concerned the appropriate levelof university current expenditure in 1986-87.4_1    SECRET    |_290h
I    SECREf   | I* HtlPp of THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that in the light of the Cabinet&apos;sanJRS|^y discussion the totals of programmes and reserves now exceeded the&quot;,:&gt;r previously agreed objective by only  129 million in 1984-85,U(%^^       392 million in 1985-86, and between  290 million and  340 million in\\\[  p     1986-87, depending on what was eventually decided about universitycurrent expenditure.    He was most grateful to the Lord President of the^^LA Council and his other colleagues for achieving this.    He was hopeful that^F^p%be gaps could be bridged.    The details for 1984-85 would have to be^^^MiVered in his Autumn Statement on 17 November.    The latest forecasts of^so^^l security expenditure suggested that there would be additional^pewtiiture of  300 million in 1984-85.   Against that, the delay in theflotation of Enterprise Oil would provide additional resources in thatyear.    It was therefore probable that the planning total of just over 126 billion would be held.In f urthejr^^te cuss ion the following main points were made -g. The figures for the defence programme set out in Annex B toC(83) ^^^^d be represented as falling marginally short of thoserequirecrp^^ke Government&apos;s adherence to the North Atlantic TreatyOrganisat^p^Tjrget of 3 per cent a year real growth in the defencebudget up to and including 1985-86, depending on the methodology used.On the other hand it ought to be possible to present the Government&apos;srecord and pla^PO^a satisfactory light.h. The recommend^P^hs of the recent report by Mr Clive Priestleyinto the finances and efficiency of the Royal Opera House (ROH) andthe Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) should be accepted, and theresulting expenditure charged to the contingency reserve.    This wason condition that the two institutions accepted Mr Priestley&apos;srecommendations on possibLe^ rings and on improvements in financialmanagement.    It was for consideration whether money should also befound for increased funding for certain other operatic companieswhose financial difficulties^^ftM^o less acute than those of theROH and the RSC.    Such increase^^pding could help to make theproposed increases for the ROH ^^IfeRSC more politicallyacceptable, and the companies con^Hnfl would certainly argue that ascrutiny would show their need to. bfW^^^ess.    On the other hand thePriestley Report related only to the ROH and the RSC; and therecommendations defined specific areal^f oMsavings and improvedefficiency. ^^^^i. The material in Annex E to C(83) 34 on the split betweencurrent and capital expenditure was not satisfactory.    It would bedesirable to have better material when the Government&apos;s expenditureplans were published, but it was difficult to Pr ^^| such material.The Treasury depended for information on Departn T^Lmany of whichhad not yet completed allocating reductions in thK^Bkogrammesbetween current and capital expenditure.    Moreover^pkV^^ublicaccounting conventions on the distinction between cur^pr and capitalexpenditure were not satisfactory.THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up this part of the discussion,  sajpjjkt theCabinet were most grateful to the Lord President of the Council^^EJkothermembers of MISC 99, and Ministers responsible for expenditure pra^ramesfor their contributions to the successful outcome of the 1983 ?ubljd^^%Expenditure Survey.

Ill expenditure in 1986-87, the recommendations in C(83) 34 were approved.Additional expenditure resulting from acceptance of the recommendations ofMr Priestley on the finances and efficiency of the ROH and the RSC would^^pw      be charged to the contingency reserve.    Proposals for parallel increasesM     in provision for certain other operatic companies should be discussed^^^L between the Minister for the Arts and the Chief Secretary, Treasury.^^^%Although the Cabinet recognised the difficulty of providing material onthe split between capital and current expenditure, it was important tomake satisfactory information available.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury^sh^^d give thought to how this could be done, and circulate proposals toJBr%abinet, at an early stage of the 1984 Public Expenditure Survey.Meanwhile, Departments should, as a matter of urgency, send to theTreasury any further information they might have, so that it could becollated and circulated to the Ministers concerned as briefing materialfor use when the Chancellor of the Exchequer made his Autumn Statement.The line g\\{\\f^ taken in response to enquiries from the media about theprogress m^ffj  Survey should be that the Cabinet had completed theirconsideration of public expenditure for the period 1984-85 to 1986-87, andthat only oi^CT^^^wo very minor points remained to be cleared up outsideCabinet; tharrpTrtmne plans for 1984-85 would appear in the AutumnStatement the ^i^^^ng week; and that full details for all three yearswould be publish^P^^due course as usual in the Public Expenditure WhitePaper.
