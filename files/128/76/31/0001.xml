^ ICQNFIDENTIALl HAFFjj2g^N^ARY     1 .     The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in thefr/y\ House of Commons during the following week.^yh&gt;      THE PRIME MINISTER said that the debate on 31 October on the&lt;X/^\   deployment of intermediate range nuclear forces would be a difficult\\_y)  one.    It was necessary for the Government to explain their policy^-^VOfully and firmly and to secure an overwhelming vote in support.W I^^AlRS ^VV^E MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE^ (BAmN$5S YOUNG), said that the Prime Minister of Dominica, Mrs Charles,Gren . had&lt;&lt;l^fl&amp;ed that the Governor General of Grenada, Sir Paul Scoon, hada reque^iea military assistance from the Organisation of East CaribbeanPrevi0 StatesCo^jECS) prior to the current military intervention in the island.Refe_ Us The QueeA had no knowledge of any such request and a statement wasCC(83)n!re: being issued by Buckingham Palace to this effect.   There wereCoticiu T   n        conflicting reports as to whether the Governor General had made anyHinut s^ ns,       request for assistance before the intervention or had welcomed it afterit had taken /lac^)&apos; but the British Government had had no knowledge ofany such reques33/dJJ3Nthere was no firm evidence that one had been made.The Governor GenerajJwas now back in Grenada.THE MINISTER OF STA^ytfk THE ARMED FORCES said that aftersome initial Americaa^rad^ctance there had now been a meeting betweenthe United States force^eo^aander and the senior Royal Navy officerin the area at which it &lt;3*jc&lt;p&amp;een made clear that the United States forcehad encountered much fieM^ryresistance on Grenada than had beenexpected.   There had proved-^cP^e more than a thousand Cuban combattroops on the island, and 1&lt;YAU  red States helicopters had been lost inthe fighting.    The Americans^^ifteved that Cuban troops were withdrawingto camps in the interior with a/^*efXto carrying on guerilla warfare.A consular team from the Britisn H gtv&gt;Commission at Bridgetown headedby the Deputy High Commissioner rad^rfex yet been allowed access toGrenada, but six United Kingdom naw^rtSEB had been evacuated underAmerican arrangements .the previous.davy&apos;/Heanwhile an Royal Air ForceHercules aircraft from Belize was in i^froados on a contingency basisin case it was needed for evacuation purposes.In discussion it was emphasised that no formal request for militaryassistance had been received by the United Kipj 3bm from the OECS.Oral statements by the Prime Minister of Barb(adost) (which was not a memberstate of the OECS) to the British High CommisVi^^rxyn Bridgetown thatsuch a request would be made in writing on 23 Oarob^r^had not beenfollowed up and had been overtaken by the meeting^rifaVday of theCaribbean Community (Caricom) at which there had beetK^/majoritydecision in favour of the application of political aM^o^nomicsanctions to Grenada but against any military interventjjxfe. There hadbeen intensive contact between the British Embassy in W*# ivSJton andthe United States Administration over the weekend of 22-^M_^02fcober,and the Americans had given no&apos; indication that a decision j^O^tervenemilitarily was imminent.   When the British Deputy High Comm&amp;sso^Jfterin Barbados accompanied by two American consular officials ha^oLn.edon the Governor General of Grenada on 23 October the Governor G^neSaJ.,_. %&gt; ?^ [confidential! % ?
[confidential! H/W had made no request for military assistance.    It appeared that thel//&gt; provisional American decision to launch the military intervention^y&lt;y\       had been taken on the afternoon (Washington time) of 24 October,^&quot;v^J^     at a meeting which ended very shortly after the Prime Ministerreceived President Reagan&apos;s first message;    and the final decisionwO) had been taken shortly thereafter.   Concern was expressed at theV_^/Vailure of the United States Administration to take the BritishM^^C&amp;iyernment into its confidence about their plans for intervention,\&gt; y&amp;yich must have been prepared well in advance of the decision to^ijaj^ament them.   At the same time it was recognised that securityWnsiaerations would have necessitated keeping such plans-as secretas/(5os^ible.   From an American perspective the intervention mightwel^^ppe^r politically justified, but it was hard to defend intemS-^f/international law and difficult to reconcile with thecontenvwr that the United States and the North Atlantic TreatyOrganisation threatened no one.   There was no comparison withBritain&apos;s military action in the Falkland Islands, which had beentaken in defence of international law and to protect British citizens.The American action in Grenada had struck a powerful anti-Americanchord with Br i/pfslY\ public opinion.   Many of the Government&apos;s ownsupporters werx^Jifespy at the inadequacy of the consultation whichhad preceded the[American decision and the Government&apos;srefusal to condemHT^/dutright.     But, despite its membershipof the CommonwealtK%tt^link with the Crown, Grenada wasa fully independent (^ttw in which British interests were notdirectly engaged and K5r\jw^ch the United Kingdom Government had noresidual responsibility-/^ftikre had been no obligation on theUnited States to seek Brirctsn)advice, or to accept it if sought;nor was condemnation approp*j^k as between close allies.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing ok/H^discussion, said that there wasno need to rake over the detaflee^vents leading up to the militaryintervention in Grenada.   The Goveroi^nt had received no formal requestfor assistance from the OECS and wad^ade their reservations about theproposed action clear to the United/SSjflHes Government.   That advicehad been sound.    The United States r^^Ojair part had exercised their-right to take a different view on an which directly touched theirnational interests.   But Britain&apos;s friendship with the United Statesmust- on no account be jeopardised.   The position taken by the Foreignand Commonwealth Secretary in the House of Commons, on which he was tobe congratulated, had struck the right balance^^It would not beconsistent with that position to join the United States in voting againstthe draft resolution condemning the American a^ifS^which Guyana wastabling in the United Nations Security Council, (rfut/it would be rightfor Britain to abstain - expressing to the UniteV-Jrawes Governmentthe hope that the United States might likewise see^fij^ja abstain onthe Argentine-sponsored resolution about the FalklarW^^T^nds, forwhich they were likely to vote in favour.   If British hMp^ere soughtto organise free elections in Grenada, the request coul&lt;3^^0\onsidered.Meanwhile, however, Britain should avoid becoming involv^_^/ hel                                    confidential &lt; n^_ -&apos;_2$0M
^ [confidential! H% I&lt;y1 The Cabinet -&lt;/\C\&gt; 1      Invited the Minister of State, Foreign andCommonwealth Office, to send instructions to the&lt;Cy^\ United Kingdom Permanent Representative to theNX^J/ United Nations in the terms indicated by theyv\       Prime Minister in her summing up.an n THE^M^NISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE, said thattreeE&lt; ?eign Ministers of the states contributing to themulvfa^CLonal force (MNF) in the Lebanon were meeting in Paristhat i^v^^The purpose of the meeting was to demonstrate that thecontrrtt^fng states would not be deterred by the attacks against theUnited Spates and French contingents which had taken place on23 October;   and, looking further ahead, to consider how best tocreate conditions in which the MNF could properly be withdrawn.Meanwhile, the/ 5a.sefire was holding.   The Greek and Italian observerforce would n&lt;D  b^) in place for some days.THE MINISTER OF H^AJWTi&apos;OR THE ARMED FORCES said that the Commanderin Chief, United RrjS^Lom Land Forces, General Sir Frank Kitson, hadreturned the previouy/^ak from a visit to the British contingentto the MNF and had satfifof^ed a valuable report.   His recommendationsfor improving the securiry^&gt;f the British contingent were beingimplemented urgently.   TJ^^aasin improvement would be to divert theroad which at present ranA^LoAgside the British headquarters andwhich carried traffic of th^^od which had been used in the suicidalattacks on the American andNxrepclfi contingents.    In addition, actionwould be needed to improve tn^tff&amp;ttity of the offices of theBritish Embassy, where some Ame *&amp;as\diplomatic officials were alsoaccommodated.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the^i-Sen^sion, said that all themeasures necessary to improve the Sectorl^ of British military andcivilian personnel in the Lebanon must^e taken without delay.&apos; The Cabinet -2.

THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE (BARONESSZUp2&gt; YOUNG) , said that the discussion of the post-Stuttgart negotiationsCo^C^^vX.        at the Anglo-French Summit on 20-21 October had been conducted in a^ud8etrCi&lt;&gt;      Sood atmosphere.   The French had remained firm in opposing theUnite(j &lt;3$^\   concePc  f net contributions and the strict financial guideline forKingd    (Sj)  agricultural expenditure.    It seemed clear, however, that theyR6fUn^m   v-^AAPxpected to make concessions on the correction of the budget inequity^\\A)a return for some relaxation of United Kingdom demands on agriculturalPtevi V/fjP/611^11^. Prench were keen to find some common ground on newRef    Us        ^y^t^cies, particularly in the industrial sphere.   Further contactsCC(83\n5e:        4*&quot;e&gt;heing arranged.   There had also been some discussion,of theClonci    . tn      p^ gre&gt;6 of the post-Stuttgart negotiations at the informal meeting ofMinutgS^0ns      Commn^t^ Foreign Ministers on 22-23 October.THE MfflOTl OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE, also reportedthat th^VEuropean Parliament would now be voting on the inclusion ofthe United Kingdom&apos;s 1983 refunds in the 1984 budget.    It was expectedthat they would vote to put the 1983 refunds and 5 per cent of theagricultural budget provision into the reserve chapter.THE OlANCELLOliWJlttE EXCHEQUER said that in the margins of theCouncil of Ministers)\Finance) on 24 October he had learnt that theGermans were plamijrte^fto table an unhelpful rival paper to the UnitedKingdom&apos;s own paperC^V^fehe budgetary &quot;safety net&quot;.   He had toldHerr Tietmeyer, the \&amp;&amp;?&amp;L German Chancellor&apos;s Personal Representative,of his objections.   TKe^nne Minister had also approved an approachby Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassad^xin Bonn.   As a consequence, the Germanshad deferred the tabling &lt;^tneir paper and had made a more carefuloral presentation.   He expkr^B^Nto have further discussions with&apos;Herr Tietmeyer on 31 OctobefV\&gt;v.THE PRIME MINISTER said that nVNegotiating prospects for the EuropeanCouncil on 5-6 December did notWee^v^o be improving.   In addition,the French considered that, if tlwev^re no agreement at Athens inDecember, the difficulties of compi&lt;j rf &amp;c\ could be greater in theperiod running up to the European Vkf^aaasnt elections.The Cabinet - \\Took note.Cabinet Office &lt;^^\ ^|October 1983 &lt;^^^)[confidential] I
