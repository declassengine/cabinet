^ [confidential! I^^||MENTARY    1.     The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the\^v^ House of Commons during the following week.Ik I?APFAirs X*y\ THE F0REIGN ^ COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the United StatesV^v\ Secretary of State, Mr Shultz, had expressed regret to him at theGrenada   NV/J^ited States Government&apos;s failure to consult the British Government^/^rarlier about American plans to intervene in Grenada.   The failure hadPrevi0 xV^T1 due lar ely t0 preoccupation with the terrorist attack on theRef6r   S       ^fldited States force in the Lebanon on 23 October.    The militaryCC(83) 3?&apos; irrtjirr^ention by the United States and certain Caribbean countries inCoticiu &apos;^St       Gr&apos;ep^d-^ now appeared to be in its final stage, although there was stillHiuute 2 ns      some^un^eertainty about the degree of continuing guerilla resistance.The m    &amp; States had announced its intention of withdrawing its forcesas soony^s^ossible.   Meanwhile the Governor General, Sir Paul Scoon,was mor^^irmly in the saddle and had declared his intention of formingan interim Administration of non-political figures to prepare the wayfor elections which, on the basis of present information, were unlikelyto prove practicable before the spring of 1984.   The Foreign andCommonwealth Off^Sfe. was in close touch with the United StatesAdministration f^d^ith the Secretary General of the Commonwealth,Mr Rampha1, abon ydevklopments in Grenada, and was exercising an importantmoderating inf luebJQ ^on American decisions.   Although it was not clearhow far the CaribbeaJ^iountries involved in the military interventionwould welcome a Comm^rive^^th initiative, the Secretary General of theCommonwealth was explo^rfgN^he possibility of putting together aCommonwealth &quot;interim seemly presence&quot; in Grenada if one were requested.Canada, New Zealand and pj^ire^Viy Australia would be willing tocontribute, but India was Nte^/helpf ul and there would be Latin Americanobjections, notably from Ven&amp;^^a, to British participation. TheGovernment therefore needed ok ^sprfYoach the question more cautiously thansome of its supporters in Parl^rtom^ would like; .but a cautiouslypositive reply to Mr Ramphal wou^^bV\appropriate.   Meanwhile theGovernor General had accepted the fi tfe*nment&apos;s offer to resume bilateralaid to Grenada and  2 million had bee^earmarked for this purpose.The British Regional Aid Team in the ^c2bbean would be visiting Grenadashortly, together with a police adviseV/a d the United Kingdom would beready if asked to help with the organisation of free and fair electionson the island.   He would be announcing nfcese measures in the House ofCommons that afternoon.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND, r^po^ting on his visit tothe United States, said that the close relatictdsh^between the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom did not appear to^^eybeen seriouslydamaged by the difference of view between the two^Goy^nments overGrenada, despite some grumbling among the American ^Jwlic at what wasseen as Britain&apos;s failure to support the United Statejr^nXthe way that theAmericans had supported Britain over the Falkland Islajjd^^The weightof opinion in the American media was highly critical of Pr^ident Reagan&apos;sdecision to intervene in Grenada, largely because journa^Kr^sSNhad notbeen allowed to accompany the United States forces who lan e /j?ri Grenada.But the Democratic Party, which had been opposed to the AmerioArrointervention, was now cautious of criticising it in view of \ &amp;/?Jgroundswell of public approval for the President&apos;s action. Wtf 1^m&gt; Xornot the intervention would be seen as a success for the Presiden^^oUid._l. %ma I confidential] %
^ [confidential! H% Il/y now depend largely on the speed with which American forces could now bewithdrawn from the island.   Present thinking in Washington about thisI ^^^^    appeared over-optimistic.&lt;^j) THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that priority inx^^v^he allocation of aid funds should normally be given to British&lt;^Vc&lt;aionies for which the Government had a continuing and direct responsibility!\\paxher than to countries where that responsibility had ended.    It would&lt;*^^5$ef erable for the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary not to mentionaC^pe/Afic figure for British aid to Grenada in his Parliamentarysta(y?m&amp;tp.   The Cabinet agreed that any British commitment to Grenadain trarfs^af police, technical assistance or other personnel should befor aC^fj&amp;ted period only.The&lt;^binet - j^^t1.     Took note.?k ITHE FOREIGN AND C0KMOWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had been to ParisPrevi0 on ^ October for^a^sOwith the Foreign Ministers of the other threeRefe   Us countries contributrj*g%4&gt; the Multinational Force (MNF) in the LebanonCC( 3^nce:        and that national rec p^4Xation talks between the main Lebanese^ nclu ?1 St       political groups had sial^ejUin Geneva on 31 October. AlthoughHinutes^0ns,     President Gemayel was shotf^jf^Xsome readiness to compromise, the attitudesof the other participants&lt;^Tj\e talks was less clear, and it was toosoon to judge whether theys&amp;i^ktXlead to the formation of a viableLebanese Government which wcK^cV^Mke it possible for the MNF to bewithdrawn.   The ceasefire vas\sJpAA holding, despite repeated infringements,!and the United Kingdom contingeinY/^tfkthe MNF was still providing the guardfor the Ceasefire Security Commir^ee^^ Recommendations for improvingthe security of the British Embassy^ip/Beirut had been received and wouldbe implemented as soon as possible. &lt;/  e&amp;Ni.ng to the longer term, therewas a worrying divergence of approacn^ACween the United States and theother three contributors to the MNF abcu /the creation of conditions inwhich the force could be withdrawn: thexawere signs that the UnitedStates might wish to retain a military presence in the Lebanonindefinitely.   Meanwhile there was a risk that the Americans werecontemplating large scale retaliation, possibly^ncluding action againstthe Iranians, for the terrorist attacks on theZ/fone^ican and French MNFcontingents on 23 October, thereby increasing Els/fEseat to the Britishcontingent.    Efforts were being made to persuade ff^ieJAmericans to confineany retaliatory action to the terrorist group dirWe^wresponsible forthe attack, if that could be clearly identified. &lt;/lCy\.

fa [CONFIDENTIAL! H. O I^fyX THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the elections inPrevitf\\\      Argentina on 30 October had resulted in the defeat of the Peronists andRefe^v&gt;/&gt;     a decisive victory for the Radical Party under Senor Alfonsin.   The newI? CC(83) Government were not due to assume office until January 1984, but thereConciu . were signs that the military junta was preparing to hand over powerMinute ^on^^/^arlier.   Although the Radicals would face severe difficulties with thew^^cvades union movement, the decisiveness of their election victory\y^ fered the country some hope of greater stability.   There was unlikely^U^&amp;.any significant change in Argentina&apos;s attitude to the Falklandt^la^ttfe; but Senor Alfonsin had been opposed to the Argentine invasionand/th  e might now be some slackening of the Argentine military threatto th^e^U&apos;lands.   There was however no incentive for the incomingGoverrarayt to declare a formal cessation of hostilities.   At the UnitedNations^/^everal of Britain&apos;s Community partners were looking forexcuses ^^0 enable them to support the Argentine draft resolution andthe Foreign and Commonwealth Office was making intensive efforts toprevent this.    Indications that the United States was moving towards aresumption of aras^sales to Argentina were also increasing, despite thefurther adverseYcoinsequences this was bound to have for theUnited States/DiEJ^LejtSKingdom relationship in the aftermath of Grenada.In discussion it wks^a^gued that the advent to power of a democraticallyelected Government irf^p^ntina would make international opinion lesssympathetic to the Br^ravNGovernment&apos; s continued refusal to enter intoany form of negotiatiow^wittkArgentina.   The high cost to the Britishdefence budget of defendkJ&amp;^He Falkland Islands, now running at about 500 million a year, was aTsoHikely to command less public support athome as the military actioV-fc^*Xcover the islands receded. Considerationshould therefore be given tcv h$jpossibility of indicating some readiness &apos;to engage in talks with the n&amp;^ ^entine Government on subjects other thansovereignty over the Falkland IsAtfirtt^.   As against this it was arguedthat it would be unacceptable to^otjrr^ into any negotiations withArgentina as long as the Argentine^Gav^rnment refused to declare a formalcessation of hostilities; that sovew igj Ey was the only issue aboutwhich the Argentines would be prepare^y^OAegotiate and no concession -onthat could be contemplated; and that, w^the light of Argentine history,there could be no confidence that a democratically elected Governmentwould remain in power long enough to be a valid negotiating partner.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion,/ 2$d that it was rightfor the Government to welcome the accession tcfmow^r in Argentina of ademocratically elected regime.   But there cou1o^.^t5S. question ofentering into negotiations with Argentina on the que^sxAftn of sovereigntyover the Falkland Islands.   Although there was no^^rfdnce that the newArgentine Government was contemplating a debt repud? ara j&gt;\ a decisionby the United States Government to resume arms sales^^W^fft^entina wouldmake it necessary for the Government to reconsider Briti^^articipationin the arrangements for an international commercial loanC^jxj/Mgentinawhich was being negotiated in conjunction with the aid to\^ ^jla deavailable by the International Monetary Fund.

Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, in&lt;yyC\ consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, toreview the Government&apos;s policy towards debt relief forArgentina in the flight of the considerations mentionedandaAr^Inent       THK^^ETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the meeting of the NuclearContro^ Plan^wfg-^Jroup of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation which he hadjust a^jSided in Ottawa had reaffirmed support for the Alliance&apos;s twinPrevi0u track d^jO^ylon of November 1979 and for the planned deployment programme^eferenc ^0r cru^v\ anc* Pershing 2 missiles.   The first consignment of cruiseCC(83) 3n :        missiles ror the United Kingdom would be arriving shortly and he wouldConciUs.   h       inform Parliament when that happened.   Meanwhile deliveries of the^itiutg 2 nS&gt;     related equipmeafc-ware proceeding.   The security situation at theGreenham CommoifYbase was under control and the level of public protestthere less thanv^Tadj^ljeen feared.   Measures for the protection of theouter perimeter we^e Ikequate and it would be undesirable to intensifythem further.   He x2^y?Sd that the inner defences round the missilesthemselves were impregnable.   As the same time it was important, not leastin order to deter terr^^^e, that the public should understand thatattempts to penetrate ma^e^efences would have in the last resort to be,and would be, met with fo  i^\ The Nuclear Planning Group meeting hadalso agreed on a measure d^gyaat importance in the arms control context,which had unfortunately beeiv-^M^shadowed in the media by developmentsin Grenada: this was the dec\^Qiv&gt;to reduce the Alliance&apos;s stockpile ofnuclear warheads in Europe by^fsfibb hringing the stockpile to its lowestlevel for 20 years.   This was add^ d^nal to the earlier withdrawal of1,000 warheads, and went very suDstapt^ally beyond the commitment enteredinto at the time of the December lY79/^cision to ensure that one warheadwas withdrawn for every one of the 5/&gt;-j^)iiise or Pershing 2 missilesdeployed.   It was thus an ef fective .demwis&gt;$:ation of the importancewhich the Alliance attached to arms conrcel and disarmament. TheBritish Government had played an influenzal part in securing Americanagreement to this decision.The Cabinet -i [confidential] C^vf&gt; I

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that his talks with the.^Z/A Italian Foreign Minister on 31 October had shown that Signor Andreotti had?o^^-yA^ not yet fully turned his mind to Community affairs.

After some initial hesitation, it had been opposed by themajorr^j^v the European Democratic Group in the Parliament. TheUnited Kljfed^m would have an opportunity to put matters right at theBudget Codicil on 22 November.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Germans had now tabled their .paper on future financing and the budget inequity but that, followinghis discussions i^t&amp;SHerr Tietmeyer, the State Secretary in the German IMinistry of Finance Vit had been corrected in a number of ways morehelpful to the UnSfwtfyingdom.   It still, however, envisaged thepossibility of a sol^X-iopAwhich was not based on net contributions, eventhough the Germans ac^rowLedged that this would be the best basis.The Cabinet - ^^^&gt;Took note.       - &lt;^^^)AJfA-lRS TSE secretary of STATE FOR&lt;^felKMENT said that modestly encouraging^&quot; unemployment figures for October WreXko be released later that day,Vrripi showing a fall of 73,000 in the gra(^ ^tal since September; the^gutes^81^   seasonally adjusted figure was a f all^^AO ,000.
