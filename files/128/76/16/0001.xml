CONFIDENTIAL fSpARUTl0N       THE PRIME MINISTER said that, following consultations with a number ofAnd r    AMENT   colleagues the previous day, she had decided to ask The Queen for a veryF^jr kNERAL       early dissolution of Parliament, so that a General Election could beON held.    Political and press speculation had reached a point where con-tinued uncertainty   could have serious consequences for the economy andin financial and exchange markets.    There were some arguments in favourof 23 June as the date for the General Election; but that would implyan interval of six weeks before the Election, and in her view and thatof the colleagues with whom she had discussed the matter that would betoo long an interval.    Accordingly, subject to the approval of Cabinet,she would seek an Audience with The Queen at 12.30 pm that day, andask for the dissolution of Parliament on Friday 13 May.    As soon asshe returned from the Palace, advance notice would be given to theleaders of the Opposition parties and to the Speaker.    The dissolutionwould be announced in a statement to the press soon after 2.00 pm.Parliament would be dissolved on 13 May without prior prorogation. TheGeneral Election would be held on Thursday 9 June.    The House of Commonswould re-assemble for the election of the Speaker and for swearing innew Members on Wednesday 15 June, and The Queen would open the newParliament in state on Wednesday 22 June.At 3.30 pm this afternoon the Lord President of the Council would tellthe House of Commons that he hoped to make a business statement laterin the day.    There would then be conversations in the usual channelswith a view to seeing what business could be completed before dissolution.The Cabinet would meet at 11.00 am on Tuesday 10 May to clear outstandingbusiness, including papers on local government finance and structure,and on proposals to deal with recent reports from the Armed Forces PayReview Body, the Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Pay Review Body and the TopSalaries Review Body.    The Cabinet would also deal with any otheroutstanding business, including certain questions on the reform of tradeunion law.In discussion, it was suggested that it might be desirable to postponethe publication of the report of the Top Salaries Review Body on thepay of Members of Parliament and Ministers until after the dissolution;but it was pointed out that it was known that the report had beenreceived and the Lord President of the Council had undertaken that itwould be published during the course of this week.    The Cabinet agreedthat, in the light of this commitment and of the speculation alreadybuilding up, there was nothing to be gained by deferring publicationuntil after dissolution.    The Cabinet would consider at the followingday&apos;s meeting the line to be taken by the Government in response tothe reportTHE PRIME MINISTER said that she had recently received a report fromthe Security Commission on the case of Geoffrey Prime, and she proposedto publish the report and probably to make a statement by way ofWritten Answer before the dissolution.THE CHIEF WHIP said that it would be necessary to pass before dissolutionan Appropriation Bill, which he hoped could be taken virtually on thenod, and a Finance Bill.    The Finance Bill now before the House wouldbe re-committed, and Committee Stage completed on the floor of the House.1. CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIt was hoped that the Opposition would facilitate the passage of theBill.    It was also hoped to dispose before dissolution of the.   Importation of Milk Bill, the Education (Fees and Awards) Bill, theMental Health (Amendment)(Scotland) Bill (Lords), the Dentists Bill(Lords), the Health and Social Services and Social Security AdjudicationsBill (Lords), the Local Authorities (Expenditure Powers) Bill and theMarriage Bill  (Lords); and of the following Bills currently underconsideration in the House of Lords: the Agricultural Holdings.(Amendment)(Scotland) Bill, the County Courts (Penalties for Contempt)Bill, the Miscellaneous Finance Provisions Bill, the Mobile Homes Bill,the National Heritage Bill and the Ports (Reduction of Debt) Bill. Hewould see if it was possible also to dispose of at least part of theData Protection Bill and of the Social Security and Housing BenefitsBill, though it was uncertain whether the Opposition would agree to thelatter.    The Housing and Building Control Bill, the TelecommunicationsBill and the Police and Criminal Procedure Bill would fall.In discussion, it was agreed not to seek to proceed with any part ofthe Data Protection Bill before the dissolution.THE PRIME MINISTER said that major public appointments which had notbeen announced before today would have to be held up until after theElection.    That would include the proposed appointment of a newChairman of the British Steel Corporation to take effect in September1983.    She would shortly be circulating guidance on this and otherquestions of procedure and conduct which might arise during the Electioncampaign.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the United Kingdom would be representedat the Economic Summit Conference at Williamsburg on 28-30 May. Shehoped that it would be possible for her to go herself; but, if theOpposition sought to accuse her of using the Economic Summit fordomestic political advantage, the United Kingdom might have to berepresented by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary or the Chancellorof the Exchequer.The Cabinet -Approved the Prime Minister&apos;s proposal to ask The Queenfor a dissolution of Parliament on Friday 13 May with aview to a General Election being held on Thursday9 June 1983.Cabinet Office9 May 1983iCONFIDENTIAL
