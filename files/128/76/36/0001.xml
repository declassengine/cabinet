It was planned that the House of/// Commons should rise for the Christmas Adjournment on Thursday22 December until Monday 16 January 1984.E^tt  a  . \C/W SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he now expected to beNu         *    &lt;^wn^erviewed on independent television immediately after the film &quot;TheAtt    r \ ^7After&quot; **ad been transmitted on Saturday 10 December.   This was toack w^rekn not as the exercise of a right of reply, but as a chance toj&gt;  . . speak^nd redress the balance.   It would be followed by a discussionevious programme in which he would not take part.J^erence:WlQ te l Too^ote.^IGN 2.     THE MINIST^OTSTATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE(BARONESS Y0UNGrp/^W\ that the Prime Minister had sent a short^t personal message c^-SejiQr Alfonsin to mark his inauguration asg^ntina President of Argent3&lt;jJa^oj^ 10 December and a note would be transmittedpt   , to the new Argentine ^a^raunent through the Swiss recording thej^*vious British position on va ibgs^aspects of bilateral relations between theCc(!&gt;rence:        two countries.   No represero^fcive of the British Government would) 34th      attend the inauguration. &lt;^e)covernment&apos;s policy of standing firmHir.C       ns&apos;     over the Falkland Islandswaae^king ready to make progress in bilateralute 2 relations with the new Argeri^n^^Cpvernment had been generally welcomedin Parliament.   Among the issu^&lt;tokfluiring consideration in the lightof the restoration of democracy /MK^gentina was the possibility of areciprocal lifting of import restrictions and the possible declarationof a 200 mile fisheries zone around&gt;^re[Falkland Islands.   There couldbe no question of any change in the ^^rcrnment&apos;s arrangements for thedefence of the Falkland Islands, inclu^n^the construction of the .airfield.   The Cabinet would be considering in due course a paperby the Chancellor of the Exchequer examining the implications for-   British bank lending to Argentina of possible American arms sales.There had been an exchange of messages between^gesident Reagan andthe Prime Minister about the United States Gov| rn$ent&apos; s decision torecertify Argentina as a country qualified on nXto^S^rights groundsto buy arms from the United States, and Presidenc^gagan had givenassurances that there would be full consultation wi^yVthe BritishGovernment before any major arms sales to Argentina^were^uthorised.The Vice President of the United States, Mr Bush, wou^^&amp;so bestressing to the new Argentine Government the need for a^JMsmalcessation of hostilities with the United Kingdom when h^^nsmtedBuenos Aires for Senor Alfonsin&apos;s inauguration. \^//\confidential
CONFIDENTIAL | HIn discussion it was pointed out that although American recertification\\-//^ of Argentina might be legitimate, any sale of arms would be highlyX/jl objectionable and would be bound to fuel hostility to the United States[lyy\     in Parliament.   A suggestion that the Government was involved inconsultation with the American authorities about such sales would behighly damaging.   As against this, the offer of consultation indicated&lt;///yan American wish to take account of British views and might afford\x_y% portunities to mobilise American pressure on Argentina to declare a&lt;/^exjsation of hostilities.   The United States were in any case aware\\tna$ the Government had acquiesced in the sale of German warships toirltgrikina which contained engines of British manufacture.THE&lt;$RIMk MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the aim mustbe to&lt;^w^s ent any American arms sales to Argentina.   To engage inCOasuHMrcZoa. with the Americans on this issue could be open tomisunderapdSraing; but it would be shortsighted to turn President Reagan&apos;soffer dowrixout of hand.   The question would need to be consideredfurther following the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s return toLondon.The Cabine^&quot;&quot;)) ^|1.     Took not^^^^^Lebanon THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOK^N AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE, said that thej&gt;t situation in Beirut was g^ra a\kly quiet.    The United StatesRefVl0US Marines had come under f ire^a^ya on 6 December but there had been noQC(,^rence:        casualties.   There was a like^ ^&gt;^d of retaliatory action by theCo       35th      Israelis against units of the\ga&gt;|$tine Liberation Organisation, whichelusions,     had claimed responsibility for &lt;tf*^$Lpwing up of a bus in Jerusalem.ute 2 The headquarters of the British etfn *mjent to the Multinational Force(MNF) had come under fire on the n^gnt^f 2 December and one soldierhad been slightly injured, but the a^^rfj\had apparently been at localinitiative and the leaders of the mifr^Mfconcerned had apoLogised andpromised no recurrence.   The United J?tate &apos;/air raid on Syrian positionson A December, after the Syrians had opened fire on American. reconnaissance aircraft, had raised tension in the area and attractedsharp Parliamentary criticism in the United Kingdom, where there wasrenewed anxiety for the safety of the British contingent.   The UnitedStates action had been condemned by the Lebane(s4 Hyesident, Mr Gemayel,and moderate Arab Governments.   The Syrians had^e^tr^Nirmed theirreadiness to attack United States reconnaissance Udj/cijaft: the Americansfor their part were continuing to make reconnaissa^fi^/Lights whichthey maintained were essential to the safety of theiY^KPXcontingent.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary would be discn^&amp;n^the situationthat day with the United States, French and Italian Forei^^Ministersin the margins of the North Atlantic Council meeting in&lt;;^rekels.

The Lebanese Foreign Minister, Mr Salem,was due to visit Damascus that day and President Gemayel would be in.. ^^X^^ London on 13-14 December.&lt;( )\hE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the British MNF contingent^--^^aktinued to do a valuable and much admired job in enabling the cease\0&amp;r v talks to continue, and HMS Fearless remained off Beirut where it^^m^offer off-duty facilities to the British contingent. Everythingpoi  &amp;ke had been done to check on the security of the building housingtheB r ish headquarters.   Its isolation was dangerous but also servedto differentiate the British from the American and French contingentsand to^rttaE* extent diminished the risk of attack.In discusMon it was pointed out that although the American air raidon Syrian positions had created a damaging impression of collusionbetween the Americans and the Israelis, it had been carried out inaccordance with Rules of Engagement consistent with self defence; andthat although th^Trotice had been short, the British contingent hadbeen given advance Naming.   Reconnaissance flights were essential tothe safety of the Mated States forces which had already taken heavycasualties.   Parliasse^aVy criticism of the American action woulddiminish as these fa&lt; r6Ys-pcame to be better understood, but therewould be continuing cc^e^RXthat although the MNF was failing to fulfilthe purposes for which been established the United States wasseeking to prevent its wi|M^val.THE PRIME MINISTER, summingNrtK^e discussion, said that the Americanshad acted in the Lebanon witn\val^(iive restraint in view of thecasualties they had suffered, r^n/there was no question of the MNFbeing able to maintain a balanceAjjPtwen the Syrian and Israeli forcesin the Lebanon.   Consideration shoui^oe given to making a freshattempt to overcome Soviet opposition/ o the conversion of the UnitedNations Force in Lebanon into a truc^iSJeervisory force.yprus THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE, said that thej&gt;t   . Government was working closely with the United States Government to^vious persuade the Secretary General of the United Naxlahs, Senor Perez deCCf*&quot;rence:        Cuellar, to play a more active role on Cyprus is(u^ S^appoint a newC0   3) 35th       United Nations Special Representative there, but (tfiej&amp;ecretary General^  clusions,     was reluctant to take action pending the renewal \a ^$$ mandate forute 2 the United Nations Force in Cyprus on 13 December. &lt;^te^ vernmentwas also in close touch with the West German, French (a^Jd^talianGovernments.   Pressure on the Turkish Government for ronse&amp;ions overterritory and troop withdrawals had so far been unsucces^jH^but afresh approach would be made to the new Turkish Governmerffc^wbipn it hadtaken office.   The Greek Government was maintaining its refn^^sNtotake part in tripartite consultations under the Treaty of GuArwjtfeebut the Greek Prime Minister, Mr Papandreou, had told the Prr^yA^confidential
1 confidential | HMinister in Athens that he would communicate further with her aboutthis after consulting President Kyprianou of Cyprus.   It would bey\       important for the United Kingdom not to be drawn into the role of^^/^   mediator between Greece and Turkey.Australia &lt;^^^TOE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the Australian Government&apos;s&lt;^S^e&gt;hsal to allow HMS Invincible into dry dock at Sydney for urgent\oB^yational repairs resulted from the Australian Government&apos;s policyoz/fiCpV(\a. 11 owing nuclear weapons on Australian territory.   This policyhad^h^backing of the Australian trades union movement.The BMtiSh Government&apos;s policy of refusing to confirm or deny thepresenceyro^uclear weapons on board Her Majesty&apos;s ships had made itimpossib&gt;upxo offer the Australian Government any assurances in thisrespect. Although the Australian Government&apos;s attitude was disappointingit had been decided not to press them further.   The nearest alternativefacilities were at Singapore and the possibility of having the repairscarried out ther^wks being explored.The Cabinet^/^NN2.      Took note .y^p M^MJ2MUNITY 3.     THE PRIME MINISTER sM^tttat the issues for the European CouncilA1RS in Athens on 4-6 December nk ^p?kn well set out at its precedingEu&quot;&quot;&quot;*~ meeting in Stuttgart.   These&lt;31%Ms were restraint on agriculturalCou Pean surpluses, strict control of Oo^mH^ty expenditure and a different^^^l of arrangement for sharing the bur^ev^cKfinaneing the Community. IfDecember these questions were satisfactorrly^e^tled, it was hoped to make roomj&gt;r   . for other policies.   The preparatoryvprk for the European Council offtefVl US December had been promising.   IrC^pajC^Lcular, the French FinanceCcforence: Minister, Monsieur Delors, had tablea^n^expellent proposal &apos;for aq    3) 35th strict financial guideline for all CommuMty expenditure, incorporating  1^ clusions, a similar guideline for agricultural speeding.   It was unfortunate,nute 3        . however, that the Greek Presidency had submitted to Heads of Governmenta large number of detailed points, particularly on agriculture, whichwere not suitable for decision there. //^)\On agriculture there were many points in the Pr y detoty1s originaland later compromise documents which the United Ks^nga^ft could notaccept.   For example, the text would have included ^^bmaitment toreconsider every special import arrangement for agriejj^ukal products,which could have caused difficulty for United Kingdom&lt;&amp;h a ts fromNew Zealand and in many other respects.   On milk the Uni^^KKingdomhad been prepared to discuss the proposed superlevy, prov^fejn thatthe arrangements were effective in curbing the surplus and&gt;-we^Nnotdiscriminatory.   Unfortunately, although the Commission hadMrr^ppsedthat the superlevy should come into effect on production in e*c &amp;^pf1 confidential | ^ I
| confidential | H097.2 million tonnes of milk, the various changes and exemptions puts\ forward by other member states would have raised this figurel/\       substantially and thus made it much less effective in restraining/vTV    production and expenditure in this sector.   The Irish, in particular,&lt;/xy^~. were arguing for a complete exemption and the Presidency proposal,supported by most member states, would have allowed Irish milk^v^Nproduction to rise while United Kingdom production was cut back. Then^o^f&gt;elians and Greeks also wished to opt out of cuts.   A good number of&lt;vm&amp;moer states were prepared to let production rise further and to\fij*ance the rising surplus by a new tax on other oils and fats and byincreasing the existing co-responsibility levy which bore heavily onUnr^ei/^j.ngdom farmers.   In opposing the agricultural proposals theUniMfdi^hgdom had support from some other member states; Germany, theNethe  am &amp;&gt; and Denmark opposed the oils and fats tax and wished tosee resryaxpfc also on other expensive products such as wine, olive oiland toba u&gt;^i while the Netherlands also opposed discrimination in thesuperlevy&gt;^&gt;There had been a long discussion on the control of Community spending.She had come for^SSS. with amendments to the French scheme tabled in theSpecial Council(6y Monsieur Delors, which might be a good basis for anagreement, but uitfVrtmvately President Mitterrand was not properlyinformed about theV^pjo^eals which France itself had made.   This hadset back the negotia^dfc^particularly when some other member stateswere arguing that the /raajjflfrnity should first decide on spendingprogrammes and then raa^^hfe money to finance them.On the fairer sharing of tn^f^nancing of the Community, the text putforward by the Greek Presiavnay-^Ud contain some useful points onwhich a consensus might have^^jv^achieved.   The key question was themeasurement of the gap to whico^elief might relate; the UnitedKingdom maintained that the proDl/wJ^wes the net contribution.   All thediscussions in the Special CouncrT^ai d^elsewhere over some months andall the proposals on the table had,;^ne^^directed to finding a new andlasting system for correcting the buta^ej^-nequity. 1 President Mitterrand,however, said that he was only prepareayfcxyliscuss a short term, ad hocarrangement.   This surprised all Heads^^Government.   It wasunacceptable to Germany and the United Kingdom that there should be anyincrease in own resources unless a lasting solution to the budgetinequity had been found.It was clear, therefore, that the United Kingdton \Ms confronted byvery bad proposals and she had had no hesitatio^/in~ytejecting them.The United Kingdom was not isolated, as for variola-masons some othermember states, notably Germany and the Netherlands^e^4&gt;d not acceptthe last compromise document submitted by the Greek PJ*  atoency. Inaddition, a number of member states had particular poijrt^^nresolved.She wished also to record that the preparation and brieraKfjlAr theEuropean Council by United Kingdom officials was of the hig^^\1 confidential | ^ I
^^^^^ ^^^^^^1I confidential | HIn discussion it was stated that no other course than rejection of thecompromise proposals was possible in the United Kingdom&apos;s interest.&lt;sy//\       There could be some problems, however, both in the next agriculturalprice fixing and in relation to the United Kingdom&apos;s 1983 refunds in&lt;Xs^V^  the draft 1984 budget.   There was no money in the 1984 draft budgetfor any price increase for Community farmers next year and it was^vv^nprobable that there would be an attempt to find some money by increasing\i^v^he existing co-responsibility levy on milk, which we did not favour.^y^pOwas also possible that the European Parliament at its next plenarysuasion would either reject the whole draft budget for 1984 or freezern4xj&amp;ited Kingdom&apos;s 1983 refunds of 750 million ecu net which had beenag*&quot;ee&gt;d/^t Stuttgart.   Another problem could be that the Council ofMinisxe^ (Agriculture) at its next meeting would probably not agreeon tb^Conteission&apos; s proposal for a further period of special importarrangeT^ratSvfor New Zealand butter.   The present arrangements expiredon 31 DeAtfjiroer 1983.   We should be trying at least for a roll-over ofa speciar^errangement.Summing up the discussion* the Prime Minister said that the Cabinetendorsed the neatfSftting position which the Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary and sne^bwd taken in the European Council on 4-6 December.The United KingdOT^rrayld not now take any premature steps on itscontribution but stau^WKwait to see whether the remaining risk-sharingelement of our 1982 gpfrmds was made available by the end of 1983 andwhether the 1983 refumf^^&amp;reed at Stuttgart were included in the 1984budget and would be parj ^e*pre the end of March 1984. Contingencyplans were prepared.   Althdngh there were some problems for the UnitedKingdom, there were also THji&apos;Qaifficulties ahead for all otherCommunity countries as a resjaz^of the failure to reach agreement atAthens.   The difficulty of f^jrfa^c^ng the Community within the 1 percent Value Added Tax ceiling increase and there would be agrowing incentive for other mem^er^soates to reach a worthwhileagreement on all the important isrsue&gt;^The Cabinet - ^^^^Took note with approval of the Prtsr^&apos;Minister&apos; s summingup of their discussion. ^SuERN A&apos;     raE SECRETARY 0F STATE F0R NORTHERN IRELAm^id that the lastfew months had seen a number of horrible sectariaVTcYllings,culminating in the murder the previous day of Mr v^djyjjr}Graham, aprominent Unionist politician.

He had grave doubts\S-/J/\ whether the local politicians - and particularly the Unionists -understood the longer-term consequences of their current attitudes.^\T\&gt;   THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that theyCy^Cabinet deplored the previous day&apos;s murder of Mr Graham but fully^//ysupported the security policies being pursued by the Secretary of State\v-^ ot Northern Ireland.

THE &lt;^RETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that he was^  ELOPMENTS     extremely concerned about recent developments in the London Borough ofq0 LOCAL Brent and the Metropolitan District of Liverpool.    In Brent,ERNMENT        protesters had bpg^en up a meeting of the Council the previous nightwhen Conservative aq)d Liberal councillors were attempting to takecontrol after tn 3d??eXtion to them of a Labour councillor. TheMayor had failed mjjffyite the police to restore order.   There hadalso been concern abnJrayprocedures adopted earlier by Brent Council,but rescinded the preva j* %night, which were designed to preventConservative and Liber^^&amp;Kfcicillors from speaking in full Council.He was organising the collection of examples of similar undemocraticpractices employed by maj^^tyyvparties to bolster their control. Itwas, however, important tha^-jy^irs information should be established asfactually correct before beiiri^a^d.   The position in Liverpool waspotentially more serious.   AlS^ev/decisions were being taken by aLabour caucus outside the machinew^f the Council and its Committees.The officers were not being invoWed/yn these decisions, but merelyinformed of them.   The authority s^eme^pset on a course of bankruptcynext year, with the aim of provoking^f^ocnfrontatiOn with theGovernment.   It was possible that the^^idpDts of some of the more moderateLabour councillors might lead them to etaxback from the brink.   The &quot; *Labour majority was only three and the local elections might result inan even more confused situation, although a change of control appearedunlikely.   This situation emphasised the need, as had been agreed, tohave Commissioner legislation drawm up and helck^ilx reserve in case theGovernment had to take over the operation of amjnrjihority. MeanwhileMinisters might need to respond to questions a&amp;ofy^itfee situation andit was desirable to do this without giving the iiUre^ion that theGovernment wished to precipitate a crisis or confrol^/icm.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, si^K^^topportunities should be taken to publicise information ab w\malpracticesin local government.   Backbenchers should also take oppo^e nTties todraw attention to what was going on.   The Secretary of Svk^^r theEnvironment should circulate a factual speaking note for Mirf ^ e\ialuse.
