CONFIDENTIALJFILAMENTARY   1.     The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House ofRS Commons during the following week.^igration       THE HOME SECRETARY said that on 16 December the House of Commons had passedes a motion disapproving the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules which hepr   . had laid before Parliament.    He was obliged to lay a revised Statement of^evious Changes within 40 sitting days of the passing of the motion, and to meetCC(jmnCe: this deadline the content of the Statement would have to be settled withinr        53rd       the next week.     He and the Chief Whip had consulted widely with theHi      Sl0ns      Executive Committee of the 1922 Committee and with individual Government1 supporters.    It was now generally recognised that a further defeat on thisissue and a prolongation of the damaging division within the ConservativeParty would be unacceptable; but there were still differences of view aboutthe merits and the likely electoral consequences of particular courses ofaction.    It was not practicable either to seek to maintain the Rules in theform disapproved on 16 December, or to go back to the substance of the Rulesin force up to the end of 1982.    If he laid a Statement reverting to theproposals in the White Paper of 25 October 1982, the main Opposition Partieswould almost certainly abstain on a motion to disapprove it, thoughindividual Opposition backbenchers might vote against the Government and itwas not clear how many Members on the Government side would also voteagainst.    An alternative course, suggested by Mr Marcus Fox MP, would be toadd to the proposals in the White Paper the safeguard of reversing theburden of proof on the acceptability of a marriage for immigration purposes,which had been proposed in the Statement disapproved on 16 December, whiledropping the extension to two years, also proposed in that Statement, of the Iprobationary period for a marriage.   Mr Fox thought that a revisedStatement on these lines would command the support of most of theConservative Members who had previously voted against the Government. TheOpposition spokesman on home affairs had been equivocal about the Labour iParty&apos;s likely response to such a compromise, but the Labour Party mightwell vote against it.   The Home Secretary said that he would be continuinghis consultations with Government supporters as a matter of urgency, but heinvited the Cabinet to agree that he might lay a revised Statement ofChanges on either of the two bases which he had outlined.The Cabinet -1.     Agreed that the revised Statement of Changes inImmigration Rules should be based on the proposals in theWhite Paper published on 25 October 1982, either withoutamendment or incorporating an additional safeguard againstthe use of marriage for immigration purposes, as proposedby the Home Secretary.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALReport of the   THE HOME SECRETARY said that on 25 January the Court of Appeal had upheldlamentary   the Divisional Court&apos;s dismissal of the Leader of the Labour Party&apos;sCom application for an injunction to prevent the Parliamentary Boundary ormiSsion        Commission for England from forwarding its report to him, but had continued r ^n8land       the temporary injunction restraining the Commission from doing so, in orderp    . to allow seven days for the applicants to petition the House of Lords forRef l0US leave to appeal.   The House of Lords might decide on the petition onCCC o^nCe: ^ February or, perhaps   more probably, on 10 February.    If leave to appealCo        ^8th       was granted, the appeal might be heard in the following week and the resultelusions,     might be known before the end of February.   The merits of the case hade 1 already been fully considered in the lower courts, and it should be possibleto dispose of any hearing quite quickly.   Nevertheless, these furtherdelays would make it much more difficult to achieve the Government&apos;s aim ofcompleting the Parliamentary procedures on the Orders in Council and makingthe necessary administrative arrangements by the end of March.   The Homeand Social Affairs Committee had envisaged eight days as a reasonable timefor him to consider the report between receiving it and laying it beforeParliament; but it might now be better to shorten that period, so as toreduce the likelihood of legal proceedings being taken against himself.THE ATTORNEY GENERAL said that it was not necessary for a period of as longas eight days to elapse between the date the report was received by theHome Secretary and the date it was laid before Parliament.    It was likelythat the courts would give short shrift to any application for an injunctionagainst the Home Secretary, and that they would decline to issue anytemporary injunction pending the hearing of such an application.The Cabinet -2. Agreed that the report of the Parliamentary BoundaryCommission for England, together with a draft implementingOrder in Council, should be laid before Parliament as soonas possible after receipt by the Home Secretary.3. Invited the Home Secretary:i. to consult the Attorney General further on theprecise timing for laying the report beforeParliament;ii. to consult the Lord Chancellor on possible waysof expediting the hearing by the House of Lords ofthe Leader of the Labour Party&apos;s application for leaveto appeal, and of any subsequent appeal.2&lt;CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALj^RElGN 2.     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there had been littles progress over the prospective visit to London of the Arab League delegationled by King Hassan of Morocco.   King Hassan had apparently failed to obtaine East      Mr Arafat&apos;s endorsement for Mr Milhem&apos;s membership as representing thepr   . interests of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).   King Hassan had0us welcomed the suggestion of a separate meeting between the Minister of State,CC(Ri?nCe: Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Mr Hurd, and Mr Qaddoumi of the PLO; butqq    &apos; }-st        Mr Arafat&apos;s response had been cool and a definitive reaction from the ArabMin  Usi0ns      states was still awaited.    It was important that the delegation&apos;s visit toUte 2 London should take place on 7 and 8 February as planned, since thereafterThe Queen would be away from London until 12 March.ze THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the talks in New Yorkjpr   . between Guatemala, the United Kingdom and Belize about Guatemala&apos;s disputej Us with Belize had broken down.    The Guatemalan representatives had offered noCC( o\nce:        advance on their previous position and had continued to insist on cession of[c0n .   10th      territory by Belize, which was unacceptable to the Government of Belize.Min  Us^ons      There seemed no prospect of Guatemala being willing to take part in furthere ^ talks for the time being.   He had received a letter from the United StatesSecretary of State, Mr Shultz, about the continued retention of the Britishgarrison in Belize, which consisted of some 1,500 men and four Harrieraircraft.    As long as the British garrison remained, Guatemala was unlikelyto attack Belize: but the garrison had already stayed longer than the12 months originally agreed.   The matter was to be considered at an earlymeeting of the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee on the basis of an Iup-to-date assessment of the situation to which the Ministry of Defence,the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Joint Intelligence Committee -Iwere contributing.iHThe Cabinet - &apos;I?1.     Took note.Isl iand THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the plethora of Argentine3nds denials of any intention to attack the Falkland Islands did not alter thePjg . current assessment of the risk of harassment or commando raids byHej l Us Argentine units against the Islands or their Dependencies: indeed there wasCc(g^?nce: some fresh evidence highlighting that risk.   A wide range of Governments had,C0tlcl   }st        however, made representations to Argentina warning against any renewed useHinutUsions,     of force: the United States Government had been particularly helpful in thise 2 regard.   A warning against possible Argentine military action in theAntarctic had also been given by the British representative at the recentmeeting in Wellington of the signatory states of the Antarctic Treaty; inreply, the Argentine representative had asserted his Government&apos;s intentionof continuing to comply with the Treaty.   The question of arms sales toArgentina was also causing some concern.   There were indications that theUnited States Government was considering lifting its embargo, and strongrepresentations were being made in Washington to discourage this. Meanwhilea naval frigate manufactured by BlBhm and Voss of Hamburg, and containingRolls-Royce engines, was about to be handed over to Argentina by theGermans.    It now appeared that under the terms of their contract Rolls-Roycewere obliged to supply an engineer to take part in the sea trials whichwould be conducted by the Argentine Navy.   There was likely to be strong,public criticism if it became known that a British engineer was participatingin sea trials of an Argentine warship.3 H|CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that it would beunacceptable to have a British engineer in the position described. Thematter should be further considered by the Ministers concerned with a viewto avoiding such an outcome, perhaps by encouraging Rolls-Royce to supply anengineer of other than British nationality.The Cabinet -2.      Invited the Secretary of State for Industry, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Defence andthe Secretary of State for Trade, to pursue the matterwith Rolls-Royce in the light of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up.1 faltar THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that under the terms of thepr   . Lisbon Agreement Britain and Spain each had the right to raise any subjectRef l0US ^ wisnec^ i-n tne forthcoming talks between the Spanish Foreign Minister and(Wgrfnce:        himself.   This was the background to the reported statement by the SpanishQQn   ; 52nd       Foreign Minister, Senor Moran, that there would be no talks with Britain^ Elusions,     unless it was accepted that the issue of sovereignty should be covered.e 3 He had earlier made the British position clear to Senor Moran. Althoughthe Spanish side would be free to raise the question of sovereignty, theposition of the people of Gibraltar was completely protected by the termsof the Lisbon Agreement.    It was an important British interest that thetalks should take place so that the Lisbon Agreement could be implementedand full freedom of communication be restored between Gibraltar and Spain.The implications of the latest developments for British policy were to beconsidered shortly by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee. - flThe Cabinet -3.     Took note.ApwUNlTY 3.     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Council ofTS Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on 24.January had discussed the problem posedTjje by the European Parliament&apos;s insistence that 1982 should be the last budgetC0 year for which the United Kingdom would receive refunds and that a&amp;Ud Un^t5T structural solution to the&apos; problem should be implemented with effect fromRef8et: 1982     1983.   He had come under strong pressure from other member states to agreenc*s that the Council should endorse such a proposition in order to get theP-r Parliament to vote the money for the 1982 refunds.   He had resisted thisRej l0us pressure on the grounds that to say such a thing would be to mislead theC(v^rence:        European Parliament:    it was quite unrealistic to suppose that aC0    &apos; 1st structural solution could be implemented so quickly.    In the end, the^in        0ns&gt;     Council had agreed to an entry in the minutes confirming that there was noe 3 intention to change the agreement reached at their meeting on 26 October1982, which had clearly envisaged further refunds to the United Kingdom.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Council of Ministers (Budget)on 26 January had failed to adopt the 1983 Supplementary Budget, whichprovided for the refunds in respect of 1982, because no qualified majorityhad been established to classify the energy measures in that budget eitheras non-obligatory or as obligatory.   The German President would be meetingCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe Budget Committee of the European Parliament on 27 January to explainthe position and to seek certain assurances on behalf of the Council ofMinisters.    If the outcome of that meeting was satisfactory, it shouldstill be possible that 90 per cent of the refunds would be paid over beforethe end of the 1982-83 financial year; but a satisfactory outcome was notassured.p?Ifortn THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Council of Ministerspr    oral (Foreign Affairs) had agreed that it would not be possible to create aedure uniform electoral procedure before the elections of the EuropeanParliament in 1984 but that a further attempt should be made to try toreach agreement about the voting rights of Community citizens livingoutside their own countries.&apos;TradSpa&apos;6 Wlth        THE SECRETARY 0F STATE FOR TRADE said that discussions were continuing withn the Spanish Government and with the motor manufacturers to try to find asolution to the problem created by the lack of balance in the tariffarrangements applied under the Community&apos;s 1970 Agreement with Spain.PriceUltUral     THE MINISTER 0F AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that he had been tolds by German contacts that, if the Christian Democrats won the election onPtev- 6 March, the new German Government would not be formed until 31 March. . ?^efe  US ^e Present Minister of Agriculture, Herr Ertl, would continue in officeCc(o^fnce:        until the end of the month, and it would be a major objective of GermanCouc,   \st        policy to secure the 1983 Farm Price Agreement before the new AgricultureMinut.Usi0ns      Minister took over in April.    They would arrange continuous meetings of thee ^ Council of Ministers (Agriculture) if necessary to secure their goal. ThisGerman plan could be relevant to the handling of the Community budgetnegotiations.Po d ca1t0 th ales THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that, although theS0v^e Commission had ruled that the French agreement with the Soviet Union wasUni0 t illegal, they were not planning to take France to court but were merelyn asking for information about the way in which the French GovernmentPfe . intended to implement the agreement.   This weak Commission response was^6fe  Us perhaps in part because the Director General of the Agricultural DivisionCc(g~?nce:        was a Frenchman.    It would be important to take every possible precautionC0flc^   50th       to ensure that the relevant Deputy Director General post continued to behi^  Usx ns,     occupied by someone from the United Kingdom, when the present incumbente 3 returned to London to take up an appointment in the Cabinet Office later inthe year.In discussion it was remarked that the Government&apos;s choice of members of theHome Civil Service to put forward for appointment to Commission posts wasconfined to volunteers and this might in some circumstances make itdifficult to propose a candidate of sufficient calibre.    It was also ,5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALsuggested that the United Kingdom was placed at a disadvantage inCommunity negotiations because other member states did not have the samerespect for the law.The Cabinet -Took note.^DUSTRLAL        4.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the employers hadRS broadly accepted the mediator&apos;s recommendation in the water industry disputejyat of a general increase of 7.3 per cent over 16 months, together with certain^ r other improvements.   After discussion this had been rejected by the unions,;je&quot;US!&apos;ry ^ay     who were now consulting their membership on the employers&apos; offer and wouldotiations     meet on 29 January to consider the outcome of the consultation. Preliminarypr   . indications were that rejection of the employers&apos; offer could well beRef l0US confirmed.    It would be for consideration at that point whether the^(8^n e:        Government should encourage the employers to accept arbitration, to whichCon i   ^st        both sides in the dispute were formally committed as a last resort by theMinutUSl0ns      terms of their agreement with the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitratione ^ Service.   For the moment the employers were reluctant to have recourse toarbitration in case it jeopardised the mediator&apos;s clear and helpful findingagainst the unions&apos; claim for &quot;upper quartile treatment&quot;. Publicpresentation of the employers&apos; case, which rested on the intrinsic fairnessof the offer and the fact that it was based on the findings of a mediatoraccepted by both sides, would be particularly important over the next twodays during which the unions&apos; consultation with their membership was taking Iplace.    Television and radio, in particular, had so far given greaterpublicity to the unions.    In seeking to give the employers&apos; case effectivepublic support, he had to bear in mind that (in contrast to the NationalHealth Service dispute) the Government was not itself the employer in thewater industry and that a confrontational approach was liable to becounter-productive, at least until the unions had decided whether tocontinue the strike beyond 29 January.    In the country, the effects of thestrike were being felt gradually: a relatively small number of properties(10,000 out of a total of 20 million with piped water) were now withoutwater, and 5 million people - or 10 per cent of the population - werebeing recommended as a precautionary measure to boil their drinking water.Supervisors, and to a large extent craftsmen, in the water industry wereworking normally; picketing was good-humoured, and with certain exceptions,eg in Cornwall, strike action so far had been in a relatively low key.There had been no request from any water authority for service assistance,and he had made it clear that the use of troops would be authorised only inthe very last resort.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that he shared the Secretary ofState for the Environment&apos;s pessimism about the outcome of the unions&apos;consultation with their membership.    There was evidence that the unionleadership, which had so far broken every agreement it had made and, in thecase of the General and Municipal Workers Union, had embarked on a strikeapparently without proper authority in terms of its own rule book, wasdetermined to take industrial action for reasons unconnected with theinterests of their membership.   From the employers&apos; point of view, it6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALwould be crucial to retain the co-operation of the supervisors if the strikewere prolonged.    A decision to call on service assistance, with theconsequent risk of forfeiting the co-operation of the supervisors, wouldhave to be very carefully weighed.THE HOME SECRETARY said that, although the strike was in a low key, thiscould change very quickly if there were a major incident.    Public angerwith the unions would be directed at the Government as well unless contin-gency plans to deal with such an incident were promptly and effectivelyimplemented.    The main body of servicemen involved was now at 24 hours&apos;notice, and the emergency repair teams at six hours&apos; notice or less. TheCivil Contingencies Unit (CCU) would be meeting that evening to review thewhole range of contingency plans.    It would at the same time consider thepresentational aspects of the dispute, with a view to deciding how best tomarshal public opinion in support of the employers&apos; case.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that attempts by unionsto make the denial of water to industry a condition of their carrying outtheir obligations not to endanger public health must be firmly resisted.She noted that, if the employers&apos; offer were accepted, the average wage ofthe waterworkers taking industrial action would rise by  10 per week to 145 per week.    Every effort must be made to impress on the public thefairness of this offer and to ensure that the employers stood firm andoffered no further concessions to the unions.    Contingency plans forservice assistance and arrangements for handling the public relationsaspects of the dispute should be kept under review by the CCU as the HomeSecretary had indicated.The Cabinet -1. Took note. ?A^1 , THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that it appeared that rities       certain local authorities hostile to the Government were refusing to placecontracts with firms employed on construction and other work at the ground-launched cruise missile site at Greenham Common.   The legality of thisaction by the local authorities concerned was being investigated.The Cabinet -2. Took note.Haul THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that there might be someage industrial action on 31 January by drivers of road haulage vehicles inLondon and the South East, who had rejected a wage settlement which hadbeen accepted by drivers elsewhere.   But the action, if it occurred, wouldbe sporadic and confined to the areas he had named.The Cabinet -3. Took note. .7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL a Prices        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the impending fall in inter-national oil prices posed a difficult problem for the British National OilCorporation (BNOC), which was obliged under its constitution to accept theentire output of the British North Sea oilfields and thus to find marketsfor it.   At the recent meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum ExportingCountries, the Saudi Arabians had succeeded in getting agreement to reduceproduction quotas, but Nigeria in particular had prevented agreement onprice reductions.    Sheikh Yamani, the Saudi Arabian Minister for Petroleumand Mineral Resources, was hoping that at the end of the ensuing period ofdisorder on the international oil market, oil prices would stabilise atabout United States $30 per barrel - ie $4 lower than at present.    If BNOCwere to appear to be leading the market downwards, there could be severeconsequences for the United Kingdom&apos;s relations with the Arab world. Butthe downward trend had already begun, and certain Gulf countries werealready offering discounts.   Failure or delay by BNOC to lower its pricesin accordance with the current trend could cost it as much as 10 million per week in oil revenues.   He hoped that the position could beheld at least until 31 January, when it might be necessary to issue atemporising statement indicating that some reduction in BNOC&apos;s prices wasunder consideration.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that difficultcalculations had to be made about the impact on inflation and the rate ofexchange as well as on oil and tax revenues.    It would also be important toavoid giving the Saudi Arabian Government any pretext for picking asynthetic quarrel with Britain over oil prices.    It would be helpful if theSecretary of State for Energy could discuss the implications urgently withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to agree on the best way forward.The Cabinet -4.     Invited the Secretary of State for Energy, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, toproceed in accordance with the Prime Minister&apos;s summingup.ftCabinet Office27 January 1983i8CONFIDENTIAL
