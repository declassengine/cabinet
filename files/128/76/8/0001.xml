CONFIDENTIALAFFat^en^^   l&apos; Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the Houses of Commons during the following week.Co st  parl- THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that during the Cabinet&apos;s discussion onanient        16 December 1982 of Civil Service manpower after 1984 she had beenpr   . invited to consider what might be done to draw the attention of Us Parliament and the public to the effect on Departmental costs, efficiencyCC(8?enCe: and staff numbers of the large and, it was thought, growing volume ofCoricl   &quot;?3rd       Parliamentary Questions and letters from Members of Parliament. The.&quot;.inut&quot;8101181     evidence did not support the view that there had been a steady growthe ^ in Questions and correspondence.    The annual number of ParliamentaryQuestions had in fact fallen since 1979, while the volume of correspondence Ireflected the issues of current concern to Members of Parliament and thepublic, and fluctuated considerably.    In these circumstances, she did notthink that it would be helpful for the Government to make a generalstatement about the burden of this work on the public service. Therewere a number of management measures which could be taken to contain orreduce the existing cost, which in 1980 had been calculated to be 1.2 million for answering Parliamentary Questions and  7 million forreplying to letters from Members of Parliament.    Officials were alreadyrequired to obtain Ministerial authority before beginning work on draftreplies to Parliamentary Questions likely to cost more than  2Q0, andthis guideline might be applied more strictly in future.    Undue effortshould not be put into responding to requests for information which wasreadily available elsewhere.   Wherever possible, Members of Parliamentshould be encouraged to direct enquiries about individual constituencycases to local offices; experience showed that in most cases thisresulted in a quicker and more satisfactory reply.    Background briefingfor appearances before Select Committees could be more selective; if aMinister was unable to give an immediate reply to a particular question,he could always promise to provide the information later.    Finally, itwas doubtful whether it was worth preparing long and detailed repliesto correspondents who were clearly not going to be influenced byrational argument.    It would be helpful if these points could be bornein mind by Ministers and officials dealing with work generated byParliament, though the extent to which they were appropriate inparticular Departments would naturally be a matter for the individualjudgment of the Minister concerned.In discussion, the following main points were made -a. Members of Parliament were increasingly taking up individualconstituency cases with local offices, notably of the InlandRevenue and the Department of Health and Social Security, butthere would frequently be cases where the Member of Parliamentconcerned would want to be able to show his constituent a lettersigned by the responsible Minister.b. It would be unacceptable for individual courts, rather thanthe Lord Chancellor himself, to deal with letters from Membersof Parliament which sought to influence the outcome ofparticular cases. &apos;1 . tlBlCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALc. The use of standard drafts had been facilitated by theintroduction of word processors, and should lead to asignificant increase in efficiency.d. It was a waste of time for officials to submit coveringnotes to Ministers which merely repeated the informationcontained in the accompanying draft replies.e. &apos;    Very large savings had been made in the Department ofIndustry by &quot;the use of pro-formas for briefing Ministers forregional visits as an alternative to the preparation oflengthy narrative documents.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the length oftime taken to deal with correspondence in some Departments was a matterof continuing concern.    The way in which debates, appearances beforeSelect Committees, Parliamentary Questions and correspondence werehandled was of great importance to the satisfactory presentation ofGovernment policy, and this had to be borne in mind when consideringwhat economies might be possible.    Subject to that, all Ministers incharge of Departments should, in their future management of workgenerated by Parliament, take account of the suggestions made by theLord Privy Seal and in discussion.The Cabinet -1. Invited Ministers in charge of Departments to be guidedby the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion inconsidering ways of containing the cost of dealing withParliamentary business and correspondence from Members ofParliament.Cenotar)&gt;1Wteath THE SECRETARY 0F STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that an incident hadoccurred at the Cenotaph in Whitehall the previous day when a wreath hadbeen surreptitiously laid on behalf of various organisations supportingthe women demonstrating at Greenham Common.    It was clear from theinscription on the wreath that this was intended purely as a piece ofpropaganda in connection with the High Court case involving a number ofthe demonstrators.    It was a longstanding convention that the nationalWar Memorial should not be used for propaganda purposes of any kind.The police had been reluctant to take action because the laying of thewreath was not   in   their opinion offensive or liable to lead to a breachof the peace, but since the Cenotaph was Crown property he had feltjustified in using staff of his own Department to remove the wreath.The Cabinet -2. Endorsed with approval the action taken by the Secretaryof State for the Environment.&apos; ICONFIDENTIAL^^^^ 89 J
CONFIDENTIAL^REIGN 2.     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Chancellor Kohls at the head of the Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Unionpg(je Parties had achieved a welcome victory in the West German generalRep^3^ election.    It was also satisfactory that Herr Genscher&apos;s Free Democrat0f      lc Party would be represented in the new Bundestag and that its participation&apos;&quot;?any in the new Government would be needed to give Herr Kohl a Parliamentarypr   . majority.    The new Government would not formally assume office untilR6 e   Us 31 March and its declaration of policy would be made on 25 April.    It wasCC(fiv\nCe:        likely but not yet certain that Herr Genscher would be reappointedConcl   * k        Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister.    It would be important to maintainMinutUS1 nS&apos;     pressure on the new German Government to achieve a settlement of thee ^ Community&apos;s budget problem before the expiry of the current GermanPresidency at the end of June.MiddleEast e THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that King Hassan of Moroccowas still maintaining that the proposed visit to London by an ArabPrev- League delegation under his leadership would take place on 18 March.Ref&quot;l0us But there were still doubts as to whether the membership had beenCc(g2\nce:        approved by all the Arab Governments concerned.   Her Majesty&apos;s^ nclu . k        Ambassador at Rabat had been instructed to obtain a definitive delegationMinut Sl0ns&apos;     list from the Moroccan Foreign Minister, so that a last minute disruptione ^ of the arrangements might be averted.    Although the proposed visit hadlost its original relevance to the Arab/Israel dispute, it was importantthat it should take place for the sake of relations between the UnitedKingdom and the Arab countries.    These were entering a delicate phasein consequence of recent developments in the oil market.   Meanwhile nofurther progress had been made in the negotiations for the withdrawalof foreign troops from the Lebanon, and there was no news about themeeting between King Hussein of Jordan and Mr Arafat of the PalestineLiberation Organisation which was due to take place in the margins ofthe non-aligned meeting in New Delhi.    He had stressed to the UnitedStates Secretary of State, Mr Shultz, the importance of a well judgedreaction by the United States Administration to the outcome ofKing Hussein&apos;s meeting with Mr Arafat, since it would provide what wouldprobably be the last chance for the United States to exercise effectivepressure on Israel to get the peace process started.!alkUndsland THE F0REIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that an Argentine groupcalled the &quot;Centre for Volunteers for the Fatherland&quot; had applied toPtevi0u tne International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to arrange a visit^eferenS t0 tne Falkland Islands by a group of next of kin of Argentine^(83) servicemen buried there.    Despite the clear implication that this wasCQnciUs-tb        a Politically motivated request, the ICRC were treating it as genuinelyMinute 2 ns&apos;     humanitarian and had expressed readiness to act as an intermediary.The British Interests Section in Buenos Aires had been asked for moreinformation about the Argentine group and its leader; and the Ministerof State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Mr Hurd, would be exploringthe nositi on further with the ICRC in Geneva that day.    The CivilCommissioner of the Falkland Islands, Sir Rex Hunt, had reported that theislanders would be totally opposed to the Argentine group&apos;s visit even .3CONFIDENTIALJ 9 0
CONFIDENTIALif Argentina were now to declare a formal cessation of hostilities.But the group&apos;s request had a direct bearing on the proposed visit tothe islands by a group of British next of kin, which was dependent onadministrative support from Uruguay.    There was reason to believethat Argentina would seek to exploit a British refusal to allow avisit by the Argentine group in order to seek to dissuade the Uruguayanauthorities from allowing the British group&apos;s visit to go forward asplanned.    He would circulate further information on this difficultproblem to his colleagues as it became available.    Meanwhile it couldbe publicly stated in answer to questions that no request had yet beenreceived from the ICRC and that if such a request were received theGovernment would wish to consult the Falkland Islanders before makinga response.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there wasconsiderable Parliamentary interest in the question of arms sales toArgentina.    He had made strong representations on this subject to theUnited States Administration and an American decision on whether toresume arms sales to Argentina was now unlikely to be taken for someweeks.ln&gt;babwe THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the situation inpre . Zimbabwe continued to give cause for serious anxiety.    The Prime MinisterRef    Us of Zimbabwe, Mr Mugabe, was pressing ahead with his policy of toughCc(goNnce: action against Mr Nkomo&apos;s Zimbabwe African People&apos;s Union Party and itsConci Ndebele supporters..    There was further evidence of atrocities by theHinut Slons,      5th Brigade of the Zimbabwean Army, but there were some indications thate ^ the level of violence was dropping.    The white population of Matabelelandwas still being treated correctly and felt reasonably safe.    It lookedas if the Zimbabwean Government&apos;s intention had been to bring Mr Nkomoto trial, but he had now escaped to Botswana where he had sought aninterview with the British High Commissioner.   This had been refused oninstructions.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that, if Mr Nkomosought to come to the United Kingdom, it was to be hoped that some waycould be found of refusing to admit him.The Cabinet -1. Took note.^ n8 Kon  The Cabinet was briefed on the state of negotiations with the ChineseGovernment on the future of Hong Kong.The Cabinet -2. Approved the action proposed by the Prime Minister.CONFIDENTIALI 91 ?
CONFIDENTIALOrd THE PRIME MINISTER said that the verdict and sentences rightly passedr on the two Arab terrorists brought to trial in London for the attemptedassassination of the Israeli Ambassador, Mr Argov, were likely to leadto attempts by elements of the Palestine Liberation Organisation toprocure the release of the prisoners by criminal means - possibly bytaking a prominent figure in British public life hostage.    The Jewishcommunity were seriously concerned on this score.    It was essentialthat the police should exercise maximum vigilance.    In this connection,public attention should be drawn to the burden which the activities ofthe protestors at the Greenham Common cruise missile site were puttingon police resources, and the extent to which this was diverting policeforces from their essential task of crime prevention.THE HOME SECRETARY drew attention to the rapid rise in the prisonpopulation, which was approaching record levels.    The pressures thiscreated for the Prison Service carried unavoidable risks for prisonsecurity.    The imprisonment of women protestors from Greenham Commonwould pose a particularly acute problem in view of the relativeshortage of women prison officers.The Cabinet -3.     Took note.C MMUN!TTvAFfAIr .     THE F0REIGN ^ COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Commission___^ had announced that it would again make export refunds available onNew z sales of butter to the Soviet Union.    While the United Kingdom wouldButt ea^and      continue to oppose this move, in the last resort we should not be ableEXpo&quot;tsato        t0 pr6Vent iC&apos;o(83) lstScions,Spai^ Wlth        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that it had finally been possibleto conclude the negotiations with Spain on improved access to thePrevj-Qu Spanish market for British cars.    Since the United Kingdom had no actual^efere S locus in the matter, the formal negotiations with Spain nominally beingCC(83we: conducted by the Commission, the agreement would have to be presentedConciu . t0 tne Community as a unilateral gesture by the Spanish Government.Hinute ~ ns      This would be done before the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs)met on 14-15 March.    In the meantime Spain had asked that there shouldbe no publicity for the agreement.    The further negotiations hadCONFIDENTIAL^^^^^ 92 B
CONFIDENTIALachieved improvements: the duty quota for mid-range cars had beenincreased from 4,000 to 5,000 cars and the tariff further reducedfrom 20 per cent to 19 per cent against the present rate ofnearly 37 per cent; the duty quota for upper range cars remained at10,000 cars at a reduced tariff of 25 per cent.    The Spaniards hadundertaken to continue these quotas from one year to the next unlessthere were a marked deterioration in economic circumstances.    The dutyquotas would be open to all Community manufacturers.    They had howeverbeen deliberately angled in the United Kingdom&apos;s direction, and thesize definitions in particular were aligned to favour British Leyland,although in practice British Leyland&apos;s ability to sell more cars inSpain was very limited; even in the upper range, where their prospectswere better, they expected to sell only 1,000 cars out of the 10,000quota.    Spain had agreed to make the same customs valuation adjustmentfor British Leyland imports as they made for other vehicle importers,and to accelerate the introduction of Value Added Tax, which woulddeal with the problems for British companies represented by the presenthome compensation tax.    There had also been a concession on whisky.In return the United Kingdom had had to make insignificant concessionsrecording our intention not to raise new points under the 1970 TradeAgreement between the European Community and Spain, and to use our goodoffices to minimise interference with the supply of Spanish cars to theBritish market, and British Leyland&apos;s intention to open talks onindustrial collaboration with their Spanish associate Santana. Thiswas the first time that the United Kingdom had been able to persuadethe Spaniards to make a concession on trade, and in order to achievethis it had been necessary to persuade the Commission not to abandontheir own negotiations.    He had had talks both with Ford and GeneralMotors, and he believed that the United Kingdom industry, although itspublic attitude would be unenthusiastic, would in fact regard the dealas acceptable.    It would be possible for the Government to point to thefact that Ford were putting on an extra shift here and substantiallyswitching their sourcing from Spain to Germany.    Use could also be madeof the impressive increase in exports of car components from  15 millionsome years ago to  55 million last year.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion,  said the Cabinet notedthat there had already been some Press comment about the package. Itwas agreed that, until Spain had informed the Commission, the publicline should be that negotiations between the Community and Spain werecontinuing and that the United Kingdom hoped for a successful outcome.It was recognised that the automobile industry in the West Midlandswould not regard the settlement as a major achievement, and that carefulattention would therefore need to be given to its public presentation.It could however be presented as the first sizeable step against a verydifficult background and as a transitional move pending the morefavourable conditions which would prevail after Spanish accession tothe Community.    Use could be made of the substantial increase in exportsof components and of the fact that other Anglo-Spanish trade was inbalance.    Caution should be exercised in referring to British Leyland&apos;sinability to sell substantially more cars to Spain, since after manyyears&apos; virtual exclusion from the market they inevitably lacked anadequate distributor network; this made it all the more important thatthe quotas should be continued for at least three years.iThe Cabinet -Took note.6CONFIDENTIAL^^b^_ -   93 m
CONFIDENTIALAFFAIRRIAL 4&apos;     THE SECRETARY 0F STATE F0R ENERGY said that the result of theminers&apos; ballot which would be announced later that morning was likelyNat&apos; to snow a substantial majority against a national strike of the sameBoard-13^ Coa* order as in the previous autumn&apos;s ballot.    This meant that the likelihoodlncju &quot;  , of strike action in the industry before the next annual pay negotiationsAct.Strial in October was small, and should make it easier to deal with thelQn problems of the industry in the coming months.    An early return to workprev^ in South Wales, where a strike was already in progress, might be delayedRefe  US kv a power struggle among the local union leaders.    The Government&apos;sC(va-,ence: public stance should be that the ballot result was the best outcome forrnn ,   ^tn the future of the coal industry.&quot;fusions,&quot;inute 4pay ....N6go .    _ THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the Electricity Council hadin  ^lations reached a settlement with the electricity manual workers and craftsmenE^ec e. on 3 March which would increase average earnings by 5.7 per cent. TheSUd ,    Clty British Gas Corporation would be meeting the unions to discuss the payancj _^ claim of the gas manual workers on 18 March, and it was hoped that aInd   as settlement would be reached at a level below that in the electricitystries industry.&apos;^nute 4WatertndUst THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that there were noDiSput v remaining effects of the water industry dispute except in the NorthWest where some 50 households were still required to boil water and inPtevi0u Wales where there was a particular problem at Blaenau Gwent. Although^eferenS ^t        been claimed that workers had made good their loss of earningsCC(83) 7f&quot;        during the strike by increased overtime since then, this was probablyConciu . no more than a union reaction to the Press reports that contractorsMinute !&quot;0ns&apos;     bad been used extensively to deal with the backlog of repairs, forexample in East Anglia.    It would in fact be a long time before theloss of earnings was made up, especially bearing in mind the level ofthe offer which had been available at an early stage on the basis of themediator&apos;s report.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE reported further progress on sales tothe private sector of Government-owned assets.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office  10 March 1983A CONFIDENTIAL^^^^^ 94 m
