CONFIDENTIALAjp^^^TARY   it      xne Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the Houseof Commons during the following week.Pari&apos;ControTentary THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the compromise proposed for^Pend  ^ inclusion in the Parliamentary Control of Expenditure (Reform) Bill,(Ref   X\Ur?       under which value for money audits would be carried out in the^ Bill   nationalised industries by their own commercial auditors, with theirPrev o reports being made available to Ministers and to Parliament, had beenRefereUS defeated in Standing Committee the previous day.    Opposition MembersCc( 3) objected to the employment of private sector auditors rather than theC nci   ^t^1      Comptroller and Auditor General&apos;s staff; and some of the Government&apos;sMinut Slons      supporters who favoured the compromise in principle had thought that6 I its adoption would lead the Opposition to prevent the passage of theBill and would thus prevent any further progress on Parliamentarycontrol of expenditure for years.   Mr Edward du Cann MP had asked himwhether the Government would seek to reinstate the compromise at ReportStage or whether he should do so himself.   Mr Norman St John-Stevas MPwould be reluctant for the Government to do so, for fear of losing theBill.    The Opposition would prefer the Bill to be reintroduced in thefollowing Session, when they would hope to carry the measure in theform which they favoured.    Value for money audits were desirable intheir own right, and the best chance of securing the Government&apos;s aimlay in Mr du Cann&apos;s putting down an amendment at Report Stage which theGovernment would support.THE CHIEF WHIP said that there would be little advantage in making anyspecial arrangements to try to rescue the compromise proposal at ReportStage, since there was now little or no chance of the Bill becoming lawin the current Session.    Report Stage could not be before 13 May, andthe Opposition would almost certainly talk the Bill out.    Other Billswould take precedence on the remaining Private Members&apos; Days.c nanis Ifor Rac!0n        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the Code of Practice^Uaii,.13&apos;&apos;&apos; ^or tne eliminat-i n  f racial discrimination and the promotion of equal^ de 0f S opportunity in employment, which the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE)^tactiCe ^ac^ prepared and which he had presented to Parliament, had arousedopposition among the Government&apos;s supporters.    In order to allay theirconcern he would be obliged to announce that the Government intended tointroduce legislation in due course to empower the Secretary of Statefor Employment to amend such codes before laying them before Parliament.It might even be necessary to indicate the Government&apos;s readiness toamend the CRE Code in the event of such legislation being passed.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that there couldbe no question of legislation on this subject during the currentSession of Parliament.The Cabinet -iTook note.
CONFIDENTIALAFPat^n 2&apos;     THE F0REIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had announced on 20 April that itpai^ could not be associated with the proposed visit to the Falkland IslandsIsj   anc* by Argentine next-of-kin being organised by Senor De Stefanis. Thes announcement made it clear that the arrangements proposed bypre . Seno-r Destefanis   were contrary to the ICRC&apos;s principle of neutrality.r6  l0us Meanwhile Senor de Stefanis was claiming that the party would sail forCc(o^?nce: the Falkland Islands on about 30 April despite the ICRC announcement.Concl An approach was now being made to the Argentine Government through theMinutUSl0ns&apos;     Swiss authorities to persuade them to deter Senor De Stefanis frome 2 proceeding with his plans, and the matter was also being pursued throughthe ICRC.    If, despite these representations, Senor De Stefanis wentahead, there would be difficult political judgments involved in decidinghow to handle him and his party, which could not be left to the militaryand civil authorities on the Falkland Islands.    He would be consideringwith the Secretary of State for Defence as a matter of urgency what theright British response would be.Middle vtast       THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that President Reagan&apos;sPtevi0 statement following the terrorist bomb attack on the United StatesReferenS Embassy in Beirut had been well judged.    There were now reported toCC( 3\ Ce: be 47 people killed or missing and 100 injured as a result of the^ Hcl   ^2th       explosion.    It had been announced on 14 April that the United KingdomHiriuteS^ ns      contingent to the multinational force in Beirut would remain there fora further period of three months.    There had been no further developmentson the Arab/Israel question since the statement by King Hussein of Jordanon 10 April about the failure of his negotiations with the leader of thePalestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), Mr Arafat.    Nor was there anysign of a major move on the part of the United States to break thedeadlock.    The United States Secretary of State, Mr Shultz, had not yetmade up his mind to visit the Middle East and was unlikely to do sounless there was a clearer prospect of agreement on a mutual withdrawalof foreign forces from the Lebanon.    For the moment there appeared tobe no way in which the European Community could help to move mattersforward.    The projected meeting between the Minister of State, Foreignand Commonwealth Office, Mr Hurd, and Mr Qaddoumi of the PLO was takingplace in Tunis that day.    Mr Hurd would be bringing home to Mr Qaddoumithe PLO&apos;s responsibility for the failure of the negotiations betweenKing Hussein and Mr Arafat, and would be impressing on him the seriousconsequences of the PLO continuing to insist on its maximum demands.States THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that President Reagan hadannounced on 19 April his endorsement of the recommendations in the^tevious Scowcroft Commission&apos;s report, which called for continuation of the Bl^efereriQ bomber, Trident and cruise missile programmes and the deployment of^(83) ^* 1C0 MX missiles in existing Minuteman silos.    This announcement, which0ficiUs^otn      was consistent with the deterrent policies of the Alliance, had anltHite 2   S&apos;      important bearing on the current debate about arms control and nucleardeterrence. &apos;iiifl
CONFIDENTIALS viet ii .union       THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there had been no?reVi0ug reaction so far from the Soviet authorities to the expulsion of a fourthe-erenc Soviet official from the United Kingdom.     The expulsion from the.&quot;(83) j.6&apos; United Kingdom of three Soviet officials for activities directed against&quot; nclus *t^ tbfi security of the United Kingdom had been followed by the expulsionMinute 2 nS&gt;       from Moscow of two British officials whose conduct had given theSoviet&apos;Government no cause for complaint.     He had considered whetherto retaliate by expelling a further two Soviet officials from Londonbut had decided to limit the expulsion to one, in the hope that this wouldterminate the exchange.     It was regrettable that the BritishBroadcasting Corporation had reported the decision in a way calculatedto elicit a hostile Soviet reaction.The Cabinet -Took note.iNlTr^1rs 3.     THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the underlying trend ofexpenditure on the Common Agricultural Policy was in danger of using up?&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;unit a^ tne EuroPean Community&apos;s available revenue.    The financiali,1(lget   ^ consequences of the 1983 price settlement were unlikely to be a majorfactor:    the main causes of the problem were the increase in the volume^vi0us of agricultural production and the gap between Community and world prices.&apos; erp-nc . ^e Commission had said that their best estimate of expenditure on&quot;   ^ Ii&apos;k        agriculture in 1984 would be between 16 and 17 billion ecus (aboutjj^clusi0 billion) and that they could not guarantee that this and the otherltiUte ^   S&gt;       demands on the Community budget could be contained within the availablerevenues.    This was extremely disturbing for the United Kingdom, becauseit meant that there might be no money in the 1984 Community budget topay for refunds of the United Kingdom&apos;s contribution.      It was essentialthat the United Kingdom should take a position which would prevent theCommission and other member states from saying that, by agreeing to theprice increase, the United Kingdom had committed itself to an increasein the Community&apos;s own resources.ijlce THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD reported that the Council6^0tiatio  ^ Ministers (Agriculture), at their meeting on 18-21 April, had come veryl s       close to agreement on the 1983 price proposals, subject to a major.^vious outstanding dispute between France and Germany.    He recalled that, as a^f6jeHce&lt; result of the Cabinet discussion on 14 April, the Prime Minister had sent^      12th        Personal messages to Monsieur Thorn, the President of the Commission,^ C^8i0l. and Vice-President Tugendhat.    He (the Minister) had been able to follow^te 3   s       up these messages by persuading the Commission to table a paper at theCouncil bringing out the financial implications of their proposals andthe underlying trends.     He had then used this paper as a basis forarguing that the Commission should withdraw their price proposals andsubstitute more modest proposals.    In the following discussion sevenmember states had said that the Commission&apos;s proposals were inadequate,pointing to the fact that the average increase within the Community was ,4 per cent whereas the average Community rate of inflation was 9 per cent.Only the Dutch gave the United Kingdom any support.     The Germans fromCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe chair said nothing about prices at all.    On the third day of thenegotiations the Commission had considered the matter and reached adecision which was both without precedent and highly favourable to theUnited Kingdom&apos;s position.     The Commission not only declined to makeany proposals for additional price increases but also committed themselvesto refusing to come forward with any such proposals later in thenegotiations.     The significance of this was that, without a Commissionproposal, there had to be a unanimous decision by the Council to agreeany increase different from the Commission&apos;s proposals, so that theUnited Kingdom acquired an effective veto.     The Commission statement. produced a change in the atmosphere in the Council and a consensus thenemerged which left only one major point outstanding.    The Commission&apos;sproposals for a revaluation of the German monetary compensatory amountwould have resulted in no increase in prices for German milk and cerealfarmers and the German Government had decided that this would beunacceptable.     This matter was left unresolved and the AgricultureCouncil was to meet again on Wednesday 27 April.The risk to the United Kingdom was that the Germans would try to solvetheir problem by a monetary device which would increase negativemonetary compensatory amounts throughout the rest of the Community whileat the same time reducing their own positive monetary compensatory amount.The effect would be that in many member states prices to domesticproducers would be increased beyond the intention of the Commission&apos;sproposals, thus solving the German political problem at the expense ofan unjustified further stimulus to the production of surpluses.    It wasessential that at the Anglo-German Summit on 21-22 April United KingdomMinisters should make it quite clear that no solution would be acceptableto the United Kingdom which resulted in a further effective increase inprices to producers throughout the Community.In discussion it was pointed out that, if the United Kingdom could be held,by approving the price proposals, to have known and accepted that theresult might be the exhaustion of all the money otherwise available forUnited Kingdom refunds, that would weaken its negotiating position overthe budget.     For that reason it was essential that the Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food should make a statement at the ?Agriculture Council on 27 April which would unambiguously protect theUnited Kingdom&apos;s position.In further discussion it was reported that the United States&apos; decisionto take agricultural land out of production would not help the problemof Community surpluses, because the land would lie fallow for a year andAmerican farmers would be able to conserve their financial resources,thus being in a position to produce an even greater increase in productionin 1984 than would otherwise have been possible.c*ol THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that he had arranged forcopies of the Report by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollutionto be sent to all his colleagues in the European Community.    The matterwould be discussed at a meeting of the Council of Ministers in June, iwhere he hoped progress would be made towards establishing an agreedCommunity policy.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALSteel ... ^|THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that his talks with?rev&apos; Graf Lambsdorff, the German Minister of Economic Affairs, on 22 AprilRefer US would be very important.    Graf Lambsdorff would be in the chair of theCC(83) Council of Ministers on Monday 25 April to fix steel quotas for theConc^u !^tn       coming year.     The last quotas had been decided at a time when theHinute ^0ns      British share of the European market had been low.      The United Kingdomwas now more competitive and selling more steel, and would be looking foran increase in quotas.     The negotiation would not be easy.C uncii e\ist   01 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER reported on the meeting of the Council(Fin    rs of Ministers (Finance) in Luxembourg on 18 April.    The most important18 Apr*t item had been a discussion about the export credit consensus within theOrganisation of European Co-operation and Development (OECD).    A Communityposition had been agreed, but it did not include precise figures for theproposed reduction in interest rates.     The United Kingdom had argued fora &quot;marked reduction&quot; and this was likely to be the outcome of thenegotiations in OECD.    The French had, for the first time, accepted thatin future changes in interest rates might be made more automatic.The Cabinet -Took note.i5CONFIDENTIAL
J CONFIDENTIALAFFatTRIAL        4*     THE H0ME SECRETARY said that, as agreed with colleagues and with__ the full support of the local authority associations, he had made anThr order increasing the pension contributions of the Fire Service by 4 per^ndu   ei?ed cent; the increase would be implemented in two stages, in May andA.ct . Str?-al        November.    The National Executive of the Fire Brigade&apos;s Union (FBU)Fire q ln t^e discussed his decision and a Delegate Conference had been calledService     for 26 April.    The militant areas of the FBU might well persuade theConference to take some form of industrial action, and the CivilContingencies Unit had decided the previous day that troops shouldbegin training with emergency fire appliances (&quot;Green Goddesses&quot;) andshould stand by in readiness.    The most damaging form of industrialaction would be a series of one-day strikes in different areas withoutnotice.    This would oblige the Government to keep the troops and theGreen Goddesses in a state of readiness at considerable expense, whileminimising the cost to the FBU.    The case in favour of the action hehad taken, which would result in the firemen paying a reasonableproportion of the cost of their index-linked pension scheme and whichwas similar to action already taken in relation to the police and armedforces, was overwhelming, and it was likely that public opinion wouldsupport the Government.    The fire officers were expected to opposestrike action.^.at n.jDoCk s* THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that, if the strike of dock-rike       workers at Tilbury was not resolved, the Port of London Authority wouldrun out of money in June.    When this happened they would be unable tocomply with the terms of the Jones/Aldington agreement on the reallocationof surplus registered dock labour among other port employers. Thisfailure would almost certainly lead to the calling of a national dockstrike.CisPuteBtitish 3t        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that negotiations between^e^land&apos; British Leyland (BL) and the unions, on the dispute at Cowley about^ wley   S &quot;wastiing-up time&quot;, had broken down.    The BL management were prepared toplant delay the introduction of the change until 30 May, when it wouldcoincide with the introduction of a new bonus scheme, and had offeredan inquiry into industrial relations at the plant.    The unions had notaccepted these proposals, and would recommend a continuation of thestrike at a mass meeting at Cowley the following day.    The managementwould write to the strikers threatening dismissal if they did not returnbefore 25 April.   The management might not have handled the disputewith outstanding skill, and their threat to transfer investment to otherplants was unconvincing; but it was very important that the Governmentshould not get involved in the dispute.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office21 April 1983
