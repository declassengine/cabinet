CONFIDENTIALAFpi^^TARY   1.     The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the Houseof Commons during the following week.Pari&apos;C ntroientary   TE CHANCELL0R 0F THE EXCHEQUER said that the leading ConservativeExperi(j.  f        sponsors of the Parliamentary Control of Expenditure (Reform) Bill,(Pej   Lture       Mr Norman St John-Stevas and Mr Edward du Cann, now appeared anxious toBi^I resolve their conflict with the Government over the provisions of theBill as soon as possible.   At a meeting with the Chief Secretary,Ptevi0u Treasury, earlier that week, it had appeared likely that they wouldRefer   S accept a compromise under which their proposals to give the ComptrollerCC(83) and Auditor General (C and AG) direct access to nationalised industries^ nclu -St        and publicly owned companies would be dropped, together with clause 4Minute !&quot; ns&gt;     (which would give the C and AG access to private sector companies fundedby the Government).    In return, Ministers would be required to consultParliament about the programme of references of nationalised industriesto the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, and Parliament would be moreclosely involved in the follow-up to such reports; and there would be newarrangements under which the commercial auditors of the nationalisedindustries would carry out value for money audits, reporting to thesponsoring Minister.   Copies of their reports would go to the C and AG,the Public Accounts Committee, and the relevant Departmental SelectCommittee, and could then be used as a basis for a further examinationby Parliament.    He believed that, unlike the proposals at presentcontained in the Bill, arrangements on these lines could lead to animprovement in the efficiency of the nationalised industries, and thatthey formed a basis for an acceptable compromise.    If the Cabinet approvedthe proposals, it would be desirable to reach a firm agreement withMr du Cann and Mr St John-Stevas as soon as possible; otherwise, theymight well be persuaded by Mr Joel Barnett, and other sponsors of theBill, to adopt a less flexible attitude.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that he had put the proposalsoutlined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to three nationalised industryChairmen that morning, without commitment.    Subject to a minor technicalpoint, they had found them acceptable, and thought that they would alsobe acceptable to the other nationalised industry Chairmen.    If theproposals were approved by the Cabinet, he intended to tellMr St John-Stevas and Mr du Cann that, if they could reach agreement withthe Chairmen of the nationalised industries on revised proposals on theselines, the Government would be prepared to go along with them.   He wouldmake it clear that the Bill would remain a Private Member&apos;s measure, andthat there could be no question of the provision of Government time forits further consideration.In discussion the following points were made -a. A number of nationalised industry Chairmen might well find thecompromise proposals unacceptable.b. The concept of a value for money audit was a very vague one; andit might be desirable that value for money audit should be carriedout by consultants who were independent of the normal commercialauditors, and who were clearly answerable to the sponsoring &apos;Minister and not to the board of the nationalised industry concerned.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALc. Companies Act companies should be excluded from the scope ofthe proposed arrangements.   The setting up of such companies wasoften a useful intermediate step in the process of privatisation,and that process would be hindered if they were to continue to besubject to Parliamentary accounting procedures.d. The introduction of value for money audits could lead tosignificant improvements in the efficiency of the nationalisedindustries.    They might be modelled on the management systemsaudits which had already been successfully carried out for LondonTransport.    It might not be necessary for separate auditors to beappointed in each industry for the value for money and for thecommercial audits; the auditors of all the nationalised industries&apos;were appointed by, and answerable to, the sponsoring Ministers,and Ministers would have control over the form and scope of anyvalue for money audit.e. Even if the Government reached agreement with some of itssponsors on appropriate amendments, there was no guarantee that theamendments would be acceptable to other sponsors, such asMr Joel Barnett.   The proposed compromise with Mr St John-Stevas andMr du Cann could not therefore be sure of producing a reasonablyacceptable Bill.f. The Bill was likely to be opposed at Report Stage on 12 Mayby some Opposition Members.    If they were successful in obstructingthe Bill&apos;s progress, the Government would come under heavy pressureto introduce a Government Bill on similar lines in the followingSession.    This should be resisted, since if a Government Bill wereintroduced there would then be heavy pressure to restore theobjectionable provisions which the Conservative sponsors of thepresent Bill were willing to drop; such pressure would be easier toresist if the Bill were a Private Member&apos;s one.    It was, however,desirable that the Bill should be put into a more acceptable formeven if it were not passed, so that it would be available in thatform to any Private Member who was minded to take it up in a futureSession.g. It would have to be made clear to the sponsors of the Bill thatthe Government&apos;s agreement in principle to the revised proposals didnot in any way imply a commitment to ensure its passage.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinetagreed that on balance a compromise on the lines suggested by theChancellor of the Exchequer was desirable, provided that the sponsors ofthe Bill clearly accepted that continuing Government support wasconditional upon the deletion of clause 4 of the Bill as it stood, andupon the exclusion of all Companies Act companies from the proposedarrangement.    No Government time would be made available for the Bill.The proposed value for money audits could be carried out by thecommercial auditors of each nationalised industry, though differentauditors with the appropriate skills might need to be appointed in somecases.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury, should inform Mr St John-Stevasand Mr du Cann that, if they could secure the agreement of the inationalised industry Chairmen to the proposed compromise, the Governmentwould not oppose appropriate amendments to the Bill.   Any detailed pointsthat needed further consideration should be considered by the MinisterialGroup on Parliamentary Control of Expenditure (MISC 92).2CONFIDENTIAL

(MISC 92).4ppAlRg 2.      THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE (MR KURD),said that the next few weeks were likely to prove crucial for theMiddle p success of President Reagan&apos;s plan for a Middle East settlement. Ifast       the plan collapsed, the way would be clear for an increase in SovietPrevi0u influence in the region.   King Hussein of Jordan, whom he had seen in^eferenS London on 28 February, was uncertain whether he would be able to reachCC(83) a sufficient measure of agreement with the Chairman of the Palestinei ^0riclu [ Liberation Organisation, Mr Arafat, to enable him to visit Washington toMinute 2 nS&apos;     sPeak on behalf of the Palestinians as well as the Jordanians.King Hussein would ask the United States Government how they proposed tofulfil their assurances about a freeze on new Israeli settlements on theWest Bank and Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Lebanon.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary was expected to discuss the prob-lem later that day with President Reagan and the United States Secretaryof State, Mr Shultz.It was still unclear whether the difficulty of the representative of thePalestinians on the Arab League delegation to visit London on 18 Marchhad been solved (though the Moroccan Government professed to beconfident that they had), and therefore whether the visit would takeplace.    It was important that the visit should take place, since Arabcountries, other than Egypt and Oman, were still withholding agreementto Ministerial visits in either direction.r THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE, said that the^teviou Spanish Foreign Minister, Senor Moran, had accepted the offer of a^efeten^ meeting with the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary in London on 16 March.^(83) c^&apos; Gibraltar would thus be discussed as one of a number of subjects in theu?nclusi0 course of a visit to London which was one of a series of visits tonute 2   S&apos; European capitals being undertaken by Senor Moran.StaiG PubUc of       THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE, reported that the6r,tiany Federal German Foreign Minister, Herr Genscher, had told him in themargins of a meeting of European Foreign Ministers on 1 March that he3CONFIDENTIAL

FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE (MR HURD) ,- said that Polish debts had been discussed at the Community&apos;s PoliticalPolis^ _ Co-operation Meeting on 1 March.   The Poles were at present payingebt      nothing on their official debt, and the Community&apos;s Foreign Ministerswanted to take up the matter with the Polish Government in collaborationwith the other creditors including the United States.   The United StatesGovernment was reluctant on the grounds that a refusal to discuss suchmatters was a mark of political disapproval of the regime; the opinionof Community Ministers was that it did not make sense to show disapprovalby accepting unjustifiable financial penalties.Eur PeanParliame THE MINISTER 0F STATE  FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE, said that thety-rthe nt 1 Political Co-operation Meeting had also discussed the proposal that theIteian^n European Parliament should investigate the affairs of Northern Ireland.The President of the Commission, Monsieur Thorn, had made a helpfulPrevi0u intervention in support of the United Kingdom&apos;s view.   The Foreign andftefer Commonwealth Secretary had recommended that the President of the^(83) c^&apos;&apos;        Political Committee of the European Parliament be told that the matterConciUs- should be dropped.    The Attorney General had been asked to advise.linutg 3 ns&apos;     whether it would be possible for the United Kingdom to bring an actionagainst the European Parliament in the European Court.&apos; i983 FarmpUCe THE PRIME MINISTER said that the price review had been discussed at her^ej&gt; tiat- meeting with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands on 2 March.l0ns     Mr Lubbers had said that the Commission&apos;s proposal for a 4i per centPteviou price increase was too much for the Netherlands where the rate of^eferenc inflation was only 2J per cent.Cc(83) 26:^0nclUs.n In discussion it was pointed out that the Dutch Prime Minister&apos;s line^ute 3 ns&apos;     was inconsistent with that of his own Minister of Agriculture who hadsaid that the Commission&apos;s proposals provided a good starting point fornegotiations but would have to be improved in certain areas.^berg Wltn     THE PRIME MINISTER said that she had received the members of the * the European Democratic Group of the European Parliament at 10 Downing Streetp   Pean 0n 1 Marcn-    She had told her guests that it was essential that theariiame budget problem be solved by June.   Even though the rest of the (Community had undertaken to find a solution by November 1982, the United?4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALKingdom still had absolutely no protection for 1983 and it would beimpossible for the Government to go into an Election campaign with theproblem unsolved.    The Government would, therefore, be obliged tocontemplate withholding if nothing were done.    It was unfortunate thatreports of this private discussion had appeared in the press.In discussion it was suggested that some of the positions taken by theUnited Kingdom in Community negotiations carried the risk that theGovernment would appear to the British public as hostile to theCommunity.    On the other hand it was argued that, by firmly defendingBritish membership and at the same time fighting hard for Britishinterests within the Community, the Government occupied a comfortableposition midway between those who wanted to withdraw and those whoadmired the Community uncritically.    In any case, British public opinionwould turn against Community membership if nothing were done about theUnited Kingdom&apos;s net contribution to the Community budget, which waslikely to be well in excess of  1 billion in 1983 if it were notcorrected.^USTrtat^AlRs 4&apos;     TE SECRETARY 0F STATE F0R ENERGY said that the National Union of...... Mineworkers (NUM) had balloted its members in South Wales seekingNati0 authority for strike action in protest against the closure of the, Coa^ ^ Tymawr-Lewis Merthyr pit.   The majority in favour of strike action hadIndUst ard:       been only fractionally above the 55 per cent required, after twoActi0n recounts.    The NUM&apos;s area executives in Yorkshire, Scotland and Kenthad recommended their members to join the strike from Sunday 6 March.Ptevi0u *n some other areas, particularly in the Midlands, ballots were being^feren^ held.   There was evidence of resentment at certain pits in YorkshireCC(82) ev that ballots had not been held there.   An emergency meeting of theC nclus National Executive Committee (NEC) of the NUM had been called that^iiiute 4 nS&apos;     morning, at which the NUM President, Mr Scargill, would probably try tosecure a decision that the NUM&apos;s rules could be interpreted so as topermit the NEC to call for a national strike without a ballot.   Even ifthe NEC did take such a decision, it was possible that some areas wouldproceed with their own arrangements for ballots.   The extent of supportfor a national strike would become clearer over the next few days. Thecase which had been made by the National Coal Board (NCB) for closingthe Tymawr-Lewis Merthyr pit was exceptionally strong: it was over100 years old and was no longer workable; all the 500 miners involvedhad been offered new jobs in the same area.   The Government shouldcontinue to leave it to the NCB to get the facts and arguments acrossboth to miners and to the public; they were already having some successin this direction.   The Government&apos;s public stance should be confinedto expressing confidence in, the NCB and its management and to statingthat decisions on closures were a matter for the NCB.i5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALNegot.    . THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the pay negotiations int^latl ns the electricity supply industry were reaching a critical stage. TheElect . . Electricity Council was meeting the trade unions that day and believed^uPpl 1CItV that there was some chance of a settlement, although this seemed on, and Ga balance to be unlikely.    If no settlement seemed likely in the courseIntjUst.S.  f the day, the Electricity Council would withhold its final offer andties there Would be a further round of negotiation.    In the gas industry thePrev o offer recently made by the employers had been turned down, and it wasRefQ&gt; Us unlikely that there would be further contacts between the two sides forCCfft-i\ a week or two.Vite 4WaterIndust THE SECRETARY 0F STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that rapid progress hadDiSput &apos; been made by the water authorities in restoring normal supplies sincethe end of the dispute.    At that time the number of households requiredPrevi0 to use standpipes had been 91,000; all but 100 of these had now had^efere S normal supplies restored.   The number of those required to boil waterCc(83) ?e:         ad been reduced to 1 million.   He had pressed the water authorities to^ nclu use a^ availaDle means for restoring supplies including the use ofMinute 4 nS&apos;     contractors, and to avoid excessive overtime.   The acceptance by1 million local authority manual workers of a pay settlement of 4.86 percent had been helpful in limiting the repercussive effects of the waterindustry settlement; it was hoped that a settlement would be achievedwith the local authority craftsmen at around the same level.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that, although thewater industry employers had not succeeded in presenting their case wellor in securing a settlement at a satisfactory level, they were to becongratulated on their efforts in ensuring that a strike which hadlasted for over four weeks had caused so little disruption to normalwater supplies.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office3 March 1983 ,?61CONFIDENTIAL^^[^^ ?   sr. m
