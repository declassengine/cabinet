IwCONFIDENTIALJ^IAMENTARY   1.     THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that it was likely that anRS amendment to the Address in favour of Proportional Representation wouldbe moved by Peers of the Liberal and Social Democratic Parties. SomeConservative Peers might support it, but the Government should haveno difficulty in defeating it.The Cabinet -Took note.^FATGN 2&apos;     THE F0REIGN MD COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the FirstRS Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, Mr Yuri Andropov, had thatS0v^ day been unanimously elected President of the Supreme Soviet.UnionPrevioUs??Lerence:(83) 15&lt;hI fusions,Minute 2n8 Kong THE PRIME MINISTER reported the latest developments in the discussionsP&gt;p . with the Government of the People&apos;s Republic of China about Hong Kong.Kef UsCCffiiNnce: The Cabinet -Cone     18 th*inuteS2 nS&apos; Took note&apos;CONFIDENTIAL
ICONFIDENTIAL,   Jp^NlTY 3.     THE PRIME MINISTER said that during the Election campaign three? __ important agreements had been reached at meetings of the Council ofC0to   . Ministers.    On 16 May a six-year Community loan of $4 billion hadBus&quot;Unity been agreed for France.    On 16-17 May the 1983 farm prices had beenDUr^ness settled.    The average price increase for the Community was 4 per cent.Elec ^ &apos;^ie ^nitea Kingdom had retained the beef and sheep premium schemes,CaniCt^&quot;0n obtained increases in butter and school milk subsidies and secured18n extra aid for pig producers.   On 24-25 May the Council of Ministers(Foreign Affairs) had agreed that the dates for the next EuropeanParliament elections would be 14-17 June 1984.pBucUe111^ THE F0REIGN MD COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Council of^ited Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on 13 June had discussed at length a draftKirxgdo report from the German Presidency for the European Council on theRefUn m financial problems of the Community.    The greater part of the reportdealt with the long-term issues.   There was a growing realisation thatthe Community&apos;s existing resources would soon be exhausted. Themajority of member states were keen to increase the Community&apos;s ownresources, although the Germans and Dutch were not prepared to agreenow.    The United Kingdom could not prevent this matter being discussed.He had made absolutely clear, however, that we reserved our position onwhether own resources should be increased.    If the European Council of17-19 June agreed, all the problems of long-term financing would nowbe subject to a full discussion within the Community between now andthe following European Council in December.    This was the only settingwithin which a long-term settlement of the budget problem could bereached.    On the short-term problem of the 1983 budget refund for theUnited Kingdom no agreement had been reached.   The Presidency&apos;s draftreport to the European Council simply rehearsed the problem andcontained no proposals for its resolution,   He had, therefore, insistedon submitting to the European Council the United Kingdom&apos;s own paperwhich had been distributed at the informal meeting of Foreign Ministersat Gymnich.    If there was no conclusion on the 1983 budget refund forthe United Kingdom in the European Council on 17-19 June, a&apos;serioussituation would arise.   At the last meeting of the European Councilthe President of the Commission had said that the last date for puttingthe figures into the Community&apos;s draft 1984 budget would be the JulyBudget Council, so that a decision was needed at the latest at theCouncil of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on 18-19 July.   Now some memberstates, principally France and Italy, were making a link with the long-term discussion or maintaining that the European Parliament would insiston such a link.   He had in mind that, if no solution on the 1983 budgetrefund for the United Kingdom were reached, the Government should beprepared to withhold Community funds after the Council of Ministers(Foreign Affairs) on 18-19 July.   A White Paper setting out the promiseswhich had been made to the United Kingdom, should be published after theEuropean Council.   The withholding of funds could provoke retaliation byother member states, but this was not very likely, as the action wouldbe directly related to the issue in dispute.CONFIDENTIAL
mCONFIDENTIALIn discussion it was pointed out that, since the United Kingdom hadreceived repeated promises, the Government would be justified insafeguarding the position by withholding Community funds.    There wassome evidence that the Germans, foreseeing this risk, were nowincreasing the effort for a solution.    If the United Kingdom withheldCommunity funds, legislation would be required, but the timing of thislegislation remained for decision.    On the one hand, there werepolitical and negotiating reasons which could point to delaying thelegislation.    On the other hand, there were legal arguments for a swiftpassage of the Bill after an announcement, in order to provideprotection against challenge in the courts.    It was clear that, ifasked in a debate whether the withholding of Community funds was legal,the Attorney General would have to say that it was illegal.    It wasfurther pointed out that retaliation by other member states should notbe ruled out, and counter-measures should be prepared.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Governmentwanted a settlement of the 1983 budget refund.    It would be necessaryto make clear to the European Council at Stuttgart that, if this werenot achieved by the meeting of the Council of Ministers on 18 and19 July, despite the repeated promises made by the Community, HerMajesty&apos;s Government would be obliged to take action to protect theUnited Kingdom&apos;s interests.    It was necessary that other members of theCommunity should be in no doubt that the United Kingdom might be drivento withhold Community funds and, if so driven, would be prepared totake this action.    She hoped that the Government would not in the eventbe obliged to carry this threat out.Socj_i fFund       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT reported that a satisfactoryagreement on the Social Fund had been reached, from which the UnitedKingdom would benefit.    The result on youth unemployment was alsosatisfactory.os THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT reported that a good agreementhad been reached in the Council of Ministers on 2 June setting actionlevels and limits for asbestos. The Germans had been very helpful inarriving at a result which the United Kingdom could accept.TheSPEE^EEN&apos;S      A.     The Cab inet considered a memorandum by the Lord President of the N tjjj Council (C(83) 17), to which was attached a draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech^ENing of         n t*16 Opening  ^ Parliament.^IAMEMtC&apos;NL        THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the draft Speech attachedto C(83) 17 had been prepared by the Queen&apos;s Speeches and FutureLegislation Committee (QL) on the basis of suggestions made bycolleagues on an earlier draft.   QL had not been able to accept allthose suggestions, because some appeared to commit the Government toi3CONFIDENTIAL
fJ**CONFIDENTIALadditional public expenditure or to legislation which had not been partof the provisional legislative programme which the Cabinet had agreedearlier in the year.    The draft Speech had to be submitted to The Queenthat afternoon.    ql would review the legislative programme for thecoming Session and would shortly submit its conclusions to the Cabinet.In the meantime there was a need for some legislation to be introducedimmediately and he proposed that some of the Bills which had fallen atthe Dissolution and some essential and Second Reading Committee Billsshould be introduced as soon as they were ready.In discussion,  the following main points were made -a. The passages on defence should be re-ordered, and thespecific reference to the negotiations between the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union on intermediate range nuclearforces should be deleted.b. In the paragraph on the European Community, the referenceto the control of agricultural spending should be deleted; andthe reference to the accession of Spain and Portugal should berevised.c. In the paragraph on the dependent territories a separatesentence on Gibraltar was needed.d. It was agreed that no reference should be made to theintroduction of private finance into British Airways and theNational Bus Company.    It had not yet been agreed that thosemeasures should be included in the programme for the comingSession.e. The legislation for the abolition of the Greater LondonCouncil and the Metropolitan County Councils could not beready until the 1984-85 Session, and the terms of the referenceto their abolition in the draft Speech were thereforeappropriate.    It was important that the legislation should beintroduced right at the start of the 1984-85 Session; it mightbe desirable for that Session to begin earlier than usual, andfor the business of the 1983-84 Session to be completed by theSummer Adjournment, without the need for a spillover in theautumn.f. The form of wording about equal treatment for men andwomen in social security was misleading; the sentence shouldbe deleted.g. The sentence on grants to education authorities should beexpanded to explain that these were grants for innovationsand improvements in the curriculum.h. The second sentence of the paragraph on Northern Irelandshould make it clear that political progress would have to bebased on widespread acceptance throughout the community. Thefinal sentence of the paragraph could be deleted. iA number of minor and drafting amendments were also agreed.4. CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinetapproved the draft Speech attached to C(83) 17, subject to the pointsmade in discussion.    The Secretary of the Cabinet should now preparea revised version for her to submit to The Queen for approval.The Cabinet -1. Subject to the changes agreed in discussion, approvedthe draft Speech attached to C(83) 17.2. Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to prepare afinal version of the draft Speech, taking account of thesechanges, for the Prime Minister to submit to The Queen.^NTRal 5.      THE PRIME MINISTER said that an announcement would be made thattto CY afternoon that the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS) would beSTAPfr disbanded at the end of July.    The CPRS had been a valuable organisationin the early years after the 1979 General Election, but studies of thekind the CPRS had recently undertaken needed firm political directionand would be better carried out in the planning units which had nowbeen set up in a number of Departments.    The Chief Scientist, CPRS,would remain as Chief Scientific Adviser, Cabinet Office; and some ofthe CPRS staff who had come from outside the Civil Service might betaken on by other Departments.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office16 June 1983t5.
