CONFIDENTIALARLIAMENTARY   1.     The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the Houses of Commons during the following week.AFFAIGN 2&apos;     THE F0REIGN ^ COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the meeting of thes Palestine National Council which had just ended in Algiers had criticisedPresident Reagan&apos;s plan for a Middle East settlement without rejectingMiddle it-   Mr Arafat was now in a position to pursue his talks withEast King&apos; Hussein of Jordan, who had been in London earlier that week.    In thelight of these talks King Hussein would decide whether he could put adevious realistic package to the United States Government.    The crucial questionTerence:        would then be whether the United States and Israeli Governments wereCC(83) 5th        prepared to negotiate on the basis put forward.   On his forthcomingConclusions      visit to Washington he would be stressing to the United StatesMinute 2 Government the urgency of the need for progress.King Hassan of Morocco had now announced that the proposed visit toLondon by an Arab League delegation would take place on 18 March andhad accepted that the interests of the Palestinians should be representedon the delegation by Mr Milhem.    It was still unclear whether this hadbeen agreed with Mr Arafat; it was therefore still uncertain whether thevisit would take place.In Beirut the British contingent to the Multinational Force had settledin well and established good relations with the Israelis.   There was noquestion of increasing the size of the contingent, which was justunder 100 men, but there would certainly be pressure for it to remainin the Lebanon beyond the present period of three months.MeXlCo THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that The Queen&apos;s recentvisit to Mexico had been an outstanding success.    The Queen had beenreceived with enthusiasm by Government and population alike.   He hadhimself had useful talks with the President,Senor de la Madrid, andwith the Mexican Foreign Minister, Senor Sepulveda.    The President wasa strong personality who had made a good start in tackling the problemsof the Mexican economy.    Senor Sepulveda had shown considerable under-standing for the British position on Belize, and had been in favour inprinciple of efforts to put Belize&apos;s security on to a wider internationalbasis.   He had, however, made it clear that Mexico had no influence withGuatemala.    He had doubted whether the United States had much influenceeither, and was very worried about United States arms sales to Guatemala.He had been appreciative of the role played by Britain in arrangingfinancial assistance for Mexico through the International Monetary Fund,and had expressed interest in the possibility of informal talks withthe United Kingdom and other oil producing countries about the managementof the oil market in the light of the recent fall in prices, which wascreating serious difficulties for Mexico.   The Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary said that he was consulting the Secretary of State for Energyon how to respond to the Mexican approach about oil prices, and wouldbe taking up the question of arms sales to Guatemala with the UnitedStates Government on his visit to Washington.1CONFIDENTIAL c I^^^^^^^^ be I
CONFIDENTIALZimbabwe THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the situation illZimbabwe was deteriorating.    Government troops in Matabeleland, \mthe white population was being protected by units which had beenlin North Korea, were behaving with appalling savagery.    The BritMGovernment&apos;s concern at the numbers of people being killed had bAexpressed to the Zimbabwean authorities.    It appeared that the pflMinister of Zimbabwe, Mr Mugabe, had fears for the possible brealHthe state; and there was a risk of civil war, with Matabeleland flitself in a situation comparable to that of Biafra.    If reports &lt;?pressure on the Chief Justice to resign were correct, this wouldlserious consequences for the administration of justice throughoutcountry.    No decision had yet been taken about the future of the IMilitary Advisory Training Team (BMATT) in Zimbabwe, which hadsuccessfully assisted with the establishment of an integrated Ziiflarmy and was now well into the training phase.    General ShortissBCommander of BMATT, who was playing a helpful role in the handliBthe internal situation in Zimbabwe, would be returning to London!for consultations.Disarmament THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that President Reagaland Arms made an important speech about intermediate range nuclear forces!Control on 22 February which brought the position of the United StatesGovernment very close to that of the British Government.    The spflPrevious took account of comments and advice which the President had sougBReference: from the Prime Minister before the text was finalised.    The UnitHCC(83) 3rd States chief negotiator on INF, Mr Nitze, now had instructions tlConclusions, any solution which the Soviet side might put forward in the GeneBMinute 2 negotiations.   Mr Nitze had visited London the previous day on hiback to Washington for consultations, and had reported that the Inegotiators in Geneva were taking a hard line and showing no sigBflexibility. Mr Nitze was disinclined to table any specific newlproposal from the United States side until the Soviet position himore extensively probed, but the United States Government had stltake a decision on this.Gibraltar THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Spanish ForiMinister, Senor Moran, had asked for a meeting with him before siPrevious of the Lisbon Agreement took place.   The reasons for this requeslReference: unclear, but it appeared that the Spanish Government was becominlCC(83) 2nd apprehensive about implementing the Lisbon Agreement in the knowBConclusions, that there would be no movement from the British side on the quelMinute 2 sovereignty over Gibraltar.    The meeting would take place in Lonlthe end of a series of visits by Senor Moran to other European clIt would be made clear to him that anything short of a comprehenllifting of all the remaining restrictions in force between SpainHGibraltar would be unacceptable to the British Government.The Cabinet -Took note.2CONFIDENTIAL^____^69M
CONFIDENTIALAFFAUNITY 3&gt;     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that at the Council ofRS Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on 21-22 February there had been nodiscussion of the Commission&apos;s Green Paper on the future financing ofCommunity tne Community.Budget-In discussion it was noted that the greatest disadvantage of the Greendevious Paper for the United Kingdom was its suggestion of an expanded budgetReference- through an increase in own resources.    It also failed to propose anyCC(83) 4th        adequate limit to expenditure on the Common Agricultural Policy.^elusions,Minute 3^iform THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Council of MinistersproCtoral (Foreign Affairs) had fixed the dates for the next elections to the cedure European Parliament for 17-20 May 1984, which meant that polling in theprev&gt; United Kingdom would take place on Thursday 17 May next year. Thel0us Council had recognised that there was no longer any prospect of creatingCC(R^nCe: a ^i^01T electoral procedure in time for those elections, but there hadn      * 2nd        been no disposition to attach any blame to the United Kingdom,fusions,Minute 3Japan THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE reported that there had been someprev. largely informal discussion of the Community&apos;s export restraint agreementRef l0US with Japan at the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs), when bothCCf-JenCe: France and the United Kingdom had taken the view that, while it was aCQ     &apos; ^th        useful step forward, a great deal more needed to be done.    They arguedMi     Usi0ris,     that it should be used as a lever to open up Japan&apos;s domestic marketUte 3 to imports from the Community.    The Netherlands and Germany, on theother hand, had argued that the agreement would entrench inefficiencyin European industry and that it should therefore be the last of itskind.    Both in the informal discussions and in the Council itself hehad registered the United Kingdom&apos;s concerns about video cassetterecorder kits and colour television tubes.TrsPai6 With        THE SECRETARY 0F STATE FOR TRADE reported that the Commission hadln sought to avoid putting the subject of their discussions with Spain onprev&gt; to the agenda of the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on theRef l0us grounds that they had done all they could and that nothing more couldCC(?mnCe:        ^e achieved.

iCONFIDENTIALCommunity/ THE MINISTER OF&apos;AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD reported that at thegj.1 ed suggestion of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary he was going to     ,es Washington shortly to urge moderation and understanding in the currentTra^CU^tura^ difficulties between the United States and the Community overe agricultural trade.The Cabinet -1.     Took note.EliParr6311 THE SECRETARY 0F STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND reported that the PoliticalNQ   *ament:       Affairs Committee of the European Parliament was about to embark on aI      ern study of political and economic affairs in Northern Ireland. Thend European Democratic Group in the European Parliament had triedunsuccessfully to prevent the study.    It was reported that the Committeeplanned to hold meetings in London, Belfast and Dublin.    He proposed totake a very strong line publicly against the study and would refuse tomeet representatives of the Committee, but he felt it would be importantto try and ensure privately and informally, both through the EuropeanDemocratic Group members on the Committee and through the proposedrapporteur, Mr Haagerup, that the United Kingdom&apos;s point of view wasunderstood.In discussion,  it was noted that such an examination of the internalpolitical affairs of an individual member state was unprecedented andoutside the competence of the Parliament under the Treaty of Rome.It raised serious constitutional implications, going beyond NorthernIreland itself, and could change the whole future course of theProvince.    It would undoubtedly be used by the Labour Party to work uppublic feeling against the Community.    The United Kingdom&apos;s positionshould therefore be one of complete opposition to the study and a totalrefusal to co-operate.    It was suggested on the one hand that, whilethis should be the United Kingdom&apos;s position in public, it would bedesirable to take whatever private opportunities offered to get theUnited Kingdom&apos;s views across, so that this country&apos;s case would notgo by default.    On the other hand, it was argued that, while such acourse of action might be advisable if the study went ahead - and therecould be no guarantee that the report would be acceptable even then - thefirst priority should be to get it stopped.    It might prove possible todo so by taking legal action either in the European Court or thedomestic courts.    At the least, proceedings of this kind might delaythe inquiry and so gain some time.   The procedures of the Committeeshould also be studied to see whether it would be possible to depriveit of a quorum if the United Kingdom members stayed away.    It was agreedthat there was no prospect of prevailing upon the Government in theRepublic of Ireland to withhold co-operation.    It was recognised thatit might not prove possible to prevent the study going ahead, particularlysince Committees of the European Parliament did have the power toinvestigate economic matters; even if the Political Affairs Committeecould be prevented from looking into the internal political affairs ofthis country, they might still have a legitimate residual right toi
CONFIDENTIALexplore the impact of Community measures on the economy of a membercountry or a region of such a country.    It would therefore be prudentto examine what would be the United Kingdom&apos;s minimum obligations towardsthe Committee in such matters as security in the event that the studywent ahead.    It was agreed that, although the Chief Whip of the EuropeanDemocratic Group was currently in London, it would be premature todiscuss tactics with him.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinetagreed that the proposed study was a wholly unwarranted intrusion intothe internal affairs of the United Kingdom.   The Government&apos;s attitudeshould be one of resulute opposition,    It was important that the mattershould be handled in such a way as to avoid giving any incentive to theOpposition to inflame anti-Community feeling.    It was therefore firstnecessary to take legal advice about the practicability of preventingthe study by means of proceedings in the European or domestic courts.The Cabinet -2. Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary toconsider urgently, in conjunction with the Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland and the Attorney General, whetherthe European Parliament had power to undertake a study of 7 political and economic affairs in Northern Ireland and whatthe United Kingdom could do to prevent such a study, and toreport his conclusions as soon as possible.formal THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT reported that at the informalEmp^ln   f meeting of Employment Ministers on 21-22 February he had tabled a paperHi^^ yment drawing attention to ways in which the measures which the United Kingdom2i_22terS ^a&lt;^ tak-en could be used to complete the Common Market and opposingFebruary   Community legislation on matters such as working time and pay which werebest settled in accordance with practices in individual member states.Although the United Kingdom Permanent Representation had been ratherapprehensive about the reception the paper would receive, it had notbeen criticised adversely and he had in fact gained some support.He had successfully opposed French proposals for a special Councilmeeting on youth unemployment.    The performance of the Greek Ministerhad been particularly unimpressive, reinforcing the view which hadpreviously been expressed that the United Kingdom should make everyeffort to achieve as many of its Community objectives as possible inthe course of the German Presidency.The Cabinet -3. Took note.5 ibb
CONFIDENTIALINDUSTRIAL        4.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the large increases inRS the price of oil imposed in 1979 by the Organisation of PetroleumExporting Countries (OPEC) had not been justified by the supplyOil Prices        position.    The Saudi Arabian Government had tried to pursue a policy ofallowing the real price of oil to fall by holding it steady in nominalPrevious terms; but this policy had been frustrated by the rise in the exchangePreference* value of the United States dollar, the currency in which oil pricesCC(83) 5th were denominated. Despite attempts by certain countries to maintaindelusions tne Pri e at an artificially high level by restricting production, aMinute 4 significant fall in oil prices was now inevitable.    The British NationalOil Corporation (BNOC) had reduced the price for oil from the UnitedKingdom Continental Shelf (UKCS) by $3 a barrel.    This appeared to beregarded by OPEC countries as a reasonable response to the market. TheNigerian Government, however, had reduced the price of Nigerian oil bysubstantially more; this was widely regarded as a disruptive move. Theinterests of the United Kingdom lay in maintaining an orderly market.A moderate and gradual decline in the price of oil was probably helpfulon balance to this country, since it would encourage an expansion ofthe world economy, from which we would benefit.    A sharp and rapiddecline would be less helpful: the damage to oil-producing countrieswould probably outweigh the benefits to oil-consuming countries; andthe problems of adjustment would be greater.    A sharp decline wouldalso threaten the continued exploitation and development of the UKCS,and hence the future of our off-shore oil equipment industry and theduration of the period of the United Kingdom&apos;s self-sufficiency in oil.Nevertheless, it would be wrong to adopt a policy of restrictingproduction as some OPEC countries had done.    Such a policy was in anyevent unlikely to be effective.In discussion, the following main points were made -a. Uncertainties about future oil prices, and therefore oilrevenue, made the task of the Chancellor of the Exchequer inpreparing his forthcoming Budget unusually difficult. Therehad been similar uncertainties the previous year; but thepresent ones seemed markedly greater.b. The participation agreements to which the BNOC was aparty encouraged the misapprehension that the price of oilfrom the UKCS was set by the Government rather than by themarket.    It was largely for this reason that the Governmentwas subjected to greater pressures from OPEC countries in thematter of oil prices than was the United States Government,even though oil production in the United States was fargreater than here.    There might therefore be advantage interminating the agreements.   On the other hand, to do sowould require primary legislation; this would be politicallycontentious, since participation agreements were widelyregarded as increasing the security of our oil supplies.The Cabinet -1.

CONFIDENTIAL?r^er The Cabinet discussed the settlement of the recent pay dispute in theustry water industry.    Their discussion and the conclusions reached areM recorded separately.*Ne8otiationsdeviousReference:Cc(83) 5th^elusions,Minute 4p.   e THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that the trade figures forgures January would be published that afternoon,   They would show a deficiton visible trade of some  400 million, and a deficit on current accountof over  200 million.    It would be a mistake, however, to read muchsignificance into figures for a single month.    The figures for theprevious month had shown a handsome surplus, and over the three monthsto January 1983 the volume of exports had increased by 2i per centcompared with the same period 12 months previously, and by 3i per centcompared with the three months to October 1982.    Any public commentshould emphasise these points, and the fact that figures for a single5, month were subject to considerable fluctations.The Cabinet -2.     Took note.Cabinet Office24 February 1983.?

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NOCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(83) 6th Conclusions, Minute 4Thursday 24 February 1983 at 10.30 am1fFatTRIAL        THE SECRETARY of STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that manual workers inthe water industry had almost all returned to work.    Pay discussions- with craftsmen in the industry, who numbered about 5,000 were now in^&apos;ater train; and the eventual settlement with them was likely to be on similarIndustry lines to that for the manual workers.    The Committee of Inquiry intoT&apos;ay the pay dispute, under the Chairmanship of Dr Tom Johnston, had^egotiations     recommended a settlement lasting 16 months.    The total pay increasewas 10.4 per cent, equivalent to an annual rate of 7.8 per cent. This^revious included certain improvements linked to productivity; apart from these,Reference. the increase (which had been described as the &apos;going rate&apos;) was 7.3 per^C(83) 5th        cent over 16 months, equivalent to an annual rate of 5.5 per cent. TheC nclusions       union negotiators had publicly represented the settlement as being worthMinute 4 as much as 12 per cent; but this appeared to be based on taking creditfor a reduction of one hour in the working week, as recommended by theCommittee of Inquiry, which would not take effect until April 1984.Because of the late hour at which the findings of the Committee ofInquiry had become public, the immediate presentation in the news mediahad been unsatisfactory.    Exaggerated estimates of the value of thesettlement had been quoted; and some newspapers had attributed theblame for the dispute to the Government and the employers, although thetrade unions had clearly decided in advance to engineer   a dispute inthe industry and had persistently failed to honour their agreements.Both he and the Prime Minister had tried to correct these misrepresenta-tions; and these efforts appeared to be having some success. Theconduct of the Inquiry, and various statements and actions by theAdvisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS), had left much tobe desired.    The water industry&apos;s national agreement on pay bargainingprovided that after appropriate negotiation, mediation and conciliationthere should be independent arbitration.    It had been agreed that theCommittee of Inquiry should report its findings, on the basis of aproper hearing of the evidence, to the National Joint Industrial Councilof the industry; and that the Committee&apos;s findings were to be the basisof resolving the dispute.    Instead, the Committee of Inquiry had beenan extension of the negotiating process.    It had interpreted its task asproviding findings which would allow the dispute to be resolved. Ineffect, the trade unions had been given a veto over the findings.There also appeared to have been inadequate supervision of the finalpreparation of the Committee&apos;s findings.    It was deplorable that outsideprotestors had been given the opportunity to try and intimidate theCommittee.   ACAS had given the impression, throughout the dispute, that ,it expected the employers to make all the concessions and had failed todraw attention to the failure of the unions to honour their agreements.l 1CONFIDENTIAL
1p&apos;0 J    Q CONFIDENTIALIn discussion, the following main points were made -a. Although it was desirable in public discussion to use thelowest possible estimate of the cost of the settlement, it wasdoubtful whether a figure as low as 5.5 per cent would beregarded as credible.   Moreover, its basis was not easy toexplain; and the phrase &apos;going rate&apos; which had apparentlybeen used to describe it was misleading and dangerous. Itwould be better to accept that the cost was 7.8 per cent atan annual rate, but to stress that it was based on the specialcircumstances of the water industry and could not justifysimilar settlements in other industries.    It would also behelpful to point out that the workers themselves would losefrom such a high settlement through reductions in job numbers:similarly, the previous pay settlement had been of the orderof 9 per cent, but the subsequent increase in the industry&apos;sannual pay bill had been only about 2 per cent.   Moreover, itwould be many months before the workers recovered the paywhich they had lost through striking.    Excessive overtimewould make it easier for them to make good this loss. Thewater industry should be encouraged to use every measure,including outside contractors, to restore supplies toconsumers as quickly as possible and so prevent unnecessaryovertime within the industry being worked.b. The industry had been remarkably successful in maintainingsupplies to consumers, thanks mainly to the efforts of managersand supervisors.    It would be desirable in public comment torecognise the efforts of these workers.   Their success showedthat the widespread belief beforehand that a national waterstrike would rapidly cause    the system to collapse was wrong.That fact should influence future pay negotiations in thisindustry.c. The methods of operation of ACAS should be reviewed,although it was necessary to recognise that ACAS was statutorilyindependent of directions from Government.    The Secretary ofState for Employment intended to see Mr Lowry shortly todiscuss with him the lessons to be drawn from the water industrypay dispute, the Committee of Inquiry, and the role of ACAS inthe proceedings.d. Most Government Departments had no professional expertiseor experience which they could bring to bear on pay negotiationsin the industries which they sponsored.   This was not surprising,since Departments had no responsibility for the negotiations;but it seriously handicapped the Government in cases such asthe dispute in the water industry, into which the Government wasinevitably drawn.    The Secretary of State for Employment wasconsidering what steps might be taken within his Department toprovide a firmer basis for the Government in dealing withindustrial disputes.t2
0      Q CONFIDENTIALe.     It was essential to do everything possible to prevent thewater industry pay settlement from leading to similar excessivesettlements elsewhere.    The trade unions in the gas and electricitysupply industries would no doubt be demanding increases similarto those secured by the water workers, even though a large partof their case in the water dispute had been that water workers,whom they also represented,  should have earnings similar to thoseof workers in the gas and electricity supply industries.Hitherto the electricity supply industry had been content with. an increase at about the same level as the miners&apos; settlement;an early settlement no greater than this might be possible butthis remained to be seen.    It was hoped that the local authorityemployers would stand firm on their 4i per cent offer to themanual workers; industrial action was not thought likely inthat sector.THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that the size of thesettlement in the water industry was clearly excessive.    In publiccomment, Ministers should emphasise that it was related to the specialcircumstances of the water industry, and should stress the damage whichit would do to job opportunities in that industry and in otherindustries, and the financial losses which it had caused to the workersthemselves.    The methods of working of ACAS under its present Chairmanshould be reviewed.    It was also for consideration whether the Serviceshould be pressed to review its panel of potential Chairmen ofCommittees of Inquiry, so as to exclude those who would countenance thesort of interference and intimidation which had taken place in thepresent instance.    The Secretary of State for Employment should considerthese matters and make appropriate recommendations.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.2. Invited the Secretary of State for Employment to reviewthe working methods of the Advisory, Conciliation andArbitration Service, and its list of potential Chairmen ofCommittees of Inquiry, on the lines described by the PrimeMinister in her summing up; and to report.Cabinet Office25 February 1983t?ICONFIDENTIAL
