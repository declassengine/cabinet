^ [confidential! H^Jt^NTARY     1 .     The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the&apos;     &lt;X// House of Commons during the following week.pay   amei^^^\   THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the motions relating to increases inAllr&gt;and   \wj   Parliamentary pay and allowances had been tabled and would beances^-/^Ndebated on Tuesday 19 July.    It would be difficult to secureprev^ \OoJpa.rliamentary acceptance of the Government&apos;s proposal for a A per centRefe  US &lt;C^7r5^ease      Members&apos; salaries.    Those Members who were still undecidedCC(gTsnce: Mwl&amp; be influenced by what he could say about future increases; butC ricl   22nc^        xhe^c^Ly comfort he would be able to offer was by reference to theHiriut-US&apos;Lons        earlj^ir* resolution of the House that there should be an annual review6 ^ of $temfe 2s&apos; salaries in the light of the average change in pay forapprojM&apos;vap^ public service groups.    If an amendment to his motion onMembers/salaries was carried and the House of Commons approved afigure higher than A per cent, he would withdraw all his subsequentmotions and say that the Government would reconsider the matter inthe light of the vote and that he would table further motions indue course.    Ttr^Zppsition on Ministerial salaries could then bereassessed.    Iff w&lt;yild not be helpful for him to suggest the possibilityof any change iSyfSfe&gt;methods of pay determination:    the debate wouldhave to be handle^_jxyrhe basis of the present system.The Cabinet ~Took note. &lt;%^\%AjRe 2-      ^ MINISTER OF STATE ,\MKE^N AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE(BARONESS YOUNG), said that tK^w^ernment of Gibraltar had significantly^talt modified its position over the QJ^fr^tar dockyard and were now seekingar a deferment of closure for only OH^y^ar, to 31 December 1984 (as against^ev- the six months deferment which the British Government had already offered).!*teferen In return, they were asking for cer^njjn^pieces of prime land at presentCc(8-3)  *! owned by the Ministry of Defence to bV/x^hsferred to them, with^ ticlUs . discussions about the possible transfe^fTf further land later;    and for^ute 2 nS&apos;       assurances of economic support from thexBritish Government if theprivatised dockyard was not viable by 1987.    The Governor of Gibraltartook the view that this was the minimum package which the Chief Ministerof Gibraltar, Sir Joshua Hassan, could persuadlpTKris colleagues toaccept.    From the British point of view, the piackVg^ offered a basisfor agreement.    Deferring privatisation for one X^amshou Id bemanageable:    it would involve spreading work whicV-^u&gt; ) Ministry ofDefence had already agreed to provide rather than ^OTje^sing it. Therecould be no question of offering the Gibraltar Govemp m\a blankcheque, and it would be important not to link any coiTB^i^ie^t of financialsupport to the viability  (or otherwise) of the privatisej^J^TCkyard.I It would also be essential to obtain from the Gibraltar^ro^jkment a? clear public commitment to commercialisation of the dockyKrJv^SN.a givendate.    The aim would be to reach final agreement at a meeti&lt;fep^&amp;hy jk Sir Joshua Hassan in London, possibly as early as the end of\ h^ /followingL [confidential! oa^TB
^ [confidential] H&apos;  ^J^Wg THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE,  said thatpre^^/- the opening round of the second stage of talks with the ChineseReje7 ^/\ Government about Hong Kong had taken place in Peking on 12-13 July^(8Trv\v        ^n a frien^ly atmosphere.    The opening Chinese statement had beenCor,c^ in substance but not aggressive in tone.    The Chinese had been^UutUSl &lt;Cr)\   touSker on tne sec nd day, stressing the danger of deadlock if the6 ^ ^~-^//\United Kingdom sought to insist on maintaining British administration/^Ykri Hong Kong after 1997.    Having moved from their original position^K^p-fr no talks without prior British acceptance of the principle of&lt;/^tn&gt;nese sovereignty, they were now insisting that the question of^om^istration was inseparable from that of sovereignty.    It remainedtox^e^een how far this was an initial negotiating tactic:unfortunately it appeared that those in authority in Peking still hadlitr%g?&lt;JV no understanding of the basis on which Hong Kong&apos;s prosperityrested^ //ffite. Chinese had however agreed to two further rounds of talks,on 25-2&lt;6^July and 2-3 August.    The talks had attracted considerablemedia interest in Hong Kong, but confidence was holding up and theHong Kong dollar was steady.Island   THE MINISTER OF~~S^AT^\ FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE, said that noformal reply was \^guy^&gt;ed from the Government to the draft report onI Ptevi t^e Ealkland Island^yh&gt;-^h had been published by the Select Committee^eferenS 0n F reiSn Affairs.   (A^tt^ugh the press had concentrated on theI ^(83) unhelpful aspects of K&amp;^jm completed report,  it also contained aConciu .^st number of helpful points .^JrNtook the view that formal negotiationsHinute ^0ns  with Argentina would f or^^T^resent be counter-productive.^ THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUE&lt;R^^^^^!khat  the financial  situation inBrazil was very worrying.   Although! r* *i in natural resources thecountry had, in effect, gone bankru^^&gt;e-\a result of the 1978/79 risein oil prices, imprudent lending by vti^ern, and particularly American,banks and bad economic management.    Anv^zective rescue operation hadbeen mounted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) but it wasconditional on the Brazilian Government cutting public expenditure andending wage indexation.    A $400 million bridging loan by the Bank forInternational Settlements fell due the followin^day and would not beextended unless the President of Brazil, Genei/al F^j.gueiredo, made astatement of intent to meet the IMF conditionsN^JpeNManaging Directorof the IMF, Monsieur de Larosiere, was reasonably^opilmistic that thePresident would comply, but the Brazilian Governmetrt^oontinued to seegreat political difficulty about doing so.    If the&gt;^/d^e^ot, Brazilwould be formally in default.    Contingency plans to m^ &lt;^v,isdevelopment were in hand, but its consequences would be gipa^e.    It washowever vital that the IMF should insist on its conditic^/b^eAng met:it would be the end of the IMF&apos;s disciplinary regime if BrazxJ^wereable to obtain financial relief-without submitting (as MexiT^Va^done) to the IMF&apos;s conditions. \Sy^r)The Cabinet -Took note. ^^^/y^^^^^^^^^ [confidential] ?fi^H
^ lCONFIPENTlALl3.      THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD reported that thei   &lt;*Qf Council of Ministers (Fisheries) on 11-12 July had failed to resolve^sh/wfV\ t*ie outstanding problems of North Sea herring.    Once again nine memberstates had been ready to agree, but Denmark had remained opposed to thepre .      yC&gt;       proposals and had invoked the Luxembourg compromise.    The Council ofRej    U^y\\   Ministers would meet again on 25-26 July.    In the meantime herringCc(g^\nca\KTy/- fishing in the North Sea, including Norwegian fishing, had been stopped.C0l,n,    ^2&quot;*-^vwhe West of Scotland herring fishery, however, would be open againCredit THEC^H^K-ELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER reported that at the Council of Ministerson lTNyVly&gt;the new consensus on export credit, which was alreadysuppor^e^rin the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Developmentexcept h$ the French, was again blocked by the intransigent attitudeof France.    The existing arrangements had therefore been rolled overfor the time being.    The question would be reconsidered at an informalmeeting of CoiuHlfiS^ty Finance Ministers on the island of Kefallinia on10-11  Septemb/tf. VOo ?dget THE PRIME MINISTER sa^&amp;^rbat it was satisfactory that at the special^te&lt;3 Council of Ministers^^-\C\July agreement had been reached on theRefUl^g^ngdom   procedures and work progra^e leading up to the Athens European Councilin December, and that no^^uVNhad been made with the United Kingdom&apos;s|jrevious 1983 budget refund- r      ThecabiMt- ?&lt;teS3 nS&apos; Took note.
