CONFIDENTIAL&apos;^^IRs f*     The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.Vth We THE CHIEF WHIP said that a writ for the by-election for the vacantseat of Cardiff North West would have to be issued no later than11 10 May, three months after the death of the previous Member.   A motionfor the issue of the Speaker&apos;s warrant for a new writ was to be movedby Mr Dafydd Wigley MP on Monday 18 April.     It was essential that theGovernment should retain control of the timing of this by-election, andhe proposed that they should move an amendment to Mr Wigley&apos;s motion,.the effect of which would be to defer further consideration of thematter until 10 May.     He was confident that such an amendment wouldbe carried, probably with the Labour Party abstaining, if all Ministersand Parliamentary Private Secretaries supported it.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that there was some pressure tohold the by-election on the same day as the forthcoming local governmentelections, or on the following Thursday.     The conclusion of aSpeaker&apos;s Conference in 1973, recorded in a letter of 26 November 1973from Mr Speaker Lloyd to the then Prime Minister, was that it wasinexpedient for by-elections to be held at the time of local electionsin April or May.     On the timetable suggested by the Chief Whip, theCardiff North West by-election would take place on 2 June, and it wouldtherefore be possible for the Government to justify the amendment ofMr Wigley&apos;s motion on narrow technical grounds, without bringing inwider political issues or discussion of the practical problems whichan earlier by-election would cause for the returning officer.The Cabinet -1.     Agreed that the motion on 18 April for the issue of theSpeaker&apos;s warrant for a writ for the Cardiff North West by-electionshould be handled in the way proposed by the Chief Whip.r&gt; ^iamgri).&gt;trol Q^ary      THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that clause 22 of the?Pendit Parliamentary Control of Expenditure (Reform) Bill incorporated thejr compromise agreed between the Government and the sponsors of the Billj, under which value for money audits would be carried out in theijtevious nationalised industries by their own commercial auditors, with theirrv^6renCe. reports being made available to Ministers and to Parliament. TheCo    ^ 7th debate on the clause at Committee Stage in the House of Commons hadw.tlclusi0 almost been completed, though it would not be voted on until^ute     s         Wednesday 20 April.    The majority of the Opposition Members on theCommittee were opposed to tihe clause in its present form because theyobjected to the employment of private sector auditors rather than theComptroller and Auditor General&apos;s staff on this work.     It was likelythat the clause would be defeated in Committee, but even if it wereapproved it would probably result in the Bill being blocked byOpposition Members on Report.     In these circumstances, Mr Joel Barnett|kthe principal Opposition sponsor of the Bill, no longer felt able tosupport the agreed compromise, though he continued to recognise its meritsin principle.     He was in favour of deleting all audit provisions fromthe Bill, thereby reducing it to a measure which dealt mainly with the1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALappointment and functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General.Mr Norman St John-Stevas, the Member in charge of the Bill, hadsuggested that the Bill, which in its present form had been almostwholly drafted by the Government, should be taken over as a Governmentmeasure, or that Government time should be made available for itsremaining stages, so as to enable it to be passed without the deletionof clause 22.     There were some merits in this proposal:    it wouldpermit the enactment of provisions which should improve the efficiencyand accountability of the nationalised industries, and would greatlydiminish the likelihood of a more extensive and less acceptablePrivate Member&apos;s Bill being brought forward in a future Session. Ifthe Bill continued to be treated as a Private Member&apos;s measure, and.if clause 22 were defeated, the Government would have to decide whetherthey could continue to support the Bill, or whether they should themselvesarrange for it to be blocked at Report Stage.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that thecompromise agreed on clause 22 had been accepted by the sponsors ofthe Bill as a fair and reasonable one.     The adoption of the Bill bythe Government, or the provision of Government time for its remainingstages, would set a bad precedent, and would leave the Government in avulnerable position in relation to future Private Members&apos; Bills whichcommanded wider public interest and support.     The Bill should continueto take a normal course, and a decision on whether or not to block itat Report Stage would be deferred until the Committee Stage had beencompleted.The Cabinet -2.     Agreed that the Parliamentary Control of Expenditure(Reform) Bill should not be adopted as a Government measureand that no Government time should be made available for itsfurther consideration.!  ir rime ^ SECRETARY 0F STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that theead       ntal       Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution was to publish a majorreport on environmental lead on Monday 18 April.   The Chairman of theRoyal Commission, Professor Southwood, had given a presentation of thecontents of the report to the Departmental Ministers mainly concernedon Tuesday 12 April.     The Commission had clearly dealt with this complexsubject in great depth, and their report would command widespread respectboth in this country and abroad.     The Government would clearly need togive close and urgent attention to all the Commission&apos;s recommendations,but he considered that the Government should make an immediate andpositive response to the recommendations which proposed that the leadcontent of petrol should be phased out altogether over an appropriateperiod, and that the price of unleaded petrol should not exceed thatof the highest grade of leaded petrol during that period.     Although theCommission had found no conclusive evidence to support the propositionthat lead in petrol presented a serious health hazard, there wasconsiderable public concern on the issue, and he believed that theimplementation of the Commission&apos;s latest proposals could be seen as anatural progression from the planned reduction by 1985 in the maximum2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALpermitted level of petrol-lead from 0.4 to 0.15 grammes per litre.Many new cars were already being designed to run on lead-free petrol,and the Commission considered that the cost of introducing a lead-freerequirement for new vehicles from, for example, 1990 would be negligible,especially when set against the improved performance in fuelconsumption terms expected to be achieved in engine design over the nextdecade.    There had been a marked change in the attitude of the oil andmotor manufacturing industries over the past two years, and he wasconfident that they would not strongly oppose the change recommendedby the Royal Commission, provided that an adequate transitional periodwas allowed.     Any move to abolish lead in petrol would requireagreement within the European Community (EC), both because of ourexisting commitments under Community law and because of the need toavoid damaging the competitive position of our industries within theCommunity.     He therefore proposed to make a Parliamentary statementthe day after the Report was published indicating that the Governmentaccepted in principle the recommendations on lead in petrol, and wouldbe opening negotiations with other EC countries forthwith.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that the Cabinetagreed that the Secretary of State for the Environment should make astatement on 19 April on the lines which he had proposed.    It wasimportant that this major new initiative in the field of environmentalprotection should be presented in a way which would minimise the scopefor further malicious and ill-informed criticisms of the Government&apos;srecord on environmental matters of the kind made by Mr Des Wilson ofthe Campaign for Lead-Free Air (CLEAR) in a recent radio programme.It might be better for the Secretary of State for the Environment tomake the Parliamentary announcement by means of a Written Answer, to befollowed by a press conference in which he would be able to presentthe Government&apos;s case more fully.   He should settle the form of theannouncement with the Lord President of the Council.The Cabinet -3.     Agreed that the Government should accept the recommendationsof the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution onlead-free petrol in principle, and invited the Secretary ofState for the Environment, in consultation with theLord President of the Council, to consider how this decisionmight best be announced.fM?0verrvfflOn THE PRIME MINISTER said that in recent early morning radio programmes there Ilcy       nt        had been totally misleading interviews with critics of the Government&apos;srecord on environmental protection and on personal taxation.    In the caseof the item on taxation, the Chancellor of the Exchequer had been ableto arrange an interview the following morning in the course of which hehad given a complete and convincing refutation of the earlier comments,but no Department of the Environment Minister had been available tocounter the damaging accusations made by Mr Des Wilson.     All Ministersin charge of Departments should immediately appoint a junior Ministerwith responsibility for monitoring all early morning radio and televisionprogrammes, with the assistance of Parliamentary Private Secretaries andsuitable backbenchers on the Government side.   As soon as any damaging3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALor &apos;inaccurate item appeared, the Departmental Minister monitoring theprogramme should contact the broadcasting organisation concerned withthe object of ensuring that the Government&apos;s case was properlypresented, by the one o&apos;clock news if possible, and also of securinga Ministerial interview the following morning at the same time as theoriginal item had been broadcast.     It would also be helpful if theSecretary of State for the Environment would circulate to the Cabineta note about the Government&apos;s record in the field of environmentalprotection.The Cabinet -4. Invited all Ministers in charge of Departments toappoint a junior Minister to monitor all early morning radioand television programmes, and to take corrective action asnecessary, as indicated by the Prime Minister.5. Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment tocirculate to the Cabinet a note about the Government&apos;srecord in the field of environmental protection.^lR3 2.     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had beenwarmly welcomed on his recent round of visits to Gulf capitals: the^dd]_e p freeze in Britain&apos;s relations with the Arab world appeared to be over.ast -In Saudi Arabia Shaikh Yamani had spoken in encouraging terms about^evious t*ie ProsPects f r maintaining the stability of oil prices.   A general^fetenS feature of the scene in the Gulf was the increasing strength of^(8l\ ?6: Islamic fundamentalism;    and some of the Rulers had expressed concernp      ^   11 t&quot;V  .   . .clus&apos; that rising frustration at lack of progress towards solving theVuCe 2 ns&apos;        Arab/Israel dispute could lead to their overthrow.     In AmmanKing Hussein of Jordan had given him a first-hand account of thenegotiations with the leader of the Palestine LiberationOrganisation, Mr Arafat,  which had led the King to abandon his effortsto make progress on the basis of President Reagan&apos;s proposals. TheKing felt let down by Mr Arafat and also by the Governments ofSaudi Arabia and Morocco;   and his confidence in the United States hadbeen shaken.     The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in hisview some strong and imaginative move from the United States Governmentwas urgently needed if President Reagan&apos;s proposals were to be saved.He had made this clear in a further personal message to the United StatesSecretary of State, Mr Shultz.     Unfortunately the United StatesAdministration seemed unable to grasp the need for urgency and professedto believe that their proposals could simply be left on the table. Thecrucial requirement was for them to put pressure on the Israeli Governmentto stop further Israeli settlements on the West Bank.     But it wasuncertain whether President Reagan could secure Congressional backingfor this course, or indeed whether he was seriously trying to do so.The situation in the Middle East was deteriorating in a way which wasdangerous for peace and threatening to Western interests.     It wasunlikely that the Soviet Union would continue to stand on the sidelines^there were already 5,000 Soviet personnel in Syria and there was anevident risk that the Soviet Union might seek to seize the diplomaticinitiative.     Meanwhile, it had been agreed that the British component4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALin the multinational force in the Lebanon would remain in Beirut(where its presence was warmly appreciated) for a further threemonths, despite the consequent shortfall in the strength of the Britishcontingent of the United Nations Force in Cyprus, but should not beincreased.Cibtaltarar THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the extravagantftevi0li reaction by the Spanish Government to the current visit to Gibraltar&quot;efere S .   Dy units of the Royal Navy stemmed from Spanish domestic political^(83) ?6: considerations, notably the forthcoming   Spanish local elections on^-lus&quot; ^ ^        and tbe weak P0Sition of the Spanish Foreign Minister,^itiute i ns         Senor Moran, whose own future was uncertain and who was continuingto look for excuses not to implement the Lisbon Agreement.    It wassensible for the United Kingdom to treat the Spanish reaction asunjustified and to respond to it calmly.Sandlands THE F0REIGN MD COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the proposed visit tothe Falkland Islands by a party of Argentine next-of-kin organised byiteviou a private Argentine citizen, Senor Destefanis,    was presenting serious^fetenS difficulties.      Senor Destefanis&apos;s   most recent public statements^(83) cast increasing doubt on the humanitarian nature of his venture andfills&apos; ^ confirmed earlier suspicions that his motivation was political; and^te 20nS&apos;        tbe Argentine Government had declined to accept any responsibilityfor Senor Destefanis&apos;s   activities.     The International Committee ofthe Red Cros (ICRC) were still inclined to give Senor Destefanisthe benefit of the doubt:    they were resisting his proposal to includepress representatives in the party but were less than robust on otheraspects.   The Acting United Kingdom Permanent Representative to theUnited Nations at Geneva was being given firm instructions to deal withthe ICRC at the highest level and to make it clear to them that itwas the ICRC and not the British Government which was in negotiationwith Senor Destefanis.     Meanwhile the visit to the Falkland Islandsby the party of British next-of-kin, which had earlier appeared to beat some risk because of Senor Destefanis&apos;s    activities, had passed offsuccessfully:   great credit for the arrangements was due to the militaryand civil authorities on the Islands.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that it mustbe made clear to the ICRC that they were not acting as a post boxbetween the British Government and Senor Destefanis.      Responsibility forthe visit lay with them:    it had been made clear to them that the visitcould take place only if it was organised and supervised by the ICRC,and on certain specified conditions.     That position must be adhered to.Iates      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that the United States authoritieshad now agreed to withdraw the litigation they had instituted against theBritish Airports Authority and himself on the question of landing chargesat Heathrow Airport.    The settlement had been reached on the basis ofa Memorandum of Understanding which set out existing British practice and5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALoffered consultation.     This satisfactorily ended one small disputebetween the United Kingdom and the United States in the trade field,although other important issues remained unresolved.The Cabinet -Took note.^pAlRs .    3&apos;     THE MINISTER 0F AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that theCouncil of Ministers (Agriculture) would be meeting in Luxembourg&apos;983 p on 18-19 April to discuss the Common Agricultural Policy price fixing.&quot;6goti   . Pr*-Ce   It was significant that two members of the Council had changed sincetions        the last meeting.    The new French Minister of Agriculture,^eviou Monsieur Rocard, was a formidable personality, a very effective^fetetic negotiator and had been a credible candidate for the Presidency of the^(83) . e: French Republic.     He was, of course, most anxious to ensure that his&quot;0ticiUs.tn first price fixing brought clear advantages to French farmers. The^itiuCe 3 ns&apos;        new German Minister of Agriculture and President of the Council,Herr Kiechle, was in a strong political position because his appointmenthad been the price demanded by the Chairman of the Christian Social Union,Herr Strauss, for not insisting on a post in the new Federal Government.The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food had met Herr Kiechlethe day before and it became clear that Herr Kiechle was not followinga strict budgetary line in his approach to the negotiations.     In thesecircumstances, the role of the European Commission would be crucial. TheVice-President of the Commission, Mr Tugendhat,    had made a speech to theEuropean Parliament explaining how rapidly agricultural expenditure wasrising.     Despite this, the Commission did nothing to restrain the cost.They ought in logic to adjust their price proposals downwards but therewas no sign that they would do so.In discussion it was pointed out that the prospects for a moderate pricesettlement had been made worse by the recent realignment of exchange rates. IThe revaluation of the Deutschemark had caused the French to press for aneven larger cut in the German monetary compensatory amount than had earlier Ibeen proposed.     This would give the German Government a clear incentiveto go along with a higher price increase than they would otherwise want.The risk to the United Kingdom was that an unchecked increase inagricultural expenditure would use up the available margin of Communityrevenues in 1984 and induce the other member states to argue that therewas no money available for further refunds to the United Kingdom.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that she would sendmessages to the President of the Commission and to Mr Tugendhat to urgethem to ensure that the Commission behaved in a manner consistent withtheir responsibilities for the management of the Community budget.The Cabinet -Took note.t6CONFIDENTIAL^^^^^^^^ _ -j 20
CONFIDENTIALP^qp^TIVE      4,     The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Home Secretary (C(83) 9 andsetting out the recommendations of the Queen&apos;s Speeches and FutureLegislation Committee (QL) on the legislative programme for 1983-84.THE HOME&apos; SECRETARY said that QL had considered the proposals put forwardby: Departments for Bills in the legislative programme for the 1983-84Session of Parliament on the basis of two alternative assumptions aboutthe length of the next Session.   Under the first, the 1983-84 Sessionwould begin in late October or early November 1983, and would end with&apos;aGeneral Election in the spring of the following year.   Bearing in mindthe scope for disruption which would be available to the Opposition in ashort Session, QL considered that the programme should be kept short anduncontroversial.    In addition to the six or seven Bills which would inany event be essential, they recommended that there should be four othermain programme Bills, together with two Scottish Bills and three Billswhose introduction would be conditional upon the Opposition&apos;s agreementto their being taken under the Second Reading Committee procedure in theHouse of Commons.    The Bills recommended by QL were set out in Annex Ato C(83) 9.   He recognised that there was a case for including Bills ofa somewhat higher political content in a short pre-Election Session, andthe Bill which would give most satisfaction to the Government&apos;s suppor-ters was perhaps the Trade Union Bill, possibly confined in a shortSession to dealing with the rules for union elections.   The secondprogramme suggested by QL assumed that the General Election would beheld in the summer or early autumn of 1983, so that the 1983-84 Sessionwould be of normal length and, as the first of the new Parliament,might be expected to include a high number of major and controversialBills.    QL recommended that, with the exception of the Scottish Bills,the programme for a normal Session should include all those recommendedfor a short Session, together with the additional Bills listed inAnnex B to C(83) 9, giving a main programme of 20 Bills.   There was somedoubt about whether both the long and highly contentious local govern-ment Bills provisionally recommended by QL would be ready in time. Ifthey were, the overall programme might well be too heavy, but if one orboth of them failed to materialise there could be scope for addinganother Bill or Bills to the programme.   QL had suggested a reserve listof three further Bills which might be brought forward in the latterevent, but they recommended that the proposed programme should in anycase be reviewed, perhaps in June, when the fate of the local governmentBills had become clearer.   He invited the Cabinet to approve therecommendations of QL on this basis, and to note the importance of allMinisters observing the&apos; timetables to which they were committed for thepreparation of Bills in the programme.In discussion of the proposed programme for a short 1983-84 Session, thefollowing main points were made -a.     The publication of the Green Paper on Trade Union Reform hadcreated an expectation of early legislation on the subject, andthe Government would face strong criticism from their supporters ifthey failed to take any action in a short pre-Election Session. ATrade Union Bill brought forward in a short Session could be con-fined to dealing with ballots for union offices.   Although thiswould be strongly opposed by the Opposition, it was much less con- ,tentious than the proposals on the political levy and wouldprobably not in itself provoke the Opposition to withdraw co- .operation in Parliamentary business.    But even a short and lesscontroversial Bill would, unless its scope was very tightly7 -y%
CONFIDENTIALrestricted, be exposed to attempts to amend and extend itsprovisions.   This, besides being potentially embarrassing for theGovernment in political terms, could make it difficult to guaranteethe passage of the other Bills in the programme.    It would in anyevent be necessary to give a firm public commitment to bringforward wider trade union legislation in the first full Session of? the new Parliament.b. The programme proposed by QL included a Bill to restore theposition on the fees for overseas students thought to obtain beforethe House of Lords judgment in December 1982.    It was now clear, inthe light of further advice from the Solicitor General, that therewould be a very substantial increase in public expenditure unlesscorrective legislation were passed during the current Session. Itwas recognised that that could pose a threat to other Bills in thecurrent programme; but if it were possible, it would mean thatthere would be space in the programme for a short 1983-84 Sessionfor the alternative Bill authorising the payment of specific grantsto local education authorities.c. In a short Session, the Conditions in Leases (Scotland) Billshould be taken in preference to the Irrigation (Scotland) Billproposed by QL.    The two Bills were of comparable length and con-troversially .d. A Contempt of Court Bill would be needed to restore to countycourts the power to commit contemnors to prison for up to twoyears, as intended by the Contempt of Court Act 1981, instead ofthe maximum of one month resulting from a recent judgment of theHouse of Lords.e. The Prevention of Terrorism Bill was not now regarded assuitable for Lords introduction in either a short or a normalSession.In discussion of the proposed programme for a normal 1983-84 Session,the following main points were made -f. The discovery of an increasing number of defects in prefab-ricated houses which had been sold to private buyers by localauthorities, in many cases under the right to buy provisions, hadmade it doubtful whether it would be proper to extend the scheme offinancial assistance already announced for owners of defectiveAirey houses without specific statutory cover.   The scale of theproblem was still unclear, but a Bill giving authority for futurepayments should be added to the contingent list to be broughtforward if necessary.g. There was increasing pressure for improvements in animalwelfare legislation, and a Bill for this purpose should beincluded in the Second Reading Committee list for a normalSession, as proposed by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries (and Food.111111CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALh. Under present legislation, planning permission for surplusCrown land could not be obtained before disposal.    This meant thatsurplus land had to be sold at well below its potential marketvalue.   There was a strong case for legislation to correct thesituation in the first normal Session of the new Parliament.    It wassuggested that the necessary provisions might be appropriate for a. Private Member&apos;s Bill.i. It was argued that an Industrial Development Bill on regionalpolicy should be given a high priority, so as to reduce thepotential damage to inward investment which would be caused by con-tinuing uncertainty, and to maximise receipts from the RegionalDevelopment Fund of the European Community.    It was noted, however,that decisions on future regional policy had yet to be taken.j.     The very substantial recent improvement in the profitability ofBritish Airways (BA) made it highly desirable that a Civil AviationBill should be brought forward in a normal 1983-84 Session toprovide for the capital reconstruction of BA as a necessary preludeto privatisation.    It might be possible to include this in ageneral transport privatisation Bill, incorporating also theprovisions on the privatisation of the National Bus Companyproposed by the Secretary of State for Transport, but not recommen-ded by QL.k.     There would be a strong case for introducing the Education(Wider Parental Choice)  (Pilot Schemes) Bill in the first Session ofa new Parliament.1.     The recent House of Lords judgment had made the proposedPrevention of Discrimination against Sikhs Bill unnecessary.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinetagreed that the legislative programme for a short 1983-84 Session shouldinclude a Trade Union Bill confined to dealing with election to unionoffices, with the firm intention of securing Royal Assent by the end ofthe Session.   The Secretary of State for Education and Science shoulddiscuss further with the business managers the possibility of passing aBill dealing with overseas students in the current Session.    If thatproved possible, the place provisionally allocated for such legislationby QL in a short 1983-84 Session could be taken by the Education (Grantsto Local Authorities) Bill.   The Cabinet agreed that the Conditions inLeases (Scotland) Bill should be substituted for the Irrigation(Scotland) Bill proposed by QL.   They noted that the Prevention ofTerrorism Bill was not now thought suitable for Lords introduction. ABill to cover the payment of financial assistance to owners of defectiveprefabricated houses would be included in the list of contingent Bills.On the proposed programme for a normal 1983-84 Session, the Cabinetagreed to the inclusion of a Bill on animal welfare on the clear under-standing that it would not be proceeded with if the Opposition raisedobjections to its being taken in the House of Commons under the SecondReading Committee procedure.   The Prevention of Discrimination againstSikhs Bill would be deleted.   The scope for further additions to the &apos;Programme would depend in part on the progress made on the two majorlocal government Bills, but the Cabinet would take account of the case9CONFIDENTIAL^^^^^^^^^^
CONFIDENTIALmade for legislation dealing with planning permission for Crown land,regional development, parental choice in education, the capital recon-struction of BA, and the privatisation of the National Bus Company whenthey reviewed the proposed programmes later in the summer.The Cabinet -1. Invited the Secretary of State for Education andScience to consult the Lord President of the Council,the Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip further aboutthe possibility of passing a Bill on overseas studentsin the current Session of Parliament.2. Agreed to consider further the proposed legislativeprogramme for a normal 1983-84 Session of Parliament whenthe position on the two local government Bills wasclearer, and in the light of any policy developments onthe additional Bills put forward in discussion forinclusion in the programme.3. Subject to 1 and 2, and to the other points made bythe Prime Minister in her summing up of their discussion,approved the recommendations of the Queen&apos;s Speeches andFuture Legislation Committee as set out in C(83) 9.Cabinet OfficeU April 1983t10CONFIDENTIAL^__?_&quot;_\ 2 4 1
