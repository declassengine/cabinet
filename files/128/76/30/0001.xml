The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House^ll/y      f Commons during the following week.^AIrc       \0)     THE F0REIGN ^ COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the visit to London___ ^-^x^ier in the month of the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq had been^i-ddl &lt;\fo^rwed by a visit from the Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia,6 East      J^roe-Saud.   There had been no significant change in the situation inPtevi0 the/^jrifo.   The arrival of six French Super Etendard aircraft in IraqRefe  Us was^stj^x&gt;unconfirmed.   Although the aircraft would make littleCC(83Nn^e:        pract^icai^flifference to Iraq&apos;s fighting strength, they would be an added&apos;-oriel   .   ^       elemen^^fi^hstability in a highly unstable situation.   At theHinut Sl0lls,     United lQx op&amp; the United Kingdom was participating in efforts to table6 2 a balancecV^raft resolution on the Iran/Iraq war which would command amajority inothe Security Council but avoid alienating the Arab world.In the Lebanon the ceasefire was just holding.   The nationalreconciliation taikTydue to start that day were being postponed becauseof objections from^jjB-JJruze leader, Mr Jumblatt, to the proposedvenue at Beirut airp/ort\)   The British contingent to the multinationalforce continued to p4^$d&gt; the guard-for meetings of the ceasefirecommittee.    ArrangemenC^^^re nearing completion for the deployment ofan observer force of Gr4^&lt;aW Italian troops loosely linked to theUnited Nations.Ik IIslandsd 182 F0REIGN        COMMONWEALTH S&amp;HuraRY said that the United NationsGeneral Assembly would shortly b^xMhating the Argentine draft&apos; resolution^evi0 011 tne Falkland Islands, although ffikyate for the debate was not yet^efer   s fixed.   Argentina had been campaigniH^unrenuously in favour of its own^(83) p&amp;:        draft, which was an updated version of/^ast year&apos;s resolution. Despitet&apos; tlclus British efforts to the contrary, the ag&amp;ipft States would be voting in^itiUte  0ns&gt;     favour of the Argentine draft resoluxipr^/s/ihey had done last year. TheUnited Kingdom was working hard to limit &lt;&amp;e growth of support for theArgentine draft and to discourage proposal^ to amend it.   Italy wasplaying an unhelpful role with the Europeans and the French attitude couldbe of crucial importance.   It would be desirable to raise the issuewith President Mitterrand of France when he cameyfoyLondon later thatKH Arm THE F0REIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the W^^SKrman ForeignControiS Minister, Herr Genscher, had had eleven hours of talks Vib\^he SovietForeign Minister, Mr Gromyko, in Vienna on 16 and 17 0ctobj j^\&amp;tevious Herr Genscher had skilfully presented the Alliance case forVtbjj),pe erenc deployment of cruise and Pershing 2 missiles, but Mr GromykV^ffobsequentr^83) \V speech in East Berlin had reverted to the harsh tone of PresiDEten^/Andropov&apos;sV^lus&apos; th       statement of 28 September.   Meanwhile the communique issued aft^rvthe&apos;^Ute 2 ns&apos;     meeting in Sofia on 13-14 October of the Foreign Ministers of the^wai^awPact had been less menacing in tone than previous statements, as waZ*\CONFIDENTIAL

It was still not possible to predict whether&lt;y//yy     the Soviet Union would walk out of the Geneva arms control negotiations(^yyCS.   if deployment went ahead.   But it was clear that the Russians were&lt;^\y^.embarked on a major propaganda offensive in an attempt to play on./X^erman fears and prevent deployment taking place as planned.   He had&lt;^/Mmself seen Mr Kostandov, one of the Soviet Deputy Prime Ministers, inv^^radon the previous day and had impressed on him that although the^Al^rance was determined to go ahead with deployment the Western desireSW^rogress on arms control and disarmament was genuine and strong.THE FOKEJGjCTAND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the risk of aunilaterayode^laration of independence by the Turkish Cypriots wasincreasing^XSuch a development would directly affect the United Kingdomas a guarantor of the territorial integrity of Cyprus and could prejudiceContinued British use of the Sovereign Base Areas.    The United Kingdomwas therefore doing everything possible to discourage the Turks fromgoing ahead.    The/j5e ence Secretary had seen leading members of theTurkish Government.in^Ankara two days earlier, and the Minister of State,Foreign and Commonw^m Office, Baroness Young, was at present inCyprus where she woi^d^wN speaking to leaders of the Turkish Cypriotcommunity. L/yTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOK^MENCE said that he had talked in Ankara tothe President, Prime Minispe^tod Foreign Minister of Turkey andexplained British concerns^jptft^m.   Unfortunately the imminent generalelection in Turkey (due on bxS^^jer) gave them little room formanoeuvre and their attitude tJo^x^ .tions with Greece was paranoiac.n8 THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETAKY^rid that a report was still^vio awaited on the outcome of the second ray-^&amp; the fifth round of talks with^terens the Chinese about the future of Hong Kora^Z/fiut the terms of the agreed^83) communique, which described the talks as^Jrsef ul and constructive&quot;,^ ?clu .   ^ were as reassuring as could have been hope^ for and should help to^itiute *0ns&gt; strengthen confidence in Hong Kong.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY drew attentsi r&gt; &lt;* reports thatthe Prime Minister of Grenada, Mr Bishop, and a numbe^/tyfpotherpolitical figures had been killed in violent clashes i^^&amp;iada where itappeared that power had successfully been assumed by thc^emity PrimeMinister, Mr Coard.

Iltlute ? V7A*        ^-^v\\The Cabinet -^Srsty 3*     THT^EgflfclGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, at the Special- Council or/Mi^sters on 10-12 October, there had been some signs ofc mmUn- movement t^w^rds the United Kingdom&apos;s position on future financing. AllBudgetlty member state* accepted that a solution had to be found.   The French had^i-ted suggested that the Danish proposal should be amended in a way which, in^ngdo principle, went in^the United Kingdom&apos;s direction.   The task now was to^etUnd put ^n Place a suf/Tcuent framework before the European Council in Athens.On the strict fini^Rji&amp;Kjguide line for agricultural expenditure there werePteVl- wide divergences of/yiewl but the Dutch had a useful proposal on thefcefe; Us table.C nclu ^tn       In Strasbourg the Europia^^P^liament had now voted in favour of the riskHinUteS^ ns      sharing element of the Unbred/Kingdom&apos;s 1982 refunds which was includedin the draft supplementary &lt;&amp;&amp;g&amp;t for 1983.   The problem of theinsufficient amount decided ^wJfheBudget Council remained but at leastthere were no further difficurt*ajs\  It was probable, however, that whenit came to consider the 1984 di^fT^midget the European Parliament mightseek to impose conditions on the^raWp^nt of the United Kingdom1 s refundfor 1983. (yV\^ ITtade    l0nal   THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY- r&amp;5p fced that there had been afirst discussion in the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on17-18 October about the implementation by vhe Community of thedeclaration of the recent Economic Summit at Williamsburg againstprotectionism.   The French had not been able at this meeting to go alongwith the specific proposals.

A joint&lt;y1 s\      declaration by the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands had madel^yy\   clear that, to render the olive oil regime suitable for an enlarged&lt;^Vv v Community, mechanisms should be introduced to fit production to//^foreseeable market outlets.   There had also been discussion of access^yyor New Zealand butter from the beginning of 1984; the Commission had been\^3j!e^pful, but the first exchange of views in the Council indicated that&lt;^i*erfe would be considerable difficulties with some member states,^ap^cularly Ireland.    It was most unsatisfactory that for the presenttra^yf^Rosal on the United Kingdom&apos;s less favoured areas had beenbldelceipW Germany, France and Denmark.ries THE MINIS^^OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD reported that thePtevi Council or^Jinisters (Fisheries) on 19 October had again failed to agreeWP&gt;.

The FrenchWe*-ghts   Minister of Transport had ra^sw^kith him there the question of theChannel Tunnel, suggesting th re?^iv. a future joint report was expectedto base itself on finance from^r^vite sources with public guarantees,there should be no difficulty in m&amp;zttg a forthcoming response atthe Anglo-French Summit Meeting ovr2&amp;A$&gt; October.   In response he hadmade clear that it would not be posvibJL^for the United KingdomGovernment to comment in this sense cwiS^teport which they had not yetseen and studied.   The German Ministertff/I&gt;ansport had also raisedwith him the question of harmonising rorv^weights with the Community ata figure higher than 38 tonnes.   He had m^de clear that he sawabsolutely no possibility that the United Kingdom Government wouldreopen this issue; the existing arrangements in the United Kingdom hadbeen accepted by Parliament on the understanding^t^Jat they would not bereopened.   It might, however, be possible to rea h agreement on a basiswhich allowed for harmonisation at a level whicliTWj^Tynot exceed 40 tonnes.The Cabinet - &lt;^jJ^Took note.,_. ^|CONFIDENTIAL1 1 270 m

CABINET^  r LIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(83) 30th Conclusions, Minute 4IThursday 20 October 1983 at 9.45 amPUBLIC UVEXpendt The Cabinet considered progress on the Public Expenditure Survey 1983.SlJRVEY i RE     They had be^^^j^m minutes dated 18 October from the Chief Secretary,1983     Treasury to tni^Trmie Minister on the progress of the Survey and onPrevi targets for Civ%^^Awice manpower up to 1 April 1988.SitUatiC 182 CHANCELL0R 0F THE EXCHEQUER siLd that at the Cabinet&apos;s previousl0n        discussion he had reported thatA   prospects for output and inflationwere encouraging;   but that budgetary prospects were not easy. Thatpicture remained broadly accurate^^h^ gross domestic product in thefirst half of 1983 was estimated to^5*||^&gt;een some 3 per cent higherthan in the first half of 1982.   Futv^s yowth would be greatlyinfluenced by the speed of recovery i^^^^Export markets, especiallyin Western Europe;   but prospects were TCjjphably satisfactory!. Theunderlying trend of inflation was downwards, although a temporaryupward departure from this trend might per^o^^^r a few months. Evenso, the rate of inflation in the later part^f^p^ current year waslikely to be lower than the forecast that had^reen published at thetime of the Budget.    The Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR)in the first half of 1983-84 had been some  7 billion, compared with 4i billion for the corresponding period in 1982-83 and with the Budgetforecast for the whole year of  8.2 billion.   Although tlie PSBR wouldbe substantially lower in the second half of the financ^^year thanin the first, and the measures which he had announced wouldhelp to contain it, it was still virtually certain that the figure forthe year would be significantly higher than the Budget Thiswas largely due to additional expenditure on demand-determi^d ^programmes and to the fact that the shortfall on cash-limited programmeswhich had been experienced in the past seemed unlikely to be  ^kp| dthis year.    A shortfall in the expected yield from indirect tax^o#^due to lower than expected inflation, had also contributed to thl^X^kI^_I    SECRET    |_ 272 J
?% I    SECRET |^^^L higher borrowing requirement.&apos;  Nevertheless, interest rates were attheir lowest for five years, mainly because the consistency of theGovernment&apos;s fiscal and monetary policies commanded confidence in the^^?^  market.   Many of the factors which he had mentioned would continue^^i^k and make the budgetary position in 1984-85 difficult.    It was^^J^essential that the Government should adhere to its published expenditureplans for that year in order to minimise the risk that taxation might^^%S^ to be increased.I^rarscussion the following main;points were made -a. Expectations of changes in the rate of inflation in thecurrent and immediately following months could be expected toinfluence pay settlements in the formative stage of the payroun^^^t might therefore be useful if Government spokesmencould suggest that the rate of inflation would soon fall. Onthe other hand, it might be wiser not to anticipate theIndustr%^g^orecast, which was normally published around the endof NovemDJ^T^Jt would  be   sufficient at this stage to make thepoint that^Bha^krend in inflation was downwards, without givingprecise figures.b. In principle, the economic recovery should generate higherrevenue and so H^rjk the fiscal outlook. Much of the benefitof the recovery ha^r^wever&gt; accrued in the form of higherprofits. This was desirable in itself, but, as corporation taxwas collected a year in arrears, the benefit in terms of higherrevenue would not be felt until 1985-86.c. It was surprising thaA,^^though the PSBR was higher thanhad been anticipated, inte^J^^|ates were nevertheless the lowestfor five years.    On the othe^^^k interest rates were probablyinfluenced more by expectation^ jjfcit the PSBR and about theGovernment&apos;s policies than by        current level.d. It would be easier for the Ca^jJIto take an informed viewof the situation and to consider de^fej^ke about public-expenditure if information could be made available about the likelyrevenue outturn when reports were made^&gt;n^pk| prospects forexpenditure.    Revenue was however hard t^^redict.   The bestestimate which could be made was that revenue in the current yearwas unlikely to be different from that forecast earlier and thatunless public expenditure was held within the published totalsthere was a risk that taxation would have to be ^^e^ased.EXpendit THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that in their previou^j^p^sion theUre     Cabinet had agreed that the objective for the 1983 Public ^KeMitureSurvey should be to hold to the published totals for 1984-8^^^k1985-86;    and that total spending should be held at the same ^KLMevelin 1986-87.   The figures were to include adequate planning reserves.He had been invited to hold bilateral discussions accordingly wi^P^^^spending Ministers.   Thanks to the co-operation of his colleagues^hoJk
% I    SECRET    | H&amp; Idiscussions had made good progress;    but there were still someprogrammes on which it had not been possible to reach agreement, and^P%     a wide gap remained.    Several Ministers had outstanding bids for^^?^  additional expenditure.    In order to achieve the objectives agreed bythe Cabinet it was necessary not only that those bids should be^^P^ithdrawn or offset but also that further savings of about  600 million^gHk 1984-85,  775 million in 1985-86 , and just over  1 billion in.^^9^6-87 should be made.   The outstanding issues arose on defence,aa^^ulture, foreign affairs, education, arts and libraries andWe nationalised energy industries;   he had also not yet reachedagreement on local authority current expenditure in 1985-86 and1986-87.   He proposed that a small group of Ministers should be askedto consider the issues.On Civil |Mce manpower, he had now agreed with all colleagues but oneon target figures for 1 April 1988 and each intervening year. Allowingfor a conti^RB^ margin of 7,500 they amounted to a total of around593,000 at l\^Bk1988 for the Civil Service as a whole, a furtherreduction of oPJerPj^nt on the target figure for 1 April 1984. Detailswere given in AraradP^to his minute of 18 October.    He had not yetreached agreement with the Secretary of State for Defence.    The figureshe proposed were consistent with his proposals on expenditure programmes.They reflected the SV^^Wtimate it was possible to make of the manpower&gt; needed to perform the essential tasks of each Department as they were nowforeseen.    The contingency margin was included to give a measure offlexibility in planning;    it was larger than it would otherwise have beenin 1987 and 1988 to allow scope for the establishment of the proposedNational Prosecution Service, if it was decided that this should bestaffed by civil servants.   As fadhas possible, allowance had been madefor expected productivity gains^mwe figures also reflected agreed plansfor privatisation, hiving-off and contracting out.   But it was probablethat further savings would be identified over the period;    the figureswould therefore be reviewed in the course of each successive PublicExpenditure Survey.   He proposed that  P^igures should be publishedalongside the expenditure plans.    It would be made clear that they wouldbe reviewed annually during each SurveyTJPj^that the presumption wasI that they would be adhered to, or reduced where, circumstances warranted.In discussion the following main points were !e. Although the Cabinet regarded it as desirable to protectcapital expenditure, it seemed probable that the overall effectof what was now proposed on public expenditure would be to reducecapital programmes disproportionately.    It would b^kelpful iffigures could be made available to the Cabinet s  ^k thedistribution between capital and current expenditure inyprospectiveexpenditure programmes, and in the reductions that .wA^an agreed,before the Cabinet took final decisions. P^ f. There was a particular difficulty in dealing with the problemof local authority current expenditure in 1985-86 and 1986-87 theChief Secretary, Treasury proposed.    This was not a matter^^PJLwhich the Secretary of State for the Environment could commi%^L^kcolleagues who were responsible for individual services run by ^t^\PPPj^^^^^ I    SECRET    |_274 m
% 1    SECRET    | fllocal authorities.    On the other hand, it was necessary totake decisions in the context of the Public Expenditure Survey.V ? The sums at stake were substantial.    The Government should not^^^k be forced into reducing programmes to which it attached high^^^k priority in order to accommodate overspending by local authoritiesj^JL     on matters of lower priority.    As against this, until the proposed^P^^    legislation on rates limitation had been passed, it was impossible^^for the Government to ensure that local authority spending conformed^^P%to published plans.    Nothing would be gained by basing plans onunrealistic forecasts.g.     Some members of the Cabinet considered that the figures forCivil Service manpower proposed by the Chief Secretary, Treasurywere insufficiently demanding.    It should not be assumed thatbecA^^he Government had made good progress in its first term ofof f ic^PJ^^cope for economies had been exhausted.    There wasstill nE|j^rganisational slack.THE PRIME MINI ^R^|umming up the discussion,  said that the Cabinettook note of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s statement on theeconomic situation and of progress towards bringing public expenditure for1984-85 and later years within the previously published planning totals.The Cabinet might wi^^Aresume discussion of the economic situationwhen the outcome of the^BPfcmber economic forecast was available. Shewould establish a smallTGroup of Ministers, under the chairmanship ofthe Lord President of the Council, to try to resolve the outstandingissues on public expenditure and to report to the Cabinet.   The Cabinetnoted the difficulty of dealing with the local authority currentexpenditure within this Group:  -t^^Chief Secretary, Treasury, theSecretary of State for the Envi^jSat and those Ministers responsiblefor substantial local authority expenditure programmes should thereforeattempt, in the first instance, to^J^Slye the issue informally amongthemselves, and bring the matter ber ^P^ ie Lord President&apos;s Group on publicexpenditure as necessary. The Chief i^AFCTtry., Treasury should ensure thatinformation on the distribution of capi^^jpd current expenditure, andhow reductions in expenditure programmes wouli affect this, wasavailable to the Cabinet before they took final decisions on the1983 Public Expenditure Survey.    The targe^^romCivil Service manpowerproposed by the Chief Secretary, Treasury werj^PJfceptable to theCabinet on the understanding that every attempt would be made toimprove on them.    In this connection, the Prime Minister recalledreferences in a previous discussion (CC(83) 24th Conclusions, Minute 5)to the need to consider possible ways of facilitating prematureretirement from the higher ranks of the Civil Service w^^e that mighthelp to improve the promotion prospects of talented yd|ungar staff.The response to inquiries from the media about the CabnPi|J^discussionof public expenditure should be to the effect that good progress hadalready been made towards the Government&apos;s objective of a9i^^m tothe published planning totals, and that final decisions wou^^^^akenover the coming weeks.    There would be no objection to conf ir^pIP^^ ifasked, that a Group of Ministers would be examining the issues JfijLwould report to the Cabinet. ^^^^^^I SECRET ~ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^l
