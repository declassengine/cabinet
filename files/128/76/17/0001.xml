ppCONFIDENTIALAFFatamentary   l&apos;     THE L0RD PRESIDENT 0F THE COUNCIL reported that arrangements had beenreached with the Opposition to expedite the passage, before theDissolution of Parliament, of a number of Bills, other than the FinanceBill.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that representatives of the Oppositionin the House of Commons were pressing for the omission of certainprovisions in the Finance Bill as a condition of their co-operation in. facilitating its passage before the Dissolution; they were even seekingthe omission of some provisions which had been approved in Committee ofthe whole House.   They justified this attitude by reference to what hadhappened before the General Election of 1979.    But in that year the thenAdministration had lost its majority in the House of Commons and hadsecured no Parliamentary approval for budgetary proposals.    The trueprecedent was 1970, when the then Conservative Opposition had facilitatedthe passage of a substantial Finance Bill.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that if necessary theGovernment might have to be prepared to use its majority in order tosecure the passage of the Finance Bill in a form containing at least themajority of its existing provisions, although the Cabinet recognised thatthis might jeopardise the co-operation of the Opposition in the passage ofother Bills.   Meanwhile, the Chief Secretary, Treasury, should continue tonegotiate with representatives of the Opposition with a view to securing asatisfactory agreement on the passage of the Finance Bill.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion, and invited the ChiefSecretary, Treasury, to be guided accordingly.^PTs ^&apos;     &apos;^ie Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet(C(83)  14) about the recommendations contained in certain Review Bodyreports.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion and conclusions reached are recordedseparately.1 ..

The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary of State forORga   ment the Environment about rates and local taxation (C(83)  15) and theAND pISATI0N      future of the Greater London Council (GLC) and the MetropolitanFINANCE        County Councils (MCCs)  (C(83)  13);   and a memorandum by the?r   . Secretary of State for Education and Science about the future of then0us Inner London Education Authority (ILEA)  (C(83) 12).^erence:C(83) 1stfusions, .?Seal THE SECRETARY 0F STATE F0R mE ENVIRONMENT said that the MinisterialTaXa . Sub-Committee on Local Government Finance (E(LF))l0n had now reached conclusions, which were the basis of his presentproposals.   Although the Government had had a certain degree of successin containing local government expenditure and rates, there was stilltoo much waste and inefficiency among local authorities;   and someauthorities continued to pursue extravagant and irresponsible spendingpolicies.    To deal with this it was necessary to take power for theGovernment directly to control the rate increases levied by individuallocal authorities.    There was strong presentational attraction in ageneral scheme applying to all authorities.   But the limit on permissiblerate increases under such a scheme would have to be set low; manyauthorities would apply for derogations from the limit;   and there wasa serious danger that the resulting workload would be unmanageable.Aggrieved local authorities could challenge the Government&apos;s decisionsin the courts:    even though it was probable that most such challengeswould ultimately fail, the need to deal with them was a seriouspractical constraint.   A general scheme could well alienate many ofthe Government&apos;s supporters in local government, and might be difficultor impossible to carry through Parliament.   He therefore recommendedthat the Government should initially introduce a scheme of selectivecontrol aimed at a limited number of local authorities with the highestlevels of spending.   All authorities would be examined againstpublished criteria.    Those whose expenditure exceeded the limits setby the criteria would be required to submit budgets to the Secretary ofState for detailed scrutiny not later than the autumn preceding therelevant financial year.    The Secretary of State would be free to limitor reduce prospective rate calls, subject to the approval of Parliament.If a selective scheme was in operation, other authorities would belikely to do their best to avoid the risk of Government intervention.But in case the selective scheme failed to promote effective self-discipline and restraint by local government as a whole, the Governmentshould take powers in the same Bill to introduce a general as well asa selective scheme of control.    These proposals would entail a shiftin the constitutional balance between central and local government;and would have implications for the position of Ministers withresponsibilities for individual local authority services, especiallyin England, whose decisions would in future be subject to the decisionsof the territorial Secretary of State on permissible total levels ofexpenditure.   But he believed that the difficulties involved were notinsuperable;   and they did not outweigh the need to be seen to beacting effectively against excessive rate burdens.2i CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALHe recommended that most of the reforms of the rating system proposedby MISC 79 should be adopted:    each of the main tiers of localgovernment should provide a separate statement for each ratepayer,with a unified single bill;    council tenants should receive annualrate statements; &apos; local authorities should be put under a statutoryobligation to consult local representatives of industry and commercebefore setting rates;    and more businesses should be given the rightto pay rates by instalment.    In addition, the discretion of localauthorities to rate empty industrial premises should be removed as soonas possible.    It was open to question whether it was necessary to pursuethe proposed scheme of discounts on rates for single-person households.This scheme raised problems of unfairness between categories ofratepayer.    If the excessive burdens imposed by the present systemwere to be mitigated by a rate control scheme such as he proposed,discounts would be less necessary.    On the other hand, he recognisedthat his proposals contained relatively few items likely to attractindividual ratepayers;   and there was a widespread public expectationthat some scheme of discounts would be introduced.Legislation to give effect to the proposals in C(83)  15 should beintroduced in the next Session of Parliament.Dissatisfaction with rates was such that it might still be necessaryto seek a new supplementary tax or taxes which could allow theGovernment to place a ceiling on rates and might lead to their eventualdisappearance.   However, none of the possible supplementary taxes couldbe introduced before 1988, and all were open to powerful objections.The Government should therefore do no more at this stage than indicatethat it would give further consideration to the long-term future of therates.    Paragraph 24 of C(83)  15 put forward a possible form of wordsto announce the Government&apos;s decisions.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that he supported the proposalsin C(83)  15:    although he believed that many ratepayers would bedisappointed with them, they were the best that could be achieved.He would wish to discuss with the colleagues concerned analogousproposals for Scotland:    in particular, he wished to make changes inScottish valuation procedures and methods of appeal.In discussion there was general agreement that the proposal to controlrate increases was the most satisfactory available solution to theproblem of rates.    It should not be presented as an interim solution:in particular, it would be unwise to suggest that the Government mightlater introduce new forms of local taxation, as the words proposedin paragraph 24 of C(83) 15 implied.    It was also desirable that thepower to activate the proposed general scheme of rate control shouldbe reserved to the territorial Secretary of State.Views were divided on the proposed scheme of discounts on rates forsingle-person households.    That single people might pay the same inrate&apos;s as families, perhaps containing several earners, and makingheavy calls on local services, was one of the most widely-spreadgrievances against the rating system.    The proposed discount schemewould appeal to many pensioners.    Its net cost would be small, or evenzero since it would be taken into account in the annual rate supportt3
CONFIDENTIALgrant settlement.    On the other hand, it was argued that the Governmentalready gave adequate assistance in this area through the rate rebatescheme.    The proposed new discount scheme would create anomalies whichwould be hard to defend.    There was no case for reducing the rate billsof rich single people or the young.    There was a stronger case forhelping single pensioners or pensioner couples;   but even this wouldbe open to significant objection;   and a concession to such groups wouldbe hard to contain.    The cost of any discount scheme would fall on thegenerality of taxpayers or ratepayers, including industry and commerce.It would tend to produce higher nominal levels of rates.   A possiblealternative approach might be to prescribe that no one need pay morethan a stated percentage of gross income in rates and to give-assistance,through the Unified Housing Benefit scheme or otherwise, to achieve thisresult.    But such an approach would benefit only a trivial number ofpeople and would be vulnerable as a mere cosmetic device.GLcUte  f the     TRE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that MISC 79 hadMCcsand tne        recommended that the GLC and the MCCs should be abolished.   The Cabinethad taken no decision on that recommendation.    They had instead askedhim to arrange for further studies to be carried out within Governmentwith a view to shortening the period required for the preparation oflegislation if the Cabinet eventually decided on abolition. Aninterdepartmental group of officials had carried out this remit:their report was attached   to C(83) 13.He remained convinced that it would be right to abolish the councils,as MISC 79 had recommended.    It would be possible to devise alternativearrangements for running the services for which the councils were nowresponsible.    The arrangements recommended by officials involved thecreation of several joint boards, that is, independent corporateentities, controlled by representatives of, but legally separate from,the relevant boroughs or districts.    This was unattractive.   He invitedhis colleagues to review the proposals with a view to transferring morefunctions to the boroughs and districts.    It might also be necessaryto consider the case for placing any new joint boards under some formof financial control.Legislation to abolish the GLC and MCCs could not be effective before1 April 1986.     It would therefore probably be necessary to extend theterm of office of members of the relevant authorities, rather thanhold elections in May 1985.   Legislation in the 1983-84 Session wouldallow little time for consultation with the interests affected, andwould carry a serious risk of defective drafting.    It would thereforebe better to legislate early in the 1984-85 Session.   To guard againstthe possibility of obstruction by the authorities due to be abolished,the Government should make contingent preparations for a short Billof counter-measures, which could be introduced if necessary in 1983-84.Even on the timetable he proposed, Ministers would need to press aheadquickly with the detailed decisions on the reallocation of functions,the composition of new joint boards, the handling of staff transfers,and the approach to countering obstruction;    and with preparing a draftWhite Paper describing the Government&apos;s proposals in detail. Thesetasks should be taken on by a group of Ministers directly concerned,having regard to the interdepartmental report.    The Government shouldannounce its proposals fully and begin consultations not later thanOctober 1983, or earlier if there was a need to link this with othe&apos;rannouncements on local government finance.4CONFIDENTIAL^^^^^^^^ 15ft M
ICONFIDENTIALt&apos;he il THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE said that the ILEAwas legally a special committee of the GLC.   Abolition of the GLC wouldtherefore open the way for improving the arrangements for education ininner London.    Itwould be desirable to retain a single educationauthority for the area.    This arrangement had proved advantageous insecuring good and economical further and higher education, and inredistributing the exceptionally high rateable resources of Westminster and!the City of London.    But the present constitution of the ILEA hadshown glaring weaknesses.    Its schools, notably the secondary schools,. were not performing well despite very high expenditure and much waste.The ILEA should be replaced by a joint board, consisting entirely ofnominees of the 12 inner London boroughs and the City of London. Theauthorities whose ratepayers paid the education precept would then ineffect be responsible also for the education element in their rate levy.This bringing together of managerial and financial responsibility wouldencourage a greater degree of financial prudence.    The ratepayers ofWestminster and the City would pay about half the joint board&apos;s rate-borne income.    This exceptional situation might justify an arrangementallowing the City and Westminster more generous representation thanwould follow from the normal principle that each elector&apos;s vote shouldhave, as nearly as possible, equal weight.   Further work would benecessary to devise a satisfactory scheme.    If it turned out that thejoint board did not budget more prudently than the ILEA, it would beopen to the Government to consider making its precept subject to controlby the holder of his office.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinetbroadly approved the proposals in C(83)  15.    It was agreed that thepower to activate the proposed general scheme of rate control should bereserved to the territorial Secretary of State.   The Cabinet were not,however, ready to take a decision on the proposed scheme of discountson rates for single-person households.    Several members of the Cabinetsaw serious objections to this proposal and would wish alternativesto be considered, such as improving the rate rebate scheme.   When theproposals in C(83)  15 were announced, it would be important to make itclear that they were the Government&apos;s considered response to the ratingproblem;    and that the Government expected that response to be successfuland did not intend to continue to search for alternative or supplementaryforms of local taxation.   The Secretary of State for the Environmentshould accordingly revise the draft form of words in paragraph 24 ofC(83)  15.   After the General Election, it would be necessary to givefurther consideration to the system of valuation for rates: thevaluation of property for rating now rested on a manifestlyunsatisfactory basis.    The Secretary of State for the Environmentshould arrange for the problem to be studied and put proposals to hiscolleagues in due course.   The Secretary of State for Scotland shouldagree with the Ministers concerned appropriate changes on the Scottishrating system reflecting the Cabinet&apos;s decisions on the proposals inC(83)  15.    The Cabinet approved the proposals in C(83)  13.    They alsoapproved the proposals in C(83) 12, subject to the point that it wouldnot be appropriate to raise in public discussion either the possibilityof giving individual boroughs the right to secede from the joint boardor the possibility of giving some form of &quot;weighted vote&quot; to therepresentatives of Westminster and the City of London on the newjoint board;    this was one example of the general question of theappropriate membership of the joint boards which would take over some5CONFIDENTIAL

^ SECRETTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NO 27CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(83) 17th Conclusions, Minute 2Tuesday 10 May 1983 at 11.00 am^EVlEwREp0RT B0DY   The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (C(83) 14)about the recommendations contained in certain Review Body reports.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet had to consider what action shouldbe taken in relation to the recommendations of the Armed Forces Pay ReviewBody (AFPRB), the Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Review Body (DDRB) and of theTop Salaries Review Body (TSRB) in two reports, one relating to the higherCivil Service, senior officers in the armed forces and the judiciary andthe other relating to Parliamentary pay and allowances and Ministerialsalaries.    The recommendations had been considered by the Ministersdirectly concerned meeting under her chairmanship at the end of theprevious week before decisions were reached about the timing of a GeneralElection.    It had been agreed that the AFPRB report which recommended anaverage increase of 7.2 per-cent should be implemented in full from1 April 1983 in line with the Government&apos;s commitments.    The Secretary ofState.for Defence was discussing with Treasury Ministers the implicationsof the additional cost for cash limits.    The DDRB had recommended anincrease for the current year of 6 per cent plus a further 1 per cent inrespect of supplementary payments for junior hospital doctors and dentistsand the restoration of the earlier abatement of their recommendationswhich now amounted to 2.7 per cent.    It was probable that, if the abatementwas not made good, the DDRB would resign and the doctors and dentistswould no longer have confidence in the review body system; there was alsothe danger of reopening the issue of future pay arrangements for thenurses who had been offered a review body on the model of the DDRB. Itwas therefore proposed that the recommended increases for the currentyear should be implemented from 1 April 1983 and that the abatement shouldbe made good from 1 January 1984.    In the case of the TSRB report on thehigher Civil Service, senior officers in the armed forces and the judiciaryit was proposed that, as in the case of the DDRB, the recommended increase f 6.9 per cent in the current year should be implemented from 1 April 1983and the abatement, which was slightly less than 5 per cent, should be madegood from 1 January 1984.    In the case of the TSRB   report on ParliamentaryPay and allowances it was proposed that the Government should not announceany conclusions but should refer to the exchanges in the House on 5 Maywhen there had been a request for the Government to consult widely in theHouse.    The Cabinet should however be invited to make it clear that theincreases proposed for Cabinet Ministers were too large and would not beaccepted.   The Cabinet would wish to review the provisional conclusionsreached in the light of the decision which had now been announced aboutithe date of the. Election.iSECRET
^ SECRET J^MIn discussion, the following points were made -a. The Government was committed to implementing the reportsof the AFPRB, and the recommendations should be accepted infull.b. As to the DDRB report, it was arguable that therecommendations for current increases should be implementedand a decision about the abatement deferred until after theElection.    But deferment without any decision could wellcause the DDRB to resign, with consequences for the nurses&apos;acceptance of their proposed review body; and if a decisionwas deferred, the restoration of the abatement could becomean issue in the Election.   The course proposed, of deferringpayment of the abatement until 1 January 1984 and announcingthat forthwith, seemed on balance to be the best course topursue.c. There were sound management reasons for implementing therecommendations  in  full and as soon as possible of the TSRBreport on the salaries of the higher Civil Service, seniorofficers in the armed forces and the judiciary; and, sincethe TSRB abatement in 1982 had been justified by reference tothe DDRB abatement, there was a strong case in principle forconsistent treatment of the recommendations in the two reports.There would also be considerable advantage in getting rid ofthe TSRB abatement before the next year&apos;s report which couldthen start from a clean slate.    On the other hand the Governmentwould be criticised for announcing increases for top salarygroups at the beginning of a General Election campaign. Ifdecisions were to be deferred until after the Election on theTSRB report relating to Parliamentary pay and allowances, itwould be appropriate to defer decisions on the other TSRBreport also.    There would be an opportunity to look again atthe proposals set out in C(83) 14 after the Election, and anyincrease in respect of 1983 would be backdated to 1 April.It was reasonable, in view of the imminent dissolution of Parliament, todefer until the next Parliament action on the recommendations of the TSRBreport on Parliamentary pay and allowances.    It should however be madeclear that members of the Cabinet not only regarded the increasesproposed for Cabinet Ministers as being of a magnitude which they couldnot possibly accept but also trusted that Members of Parliament wouldtake a similar view about the recommendations affecting their own salaries.It would be desirable to indicate that any decisions reached in the newParliament about re-settlement allowances should apply also to Membersof the present Parliament in relation to their present salaries.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet agreedthat the AFPRB&apos;s recommendations should be accepted in full from 1 April1983.    In the case of the DDRB the annual increases recommended of 6 percent overall with an additional 1 per cent for payments to junior hospitaldoctors and dentists should be implemented from 1 April 1983 and the2.7 per cent abatement should be restored as from 1 January 1984.

So far aspolitical funds were concerned, he proposed that any such fund establishedby a trade union must be authorised by a ballot of members not simply ona once-for-all basis as under present legislation but every ten years.In relation to the other outstanding matters, there had been a discussionwith other Ministers closely concerned under the Prime Minister&apos;schairmanship and proposals had been worked out for approval by the Cabinet.In the case of the political levy it was proposed that the Government&apos;sposition should be made known on the following lines: that consultationson the Green Paper had confirmed that there was widespread disquiet abouthow the right of individual trade union members not to pay the politicallevy operated in practice through the system of contracting out; hetherefore intended to invite the Trades Union Congress to discuss thesteps which the trade unions themselves could take to ensure thatindividual members were freely and effectively able to decide forthemselves whether or not to pay the political levy.    In the event thatthe trade unions were not willing to take such steps, the Government wouldbe prepared to introduce measures to guarantee the free and effectiveright of choice.In the case of strikes in essential services he proposed that theGovernment&apos;s attitude should be made known on the following lines: thatessential services would be affected by the proposal to remove immunityin the absence of pre-strike ballotsi and that the Government would consultfurther about the need for industrial relations in specified essentialservices to be governed by adequate procedural agreements, breach ofwhich would deprive industrial action of immunity.1SECRET^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SECRET?THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinetagreed that the Government&apos;s policy relating to trade unions&apos; politicalfunds and political levies, and to strikes in essential services shouldbe made known, in the course of the General Election campaign, on thelines set out by the Secretary of State for Employment.    If in relationto the political levy the question was raised whether the statement ofpolicy meant that the Government would, if necessary, be prepared inthe next Parliament to replace contracting out by contracting in, theanswer should be in the affirmative.   The policy statement had beenformulated in such a way that it would not be possible for the Oppositionin the next Parliament to argue that the incoming Government did not havea mandate, if it so wished, to put an end to the system of contracting out.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;s summingup of their discussion.Cabinet Office12 May 19832iSECRET
