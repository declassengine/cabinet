ICONFIDENTIALApp^lAMENTARY     ^ *     &apos;^ie Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.ApPA^w 2.-    THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the new proposal___ ^ by the First Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, Mr Andropov, toS0v^e make warheads rather than missiles the basis of counting in theUnion       negotiations on Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) was calculatedPtev^ primarily to serve the interests of Soviet propaganda.    It representedRefe  US a small move towards the Western position, but it was coupled withCc(g^fnce: continued Soviet insistence on the inclusion of British and FrenchCoricl   .^tb        nuclear weapons in the negotiations, which was unacceptable. TheMinut Sl0ns,       Soviet proposal would need careful exploration at the negotiating tablewhen the Geneva negotiations resumed on 17 May.    The debate ondisarmament questions, which was due to take place in the House of Commonsthe following week, would provide an opportunity for the Governmentto make clear to the public why it was not acceptable to include Britishand French nuclear weapons in the negotiations.    The unhelpful effectof the vote by the United States Congress the previous day in favourof a nuclear freeze appeared to have been offset by an amendment tothe resolution linking the nuclear freeze to a successful outcome ofthe current arms control negotiations.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that thefundamental reason why the British nuclear capability could not beincluded in the Geneva negotiations was that, unlike the Soviet andUnited States INF, it was a deterrent of last resort and comprised theabsolute minimum of forces needed to make that deterrent effective.So long as Britain was threatened by nuclear weapons it would benecessary to maintain this deterrent in being.The Cabinet -1 .     Took note.Inlandislands THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the attempt bySenor Destefanis to organise a visit to the Falkland Islands by a party^tevi0u  ^ next-of-kin of Argentine servicemen killed in the fighting there^fereiiS appeared to have ended unsuccessfully amid reports of friction between^(83) Senor Destefanis and the next-of-kin and between the crew andC nciUs.^tn        representatives of the Press.    The withdrawal of the Italian Ambassador^iriute 2 nS&apos;       from Buenos Aires following Italian criticisms of the ArgentineGovernment&apos;s report on the Argentine citizens who had disappeared duringmilitary rule was also helpful to the general climate in which relationsbetween Britain and Argentina had to be conducted.    Meanwhile it wasclear that the British Government&apos;s representations about the next-of-kinvisit had had some effect on the Argentine authorities, who hadundertaken to examine the possibility of an officially sponsorednext-of-kin visit in due course.    In addition to the Swiss and %Brazilian Governments, those of Italy and Peru (unlike that of theUnited States) had also played a helpful role.1CONFIDENTIAL
ICONFIDENTIALAti tast THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he was not in aPrevi0 position to judge whether the efforts which the United StatesRefe   Us Secretary of State, Mr Shultz, was currently making to achieveCcrg^s11061 agreement on the mutual withdrawal of foreign forces from the LebanonConcl   &apos;^tb were making progress or likely to prove successful.    His own view wasHinuteS2 ns  that agreement would be extremely difficult to achieve.andinavia        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there was as yetinsufficient information on which to assess the current reports ofpersistent violation of Swedish and Norwegian territorial waters bySoviet submarines, or what purpose those violations served from theSoviet point of view.The Cabinet -2. Took note.Mee^^ THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the meeting he had attendedin Washington the previous week of the joint Development Committee ofthe International Monetary Fund and the International Bank forReconstruction and Development had been straightforward.    The developingcountries had advanced the same demands as before, but in morerestrained terms.    The key issue was whether the United States wouldhonour its financial commitment to the International DevelopmentAssociation.    This would depend on the United States Congress, wherethe United States Administration was now seeking to mobilise support.I? andeUng mE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he had also attended meetingsin Washington of the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors ofthe seven Economic Summit countries (G7) and of the Group of 5.A row between the French and the Americans had been avoided.    The mostimportant issue at these meetings had been the size of the United StatesFederal deficit, with the implications this had for interest rates andfor the strength of the United States dollar against the yen and theDeutschmark.    Another disturbing consequence of the high deficit wasthat it had turned the United States - the richest country in the world -into a substantial importer of capital.    He had also had an opportunityof raising bilaterally with the United States Secretary of the Treasury,Mr Regan, the damage which could be done to relations with theWestern Alliance by measures proposed in the draft Export Administration Act Inow before the United States Congress.    Mr Regan had suggested thatcountries which disliked this legislation should make their views clearat the forthcoming meetings in Paris of the Organisation forEconomic Co-operation and Development.    This suggested that there wassome understanding in Washington for European objections to the draftAct, but that this understanding was not general through out the ,Administration.    Every opportunity must be used to put the European caseacross.The Cabinet -3. Took note.2
I^^^^^^^^^^ ^^Pm^ImICONFIDENTIALJO^UNITY 3.     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there would be___ considerable disappointment with the Commission&apos;s proposals on the^ tnmun.&apos; future financing of the Community.    They were proposing an increase inButjget_lty the Community&apos;s own resources but making no proposals to bring. expenditure on the Common Agricultural Policy under control. ThePrev- Commission&apos;s proposal for the draft 1984 budget had not yet beenRef    Us published but was likely to leave inadequate headroom for theCC( 3\ ce: United Kingdom refunds.    This pointed to difficulties at the informal&apos;-oticl   .^t*1        meeting of Foreign Ministers at Gymnich on 14/15 May.    In discussionHinut Sl0ns,       it was pointed out that any suggestion in the Commission&apos;s document6 3     .        of a tax on energy consumption would be unpopular and that such a taxwould not benefit the United Kingdom.    The proposal to raise extraCommunity revenue from Value Added Tax would be acutely difficult.&apos;983 FarmMce THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that there was aNegot.    . reasonable chance of agreement on the 1983 price proposals when thelations      Council of Ministers (Agriculture) resumed discussion on 16 May.Previ0u Other member states wanted to use the monetary device of adjustingRef6r   s the value of the pound in the ecu.   United Kingdom agreement to this^.(83)  e: depended on other elements in the package, for example, the butter&lt;&quot; nclu !3tn        subsidy, being acceptable.   There was a possibility that, because ofHinute 2 ns&gt;       other currency movements, a similar result to that sought by adjustingthe value of the pound in the ecu could be achieved by other monetarychanges.    The principal difficulty in settling the 1983 farm pricenegotiations as a whole, however, was now the Italian position. Indiscussion it was also pointed out that the French now apparentlywished to adjust the green franc in advance of the final settlement.The United Kingdom position could be decided only if there were aCommission proposal.    The French did have real problems with massdemonstrations by farmers and some adjustment of the green franc wasin any event foreseen in the final package.The Cabinet:Took note.TbiTE^ENT nav    ^EFEnp ^&apos;      Tne Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of State for, TtMATEs Defence (C(83)  11) to which was attached a draft of the Statement onl983 the Defence Estimates 1983.!tevioUs THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the Statement on thepe ereriCe&gt; Defence Estimates for 1983 had been considered in draft by theC    2) 16th        Defence and Oversea Policy Committee.    It would be the fifth major^nclusi0n Statement on defence policy in a little over two years, and hisute 5   S&apos;       intention was that it should consolidate the Government&apos;s defencepolicies rather than take any major new policy initiatives.    In viewof the continuing high level of public interest in nuclear and armscontrol issues these were given particular attention.   As had beenthe practice of recent years, he had included a number of essays idesigned to provide additional information on important issues ofcurrent interest.    A passage dealing with the issue of the control ofCONFIDENTIAL
ICONFIDENTIALUnited States cruise missiles to be based in the United Kingdom wouldbe added before he presented the Statement to Parliament, which heproposed to do on 25 May.In discussion the question was raised whether paragraphs 340 and 341,which dealt with the United Kingdom&apos;s capability to operate outsidethe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) area, were intended toconvey any change of emphasis from previous Statements. The intentionwas in fact to give the same emphasis as in the Statement onDefence Estimates for 1982.    While the possibility of some smallincreases in the United Kingdom&apos;s contribution outside the NATO areawas being considered, it would be premature to make any publicannouncement.    The point was also made that the first sentence ofparagraph 104, on arms control and disarmament, might be regardedas somewhat negative in the light of recent developments.THE PRIME MINISTER summing up the discussion, said that theUnited Kingdom&apos;s defence contribution outside the NATO area wasconsiderable and it was doubtful whether it would be right to takeon any new commitments.    Subject to the inclusion of a paragraphdealing with the control of cruise missiles, and to further considerationby the Secretary of State for Defence of the text of paragraph 104,the Cabinet approved the draft Statement on the Defence Estimates 1983and agreed that it should be published on 25 May, or sooner if thatwas practicable.The Cabinet -1. Approved the draft Statement on the Defence Estimates1983, subject to the points made in the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up.2. Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to publishthe Statement on 25 May, or sooner if that was practicable.Cabinet Office5 May 1983iCONFIDENTIALI        ^^^^^ 145
