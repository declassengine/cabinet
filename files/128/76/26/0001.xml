United States in Central America, where the Americans had a legitimatev^\}&gt; and immediate interest.   British interest in the stability of the/yy\       Caribbean and the presence of the British garrison in Belize meantvv^      that the United Kingdom shared United States concern to preventCentral America from falling under Soviet and Cuban influence.&lt;^5\\&gt;Unfortunately the existing Governments through which the United States.   \0^/yhad to work were unattractive allies.

k IconfidentialI H\^^^UNITY 3.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that the^/Vx &gt; meeting of the Council of Ministers (Steel) on 25 July had beens{^ &lt; \ satisfactory for the United Kingdom.   The Commission&apos;s decision^&quot;\yv on reductions in Community steel capacity had been confirmed. ThePrevi^o\        United Kingdom steel industry could accommodate the reduction without&quot;efe m)1       problems.    Italy, France and Germany were required to make moreCC(83^S^/\   SUDStantial cuts in capacity.    The United Kingdom had also obtainedCon.ciu .S\V^ 3n increase of 380,000 tonnes in its production quota, of which^inutUS- \f/O240,000 tonnes would be for the public sector and 140,000 tonnesJ    &lt;wlA?t t^ie Private companies.    In addition, we had now obtained(^/appxoval for the modernisation of the plant at Port Talbot.Bud^enity T1H?^&amp;2GN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Council ofUnited Mini^rs (Budget) on 20-22 July, at which the Financial Secretary,KiUgdo Treasury had represented the United Kingdom, had established theRefUntjtn draft 1984 Community budget including provision on budget lines, notin the reserve chapter, for measures implementing the fullPrevi United Kingd^ir\h983 refund of 750 million ecu net ( 437 million) .Refer US The Stuttgai^akreement had been respected.    In the draft 1983^C(83) C6&apos; supplementary^b1rfQrgj^t, however, the Council had not made fullCohm   ?^tn      provision for X^he^dditional payments due to the United Kingdom underMiriUt.USl0ns       the 1982 risk-sh^tf&gt;4wigreement negotiated in October 1982. The6 ^ figure was  42 milM^^Ness than the amount to which in our view theUnited Kingdom was ^rrrilvLed.   The United Kingdom had therefore votedagainst the draft 1983/^|pplementary budget.   He did not intend tolet the matter rest inv^h&apos;eYfcontinuing negotiations.    In discussionit was noted that the G^?t&amp;zk%, whose position was crucial, hadfailed to support the Uni&lt;wrdVlu.ngdom on the 1982 risk-sharingpayments. \&gt;yyf)Iies THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FIS$KJE&amp; AND FOOD reported that thePtevi0u Council of Ministers (Fisheries) July had not reachedRef6r   s agreement on North Sea herring.   Th^/D^nes had again invoked theCC( 3) Luxembourg compromise.   The Council md decided, however, with theCon.ciu .   ^      United Kingdom voting against, that the Norwegians should be allowedMiriUte ^ ns       to fish the remainder of the herring quota in the North and centralparts of the North Sea.   About 10,000 tonnes^-ef this quota remainedto be fished.    Scottish herring fishermen w/ef&apos;e^strongly opposed.There was, however, some compensatory advanH^e^imcause Norway wouldnot now block fishing for cod and other specie^ iA)Norwegian waters.The Cabinet - &lt;^ty^/\Took note. ^v/&gt;^^^^ [confidential] h
secret ~| H4Bjf^E 4.     The Cabinet resumed their consideration of a note by theJM^SSION Secretary of the Cabinet (C(83) 28) to which was attached a note byUP ,       R officials on the choice of a defence suppression weapon for the^IR pfiS^. R yal Air Force.Pro, . ^4^^. -In discussion the following main points were made -CC(a-3\ 4k        a.      If ALARM were chosen, in preference to HARM, andConcl   ^t^^^^      there was (as there could well be;  some slippage in delivery^nuteS1 nS^^.^^. dates&apos;    tne Tornado aircraft would be without a weapon capablee 2 ^^^^ of suppressing Warsaw Pact air defences for two or three yearslonger than if HARM was chosen.    The important date would bethat by which an initial operational capability could beachieved, rather than the date on which delivery would becompleted.    Unless it was reasonably certain that there wouldbe n^^mflict with the Warsaw Pact during this period, adedBma|i in favour of ALARM would incur considerable defencerisWR^fce planning assumption of successive Governments inthe 1920$ and 1930s that there would be no major conflict inthe nex^^^^^years had led to British forces being inadequatelyequipped^he^gwar did break out in 1939.    As against that,however, a conflict with the Warsaw Pact during the next decadewould invoIv^WA United Kingdom only in company with allies.It would be possible for United States aircraft to undertakethe task of su%tre^Lng Warsaw Pact radar defences.    There wouldbe no requiremen^^^^  advanced defence suppression weapons inthe type of contract in which the United Kingdom would beengaged alone, such as had occurred in the South Atlantic. Evenwithout a defence suppression weapon, the Tornado aircraft wouldhave electronic equipment designed to deal with enemy defencesand significantly reduce tl^^ttrition rate:    the purpose of thedefence suppression weapdfi was,to reduce that rate further, toa level which commanders would regard as acceptable.    If aconflict occurred from 1990^p^^s, ALARM would be moreadvantageous in defence terms^^rarmHARM.b. The employment consideratio^EMecting the choice ofsystem were evenly balanced.    Compaj^Kg^th HARM, the ALARMprogramme would create only some 7O0n(a job opportunitiesa year over seven years.    ALARM had j^prExport prospects,whereas participation in the HARM progr^^^^would provideBritish firms (albeit against competition from American firms)with an opportunity to participate in a world-wide marketestimated at 25,000 missiles.c. While it was not realistic for the United  i^dom t0maintain a capability in every area of defence technology, thelong-term implications of losing the capability for homing-headtechnology would be serious.    United States firms would notoffer attractive arrangements for participation by &quot;j^^^f1firms unless there were a competitive industrial basl^M^jaiscountry.    Nor would it be right on strategic grounds to becomedependent on the United States for all the future weaponsJ^^systems for which homing-head technology was likely to be^p^^. ^^^^^^H|    secret_| 23Q J
1secret ~1 H. lW% d.     There were grounds for scepticism both about the size of^K^k the price reduction which British Aerospace had offered andabout the shortness of the period allowed for development and^^?^ production of the weapons.   But to reject British Aerospace&apos;sproposals for ALARM would be to signal publicly that the^fc^k Government lacked confidence in some of the United Kingdom&apos;s^^^m most important companies with a recognised capability in advancedW^^L        technology.    Criticism of a decision in favour of ALARM could^^^^     nevertheless be expected from those companies and areas which^^^^k^ stood to benefit from participation in the HARM programme.e. The Royal Air Force&apos;s original preference had been forHARM.    Their requirement was for 750 missiles.    But it wouldbe possible to decide to purchase more missiles later on, sincethe production line for ALARM would remain open until 1990.f. At the previous discussion, concern had been expressed aboutthe^m Kial risks to British Aerospace following the pricereduction which the company had offered.    The Chairman ofBritisrPJ^^ pace had pointed out that the company would besharing ^^^^k with its sub-contractors, which included majorcompanies such as the General Electric Company.    Sir Austin Pearcehad also madi^^^lear that if the company did not obtain thecontract for ALARM there would be substantial redundancies.The ALARM prog^Jm^would enable British Aerospace to spreadtheir overheads m^^widely and avoid redundancies, which was amore important consideration than the financial penalties thecompany might incur by entering    into the ALARM contract onthe basis of their latest offer.    The Government could not permitthe company to recoup any losses on other defence contracts. Itwould also be important tp^^pid financial consequences whichmight make further sales Government&apos;s shareholding moredifficult.g. It would be necessary crc^Hmto monitor the progress ofthe ALARM programme.    Treasury^^f^Wals should be associatedwith this process, as also with the contractual terms. Neitherthe penalty clause for late delivery to the company nor thecost of slippage were sufficient to give the Government anyeffective control.h. Care would be needed in explaininga decision in favour ofALARM to the United States Administration and Congress. But itshould be possible to continue to sell British defence equipmentto the United States:   British weapon   systems sold on theirmerits; and the influential Chairman of the SenatiflfcArmed ServicesCommittee, Senator Tower, had indicated that heAM^hready tolook for ways of offsetting the imbalance in defence torade betweenthe two countries which would occur as a result o ?^^purchaseof the Trident   missile system.    For their part, th%^H^dStates Government would never allow a foreign companj^p^ecomethe principal supplier of equipment vital to their nationaldefence interests. Jfi^LTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Ca^^etJ^agreed that the ALARM missile should be chosen to meet the Royal Ai^^^Hi^^^^        rziECRET i 231M

Its progress must be carefully monitored and major developments^^p^       reported to Ministers.   The choice reflected the Government&apos;sconfidence in British industry and the importance of preserving^^j^W   a national capability in an area of advanced technology vital fordefence.    Before Ministers were faced with further decisions of^^^kthe same kind on major defence equipment projects, officials should^^mrcpduce a comprehensive report on the areas of defence technology^ ^flkch it was essential to retain in the United Kingdom: participation^KiThe study should include officials from the Treasury and theDepartment of Trade and Industry, as well as from the Ministry ofDefence.

Therewa^^rjj&amp;wever, a difference of view within the Group about theappr^ep^ate method of financing the joint boards and the extentto wh^ch their expenditure and staffing should be directly controlledby central Government.    Two options had been identified -Option A^_^The joi^t. Jj *rds could be made directly responsible for theirexpenditun^dtVisions and the grant and rating consequences -including Ngr^wr^penalties - in the same way as localauthorities &lt;!ylDnxp implied that the boards should receiveblock grant a?(pXs&gt;Xeific and supplementary grants from centralGovernment and&lt;r^&gt;st&gt; their own finance by precept. Theyshould therefore b^ tvbject to the selective scheme of ratecontrol which the&lt;^oveynment intended to introduce.Option B &lt;^C^^?Responsibility for funo^^tke boards would be placed withthe constituent lower-tiera ^borities.    The boards wouldreceive specific and suppteman-t^ry grants from centralGovernment (eg. police gran^XJi^\not block grant. Theconstituent districts or borSomz would receive block granton their share of the boards&apos; expenditure and rate for therest of their contribution.   Th&amp;Xcontrol schemes would haveto be applied indirectly through the constituent districts.Most members of MISC 95 favoured Option A. /They took the viewthat it would be more effective than Option//Bitf controlling theexpenditure of police and fire joint boardsK3T^J2&gt;&gt; appreciated thatOption A raised political and constitutional difficulties. Butthese were presented more by control of police^ ^^yre operations,which was not suggested, than by control of budg&apos;e^X^It was alsorelevant that the Government already had substanti %Vo\jersrelating to the police and fire services.   He too s^uppbr^ed Option A.In his view, it was a necessary condition of securing/ fo ^savingsin staff and expenditure which were the basic reasons &lt;roryaroplition.Under Option B the joint boards would not be responsiblV-^r^thefinancial consequences of their proposals and would have wjsM&amp;icientincentive to rein back expenditure.   An individual borough&gt;^y/^\ \confidential %
\ ICONFIDENTIALl Hdistrict could be forced by other constituent authorities to(fjj contribute to an excessive budget.   This contribution would count^-^) as its own expenditure for the purposes of both block grant penalties^l/y and the selective control scheme.   The consequence could be that(//\ the authority was forced into grant losses or control through nofault of its own.   This would be regarded as so unfair that it could//y\        lead either to the exemption of police and fire expenditure fromany form of control or to failure to carry the control schemethrough Parliament.   Either result would be unacceptable. He&lt;^-\\v proposed that the white Paper setting out the details of the\\ y^)Government&apos;s abolition proposals, which he hoped to publish in theC^^^aytumn, should make it clear that the Government favoured Option A.&lt;^HE^OME SECRETARY said that he strongly favoured Option B.    In hisviex; it would in fact be more likely to restrain expenditure thanOp^ri^rf/A.    This was demonstrated by experience during the Government&apos;sfir DMx rm of office.   The Government had been successful bothin encouraging local authorities to spend more on law and order andin refusing to accept this as a valid reason for an increase intotal of local authority expenditure.    The effect had been toput downward pressure on expenditure on other services, but withoutpassing judg^peTm on the appropriate level of expenditure on anyindividual sx^vlce&gt;.    Expenditure on the police and fire services bymost of the aU| hoTr\hties that would be affected by abolition wasalready in excsjss^f^the relevant grant-related expenditureassessment (GRE) &lt;y/kfyyo\ildi not be easy for the Government to amendthe GREs; or to br/p^^Vpenditure closer to them; or to condoneapparent over spend  &lt;$gxyyhe likely upshot was therefore higherexpenditure and higher/%a&quot;tes.   A further consideration was thatunder Option A the memrars^of constituent local authorities wouldhave no incentive to res^ ^pr$Vthe expenditure of joint boards,&quot;because the precept levied/l&amp;^he board would not count as theirown expenditure for the puxpp^s of the Rate Support Grant andholdback schemes or the schemy/o&apos;J^selective rate limitation.    He didnot consider it probable thatMfon-^ituent local authorities would beforced to incur grant penalties&lt;x5r      brought under selectivecontrol by the decision of other&lt;^5herities represented on thesame joint board.   Expenditure on,|-r^%ervices in question was arelatively small proportion of the lwd^ets of the relevant authorities;a high proportion of the expenditureN&amp;as already controlled by the HomeOffice; and it was unlikely that authorities which were extravagantspenders in other fields would seek to spend excessively on thepolice.   Apart from the arguments relating to-t^ntrol of expenditurethere were political and constitutional objeptip)is to Option A.It would mean that, for the first time, cent^L^G&amp;vernment would bedeciding the maximum level of expenditure on ar/individual localauthority service in a particular area.    It wouS^^lrablish adifferent system of control of police expenditure^m/^e metropolitanareas and the shire counties.    This would be regaru^d^cNk a firststep towards a direct Government control of policing rR/^hner cityHe recognised that there was a particularly serious probT^mWcontrol during the period of transition from the present o^gyp^ationof local government in metropolitan areas. He was therefor^^iA^ng,if his colleagues agreed that Option B was appropriate for thi^ron^erterm, to seek powers to extend his control over police establisbj^ewsto cover civilian staff, and to seek similar powers over fire ,.                        confidential] \a1A _&apos; _234 m

This wouldr^y\ in practice give the holder of his office control over 87 per cent&lt;y^\ of tne police budget and 89 per cent of the fire budget.The following were the main points made in discussion -a. Although the Government had been reasonably successfulin tne past in reconciling increases in expenditure on lawand order services with general restraint of local authorityly^&lt;\   expenditure, it was now proposing to change the organisationSy^&gt; of local government; and it would not be safe to assume that^-//past successes would continue.   Ministers would inevitably be&lt;^&lt;^rced to take a more overt and explicit view of the^y^aWropriate level of expenditure on individual local authorityY^ervices in several areas.b. whether or not it was likely that individual localauthorities would be subjected to grant penalties or bebrought/SS^ier selective control as a result of the decisionsof otheralythorities, it was wrong in principle to set up asystem Vr^^^^ouId have that effect.c. Althou^^Dhe minute of 22 July from the Secretary of Statefor the Envir^m^kt discussed the police and fire services asthough they weg^on^all fours, the constitutional objectionsto Option A were jxii^pk weaker in the case of the fire services,and the need for&quot;C^^^jj;ive control of expenditure was great.d. There was no dotd^jCx^hat the Inner London Education Authorityand Passenger Transpc^t^Ajfthorities would need to be controlledunder Option A.   The bu ^efc^nd precept of the MetropolitanPolice were already cont^^l^X. directly by the Home Secretary,as police authority for the/ffe^opolis.    It was difficult tojustify different   treatment/ptUv for the police in metropolitanareas outside London. &lt;*^S//  THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the d^cussion, said that the Cabinetrecognised that the present system orvfinancing the police and fireservices in metropolitan areas had served the Government and thecountry well; and they sympathised with the arguments advanced bythe Home Secretary.
