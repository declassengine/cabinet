But there had been no shift ttt the Communists: thebeneficiaries had been the smaller, lay parties, especially theRepublicans led by the former Prime Minister .^.Signor Spadolini.Italy would now be even less easy to govern/jrhlm hitherto, but thelikeliest outcome was the formation of a rign^^w-vcentre coalitionGovernment on familiar lines.

Meanwhile the United States hadiMinute ? nS&apos;       reacted with unexpected sharpness to the Government&apos;s decision to makean Order under the Protection of Trading Interests Act in connectionwith British AvrwaVs&apos; and British Caledonian&apos;s attempt in the Courtof Appeal to s^^JVthe &quot;treble damage&quot; action being brought in theUnited States by(fhe)liquidator of Laker Airlines.    The liquidator&apos;saction presented^z^xr^idable threat both to British Caledonian and toBritish Airways and^epc^e to the Government&apos;s privatisation plans forthe latter.    Followi^g^taeyUnited States Ambassador&apos;s protest on24 June, he had sent a^r^am^of officials to Washington to explain theposition to the United St^f^k Administration and seek some accommodationwith them.    The Americans^Xr^sponse had been discouraging.    But althoughthey were now saying that %5&amp;y ^egarded the negotiations as being at anend they had nevertheless p^V^^number of further questions to theBritish delegation, which ha&amp;Xb^Mtn[instructed to remain in Washington.Meanwhile British airlines operat *iX\in the United States were exposedto the risk of American sanction^/^A^e matter was both complicatedand delicate, being subjudice in ^ne^Jnited Kingdom.    Much would dependon the outcome of the case now open^g^ti^fore the Court of Appeal; andit would be important not to pre judrc^^h^k United Kingdom&apos;s * right toseek arbitration under the Bermuda Ilvp^eaty.^ItarTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thaj^the Chief Minister of^revious Gibraltar, Sir Joshua Hassan, was in London to^di^)cuss the Government&apos;s^eferenc . decision to close the Naval Dockyard at GibratxS^I^Bm December 1983^(83) and replace it by a commercial dockyard to be operated by^?nclusi A &amp; p Appledore International Ltd.    The terms of\h^M.osure included^.ttute 4 nS&apos;       some  28 million of development aid to help refurbr^V/^a. yard and getit off to a good start:    and although some 900 jobs wlxJ^S^be lost inGibraltar, the rate of unemployment there would still be^k&amp;er thanin Chatham.    Sir Joshua Hassan and his Ministers, who f ^^ra^electionsin March/April 1984, were united in believing that closujXA^vAheend of 1983 was politically unacceptable and were seeking t^d^er itfor two years.    There was no advantage to the United Kingdori\vn/^deferment, and evident danger in allowing the date of closure&lt; ws-iap.But there was in any case likely to be a slippage of three mont^/ltjVthe commercialisation arrangements:    and it would be undesirable gy/y*&gt;compound the difficulties which were to be expected with the._:_. %&gt;mconfidential] \&gt; i^^^^ 184 B

It might&lt;S\^\&gt;      therefore be wise to explore with Sir Joshua Hassan, by way ofcompromise, an arrangement whereby the Naval Dockyard would remainY^X^N open for a further six months.    The Ministry of Defence estimated the. \^//xost of such an arrangement at  6J million but thought it might be&gt;^r&lt;q^ssible to reduce this to  3i million net.&lt;^rat^*RIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, noted thats^r^&gt;n th s&apos; deferment of closure might be insufficient to meetSirXJoSihua Hassan&apos;s electoral requirements, and that any defermentwouidx^aKe it more difficult for the British Government finally toclos^t33^&gt;door.    The terms on which closure was being implementedwere gexyezjefas.   At the same time Sir Joshua Hassan was an excellentChief M^Mster and deserved some degree of understanding for hispoliticai^difficulties.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Mr Dankert, the&lt;Sy President of the European Parliament, during his visit to London last week&apos;Conmu/i6r\ not 8^ven a helpful impression of the likely attitude of the EuropeanBudge^5v^     Parliament to the inclusion of United Kingdom refunds in the Community&apos;sUtiite{j    y/)   budget for 1984.    Steps would be taken, however, to mobilise support in theKingjQm European Parliament for our position.    It had been pointed out toRefUn(j      v&gt;-oA \r ^ankert tnat his attitude risked undermining recent improvements in the^p^iktitude of British public opinion to the European Community, and it would^vious      NA^ve/better if the European Parliament were to take a more realistic position.II&apos; % ISteei %THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that the Commission&apos;sPrevi0u latest decision on capacity reduction appeared to be reasonably favourable^erenc t*ie ^n^te-d Kip&amp;dom.
