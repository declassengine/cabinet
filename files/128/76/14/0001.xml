CONFIDENTIAL1.      The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.BuHdiS THE L0KD PRIVY SEAL said that the Government had been defeated in theContro^ Committee Stage of the Housing and Building Control Bill in theHouse of Lords on 26 April, when a motion to delete Clause 2 had beencarried by 182 votes to 96.    The clause would have amended theHousing Act 1980 so as to confer the right to buy on certain securetenants of charitable housing associations and housing trusts. Itwould have applied only to dwellings which had been provided wholly oroverwhelmingly with public funds, and about three-quarters of theexisting stock of charitable housing associations would have been exemptfrom its provisions.   But many Conservative Peers were personallyinvolved in charitable housing associations, and their votes had beenlargely responsible for the Government&apos;s defeat.    The element ofretrospection in the clause had weighed heavily with them.    She wassatisfied that nothing more could have been said or done to avertdefeat.    She had contacted all the newly created Conservative Peers andmany others, and an unusually large number of the Government&apos;s supportershad attended the debate.    The Secretary of State for the Environmentand the Minister for Housing and Construction had explained the effectof the clause to a number of the Government&apos;s supporters.    The Ministerfor Local Government had made a persuasive speech at the end of thedebate, which had changed the views of about ten Conservative Peerswho had intended to vote against the Government.    Nevertheless, 36Conservative Peers and 41 cross-bench Peers had voted against the clause;only two cross-bench Peers had supported the Government.   A number ofConservative Peers had been unable to attend because of other commitments,but their presence would not have enabled the Government to avoid thedefeat, which clearly illustrated the difficulties of ensuring a Government Imajority in the House of Lords.    It was hoped to complete the CommitteeStage of the Bill that day.    It was intended to complete the remainingstages of the Energy Bill in the House of Lords on 9 May and theThird Reading of the Social Security and Housing Benefits Bill on 13 May.The Third Reading of the Housing and Building Control Bill could thentake place on 19 May.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that there wasno prospect of reversing the defeat on Clause 2 of the Bill in the currentSession.    It would be a disappointment to the tenants concerned, and itwould be helpful if they themselves mounted a campaign in favour of theprovisions in the clause.    The decision not to seek to reinstate theclause could be announced that afternoon, but it should be made clearthat this decision was without prejudice to the inclusion of equivalentprovisions in a future Bill.The Cabinet -Took note.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL IF0REIGN  %AlR&apos;c 2&apos;      THE F0REIGN AN0 COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the1    ..__ United States Secretary of State, Mr Shultz, was heavily engaged in^iddl tbe Middle East.    He was at present in Israel and would be going one East to Beirut.    With the British Government&apos;s encouragement, he wasPrev^ concentrating in his discussions on trying to secure agreement to a!W0  Us mutual withdrawal of foreign forces from the Lebanon.Crv! ence:(83) 13th ?Utlited St.*states     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY drew attention toPtev^ President Reagan&apos;s address to Congress the previous day on theKefere^e United St ates Administration&apos;s policies towards Central America. ThisCC(83) 131 was an important statement which had been prompted by the arms build-up^ nclUs. in Central America and President Reagan&apos;s determination to stem theMinute 2 nS&apos;       growth of Communist influence in the area.    It was likely to have beenwell received by the American public;   but first indications suggestedthat it had not convinced the opponents of the Administration&apos;s policiesin Congress.The Cabinet -1.     Took note.islands THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Government&apos;s effortswere being directed to deterring Senor Destefanis and his party of!tevious Argentine next-of-kin from sailing for the Falkland Islands, followingerenc . the statement  y the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)?-(83) 13&apos; dissociating themselves from the venture.   An approach had been made toy?nc.lusi tbe Argentine authorities through the Swiss and parallel approachesute 2 nS&apos;       na&lt;^ been made to the United States, Brazilian and other Governments topersuade the Argentine Government to prevent Senor Destefanis fromsailing.    The Permanent Under Secretary of State, Foreign andCommonwealth Office, Sir Antony Acland, was seeing the Secretary Generalof the United Nations, Senor Perez de Cuellar, at Heathrow Airport thatmorning and would ask him to use his influence with the Argentineauthorities in the same sense.    Meanwhile the Foreign andCommonwealth Office was issuing a public statement designed to makethe British Government&apos;s position clear:    this would emphasise thatthe Destefanis venture, which had been disavowed by the ICRC as contraryto the principle of neutrality, was not acceptable;   but that theGovernment would put no obstacle in the way of a genuinely humanitarianvisit organised and supervised by the ICRC.    If Senor Destefanis&apos;sparty set sail, their ship would be intercepted as it entered theFalkland Islands Protection Zone with a view to getting it to turn back;but no force would be used.    Further consideration would be given to theaction needed to prevent a landing if the ship continued on course forthe Falkland Islands.    Meanwhile units of the Argentine fleet were atsea in connection with the anniversary of the sinking of the Argentine*cruiser General Belgrano, which fell on 2 May, the date on whichSenor Destefanis&apos;s ship was liable to be intercepted.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that it wouldbe important to get across to public opinion both at home and abroadthe fact that the ICRC had dissociated itself from Senor Destefanis&apos;sventure, which appeared to be essentially propagandistic rather thanhumanitarian in character;    and that this was why the visit wasunacceptable to the British Government;    and to make it clear that theBritish objections had never applied to a visit by bona fide Argentinenext-of-kin organised and supervised by the ICRC.    These points werebeing stressed in the statement by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.The Cabinet -2. Took note.Soviet n .Union       THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there had been aPtevi0u helpful press reaction to the visit to Moscow by the ParliamentaryKefer Under Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office,CC(83) ^V&apos; ^I00*111 Rifkind, who had been having talks with his Soviet counter-foils parts.   His visit marked the resumption of low-key political contacts^nute 2 nS&apos;       between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom.    It was important thatthe United Kingdom should not be thought to be closing off theEast/West dialogue in the period leading up to the Alliance&apos;s deploymentof intermediate nuclear forces in December, or to be getting too farout of step with its other allies, whose contacts with the Soviet Unionwere more intensive.   Mr Rifkind would be reporting the outcome of histalks on his return;    meanwhile it was clear that they had been usefuland had given him the opportunity to raise a large number of outstandinghuman rights cases with the Soviet authorities, including that ofProfessor Sakharov, whom the Soviet Government were now reported to beready to allow to leave the country.The Cabinet -3. Took note.2^NlTv*AlRg 3.     THE PRIME MINISTER said that the visit to London the previous weekby the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Dr Helmut Kohl,p^tal and n^s senior colleagues had been outstandingly successful. The^ePubiic   c        atmosphere in all the meetings had been genuinely friendly and Dr Kohl^a-ny himself had performed more impressively than on previous occasions.It was evident that there was a wide measure of agreement between thetwo Governments which augured well for the Williamsburg Economic Summit.The visit had been good for Anglo-German relations and for Europe.It had however been necessary to remind the Germans of the undertakingto find a solution to the problem of the British 1983 budget contributionbefore their current Presidency of the Community expired at the endof June;    it was clear that they were finding it difficult to live up tothis undertaking.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that the recent visit to the &apos;United Kingdom by a group of high-level businessmen from theFederal Republic of Germany headed by Herr Rodenstock,    the Presidentof the Federation of German Industries, had also been a great success.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALAll the German representatives had been of unusually high calibre and,in a concluding press conference Herr Rodenstock had gone out of hisway to be complimentary about the British economy and its prospects.It was hoped that his remarks would be widely reported in Germany. Itwould be important to ensure that members of any team of senior Britishbusinessmen which might visit the Federal Republic under similararrangements were of the same quality.SteelTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY reported that the meeting of thePtev,- Council of Ministers on steel on 25 April had been somewhat acrimonious.&lt;\efe&gt;.&quot; It had been possible, however, to persuade the Council to call for^(g^s     . further proposals from the Commission which would take account ofConc^Us!^tn        restructuring.    This should give more flexibility on the existing quotas,Hinute i ns        which would help small firms.    There was no chance that other memberstates would give up quotas and, since an overall increase was notdesirable, it was best to aim for greater flexibility.   Domestic steelorders were rising but this was partly in anticipation of price increaseswhich the British Steel Corporation was bound to make.Budget Ly THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had spoken to thePresident of the European Commission, Monsieur Thorn,   and to*Ievi0u Vice-President Tugendhat about the need to leave sufficient room in the^eferen 1984 draft budget for the United Kingdom budget refunds.    They intended^(83) to keep headroom available, although they wished to disguise the methods%iclUs- tn        by which this was being done.    There would now be further discussion of^lute 3 nS&apos;       tne budget problem at the informal meeting of Foreign Ministers atGymnich on 14/15 May.    He would press the United Kingdom&apos;s case, inpreparation for the Council of Ministers&apos; meeting on 24 May, but thereception from other member states so far was distinctly cool.The Cabinet -Took note.J%aignjcLEar   f R       4-      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the Campaign for^RMampm Nuclear Disarmament (CND) had been successfully thrown on to thejj. defensive by the action taken to identify the left wing affiliations1Sarniame  ^ so many  f its leading members; but many of the rank and file supporters^ns nt         ^ tne movement were not left wing in their political orientation and it0lltroi was important that their sensitivities should be respected.    There wasp no truth in the current press reports that political approaches had beenI^evious made to church leaders to persuade their members to leave the CND.C   3) 6th THE H0ME SECRETARY said that the publication that day of the new^clusi0ns        Civil Defence Regulations would no doubt provoke strong criticism fromnute 2     &apos;       cbe CND and others;   but the regulations in their revised form wererelatively uncontroversial and the criticism should be containable. ,4CONFIDENTIAL^_____ 138 j
