CONFIDENTIALFJL^&apos;NTARY    ? .     The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House ofCommons during the following week.Oj.jSu &quot;ance THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Government had been defeated by 33 votesTracj.^ in a division in the House of Lords the previous evening on a motion byln8 Fund     Lord Shackleton regretting the Government&apos;s decision to move towards thecommercialisation of the Ordnance Survey, and calling on them to refer theissue to the new Ordnance Survey Advisory Board before laying the relevantorder.   The motion had been supported by all the Opposition parties, andonly one cross-bench Peer had voted against it.   A two-line whip had resultedin the attendance of a large number of Conservative Peers, but in the eventmany of them had abstained, and 10, including some former ConservativeMinisters, had voted against the Government.   The Minister of State,Department of the Environment, Lord Bellwin, had taken great pains to informhimself on the very technical subject under debate, and had made two powerfulspeeches;   but a number of the Peers supporting the motion had been able tospeak with detailed and authoritative knowledge of the Ordnance Survey.She did not think that more could have been done to avert defeat. TheOpposition in the House of Lords were now much better organised under theirnew Leader, and she feared that there might be further Government defeats,for example on the provisions of the Housing and Building Control Billaffecting charitable housing trusts.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that he had addressedConservative Peers before the debate in an attempt to gain their support,though he had not spoken to Lord Shackleton.   The supporters of the motionappeared to have misunderstood the Government&apos;s intention, which was to putthe Ordnance Survey on a more businesslike footing and to provide greatermotivation for its staff.   Many of those who had spoken had chosen tomisrepresent this as an attack on a fine and respected service. Althoughthe. Lords motion was not binding, it would be offensive to the upper Houseto table the relevant Order in the Commons at once.   He had asked theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment,Mr Shaw, to see whether some modest concessions could be offered.   He wouldthen speak to the main opponents of any change before proposing any furtheraction.   He had already stressed to the Minister for Housing andConstruction the importance of preparing the ground in advance before theHousing and Building Control Bill reached the House of Lords.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that although theachievements of the Ordnance Survey were not in doubt, it was unacceptablefor it to continue to operate with an open-ended subsidy.   The control ofsupply was a matter for the House of Commons, and it was for considerationwhether steps might eventually have to be taken to restrict the power ofthe House of Lords to take action which led to increased public expenditure.The Cabinet -Took note.CONFIDENTIAL
1CONFIDENTIALF REIGNAffairs THE F0REIGN MD COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the publication inTel Aviv of the report of the judicial inquiry into the Beirut massacre was___ having serious repercussions on Israeli domestic politics.    The situationwas very uncertain.    It was doubtful whether the Defence Minister, Mr Sharon,Nidd&apos;i would either resign or be dismissed, but there might be an early generale East      election.   Meanwhile, despite hopes placed by the Americans on Mr Habib,revious there was no sign of progress towards agreement on the withdrawal of foreignre^etence: troops from the Lebanon.    Unfortunately, as discussion with the United Statesc (83) 3rd        Vice-President, Mr George Bush, in London the previous day had confirmed, thev?nclusions      United States Administration remained reluctant to put effective pressure onlnute 2 the Israeli Government to show greater flexibility.   This was a cause ofincreasing concern to moderate Arab Governments, as had been made clear byPresident Mubarak of Egypt on his recent visit to London.   The main body ofthe British contingent for the multinational force in the Lebanon hadarrived in Beirut on 8 February and had taken over positions previouslyoccupied by the Israelis in the face of some Israeli reluctance.In discussion the point was made that it was increasingly difficult forBritish public opinion to take a sympathetic view of Israeli policies aslong as Mr Begin, with his terrorist background and attitudes, remained atthe head of the Israeli Government.    But the judicial inquiry into the Beirut Imassacre had been exemplary;   and it was possible that the pressure of worldopinion, which had induced Mr Begin to set up the inquiry in the first place, Iwould also bring about Mr Sharon&apos;s resignation.Keport   THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Brandt Commission hadnow produced its second report, which was more technical than the first.Careful consideration would need to be given to the British Government&apos;sreaction.a THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the exodus of about one^evi0 million illegal migrant workers from Nigeria had now ended.   Ghana and Chad^fer^s faced immense difficulties in assimilating the refugees.   Nigeria had paid^(83) little or no attention to international protests, including those from the%*clu .rt^        British Government.   British assistance to the refugees had so far been^inute o ns.     limited:    the United Kingdom had contributed to the European Community aidprogramme and made an additional  150,000 available bilaterally.    But requestsfor further financial aid were likely to be forthcoming.f*ce-p f ^&amp;     THE PRIME MINISTER said that the recent round of visits to European capitals5f thereS^dent  y the Vice-President of the United States, Mr George Bush, had gone well.^ateg ^n^ted   His visit to London, which was concluding that morning, had been outstandinglysuccessful.   Mr Bush had addressed a large and influential audience atGuildhall and had handled questions well.    In his private talks with her andthe Foreign and Cormionwealth Secretary, which had concentrated on defenceissues, he had been expert, reasonable and flexible.    He had made it clearthat the United States would continue to treat the zero option as the long-term Iobjective of the current negotiations with the Soviet Union on IntermediateRange Nuclear Forces (INF) but were ready if possible to conclude inter- .mediate agreements on a basis of parity:    they did not regard the zerooption as a &quot;take it or leave it&quot; position.   This was entirely in line with^ CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe views of the West German Chancellor, Dr Kohl.    The United States wouldprobably not, however, be making specific new proposals in the INF negotia-tions until after the Federal German elections on 6 March.   Mr Bush hadbeen accompanied by Mr Feldstein, the new Chairman of the Council of Economic IAdvisers, who had announced that the first signs of economic recovery werebecoming apparent in the United States, notably in the construction andmotor car industries.    It was to be hoped that these positive and welcometrends would be sustained.In discussion it was agreed that Mr Bush had presented the arguments for theUnited States position on arms control and deterrence effectively. Asustained campaign was needed to present the case for nuclear deterrence toBritish opinion, which was basically sympathetic to it.    A Ministerialgroup had been established for this purpose under the chairmanship of theSecretary of State for Defence.   The increasingly irresponsible positionsbeing adopted by the Opposition Parties on defence issues were notnecessarily unhelpful to the Government&apos;s case.    The development of adialogue with the Soviet Union on issues other than arms control would helpto reassure public opinion, and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office wasalready working to bring about a gradual increase in official contacts withthe Soviet Union to the extent that this could be done without implying anormalisation of relations.The Cabinet -Took note.ApSjIrY 3.     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Europeanb Parliament was expected to approve the 1983 Supplementary and Amending Budgetbefore their plenary session ended on 11 February.   The Commission hadpublished their Green Paper on the future financing of the Community. InC(w   . part it could be helpful to the United Kingdom, since some of its ideas wereBu(jgenity in line with the possibilities suggested by the Chancellor of the Exchequer19ooS^&quot; lri his statement in Brussels on 7 February.82 RefUndsPtev^ In discussion it was noted that the proposal for a new source of revenueRe er Us related to shares of agricultural production   was potentially helpful to theCC( 2\nCe: United Kingdom, although the agreement of other member states might beConc,   ?rd        difficult to obtain, but that the proposals for increasing the budget wereMij^^ons, unwelcome.tteat &quot;eat~       THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that the European Court&apos;s IHi.]^ judgment on 8 February ruling against the United Kingdom&apos;s procedures forPorts     restricting milk imports had made it clear that the United Kingdom was^evi entitled to lay down hygiene requirements for milk imports to protect the*efe  Us health of the consumer.    It had however implied that this should be done on^(83) tne basis of certification by the exporting member state.   The French^ nciu . ^        system in particular was untrustworthy;   he had recently seen a report of an(^nute i ns      analysis of pasteurized milk in France in which a third of the samples wereunsatisfactory.    Time would be needed to agree acceptable arrangements withthe Commission and other member states, which would include regularinspections at the ports, and primary legislation would be required. The3 &apos;^BCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALprice of imports should not be as low as some Press reports had suggestedunless France resorted to subsidising it by such means as regional aidthrough Credit Agricole.In discussion it was noted that the current temporary arrangements could notbe maintained for any great length of time and that it was thereforeimportant that the Government should act quickly to put permanent andacceptable arrangements in place.    Once these had been implemented, therewould be advantage in some successful prosecutions in respect of milk whichfailed to meet the new requirements.The Cabinet -Took note.APFATTRIAL        4*     THE SECRETARY 0F STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that interruptions in the IS water supply resulting from the water workers&apos; strike were increasingsteadily but gradually.    The current spell of cold weather would make thesituation worse;   and the plight of old people dependent on frozen stand-Uat pipes was particularly distressing.   There had, however, been a number ofIn(jUs reconnections, and in general the system was continuing to function farPay Stf^ more effectively than had been expected.    Some 37,000 properties were nowUegot-    _ without water and some 7 million people were being advised to boil theirlations     drinking water.   The negotiations which the Arbitration and ConciliationPr*   . Advisory Service (ACAS) had been conducting between the employers and theR6     Us union side had broken down following the unions&apos; refusal to accept theCc(o^?nce:        binding arbitration sought by the employers in accordance with the termsC0n ,    ?rc*        of the agreement which both sides had signed, under the auspices of ACAS,Mir,, tUsi ns,     at the outset of the mediation process.    There was evidence of workers?&quot;?lute L . ....H wanting to return to work, but being inhibited from doing so by the closedshop agreement between the employers and the unions;    and the employerswere under some pressure to abrogate that agreement on the ground that theunions were not honouring their obligation under it to maintain emergencycover.    Emergency cover was, however, being maintained in most cases; andthe most urgent requirement was to get across to the public the extent ofthe union side&apos;s failure to honour the agreements it had entered into. Hewould therefore be discouraging the employers from premature action toabrogate the closed shop agreement, and he would be making a statement toParliament that afternoon which would emphasise the passage from the latestACAS statement which stressed the need to refer the dispute &quot;either toarbitration or to some other third party, for a final decision&quot;.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the statement by ACAScommenting on the breakdown of the negotiations had been injudicious andunhelpful in criticising the employers while failing to make it clear thatthe unions had broken their agreements.    In public presentation of the issuesit would be important to direct criticism away from the workforce and on tothe union leadership, which was prolonging the dispute by its refusal tohonour the agreements providing for binding arbitration and thereby causinghardship both to the public and the unions&apos; membership.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that reports in the Press that theelectricity workers were contemplating sympathetic action were largely &apos;sabre-rattling at this stage:    it appeared that the union leadership wasexploring the readiness of its members to take militant action. Paynegotiations with the manual workers in the gas and electricity industrieswere going ahead slowly, and no further meetings were planned until the weekafter next.    But there were fears of eventual industrial action in   the gasindustry. ,CONFIDENTIAL I
CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that there was also somecause for concern in the National Health Service where the water industryunions were threatening to withdraw emergency cover from hospitals whichdid not have emergency and accident Departments.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that it was importantnot to jeopardise the maintenance of emergency cover, which it appeared wasbeing generally maintained despite union rhetoric to the contrary. Ifemergency cover were in fact withheld, firm action would be necessary.For the moment, however, the right course was to focus public criticismon the unions for failure to honour their agreements.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office10 February 1983CONFIDENTIALj _ 5 61
