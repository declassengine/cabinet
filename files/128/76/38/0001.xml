The French h nt*Goveufmeaf^was also considering a reduction, although it had not been iriutable srT^ar^to persuade the Lebanese Government to request one.The United/Kingdom&apos;s objective was to substitute a United Nationsforce for^he MNF.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Council f Ministers on 19 December had decided to send a letter to theC        (sXs\    President of the European Parliament, Mr Dankert, formally^mniunitg/v^o^  stating its disagreement with certain actions by the European^udget and /^.n Parliament on the Community&apos;s 1984 budget, including the decisionMted KinraomYbf the European Parliament to classify the whole of the United Kingdomefunds        \ir^4hd German 1983 refunds as non-obligatory expenditure and to put themu &apos;    p ^^^vthe reserve chapter.   Mr Dankert had nonetheless rejected theevious \ 0j*ncil&apos;s letter and signed the budget.   The next step was to pressCry rence: trLQ^JrfOTmission to propose a transfer of the provision for thed       c(83) 37th        I9^83^r&amp;nds on to budget lines.illusions, &lt;^Z&gt;en    &apos;^nute 3 &lt;^&amp;)In discdv&amp;s&gt;6n it was pointed out, first, that it was unsatisfactorythat the i^jropean Parliament had taken decisions in breach ofCommunity rules and that the Council of Ministers was apparentlyunable to reverse this;   and, secondly, that the United Kingdome should not allow&lt;Ste Community to be in default on its obligationswithout reacting.   &lt;Jm reply it was pointed out that, in accordancewith past practire^We bulk of the United Kingdom&apos;s 1983 refundshould be paid byviL^ra ch 1984 and that the Council of Ministers0 was standing firmly ^^p^the United Kingdom on the honouring of thets Stuttgart Agreement,  /r&amp;fas still possible that the provision  for the 1983 refund cot^d^w^taken out of the reserve chapter ofthe budget by that date. ^fe^European Parliament&apos;s action waslikely to strengthen the w ew)df some member states, notably France,that a firmer control of CblatiMmXy spending was now necessary.e There was a separate questiotf b^*he amount ( 42 million) whichthe United Kingdom claimed shakWbhe added to the 1982 basic.refundand risk-sharing element.   The^Cyjm&amp;l of Ministers had not acceptedgPt that view.   This amount was due Vy^&gt;^ &gt;ecember 1983.   It would befor consideration what action the ^mijb^d Kingdom Government should e take, if that date passed and (as seCT jtSlikely to, be the case) the   42 million had not been received.   Ofteypossibility might be toput an equivalent amount from the paymtarps due to the Commission        . ,in January into a suspense account, in ^h^ich it could be held ininterest-bearing Government debt.   Tactically the better coursemight be to ensure that, if it proved necessary to withhold Communityfunds because the bulk of the 1983 refunds were^Sht received by thedue date, the United Kingdom should then recover also the amountclaimed under the 1982 risk-sharing formula.   m^nS^uld requirefurther consideration in the New Year.   In the mraj^zme, however,it would be important to put all member states on w  rMng that theCommunity would be in default from 1 January 1984 on/vjj^additionalrisk-sharing element of the 1982 refund.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thar^defejpitethe action of the European Parliament, no question of Comma^d^default on the 1983 refund arose immediately.   As for the a&amp;r^fwanalrisk-sharing element of the 1982 refund, a formal letter shou^xj^owbe prepared and despatched notifying member states that the CfSnmwKrty\ was in default.    It would be necessary to consider thereafter wriepjpe^,further action was required. XX1 ,__ \\confidential |

A number of councillors were apprehensive about thepossibilitj^Jf the introduction of the general scheme and its effectupon their councils.   It should be made clear that the purpose of thelegislation was to re-establish in statutory form the convention whichhad hitherto prevailed under which local government complied with thegeneral expenditura^targets and controls established by the centralGovernment, and ts^e^i^with councils who were acting in deliberate Idefiance of that convention.   This intention, and the limitations on theselective scheme,, wevE^)*^ clear in the text of the Bill as published.There were a number of^cyofcjjiils, other than those at which the selectivescheme was primarily aiiqpd&lt;^vho were running high levels of expenditure* and were apprehensive abontvtttjir position.   In this context it would behelpful to be able to draw &lt; fcjre&amp;tion to the scope in local governmentfor reducing expenditure witSttmijz)cutting services.   The recent report bythe Audit Commission would be&apos;-cjrf^mely helpful in this regard, and thematerial in it should be made w^cre y\available both at national and atlocal levels. ^flx&gt;THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the d&gt; clifcsion, said that the principlesand purposes of the Rates Bill were stjrafgly supported by ratepayers andby industry and commerce.   What was na^fi5 ded was to mobilise thissupport in terms of pressure upon Members/^) &gt;Parliament to support theBill in its progress through Parliament. ^/me primary purpose of the Bill .was to protect ratepayers, and this theme^hould be emphasised in thespeeches which she hoped that as many Ministers as possible would bemaking.on the subject before Parliament resumed on_16 January.

Preliminary consideration of the possibilityCC(83) 36th      of pros4 ^fcion in the United Kingdom had led to the conclusion that tbeConclusions,     balance OT^mjantage was against proscription but that it might beMinute 4 diff icult vfrar^the Government not to follow suit if the Irish Governmentdecided to Tyroscribe.    It had, however, been recognised that proscrip&quot;tion would be easier in the Irish Republic than in the United Kingdom&gt;(where over 100,000 votes had been recorded for Sinn Fein candidates iflthe last General EtEZ^tion).   It had also been pointed out that aproscribed Sinn Fein &lt;dould re-emerge under another name, and thatproscription coula^^Sd^ice mass defiance and widespread civildisobedience in Nortmej^yireland on the part of Sinn Fein supporters.It had since become krTara/that the Irish Cabinet was reluctant toproscribe Sinn Fein and/^^Wecided to postpone a decision on thequestion for the time be^pg^v *THE SECRETARY OF STATE F0R&lt;^TmSRN IRELAND said that proscriptionwould be disruptive to Sinn Tq&amp;i^^s an organisation and would make iteasier to deal with electoral a&apos;Streeoin Northern Ireland.   There was acase for acting quickly while p&quot;ot&gt;j^ indignation about the Knightsbridebombing and other recent acts of ^eraebrism was still fresh.   As agai lStthis there were the practical dif f^uLties outlined by the PrimeMinister, to which could be added th^ppdblems of having to imprison_, .  large numbers of people in Northern I&lt;^a ji who might defy proscripti00and generate riot and disorder.   Excepr^or the leader of the , &apos;Democratic Unionist Party, Mr Ian Paisleyv^plrtion in Northern&apos;Irelandappeared to be against proscription and thsNJeader of the Social .Democratic and Labour Party, Mr John Hume, believed that it would da 3?his party electorally and make it impossible to hold elections in theProvince.    If the Irish Government decided to pra^Sribe it would bedifficult for the British Government not to follow $)uit; but the recenseries of terrorist actions in the Republic had al^tejil public opimotl ^in the South to the threat which terrorism present^fe^Js^the stabilitythe Republic and had led to strong domestic pressurV^wArish Minister*for more effective counter-terrorist action.   For the mc^rvt, the rig*1course would be for the British Government to build on &lt; &amp; |\andencourage the Irish Government to strengthen border securifr^and takemore effective measures against the 200-300 terrorists who^u^em theRepublic as a safe haven for action in the North.

Both the General Officer Commanding in&lt;^^vNorthern Ireland and the Chief Constable regarded this as a high/^priority.   Consideration was also being given to measures against&lt;^HfaVrorism which might be taken jointly with the Irish Republic. Althoughon had been a number of major terrorist outrages in recent weeks theOT^all situation in Northern Ireland was relatively calm and theca^H^lTY figures for 1983 promised to be the lowest for any year since^ thelmr&lt;snt troubles began.he THE H0ME^8J3CRETARY said that five people had been detained forquestioMM^fcollowing the Knightsbridge bomb explosion but no explosivesor bombs r^rcKb en found and no arrest appeared imminent.   He had powersunder the Wevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1976 toproscribe ah$ terrorist organisation, and similar but separate powersfl were available to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.Proscription in Great Britain would require an Affirmative Resolutionin the House of CodfiShs, although in an emergency this could be soughtretrospectively. (ul vntroduced, proscription would need to apply bothin Northern IrelanSr^ry^yn the mainland, and it was right that NorthernIreland consideratiaj^s^yWild be paramount.   He agreed with the Secretaryof State for Northern&quot;3j %and that proscription would on balance beunhelpful in present ciwpxl kances: it would not affect the fight againstterrorism on the mainlan&lt; /^p^it could well lead to widespread civildisobedience in Northern Irei^Jrcl.   It was important that the united moodof the country in the face &lt;w^rdCent acts of terrorism should not bedissipated by arguments abouc^MS^&amp;frits and demerits of proscription.g To enforce proscription only aM^s^ leading members of Sinn Fein, whileallowing the rank and file to goVf^ee. would be politically indefensibleand would bring the law into disr^wa^xIn discussion it was suggested that all possible measures for combatingterrorism should be explored and that&lt; f e^fcaw against incitement to&apos; violence should be reviewed, although Ityvas^recognised that the mainproblem in this area lay in the collectiwxff evidence.   It was . ,- suggested that there were precedents in c^il law for collectingevidence (notably in connection with breach of copyright) which mightusefully be applied against leading members of Sinn Fein who weresuspected of incitement to violence.   Another possibility would be toestablish a Tribunal of Inquiry as a preliminary(^o^3roscription, which  would make it possible subsequently to indict lea^fegSinembers of SinnFein for criminal activities.
