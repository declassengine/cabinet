CONFIDENTIAL^LlAMENTARY     1.     The Cabinet were informed of a number of statements of Governmentpolicy to be made by means of Written Answers to Parliamentary Questionsbefore the dissolution of Parliament.F ilIlance fiiH       THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that agreement had been reachedprev^ with the Opposition to expedite the passage of a shortened, thoughRefe  US still substantial, Finance Bill.   The provisions regarding oil taxation,CC(8l^nCe: business expansion measures and certain industrial measures, would be&apos;-oriel   .^t*1        retained.   But those increasing the limits on the size of mortgageHinutUsi0ns        eligible for tax relief, relaxations in capital transfer tax, ande ^ increases in the income levels at which higher rates of income tax werelevied had had to be dropped.   This would have no immediate effect,since the Inland Revenue had issued income tax codings on the assumptionthat the proposals in the Finance Bill as originally presented toParliament would become law.    Provided that the Government was returnedto office, there would be no lasting effect, since the Government hadundertaken immediately to present a new Finance Bill giving effect to theprovisions which had been dropped.   Ministers should stress these pointsin public discussion.   They should also point out that the Oppositionattitude threatened the position of a substantial number of people withincomes in the middle range, and not only of those with the very highestincomes;   and that the blocking of the increase in mortgage limits wouldhamper the smooth working of the housing market.SeUct THE CHANCELL0R 0F TE EXCHEQUER said that the Treasury and Civil Service^ rnmitt Select Committee had considered two draft reports on thees international monetary system;    one had been prepared by one of theCommittee&apos;s special advisers, the other by Dr Jeremy Bray MP. Neitherwas helpful to the Government.    It was understood that the Committeeintended to publish both the drafts on 24 May, the former as aChairman&apos;s report.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that Governmentspokesmen should vigorously attack the attitude of the Opposition to theprovisions in the Finance Bill which they had obliged the Government todrop.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury, should immediately circulate tothe Cabinet appropriate briefing material, making clear how many peoplewould be affected by the failure to increase the mortgage limits, andby the refusal to allow the threshold of liability to higher rates ofincome tax to be increased.   This should cover both those who wouldbecome liable to the higher rates and those who were already so liablebut would have to pay more tax if the Opposition&apos;s views were ultimatelyto prevail.    Examples should also be given of the amount of additionaltax which those affected would have to pay in this event during theremainder of 1983-84:    this would include recovery of the reduction intax which they had enjoyed under the codings which the Inland Revenuehad already issued.    The right of Select Committees to act in the waydescribed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer was open to question:it implied publication of a report by a Select Committee of theHouse of Commons at a time when the House of Commons would have nomembers.    The Lord President of the Council should take this matter,up urgently with the Speaker of the House of Commons.1CONFIDENTIALI ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Invited the Lord President of the Council, inconsultation with the Parliamentary Secretary, Treasury,to make representations to the Speaker of the House ofCommons concerning the propriety of Select Committees of theHouse publishing reports after the dissolution of Parliament.F RElr\rAppAjp 2.     THE PRIME MINISTER reported on the position reached in the exchange___ of views with the People&apos;s Republic of China about Hong Kong.H nS Kongfusions,SujnmitiC THE PRIME MINISTER said that sne had not Yet taken a final decisionWilK   at about her attendance at the Economic Summit meeting at Williamsburg28-.30a Jsburg on 28-30 May and would be grateful for any views that the Cabinety might wish to express..   , . ...Refer In discussion it was strongly argued that the Prime Minister should^(83)  e: be Present at the Economic Summit which was a meeting of majorConciu .^tb international importance.   Although it was awkward that the Summitl0ns        would now be taking place during the Election campaign, it wasconvenient that the meeting would coincide with the weekend of theSpring Bank Holiday.The Cabinet -Took note.J^NItyPAlRS 3*     TEE MINISTER 0F AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that acomplete package, including a substantially increased butter subsidy[983 pa for the United Kingdom, was awaiting decision by the Council of Ministers*ice   1111 (Agriculture) on 16 May.   The Italians, however, were still makingegotiat. large demands and it was possible that, if these were not met, theyl0ns      would not agree until after the Italian election at the end of June,p^ious This would create a difficult situation in some Community countrieseferen where farmers were already protesting strongly.   United Kingdom farmers^(83) would also be discontented at the delay.   He intended that the Nine, nclllc.    n        should stand together and not give way to excessive Italian demands.Minions, ^ H.

This wasUne essential because this Council had the remit to arrive at a conclusionon the interim budget solution and to report it to the European Councilat Stuttgart on 6-7 June.In discussion it was noted that the Prime Minister would wish toconsider carefully whether it would be feasible and desirable for herto attend the European Council at Stuttgart bearing in mind that thiswould be in the last week of the General Election campaign and takingaccount of progress on the interim budget problem.    If the Prime Ministerwas not to attend, the matter would require most careful handling.The Cabinet -Took note.s cialSecubttv &apos;     The Cabinet discussed certain social security matters. Theirdiscussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.^^ANrp 5*     THE PRIME MINISTER said that there was not likely to be a needMENTS       for a further meeting of the Cabinet before the General Election.If any matter arose which required discussion the Ministers concernedwould have to gather together to deal with it, as necessary.THE HOME SECRETARY said that, as this was likely to be the last meetingof the Cabinet before the General Election, he wanted, on behalf of thewhole Cabinet, to express their appreciation of the Prime Minister&apos;sleadership and to wish her the best of success in the forthcomingElection campaign which her leadership had so richly deserved.THE PRIME MINISTER, thanking the Home Secretary and her colleagues,said that she in turn was conscious of how much she owed to the loyalsupport of the Cabinet who had worked together as an effective andunited team.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the statement made on theirbehalf by the Home Secretary and the Prime Minister&apos;sresponse.Cabinet Office12 May 1983&lt;3CONFIDENTIAL
^ SECRETTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NO 8CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(83)  18th Conclusions, Minute 4Thursday 12 May 1983 at 10.00 ams cialSEcURl THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that at the time of theT 1983 Budget the Government had announced that it intended to change thebasis of uprating the main social security benefits from forecasts ofinflation to the actual increase in the Retail Price   Index (RPI) in the12 months ending in the May before the uprating in question. Theprevious method, based on forecasts, would probably have led to anuprating in November 1983 of 6 per cent, less any reduction which theGovernment might have decided to impose in order to recover all or partof the 2.7 per cent excess provision for inflation in the November 1982uprating.   Ministers had indicated at the time of the Budget that theyexpected the new method to produce an uprating of about 4 per cent;and the Financial Statement and Budget Report had assumed an increase of4/^ per cent.    It now seemed likely tbaj: the increase in the RPI betweenMay 1982 and May 1983 would be about T/^ per cent or even less. TheGovernment was already under attack for changing the method of upratingon the grounds that the change was simply a way of saving money.    If theNovember 1983 uprating was of less than 4 per cent, the Government mightbe .accused of making further savings at the expense of pensioners.Although the RPI figure for May would not be published until 17 June itwould be widely predicted;   and the November 1983 uprating could thereforebecome an important issue in the General Election campaign.   -He thereforeproposed that the Government should announce at the outset of the campaignthat, the November 1983 uprating would be of the order of either 4 per centor 4   per cent.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the decision to change thebasis of uprating from forecasts to actual figures had been taken ongrounds of principle and had been remarkably well received in publicdiscussion.    If the Government abandoned its position of principle at thevery first time of operation of the new method it would appear to have no Iconfidence in its own arguments;   and there would be no logicaljustification for whatever alternative figure it might select.   The costof what was proposed by the Secretary of State for Social Services wouldbe about  220 million in a full year, equivalent to an increase of0.2 per cent in National Insurance contributions.    The Government hadincreased retirement pensions in real terms during its period of officeand was under no obligation to go further:    in any event, theadditional increase in retirement pensions that would flow from acceptingthe Secretary of State&apos;s proposals would be small in actual money termsi1
^ SECRETfor the individual concerned and could not outweigh the seriousdamage that would be done to the coherence of the Government&apos;s positionif the principle of using actual figures was abandoned.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Secretaryof State for Social Services had been right to raise the issue towhich he had drawn attention.   But the Cabinet were clearly agreedthat it would be wrong to abandon their previous decision to upratethe main social security benefits by reference to actual increasesin the RPI.     The fact that this year&apos;s uprating seemedlikely to be low was only a reflection of the Government&apos;s success indefeating inflation:   pensioners were among the main beneficiaries ofthat success.    In this, as in other matters, the Government should standfirm during the General Election campaign on its previously declaredpolicies.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.2. Agreed that, as previously envisaged, the November 1983uprating of social security benefits would be based on theactual increase in the Retail  Price  Index between May 1982and May 1983.Cabinet Office . ,13 May 19832SECRET^^^^^^ A O (\
