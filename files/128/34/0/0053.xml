UnitedNationsGeneralAssembly(previous reference :CC. (60) 51stConclusions,Minute 1)CC. 53 (60)1. The Prime Minister said that the outcome of the discussions at the General Assembly of the United Nations had justified the cabinet&apos;s decision that he should attend it. In the event the PrimeMinisters of Canada, Australia and New Zealand had also attended,in addition to the Prime Ministers of India and Ghana: theCommonwealth had been well represented.In his speech to the Assembly he had tried to combine a firmdefence of the policies of the West with a constructive and practicalapproach to the outstanding world problems. There was a danger that, in the period before the Presidential election, the United Statespoint of view might harden in such a way as to make any negotiationswith the Soviet bloc more difficult in the future, and his main purposehad been to keep open the possibility of a Summit meeting in thefollowing year. He had formed the impression that some of the new members of the United Nations, who might have been expected tosuccumb to the influence of the representatives of communist countries, realised that the attack which the Soviet Union leader,Mr. Khrushchev, had made on the colonial policies of some of theWestern Governments had been grossly exaggerated. His attack onthe United Nations intervention in the Congo had certainly not been successful. But some further action was necessary to resolve thesituation there, and the Prime Minister had privately represented toMr. Hammarskjold that the United Nations might set up someconstitutional enquiry to examine the relations between the centralGovernment and the provincial authorities in the Congo.After failing to reverse the United Nations policy for the Congo,Mr. Khrushchev had made a bitter attack on Mr. Hammarskjoldand on the constitution of the Secretariat. His proposal to replace asingle Secretary-General by three, representing the West, the soviet bloc and the neutrals, would paralyse effective action by the united nations. Many of the uncommitted countries seemed to realise thatthis would not be in their best interests, since an effective united nations organisation provided the best opportunity for neutral countries to exert influence in world affairs.The Prime Minister said that in his private discussions withMr. Khrushchev he had taken care not to appear to be attempting to mediate between him and President Eisenhower. It was clear thatSummit negotiations could not be resumed until a new administration had taken office in the United States. Mr. Khrushchev had indicated that, in the meantime, he did not intend to provoke a crisis over berlin. It was difficult to decide whether the Soviet Union genuinelywished to make progress on disarmament. Mr. Khrushchev had saidthat he would like a special meeting of the General Assembly on thissubject in the spring. Meanwhile, provided that the United StatesGovernment refrained from resuming nuclear tests, there was a goodhope that the Geneva Conference on this subject might make further progress. There might also be useful discussion of other practicalproposals, including the technical study of measures of inspection andcontrol which he had suggested.The Commonwealth Secretary said that it was important toprevent the uncommitted countries from forming the view that theWestern Powers were not really in favour of disarmament. The best way of persuading the African and Asian countries that the western powers genuinely wanted disarmament under effective control mightbe by initiating discussion of this subject within the Commonwealth.For this purpose we should consider convening a meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers to discuss disarmament, preferablyafter a preparatory meeting of officials from all commonwealth countries.The Home Secretary expressed the Cabinet&apos;s gratitude andappreciation for the success of the Prime Minister^ visit to theGeneral Assembly.
Took note with approval of the Prime Ministers report onhis mission to the General Assembly of the United Nations.NationalHealthServiceMedicines forPrivatePatients(previous reference:C.C. (60) 15thConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (60) 137) about the supply of medicines on national health Service terms to the private patients of general practitioners.The Home Secretary said that as long ago as 1949 theConservative Party had publicly endorsed the principle that anypatient should be able to avail himself of either the whole or anypart of the National Health Service, and had expressed the view thatthe private patients of general practitioners should be allowed toobtain the medicines prescribed for them on National Health Serviceterms. The Home Affairs Committee had recently considered thefinancial and other arguments against making this concession and had decided that, in view of the Government&apos;s commitments, the increasing pressure from their own supporters in Parliament and theBritish Medical Association, and the possibility that the concession would make it easier to secure acceptance of drastic action to control the cost of the National Health Service and, in particular, of the drugsprovided, they should recommend the Cabinet to approve theproposal of the Minister of Health that the necessary legislation should be introduced early in the following session.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, since the last increasein the National Health Service contribution, the cost of the service had increased by some  190 millions and was expected to increase by a further  40 millions within the next two years. Since thediscussion in the Home Affairs Committee he had decided that he must recommend to the Cabinet an increase of the order of oneshilling in the weekly contribution. The proposed concession to private patients was estimated to cost at least  2-1 millions a year andthe cost might well be substantially higher. He was, therefore, unableto agree to it until a decision had been taken on the amount of the weekly contribution.In discussion it was pointed out that the proposed concession would certainly lead to an increase in private practice and that therewas, in consequence, a serious danger that the National health service would in time become a &quot; second-class &quot; service or would atleast come to be so regarded. The concession would, moreover,detract to some extent from the advantages of being a private patient,since the control necessarily exercised over prescribing in the national health Service would limit the freedom of doctors in prescribing for those of their private patients who chose to avail themselves of theservice. Nor was it clear that the situation had changed since theCabinet had decided earlier in the year that the time was notopportune for making the concession and that pressure for it shouldbe resisted.Discussion showed that, in spite of these considerations, therewas considerable support for the view that the concession wasin itself desirable and that further deferment could not easily bejustified to a section of the Government^ supporters. It was,however, recognised that the timing of such a concession presented a difficult problem. There would be advantage in announcing it at theConservative Party Conference in the following week, but there wouldnot be time before the Conference to reach a decision on the chancellors proposal for an increase in the weekly contribution. If,in the event, the Cabinet were unable to accept that proposal, it mightbe found financially impracticable to make the concession to private patients; and it would, apart from this, be inappropriate to announce a substantial concession to one small section of the community
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that legislation to enable the private patients ofgeneral practitioners to be provided with medicines on national Health Service terms should, if possible, beintroduced in the following session.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to put before them at an early meeting his proposal for an increase in the weekly National Health Service contribution.(3) Agreed to resume thereafter their discussion on thelegislation referred to in Conclusion (1) above.(4) Invited the Minister of Health to circulate a memorandumon possible methods of effecting economies in theNational Health Service.industrial disputes(previous reference :C.C. (60) 43rdConclusions,Minute 8)railway wages(previous reference :C.C. (60) 9thConclusions,Minute 5)3. The Minister of Labour said that a national railway strike had been called for 17th October by the National Union of railwaymen (N.U.R.) over the question of a pay differential forsome 40,000 skilled engineers in the railway workshops. Theworkshop staff had already received a 5 per cent, increase back-datedto the previous January and, with the concurrence of the Government,the British Transport Commission had offered a further 3 per cent,for the unskilled and 4 per cent, for the skilled men. The unions had not regarded this differential as sufficient; and, although thedifference between the two sides was now very small, the N.U.R.had precipitately called the strike. On the initiative of the confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions they had agreed to hold a further meeting on the following day with theChairman of the Transport Commission, who intended to try toC.C. 53 (60)without at the same time indicating the Governments intention toimpose an additional charge on the far larger number of contributorswho were in a less favourable position to meet it. Both proposals would require legislation; and,&quot; if it were decided to proceed withthem both, the two Bills might be announced or introducedconcurrently early in the new session. This juxtaposition would inevitably involve the Government in serious political difficulty. But,if the contribution were to be increased, the legislation must for technical reasons be passed before the end of the year and it was desirable that the Bill authorising the concession to private patientsshould also have been passed before it became necessary to announcedrastic economies or increased charges in the Health Service in the context of the Departmental Estimates early in the following year.On the other hand, if announcement of the concession were deferred,it might be possible if the medical profession were willing toco-operate without it- to present it more acceptably in the context of a reduction in the cost of drugs prescribed, effected by theco-operation of the doctors and without additional charge on the patients.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that thegeneral feeling of the Cabinet seemed to be in favour of making the concession. Before, however, it was decided to legislate in thefollowing session, the Cabinet must reach a decision on the chancellors proposal for an increase in the weekly contribution. TheChancellor should therefore put his proposal formally before theCabinet as soon as possible. Having reached a decision on that,the Cabinet should give further consideration to the timing of the concession to private patients. It would be useful if the Minister ofHealth could at the same time give the Cabinet some indication ofhis plans for effecting economies in the National Health Service.
London DockStrikeThe Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Labour, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, to give further consideration, in thelight of their discussion and of the projected meeting between the British Transport Commission and theNational Union of Railwaymen, to the best course ofaction to be taken by the Government.The Minister of Labour said that he had announced his willingness to appoint a committee of enquiry to investigate the causes of the dispute between the London Docks Board and the tally clerks,which had led to the present unofficial strike. He had, however, made it clear that the committee would not begin to function until the menreturned to work, and the Transport and General Workers union were that day trying to persuade them to do so.The Cabinet (2) Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour onthe unofficial strike in the London docks.Law of the 4.   The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that, althoughSea the discussions with the Icelandic Government on fishery limits hadIcelandic not been broken off, little progress was being made.   It seemedFisheries probable that, even if the Icelandic Government were prepared to(Previous make some agreement, they would be unable to secure its acceptanceReference: by their Parliament.  The  ban on fishing within the 12-mile limit,C.C. (60) 49th voluntarily accepted by the British fishing industry, was due to expireConclusions, on 12th October; and, if no progress were made in the discussionsMinute 1) with Iceland within the next few days, it would be necessary to reach an urgent decision on the resumption of naval protection.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,7th October, I960.persuade them to submit the dispute to arbitration. If the unionsrejected this offer there would be three courses open to the Minister:to appoint a committee of enquiry into the dispute; to offer theservices of his Department by way of conciliation; or to take no action. A meeting of Ministers on the previous day had been infavour of the first course; but, since the findings of an enquiry wouldbe binding on neither side, the Minister said that on reflection hewould prefer to make a direct offer of conciliation. By this means itmight be possible to devise some compromise for example, by offering the further increase claimed only to the highest grades of the skilled men or by the introduction of some form of bonus scheme.The offer should, in the Minister&apos;s view, be made as soon as possible after the unions had rejected arbitration, in order that time might notbe left for their attitude to harden.Discussion showed that there was general agreement that theGovernment could not properly refrain from action to avert a strikeover so relatively small an issue and that the course proposed by theMinister of Labour was the best of those considered. A final decision should not, however, be taken before the result of the further meeting between the Transport Commission and the unions was known; andthe announcement should not be made until after it had become known that the offer of arbitration had been refused.
