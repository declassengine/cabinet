Parliament.Control ofExpenditure.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 34thConclusions,Minute 7.)1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Home Secretary said that he had shortly to answer a parliamentary Question suggesting that an enquiry should be heldinto expenditure on political advertising between elections. TheCabinet agreed that this suggestion should be resisted.The Home Secretary said that, in connexion with the proceduralchanges designed to give increased Parliamentary control overGovernment expenditure, he proposed to seek an agreement withthe Opposition that more Supply Days should in future be devotedto the discussion of Departmental Estimates. The present tendencywas to use all Supply Days for debates on issues of current political interest.international monetary Fund.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 18thConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 102) on the question whether theUnited Kingdom should now assume the obligations of Article viii of the International Monetary Fund Agreement.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the staff of the Fundwere enquiring whether countries which had substantially removedtheir restrictions on trade and payments would now be ready toassume the obligations of Article VIII. We ourselves had madesubstantial progress towards eliminating the discriminatory restriction of imports, and we no longer claimed that our remaining restrictions were justified on balance of payments grounds. International controlof the remaining restrictions was entirely a matter for the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) and a move to Article VIIIwould not affect our ability to retain such restrictions. If we were tofind it necessary in the future to reimpose quantitative restrictions on imports, the Fund would be responsible for advising whether therewere sufficient balance of payments reasons for doing so, whether we remained under Article XIV or had moved to Article VIII. Inaddition, since sterling was now convertible, we should find greatdifficulty in obtaining the approval of the Fund for any discriminationwe wished to apply in imposing such restrictions, whether wehad moved to Article VIII or not. For these reasons a move to article VIII would be no more than a formal recognition of theexisting situation. The move would however underline the need forsterling area countries to manage their internal economies in a way which, in the view of the Fund, would avoid putting a strain on sterling.Germany, and also Belgium and Holland, were known to beready to move to Article VIII. An immediate move was unlikely sinceFrance would prefer some further delay before all the member countries of the European Economic Community made the movetogether. For our part, we should wish to proceed as slowly aspossible. But if the other countires principally concerned decided toaccept the obligations of Article VIII, it would be damaging to sterlingif we were to hold back. It was therefore recommended that we shouldbe ready to assume the obligations of Article VIII at an appropriate time in relation to similar moves by other important countries. Weshould however avoid any commitment which would preclude our ability to discriminate against the non-sterling area, in case it might be felt desirable, despite the obvious difficulties, to do this at some time inthe future.In discussion it was suggested that the main effect of moving fromArticle XIV to Article VIII was that the latter involved acceptance of specific obligations not to  discriminate in the application of
restrictions, except in circumstances where a currency had been formally declared scarce. It could be argued that the justification fordiscriminating against specific currencies had ceased when sterlingwas made externally convertible in December 1958. While it was truethat it would be difficult to justify discriminatory restrictions whether we moved to Article VIII or remained subject to Article XIV, there might be political arguments in favour of discrimination in certaincircumstances, for example in order to avoid restricting imports fromsterling Commonwealth countries.It was also suggested that the formal acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII would seem inconsistent with the recent measures to restrict demand, since these had been necessary, at least partly, forbalance of payments reasons. It would be misleading to act as though there were no balance of payments difficulties in prospect. On theother hand, it could be argued that a move to Article VIII did not imply that we expected in future to be free from balance of payments difficulties; it merely affirmed that, if such a situation arose, any action we took would have full regard to our international obligations andto the need to justify any restrictions to the Fund and to the G.A.T.T.The Prime Minister said that it was the general view of theCabinet that, since all the other countries principally concerned were unlikely to make an early move to Article VIII, it was unnecessary todecide in principle now that the United Kingdom should acceptsimilar obligations. If the other principal countries were to make sucha move it might well be desirable, for reasons of confidence, for theUnited Kingdom to take similar action. But that was a matter that could be left to be decided in the light of all the circumstances at thattime.The Cabinet Agreed to defer a decision on the question whether theUnited Kingdom should assume the obligations ofArticle VIII of the International Monetary Fund.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,7th July, 1960.
