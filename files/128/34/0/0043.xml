The Foreign Secretary said that the Prime Minister of the congo Republic, Mr. Lumumba, had threatened to accept an offer of military assistance by the Soviet Union unless the United Nationscalled on all Belgian forces to withdraw from the Congo within three days. The Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations,who was in the Congo, had rejected this ultimatum and had saidthat if the Soviet Union&apos;s offer were accepted, the United nations forces would be withdrawn. Although it was not likely thatMr. Lumumba would carry out his threat, the possibility of someSoviet intervention in the Congo could not be excluded. It remainedour aim to ensure that all aid to the Congo was channelledthrough the United Nations, but that the United Nations forcesdid not intervene in the Katanga as long as law and order were maintained there. It would be in our interests if the United Nationscould play some mediatory role in achieving a settlement between the congo Republican Government and the Katanga Government whichpreserved the provincial rights of Katanga and safeguarded Westerninterests in that area. It was satisfactory that the Prime Minister ofthe Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland had now made a statement that it was not possible in the constitutional circumstances for theFederation to meet the request of the provincial Premier of Katangafor military assistance.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Soviet Union.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 9thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Prime Minister said that he proposed later in the day to announce to Parliament the terms of the note which was to be presented to the Soviet Government rejecting the accusation that a united States aircraft, based in the United Kingdom, had violatedthe territory of the Soviet Union on 1st July and had in consequencebeen shot down over Soviet territorial waters. In addition to thisformal reply, he would also inform Parliament of the terms of a personal letter which he had sent to Mr. Khrushchev at the sametime, in which he expressed his anxiety about the way in which theworld situation was developing. He hoped that this message would show that, while the British people would not be separated fromtheir Allies by threats or propaganda, they sincerely desired a relaxation in world tension.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the PrimeMinister.government expenditure.(previous references:C.C. (60) 7thConclusions,Minute 4, andC.C. (59) 57thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 113) on estimates of government expenditure for the years 1961-62 and 1962-63.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the latest forecastsshowed that Government expenditure for 1961-62 would show anincrease of more than  200 millions over the current year, and thatthere would be a further increase of  100 millions in the following year. On a realistic assumption about pay rates, it would be wise to envisage additions to these increases of at least  50 millions for1961-62, and of  100 millions for 1962-63. The forecasts were basedon existing commitments, and took no account of a considerablenumber of substantial projects which would involve still further extra expenditure. If all these projects were accepted, supply expenditurein 1961-62 would be  381 millions more than in the current year an increase of 7-9 per cent.; and in 1962-63 there would be a further&quot;7660-2
increase of 3 -1 per cent. These figures would imply a significant increase, of approximately 7 per cent, over three years, in theproportion of supply expenditure to the gross national product.This development would cause most serious difficulties in regardboth to the possibility of further reductions in taxation and to themaintenance of confidence in sterling. It would also adversely affect our ability to devote more resources to productive industry in theprivate sector. In order to control the situation it would be necessaryto refrain from undertaking any new projects, of whatever size andhowever attractive, which entailed an increase in public expenditureunless room could be found by a reduction of existing commitments.In discussion it was generally accepted that there was urgent need to limit the prospective increase in supply expenditure. It hadto be borne in mind that the railway deficit would in future fall tobe included in Government current expenditure, and that there were many other commitments which would involve government expenditure below the line. It was, however, suggested that theassumption which had been made about the future rate of increasein the gross national product might be somewhat pessimistic. Therecent increase in production had greatly exceeded the averagepost-war rate. While there might not be as much scope for anincrease in the rate of productivity as large as could be expected in under-developed countries the amount of industrial investment inrecent years, together with rapid technological developments in industry, should provide room for an appreciable increase in productivity over the next few years. In this connexion it was pointedout that our industrial investment overseas often did not yield earlyresults. But while increasing investment at home was very desirable,there would be great political difficulty in diverting oversea investmentto this purpose.The Prime Minister said that it would undoubtedly be necessaryto examine strictly any proposals which involved additional public expenditure. Large reductions in expenditure could only be securedthrough major policy decisions. He would in any case call on all departmental Ministers to scrutinise their Estimates critically, witha view to reducing expenditure wherever possible.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C. (60) 113.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would call on all departmental Ministers to scrutinise their Estimates witha view to reducing expenditure wherever possible.road programme.OPreviousReference:C.C. (60) 25thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 115) about the road programme for the next five years.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that, at their meetingon 11th April, the Cabinet had agreed that expenditure on roads inthe current year should not exceed the level already approved andthat further consideration should be given to the long-term road programme in relation to projected Government expenditure in1961-62 and subsequent years. The Economic Policy Committeehad now concluded that while, as a general rule, road building shouldbe planned on the basis of a five-year programme, uncertainty aboutthe future level of investment required in the railways made itnecessary that only interim decisions should be taken on certain parts of the road programme. Taking into account other claims for investment in the public sector, the Committee recommendedthat, for planning purposes, Government expenditure on classifiedroads (which were mainly in urban areas) should be fixed at  150millions over five years in England and Wales and  3.1 millions over five years in Scotland.  Expenditure on through roads should

(60) 112) on the public investment(Previous        programme in the years 1961-62 and 1962-63.C.C. (59) 47th        The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, with the agreementConclusions,    Qf his colleagues, he had recently announced in Parliament, that minute 4.)      investment in the public sector in 1961-62 would be held at the levelof the programme for the current financial year, namely,  1,730millions. Proposals for 1961-62 amounted in total to  1,760 millions,so that it would be necessary to effect a reduction of  30 millions,x   Of this,  20 millions could be found by reductions in a number of be fixed for two years only. In England and Wales it should be 75 millions on motorways and  44 millions on trunk roads. InScotland it should be fixed for two years at a rate which wouldnot commit the Government to a total expenditure of more than 29 millions over five years on through routes.The Minister of Transport said that proposals by local authorities for classified roads (for which they were responsible, subject to theirobtaining a 75 per cent, grant) amounted to some  200 millions over five years. He had felt able to scale this down to  170 millions.While, in view of other claims for Government investment, he wasobliged for the time being to accept the view of the Economic PolicyCommittee that the figure should not exceed  150 millions, he might find it necessary to raise the question again at a later stage. Fortrunk roads the planning period could, as recommended by theCommittee, be limited to two years. But for motorways, which involved the construction of viaducts and other major engineeringworks in addition to the roadways themselves, planning on the basisof five years was essential.In discussion the Cabinet generally endorsed the conclusions ofthe Economic Policy Committee. It was, however, agreed that formotorways a five-year planning period was required. For planning purposes, therefore, the agreed figure of expenditure should beadopted for the first two years of the programme and commitmentsmight be entered into for expenditure during the succeeding threeyears at an annual level equivalent to the average of the first twoyears. The possibility of increasing the level of expenditure in the later years should be reconsidered in the following autumn, whenthe Governments commitments on investment in the railways couldbe more accurately assessed.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that in England and Wales Government expenditureon motorways should be not more than a total of  75millions in 1961-62 and 1962-63 and that subject to review in the light of Government commitments on investment in the railways in the succeeding three years it should not exceed  37^ millions a year.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Scotland, to determine the levelof Government expenditure on through routes inScotland on the same basis as in England and Wales.(3) Took note that the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister of Transport would, if necessary, bring beforethem again the question of Government expenditure onclassified roads.(4) Subject to Conclusions (1), (2) and (3), approved theproposals in C. (60) 115.
investment programmes already agreed between Departments, leaving 10 millions to be found from the small programmes of the centralGovernment and local authorities and from the programmes forroads and the British Transport Commission.For 1962-63 the proposals for public investment amounted to 1,790 millions. It was not yet possible to decide what increase,if any, for that year over the current year&apos;s level could be accepted.It was therefore proposed that within the figure put forward for eachprogramme a minimum should be determined for provisional approval before the end of the current year, on the understandingthat there would then be no question of subsequent reduction save in the most exceptional circumstances and that the balance wouldbe carried out if circumstances permitted. Officials might be askedto submit in the autumn a report on the details of a total programme on this basis.He had undertaken to publish later in the year a White paper on investment in the public sector. This would show the provisionalout-turn for 1959-60 and the programmes for 1960^61 and 1961-62.It would be for later consideration whether the programmeprovisionally approved for 1962-63 should also be included.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were prepared to approvethese proposals in principle. The methods by which the reductionof  30 millions should be achieved in 1961-62 required, however,some further consideration and the following points were made:(a) The proportionate reduction proposed in C. (60) 112 in thesmall programmes was approximately twice that in the total programme (in which they were included). The primary reason forthis was that the rate of increase in these small programmes had, inthe last few years, been relatively greater than in the total programme.There would be no objection in principle to adjusting the reductionsso as to bear less hardly on the small programmes.(b) In particular the reduction proposed in the programmes ofthe coal and power industries was only  4 millions out of a totalof  468 millions. While these industries were obliged to enter intocontracts affecting the level of expenditure for some years ahead,it was unlikely that their commitments were so firm as to make itimpossible to achieve a somewhat larger reduction in their investment.(c) The Transport Commission had put forward a programmeof  240 millions, but they could probably be brought to accept areduction to  200 millions. The increase in expenditure on roadsapproved by the Cabinet earlier in their meeting that day would,however, necessitate some further reduction below that figure. Ifthis proved impossible without cancellation of contracts entered intoby the Commission, the compensating reduction would have to befound elsewhere in the total programme.(d) It would probably be preferable that figures for 1962-63should not be included in the proposed White Paper.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that total investment in the public sector in 1961-62should not exceed  1,730 millions.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer:1,(i) to arrange for officials to report on the programme for 1962-63 on the lines proposed in C. (60) 112;(ii) in consultation with the other Ministers concerned,to give further consideration to the other proposals in C. (60) 1.12 in the light of their discussion;(iii) to circulate in due course a draft of the proposed white Paper on investment in the public sector.
Opening ofParliament.(previous reference:CC. (58) 66thConclusions,Minute 3.)TelevisionFacilities andColour Film.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (60) 114) about the television or colour filming of thenext State Opening of Parliament.The Home Secretary said that the British broadcasting corporation had applied for permission to televise the State Openingof the next session of Parliament. The Home Affairs Committee,whose view was that the State Opening should be televised not morethan once in each Parliament, had concluded that in the present parliament it would, for a number of reasons be preferable to defer the broadcast until a later session. Meanwhile, however, theproduction of a colour film of the State Opening would be ofconsiderable value overseas. Tests had been carried out which indicated that the making of a colour film would be practicablewithout an intensity of lighting such as would cause discomfort tothe Queen, and the Lord Great Chamberlain was willing to agreeto this project. Consultation with the Governments supporters inParliament and with the Opposition would be necessary, in particular on the extent to which the film should include Black Rod&apos;s summonsto the House of Commons and the Commons&apos; procession. In theHome Secretary&apos;s view, the scope of the film should not exceed thatof the television broadcast in 1958 and that part of it which dealtwith the Queen&apos;s speech should be subject to editing by the LordGreat Chamberlain in consultation with himself.In discussion the Cabinet agreed that the application of theBritish Broadcasting Corporation should on this occasion be refusedand that two colour films of the next State Opening should be made one by the Central Office of Information and one by a newsreelcompany, from which some revenue would be derived.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the State Opening of the 1960-61 session ofParliament should not be televised.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to undertake appropriateParliamentary consultations on the making of colourfilms of the ceremony.(3) Agreed that, subject to the concurrence of the Queen andto the consultations referred to in Conclusion (2), twocolour films should be made of the next State Openingof Parliament.Muscat andOman.(previous reference:CC. (58) 44thConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C. (60) 104) about the extent of the assistanceto be given to the Sultan of Muscat and Oman.The Foreign Secretary said that the cost of giving the Sultancertain civil and military assistance in order to strengthen his armed forces and to improve the loyalty of his people now amounted to nearly  700,000 a year, instead of  390,000 a year as estimated whenthe policy had been adopted in 1958. Moreover, a review of thesituation in the Sultanate had shown that the existing measures were inadequate, and that considerably increased expenditure, amountingto about  1,350,000 a year (with the addition of  1,565,000 capitalexpenditure spread over three years) would be necessary if we wereto ensure the success of the policies we had adopted after the Omanirebellion had been suppressed in 1957.British interests in the Persian Gulf were as important as ever,and included the preservation of the independence of Kuwait, theretention of military facilities, such as those at Masirah and Sharjah,and access to possible new oil resources in the Gulf. There was stillCC. 43 (60)

The Home Secretary said that authority, had been given forthe transport of food and fuel oil by naval vessels to the Western Isles,where there were shortages due to the unofficial strike of merchant seamen. A request had been received from the Northern ireland government for assistance in the provision of cross-Channel services,because of the effect of the strike on the country&apos;s tourist industryand general economy. In view, however, of the danger of spreading the strike, this request had had to be refused.The Minister of Labour said that the National Union of Seamenwere likely that day to order the strikers back to work. If this provedineffective, the Maritime Board, which represented both the employersand the unions, would be ready to make special arrangements toman the ships required for essential services.. The Cabinet Took note with approval of these statements.some risk of a further rebellion in Oman, supported by Saudi arabia and other Arab States. It would be particularly important in present international circumstances to avoid open intervention; and, althoughother courses had been carefully examined, there seemed no practicable alternative but to give the Sultan support on theincreased scale which was now thought necessary having regard tothe importance of our interests in the area.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that while it might bepossible to contemplate some modest increase in current expenditure to provide the Sultan with sufficient assistance to maintain hisposition, the increases now recommended appeared far too large.The general increase in expenditure overseas was alarming in viewof the balance of payments prospects.In discussion it was suggested that it would not be unreasonable to seek a substantial contribution from the Sultan himself towardsmilitary and civil measures which were in his own interests. in examining the extent to which current assistance to the Sultan mightbe increased, it would be useful to consider what forms of assistance would be most likely to secure some commercial return for UnitedKingdom interests.The Prime Minister said that the question of the scale ofassistance to the Sultan required further detailed examination. Itwould be necessary to consider, having regard to the importance ofour interests in the area, to what extent it would be prudent toincrease this assistance, what form such assistance should take, andwhether some future commercial benefit might be derived from it.For this purpose he would invite the Paymaster-General to act as chairman of a small Committee of Ministers from the ForeignOffice, the Treasury, the Colonial Office and the War Office.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would appoint aCommittee of Ministers representing the Foreign Office,Treasury, Colonial Office and War Office, under theChairmanship of the Paymaster-General, to consider thequestion of assistance to the Sultan of Muscat and Oman.
