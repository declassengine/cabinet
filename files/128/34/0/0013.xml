(60) 12thConclusions,Minute 4.)The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the PrimeMinister.House ofCommons(previous reference :CC. (60) 5thConclusions,Minute. 5.)2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Works (C. (60) 15.) on the provision of temporary accommodationAccommodation for Members of Parliament,of Members.The Minister of Works recalled that he had been invited by theCabinet to consider the relative merits of a temporary building inStar Chamber Court and the adaptation of premises now occupiedby the St. Stephen&apos;s Club as a means of temporarily meeting the urgent need for more accommodation for Members. Longer-termplans, such as a new building on the Bridge Street site or in NewPalace Yard, could not help the immediate need. In his view, theadvantage clearly lay with a temporary building in the Star ChamberCourt. Technically this would present far less difficulty than the adaptation of the St. Stephen&apos;s Club, which might not in any eventbecome available. Moreover, the adaptation of the Club premiseswould be of no value when the whole of the Bridge Street site was cleared for redevelopment.Discussion showed general agreement with the Ministersproposal. It was, however, considered that further consideration should be given to the type of accommodation to be provided whether in the form of cubicles or small rooms or by way of individual desks in larger rooms.In further discussion the Cabinet were informed that a debate on accommodation for Members was likely to take place before theend of the following month.  The Opposition would press that the* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET*1. The Prime Minister said that since the Cabinet meetingon 23rd February he had considered further, in consultation withthe Colonial Secretary and some of his other colleagues, the difficulties involved in accepting the view of the Governments of the federation and of Southern Rhodesia that Dr. Banda should not be released fromdetention until after the Monckton Commission had left Nyasaland.In. the light of these consultations and after telephone conversations with the Commonwealth Secretary, the latter had now put forward to the Governments of the Federation and of Southern Rhodesia a compromise proposal by which Dr. Banda would be released in nyasaland shortly before the Monckton Commission completed their work there. This arrangement would have the effect thatAfricans who favoured Federation would be free to give evidence tothe Commission, without fear of intimidation, before Dr. Bandawas released, and that Dr. Banda and his friends would have anopportunity to give evidence in Nyasaland, if they chose, after his release. It was now understood that the Governments of theFederation and of Southern Rhodesia would be prepared, withreluctance, to accept an arrangement on these lines. It would go some way towards meeting their apprehensions about the securityrisk involved in releasing Dr. Banda. At the same time it would preserve the principle, to which the United Kingdom government attached great importance, that Dr. Banda should be released at such atime as to make it possible for him, if he wished, to give evidence to theMonckton Commission in Nyasaland as a free man.The Commonwealth Secretary was returning to this countryto make a full report to the Cabinet.
3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (60) 30) about a proposal that the proceedings of theHouse of Commons should be televised.The Home Secretary said that the Home Affairs Committee had considered that this proposal should be resisted on the ground thatit would inevitably lead to distortion of the conduct and characterof debates and was likely to bring the forms of parliamentary government into discredit. A technical report had been obtainedfrom the British Broadcasting Corporation on the facilities whichwould be required in the Chamber: from this it appeared that,although not wholly intolerable, the necessary facilities would at best be very inconvenient to Members. The Home Secretary hadtaken certain soundings on both sides of the House and was satisfiedthat the great majority of Members regarded the proposal withdisfavour. He therefore suggested that, in reply to a parliamentary question in the following week, the Prime Minister should reject the proposal.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that, although the televising of Parliamentary proceedings in some form had some attractions, the objections to it were, atleast for the present, decisive. It might be that the technical difficulties had been overestimated. Some of the objections might be met bythe broadcasting of a condensed version of the proceedings preparedfrom a film. But this again would not command enough support in the House, and it would raise delicate problems of editing. Therewould be no objection to a debate on the subject if that were sought by the Opposition, but any demand for the presentation of a white paper or the appointment of a Select Committee should be resisted.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that hewould set out in his statement some of the objections to the proposal and refer to the lack of sufficient support for so radical a departure from tradition. He thought it preferable, however, not to preclude the possible introduction of televising Parliamentary proceedings atsome future date.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would make a statementresisting the televising of Parliamentary proceedings onthe lines he had indicated in their discussion.House ofCommons.Televising of proceedings.(previous reference :C.C. (60) 10thConclusions,Minute 1.)Representationof the Vaticanin the UnitedKingdom.(previous reference :C.C. (59) 2ndConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (60) 31) about the representation of the Vatican inthis country.The Foreign Secretary recalled that in the previous year theCabinet had concluded that the balance of advantage was againstaccepting an Internuncio, with the rank of Minister, as the diplomaticrepresentative of the Vatican. It was appropriate to consider thisquestion again, in view of the visits which were shortly to be madeLord Great Chamberlain should be relieved of his control over the palace of Westminster. This suggestion should, at least at the present stage, be resisted. It would be possible to announce in the debate that it was proposed to provide temporary accommodation in theStar Chamber Court and that application had been made for the designation of the Bridge Street site for Government purposes.The Cabinet Approved the proposal in C. (60) 15 to erect a temporarybuilding in Star Chamber Court.
Resale Price 5.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the PresidentMaintenance.   0f the Board of Trade (G. (60) 26) and the Paymaster-General(C. (60) 33) on the question of resale price maintenance.The President of the Board of Trade said that, while section 24of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1956, prohibited the collectiveenforcement of resale price maintenance, section 25 of that Actempowered individual suppliers to enforce resale price maintenanceconditions relating to their own goods against anyone who acquiredthe goods for resale if he had received due notice of the conditions.There was considerable criticism of this provision, particularly in thelight of the Governments appeal for lower prices and the experience in a number of trades, especially the food trade, of the benefit to consumers from price reductions which some retailers were willingto make. Moreover, the present law put certain retailers at a disadvantage in competing with the Co-operatives. On the otherhand, resale price maintenance was strongly supported by somemanufacturers, notably the makers of branded textiles, and also bysmall shopkeepers and by shop workers. To end the enforcement ofresale price maintenance might accelerate the disappearance of many small retailers and wholesalers.It would not be practicable to announce that the Governmenthad decided to take no action in this matter on the ground that itwas too early to judge the effects of the 1956 Act. Equally it wouldbe unwise to bring resale price maintenance to an end without giving a full hearing to those who believed that their interests depended on it.It would therefore be best to hold an enquiry, in order to provide more detailed information about the extent and effects of the enforcement of resale price maintenance.  Such an enquiry might beC.C. 13 (60)to Rome by the Prime Minister and himself, and later by the Queen.He recognised that there were certain objections to the proposal but his own view was that we could derive diplomatic advantage -fromaccepting representation of the Vatican and, on balance, he was inclined to favour accepting an Internuncio.Discussion showed that opinion in the Cabinet was divided onthis issue. It was suggested that acceptance of an Internuncio wouldbe likely to revive unfortunate interdenominational conflicts whichwere tending to die out, and that it would provoke considerable opposition in Wales and Scotland and, more especially, in NorthernIreland. On the other hand, the Pope was already represented inthis country by an Apostolic Delegate, and the distinction between an Apostolic Delegate and an Internuncio was unlikely to be widelyappreciated. It might be, therefore, that the fear of diverse reactionswas exaggerated. If diplomatic representation of the Vatican wasto be accepted, the present was an opportune time for this step.But, if the proposals were to be pursued, there should be consultationwith the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Moderator of the church of Scotland and the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland before afinal decision were taken.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that opinion in the Cabinet was so equally balanced that it would be preferable to defer a decision. If, however, it were later decided to accept anInternuncio, the change should not be made or announced at anytime near that of the Queen&apos;s visit to Rome.The Cabinet- Decided to defer a decision on diplomatic representation ofthe Vatican in the United Kingdom.
