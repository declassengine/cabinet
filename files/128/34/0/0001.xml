Middle East.Kuwait.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 61stConclusions,Minute 9.)1. The Foreign Secretary said that it had now become evidentthat the Ruler of Kuwait was envisaging a more rapid timetable forthe reduction of United Kingdom jurisdiction in Kuwait. He wishedto be able to announce a substantial transfer of civil jurisdiction not later than the tenth anniversary of his accession to power, on25th February, 1960. We should be able to retain certain safeguardsand there was at present no question of transferring criminal jurisdiction; but, if we were to retain the Ruler&apos;s confidence, it wouldbe necessary to meet his wishes for an acceleration of the programme.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.East African 2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ColonialLand Forces.    Secretary (C. (60) 1) on the future of the East African Land Forces.The Colonial Secretary said that in 1957 it had been decided thatadministrative and financial responsibility for the East African land forces (E.A.L.F.) should be transferred from the War Office to thelocal Governments. It was now evident that constitutional development must proceed less rapidly in Kenya than in the other two East African territories. In these circumstances there would bemilitary and administrative advantage in our resuming control of thelocal forces; and he proposed that the United Kingdom Governmentshould assume administrative and financial responsibility for E.A.L.F.from 1st July, 1960. As a matter of principle it might be thought that local contributions should be sought from the Colonial territoriestowards the cost of these forces, but he would prefer to have authoritynot to insist on any such contribution if it appeared that a concession on this point would help to secure a successful outcome of theforthcoming conference on the constitutional development of Kenya.In presentation, neither the political nor the financial aspect of his proposals need be stressed; they could be represented as animprovement in the organisation of the local forces. In fact, thefinancial assistance they would provide might have a decisive effecton the conference, since it would be recognised that our proposals would enable the local Governments to apply additional resources to more constructive purposes, such as the development of agricultureand education.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would like to have further time to consider the financial implications of these proposals.The resumption of responsibility for these local forces seemed to be contrary to the policy normally applied in territories moving towardsindependence. If there were to be no local contributions, we shouldbe committed to expenditure of some  3 millions a year. Moreover,this transfer might be regarded as establishing the principle of UnitedKingdom support for the local forces of other Colonies moving towards independence.The Cabinefs subsequent discussion centred mainly on thepolitical issues involved in this proposal. The following points weremade:(a) The measures now suggested would (however they were presented) seem to be a reversal of the policy adopted in 1957. Ourresumption of full control of E.A.L.F. might be justified if it couldbe shown to be part of a general plan under which Colonies emergingtowards independence would be guided towards accepting a continuing measure of United Kingdom authority; it would, however,be more difficult to defend in relation to territories moving relativelyquickly towards complete independence.SECRET56650-1 B 2
(b) The movement towards independence was likely to proceedmore slowly in Kenya than in Tanganyika or Uganda. In thesecircumstances there might be differences of opinion in the locallegislatures about the continuance of financial support for E.A.L.F.On the other hand, even if financial responsibility were assumed bythe United Kingdom it might, on political grounds, be difficult tomaintain a composite force indefinitely. It was possible that local political opinion would become hostile to the continued recruitment of African troops if they were under British control.(c) It would be useful to know whether leading Africanpersonalities in the three territories were likely to regard the financialattractions of the scheme as outweighing any political disadvantages.In Tanganyika and Uganda especially, the alternative to the resumption of United Kingdom control might be that opposition to expenditure on the forces would develop in the local legislatures. Inthat event the Governors would have to exercise their reserved powersto provide the necessary financial support for E.A.L.F.; and measuresof this kind, taken in an emergency, might lend support to the viewthat the United Kingdom Government were adopting a reactionarypolicy.Summing up the discussion, The Prime Minister said that theChancellor of the Exchequer should have an opportunity for furtherconsideration of the financial implications of this proposal. the cabinet&apos;s discussion had, however, suggested that its political aspectswere even more important than its financial and administrativeaspects. While it would have the advantage of removing controlof E.A.L.F. from discussion in the local legislature, it could be presented as a reversal of the policy which we normally adopted whenColonial territories were moving towards independence. The weight to be attached to these opposing political considerations should determine the decision to be taken on the proposal and he suggestedthat the Cabinet should resume their consideration of the matter inthe following week.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would give further consideration to the financial consequences of theproposal outlined in C. (60) 1.(2) Agreed to resume their consideration of this proposal at ameeting in the following week.Law of the Sea.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 61stConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C. (59) 192) on the preparations for the next Conferenceon the Law of the Sea.The Lord Chancellor said that our fundamental objective was toensure that the territorial sea should not be extended beyond six miles.At the same time we wished to preserve, so far as possible, our fishing rights in the outer six-mile zone. In deciding the policy and tacticsto be adopted at the Conference in March, and in preparations beforethem, we should consider whether, and if so at what stage, it mightbe necessary to relinquish fishing rights in the outer six-mile zone inorder to secure sufficient support for a six-mile territorial sea. Therewere two possible alternatives. We could actively support theformula (which we had, in confidence, indicated to the United Stateswe should be prepared to accept) of a six-mile territorial sea with theretention for a specific period of historic fishing rights in the outersix-mile zone (&quot; six plus phased-out six &quot;). Or we could at once adoptthe Canadian position and work for a formula of six miles territorial sea and a further six miles of exclusive fishing rights (&quot; six plus plainsix &quot;). It had been the general view of the Ministerial Committee onthe Law of the Sea that at an early stage of the Conference we should
try to secure acceptance of the &quot; six plus phased-out six &quot; solutionand that we should forthwith join with the United States in canvassingsupport for it. There were some indications that the Americans were making progress with the Latin American States on this basis. But,if this solution were rejected by the Conference there was a risk that proposals for a twelve-mile territorial sea might then be adopted.The majority of the Committee had therefore felt that we should,before the Conference, also ask our friends in Western Europe andthe Commonwealth whether in order to avoid a twelve-mile territorial sea they would be prepared ultimately to accept the Canadian formulaof &quot; six plus plain six &quot;. If so, we should then, if necessary, be ableto table this proposal at a late stage of the Conference in theknowledge that it would have substantial support.The Minister of Agriculture suggested that it would be premature to consider the &quot; six plus plain six &quot; solution until support for the&quot; six plus phased-out six &quot; proposal had been fully canvassed. Anydisclosure at this stage of our willingness ultimately to support &quot; sixplus plain six &quot; would prejudice the chances of success with &quot; six plusphased-out six&quot;, which was a solution that would presentconsiderably less serious problems for the United Kingdom fishing industry. Moreover, there was no definite indication that &quot; six plusplain six &quot; would command more support at the Conference than&quot; six plus phased-out six &quot;. He would therefore prefer that ourcanvassing should be limited at present to the latter solution.In discussion the Cabinet recognised that prolonged divisions ofopinion between the countries opposed to a twelve-mile territorial sea might have dangerous consequences. Even if proposals for atwelve-mile limit obtained only a simple majority at the Conference,their application by any country might be upheld by the international court. On the other hand, our active support for &quot; six plus plainsix &quot; at this stage would inevitably compromise the more favourable position we had obtained under our current agreements for fishingoff the Faroes, North Norway and Greenland.Summing up the discussion, The Prime Minister said that wemust be prepared, if necessary, eventually to accept the &quot; six plusplain six &quot; solution, but the gradual phasing out of our historic fishing rights in the outer six-mile zone would be less disadvantageous to theUnited Kingdom fishing industry. For the time being, therefore, weshould continue to encourage the United States in advocating this solution and should consider whether any further steps could be takento obtain additional support for it. If, however, the outcome of thepresent discussions between the United States and the Latin american countries suggested that sufficient support for the United states proposals would not be forthcoming at the Conference, it would benecessary to reconsider our position and tactics before the opening ofthe Conference.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of C. (59) 192.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for the ministerial committee on the Law of the Sea to make preparations for the forthcoming Conference on the lines indicated bythe Prime Minister.Europe.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 63rdConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that,for the purpose of discussing developments in European economic relations, there was to be in the following week a series of meetings ofthe European Free Trade Association (E.F.T. A.), of the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) and of a new economicgroup comprising all the members of the European Economic
Community (E.E.C.) (except Luxembourg), all members of theE.F.T.A. (except Norway and Austria), the European economic commission, Greece, the United States and Canada. In these discussions our primary objective must be to safeguard and strengthen the E.F.T.A. We should welcome increased participation by theUnited States and Canada in European economic organisations; butwe must ensure that, if the O.E.E.C were to be dismantled (whichmight be regarded as among the objects of French policy), this mustnot happen until some effective organisation had been designed totake its place. The United States had put forward a proposal that asmall number of independent advisers might be appointed to make recommendations on the re-organisation of O.E.E.C. We should oppose such a procedure, on the ground that reform of this organisation ought not to be entrusted to people who would not be acting as representatives of Governments.In discussion there was general agreement with these views. Thefunctions of the new economic group would be to deal both with commercial relations between the different European economicregional organisations and between those organisations and othercountries, and also with aid to the less developed countries of theworld. We must aim to secure that its first concern was to work towards some form of association between the E.F.T.A. and theE.E.C. Indeed, agreement to establish such an association must beregarded as a condition of our agreeing to provide aid on an increasedscale for less developed countries. The objectives of United states policy appeared to be to secure a reduction in European tariffs andan increased contribution from European countries towards aid forthe less developed. These aims were not incompatible with our own interests, more especially if there were no derogation from thefunctions of the International Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment and similar institutions; but the conception of associating the E.F.T.A. and E.E.C. and developing them into some form of Atlantic community which would include both the UnitedStates and Canada was dangerous in that the European countries would not be able to reduce tariffs until the United States were willingto reduce theirs.Summing up the discussion, The Prime Minister said that ourprimary objective must be to consolidate and vitalise the E.F.T.A.and that for this purpose we should consider how best to develop itsinternal institutions and common policies. We must seek to convince the United States that the creation of the E.F.T.A. was in the general interest and that any attempt to bring it to an end would have serious consequences for Europe. At the same time we must keep alive theoriginal concept of a European free trade area. With these objectsin view we should attempt, in the negotiations in the following week,to establish some procedural machinery for considering futujredevelopments, although there might be advantage in securing that this did not work too fast.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to be guided in theforthcoming negotiations on future European economic relations by the considerations put forward in the cabinets discussion.Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 61stConclusionsMinute 3.)NyasalandEmergency.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the colonial secretary on the Nyasaland emergency (C. (59) 191).The Colonial Secretary said that there were at present416 Nyasaland detainees. He felt that the programme proposed bythe Governor for their release over the first six months of 1960 was too slow, though it represented twice the release rate originallysuggested.  There were no rehabilitation problems in Nyasaland
6. The President of the Board of Trade said that, in order toprotect the jute industry in Dundee against competition from Indiaand Pakistan, all purchases of jute yarn, cloth and bags from thosecountries were handled by the Jute Control, who resold them at ageneral mark-up over the landed price. This mark-up had, in 1957,been reduced from 40 per cent, to 30 per cent, and both the indian government and the manufacturers of jute bags in the Unitedcomparable to those of the Mau Mau in Kenya and, after taking account of the security risks involved, he now recommended a monthly release rate of 120 detainees from January to April, leaving a hard core of about 12. He thought that the end of the emergencycould be announced at the end of February, to become effective inMarch when special powers would have to be provided, comparable to those in Kenya, for the continued detention of the hard core. he did not think that Dr. Banda should be detained as part of the hardcore and an appropriate date for his release might be in March, whenhis detention would be due for a normal periodical review.There was general agreement that it would be desirable forNyasaland detainees to be released in accordance with the colonial secretary&apos;s revised programme. Discussion then turned to theproblem of Dr. Banda&apos;s release and the following points were made:(a) Dr. Banda had been detained by order of the Governor of nyasaland but, as a prisoner, he was under the control of theGovernment of the Federation. It would be desirable, if possible,for arrangements to be made with the Federal authorities under which Dr.. Banda (so long as he remained in detention) could receive visitsfrom persons approved by the Governor of Nyasaland.(b) The Governor considered that Dr. Banda should not be released until after the Monckton Commission had left Nyasaland.The Commission were, however, expected to be in Nyasaland from march until about the middle of May and under the general releaseprogramme now envisaged it would not be practicable to detainDr. Banda until the latter date.(c) Public opinion in the United Kingdom was likely to become increasingly critical of Dr. Banda&apos;s continued detention. when parliament reassembled at the end of January the attitude of some government supporters on this question might be uncertain. Onthe other hand, the Governor and the Federal authorities would consider that Dr. Banda&apos;s release would increase the risks of publicdisturbance in Nyasaland.Summing up the discussion, The Prime Minister said that theGovernor should be informed of the Cabinefs wish to accelerate therate of release of Nyasaland detainees and his concurrence should besought for the release programme proposed by the Colonial Secretary.The Governor should also be informed that the Prime Minister would discuss the date of Dr. Banda&apos;s release during his forthcoming visit to Africa.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Colonial Secretary to arrange for Nyasalanddetainees, except for a hard core of about 12, to be released from January to April 1960 at the rate of 120 amonth subject to the continued maintenance of public security in Nyasaland.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to inform the Governor of nyasaland of the arrangements envisaged in their discussion for the release of Dr. Banda from detention.
Kingdom were pressing for a further reduction. The Presidentproposed that the mark-up should now be reduced to 20 per cent.,which would satisfy this demand, at least for the time being, withoutthrowing too great a strain on the economy of Dundee.In discussion it was recognised that in Dundee the proposed reduction would inevitably raise the number of unemployed, whichhad recently been brought down through the establishment of a wider range of industries in the area. On the other hand, the indefiniteprotection of the Dundee jute industry could not be justified on general economic grounds and there were no compelling arguments for resisting the pressure to reduce the measure of protection currentlyafforded to it. The balance of opinion in the Cabinet was therefore in favour of the Presidents proposal.The Cabinet Approved the proposal that the general mark-up on goods imported by the Jute Control should be reduced from 30 percent, to 20 per cent.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,5th January, 1960.
