CC. 27 (60)Parliament. 1.  The Cabinet discussed the handling of the debate in theHouse of Commons on 27th April on the Censure Motion relatingto the Governments decision to abandon the development of blue streak as a military weapon. It was important that the opposition should not evade their responsibility for seeking to avoid a wide-ranging debate on this question. It should be left to them to move the closure of the debate, if they wished to do so.The Cabinet agreed that it would be preferable that the Houseof Commons should not sit on the day of the wedding of H.R.H. the princess Margaret.ForeignAffairs.Disarmament.(previous reference:CC. (60) 20thConclusions,Minute 6.)Europe.(previous reference:CC. (60) 2ndConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the Conference on general disarment had so far made little progress. He hoped, however,that papers defining the Western position would be tabled shortly.These would put the Western Powers in a better posture for their discussion of this problem at the Summit Meeting. The conference would be adjourned before that Meeting began.The Conference on Nuclear Tests would however continueduring the Summit Meeting. In recent weeks progress had beenslow; but it was still hoped that it would be possible to identify the major outstanding questions which might be settled at the summit Meeting.The Foreign Secretary said that during his recent visit to washington it had been strongly represented -to him that theUnited Kingdom Government had not produced convincing proof that their economic interests would be seriously damaged by theimmediate tariff changes which were contemplated by the countries of the Common Market. The United States authorities had madea careful analysis of the probable effects on their economic interests,and had come to the conclusion that these would not be serious.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was not easy to forecast precisely the net effects which these&apos; changes would have on United Kingdom trade. He hoped, however, to be able toarrange for French and British officials to try to work out an agreed statement on this point.The Prime Minister said that it would be helpful if such an agreed statement could be prepared.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements by the Foreign Secretary.aircraft industry.(previous reference:CC. (60) 20thConclusions,Minute 4.)european co-operation.3. The Minister of Aviation said that during his recent visits to Paris and Bonn he had held promising discussions about thepossibility of co-operation between the aircraft industries of France,Germany and the United Kingdom. Projects for the jointdevelopment of a vertical-take-off military aircraft and of electronicequipment for air defence were to be considered; and other membersof the North Atlantic Alliance might be willing to join in these projects at a later stage. Both the French Prime Minister and theFederal Chancellor had also shown interest in the possibility ofco-operation in a space research programme if we decided to adaptBLUE STREAK as a space-satellite launcher. There was at present no European interest in the joint development of a long-distancesupersonic transport aircraft: this was probably a field . forco-operation with the United States. -The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Aviation.
Civil ^ 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theAviation. Minister of Aviation (C. (60) 7.1) reporting the progress made by(Previous officials in their discussion of the plan for an internationalReference: organisation, to be known as &quot; euro control &quot;, for the control ofC.C. (59) 55th movement of jet aircraft over Western Europe at heights above conclusions, 2q ,000 ftMinute 4.)European Air The Minister of Aviation said that agreement should shortlyTraffic Control, be reached on a Protocol and on a Convention which he hoped tobe able to approve for submission to a conference of the Governmentsconcerned later in the year.Discussion showed that there was general support for theproposals of the Minister of Aviation, subject to agreement being reached on certain amendments of the Convention to meet military requirements and on the understanding that further consideration would be given to the possibility of imposing charges on operatorsat a later stage. The &quot; euro control &quot; project would be a useful link between the Common Market and the countries of the european free Trade Association, and it was possible that Switzerland andthe Scandinavian countries would eventually join the system. Thelegislation required to permit the control of aircraft over the UnitedKingdom by the new agency need not be introduced during thepresent session.The Cabinet Approved the proposals set out in C. (60) 71, subject tothe satisfactory outcome of negotiations on military requirements and on the financial conditions ultimately tobe adopted for &quot; euro control &quot;.House ofCommons.(previous reference :C.C. (60) 19thConclusions,Minute 4.)Members&apos;Fund.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (60) 69) on the powers of investment of the trustees of the House of Commons Members&apos; Fund.The Home Secretary said that the Government had undertaken to introduce legislation in the following session to extend the investment powers of trustees. Meanwhile, the trustees of theMembers&apos; Fund were pressing for earlier legislation which would give them wider powers than those contemplated for trustees generally.While there were obvious objections to this, refusal might revivedemands for pensions for Members of Parliament or for an increasein the Exchequer contribution to the Fund.Discussion showed that the balance of opinion in the cabinet was that the Government should not take the initiative in introducing legislation for the benefit of Members and their dependants inadvance of that designed to improve the position of the beneficiariesof trusts generally. It was also argued that, in the present state ofthe market, it might be prudent for the Trustees to avoid wideningthe range of their investments. An attempt should therefore be madeto persuade them to await the general legislation already announced by the Government.The Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary, in conjunction with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to inform the Trustees ofthe House of Commons Members&apos; Fund that, in the viewof the Government, it would be inexpedient to extend their investment powers in advance of the legislationapplicable to Trustees generally.
7*. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there were indications that bank advances were continuing to rise. He was satisfied that it would be salutary if some modest checks were nowapplied to discourage further economic expansion. He therefore proposed to bring into operation, on a modest scale, the specialdeposits scheme which he had explained to the Cabinet wheninforming them of the content of his Budget statement. This wouldbe accompanied by the re-introduction of a mild degree of controlover hire-purchase transactions.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 70) on the salaries of non-medical university staff.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Wages PolicyCommittee had recently decided that the Government should accepta recommendation of the University Grants Committee that certain increases should be made in the salaries of the non-medical staffs of the universities. They had, however, been unable to reach agreement on the recommendation that these increases should haveeffect from 1st October, 1959, the date from which comparable staffsin technical colleges had received their last salary increases underthe Burnham arrangements. The Chancellors own view was thatit would be difficult to defend refusing some degree of retrospectionto the university staffs.Discussion showed that opinion in the Cabinet was divided onthis issue. It was argued that to refuse the degree of retrospectionrecommended by the University Grants Committee would arousemuch resentment in the universities. The Governmenfs earlier decision to defer the operation of the salary increase granted in 1957had been most unpopular, and a refusal to grant any retrospectionon the present award would be compared unfavourably with recentdecisions to back-date salary increases for doctors in the national health Service to 1st January, 1960, and for the Executive Class ofthe Civil Service to 1st October, 1958.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the award to theuniversity staffs was a straightforward salary increase, which couldbe distinguished from the re-assessment of scales based on surveyswhich related to a past date. The whole principle of retrospectionmust be re-examined when the present series of salary adjustmentshad been completed, and it would be undesirable to introduce itmeanwhile into the universities, where it had not hitherto been applied and might well provoke demands for its extension to school-teachers and other classes covered by the Burnham arrangements.Summing up the discussion The Prime Minister said that on balance it seemed expedient to give some degree of retrospection inthis award. The consequences might, however, be less embarrassingif the retrospection were based neither on any stated principle noron a date explicitly related to that of any other pay award. On this basis a reasonable compromise would be retrospection to 1st January,1960.The Cabinet-Agreed that the recommended salary increases for non-medical staffs of the universities should have effect from 1st January, 1960.
Cabinet Office,26th April, 1960.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would be discussing this plan with the Ministers directly concerned at ameeting on the following day. A public announcement would bemade on 28th April.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of this statement by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.
