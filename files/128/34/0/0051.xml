Housing 2.   The Minister of Housing said that the Rent Act, 1957, hadPolicy enabled landlords to make limited increases in rents, provided thatRents they entered into three-year agreements with their tenants.  These(Previous agreements were now expiring and rents at current market levels Reference: three or four times the gross value of the properties were beingC.C. (60) 46th demanded. This was giving rise to considerable anxiety in theConclusions, London area, althoush in the provinces little difficulty seemed to minute 4)        beoccurring. In a limited number of cases in London, mostlywhere speculators had recently bought the properties concerned,extortionate rents were being demanded. He had advised localauthorities, some weeks previously, that in such cases he wouldbe prepared to consider compulsory purchase of the properties.There was evidence that this circular had had a salutary effect, butUnited Nations 1. The Prime Minister said that he had now been advised byGeneral the Foreign Secretary, who had had discussions with President.Assembly        Eisenhower in Washington and with representatives of a number(Previous        of Commonwealth and other countries in New York, that thereReference:      were strong arguments why he (the Prime Minister) should attendC.C. (60) 50th the General Assembly of the United Nations at some stage.  this conclusions,    view had also been specifically expressed by President EisenhowerMmute 8)       jn a written message which had just been received.   The foreign secretary had suggested that he (the Prime Minister) should arrive in New York on the evening of Monday, 26th September, and thatan announcement to this effect should be made before the soviet union leader, Mr. Khrushchev, had spoken in the Assembly, whichhe was to do on the following day.The Prime Minister said that it would in fact be preferable for him to arrive in New York on the evening of Sunday, 25th September,since that would allow more time for any discussions that might benecessary before he met President Eisenhower, as it had now been provisionally arranged that he should do on Tuesday, 27th September.It was likely that he would make the main United Kingdom speech in the General Assembly on about the following Thursday.It would be possible for him, in the course of his journey to new York, to have a short discussion in Iceland with the IcelandicPrime Minister if this would be of help in the fisheries discussions between the two countries which were due to begin on 1st October.In discussion it was pointed out that the Prime Ministers visit to the General Assembly might be regarded as a success for the tactics followed by the Soviet Union leader. However, it was on balance the general view of the Cabinet that, in the interests of ensuring that the case for the West was fully presented at theAssembly, and that the new and uncommitted members of theUnited Nations did not succumb to the influence of the representativesof the Communist countries, the Prime Minister should attend themeeting in New York. In order to avoid having to justify thisdecision by reference to the speech which Mr. Khrushchev was tomake, an announcement should be made at 9 p.m. that evening.In further discussion the Minister of Agriculture said that itwould be most helpful from the point of view of the comingdiscussions with Iceland if the Prime Minister were to break hisjourney to meet the Icelandic Prime Minister who, it was understood,would welcome such a proposal.The Cabinet Agreed that the Prime Minister should attend the general assembly of the United Nations, and that a decision tothis effect should be announced &quot;that evening.
it must be recognised that throughout the London area there would,during the coming months, be very substantial increases in the levelof private rents. The majority of tenants could afford to payeconomic rents but some of those living on fixed incomes might find themselves unable to afford to continue to live in London. TheGovernment would be subjected to strong political pressures, butthey could, in the Ministers opinion, defend the present position.To re-introduce any form of rent control for houses which had beende-controlled would be contrary to their general policy and to their long-term aim of offering inducements to private enterprise to buildhouses and fiats to let.There was, however, evidence that an increasing number of tenants were finding themselves obliged to enter into short-termagreements under which they had to undertake full responsibilityfor repairs and maintenance of the property which they occupied.This practice on the part of landlords could not be justified, and consideration should be given to the possibility of introducing legislation amending the Landlord and Tenants Acts in such a way as to prevent it. The early introduction of a Bill for this purpose would be a constructive act on the part of the Government whichwould not derogate from their policy on rent control.The Cabinet (1) Took note of this statement by the Minister of Housing.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with theMinister of Housing, to consider the desirability oflegislation to prevent landlords from imposing on short-term tenants full responsibility for repairs andmaintenance of their property.CommonwealthEconomicConsultativeCouncil(previous reference:C.C. (60) 50thConclusions,Minute 3)3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, at the meetingof the Commonwealth Economic Consultative Council which had concluded on the previous day, there had been a useful discussion about the problem of the relations between the European Free trade association and the European Economic Community. With theexception of New Zealand, who feared that any form of association between the Association and the Community would do serious damage to her own economy, the Commonwealth Finance ministers had shown themselves to be more sympathetic than had been expectedto the United Kingdoms difficulties.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd September, 1960.
