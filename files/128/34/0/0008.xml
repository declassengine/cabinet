industrial disputes.railway wages.(previous reference:C. C. (60) 7thConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Minister of Labour gave the Cabinet an account of thecourse of the negotiations in the railway wages dispute since their last meeting. At a meeting under his chairmanship earlier that day,Sir Brian Robertson, Chairman of the British Transport Commission,had made a statement to representatives of the three railway unions on the lines agreed by Ministers that morning. The essential points of that statement were that at the request of the Government he had revealed that the figure he had in mind to offer as an interim increase at the end of the previous month was 4 per cent., and that he was now prepared to say that, subject to the agreement of the three tradeunions, he would, within seven days of the receipt of the report&apos;,increase wages by 4 per cent., back-dated to 11th January, .1960,subject to confirmation that this action was containable within the findings of the report of the committee under the chairmanship of professor Guillebaud. The statement added that an immediate increase of that amount would not prejudice the consideration of the findings of the report.After consideration by the three unions separately, therepresentatives of the Associated Society of Locomotive engineers and Firemen and the Transport Salaried Staffs Association had intimated their acceptance of this formula. The representatives ofthe National Union of Railwaymen (N.U.R.), on the other hand,had raised a number of points, the most important of which was thatan interim increase of 4 per cent, was unsatisfactory and could notbe recommended to their Executive. Such a figure, they said, would cause dissatisfaction among members of the union and would leadto unofficial strikes. The question for decision, therefore, was whether the Cabinet should now authorise Sir Brian Robertson toraise his offer of an interim increase to 5 per cent., subject to thesame conditions as the earlier offer, or to maintain the offer of 4 percent, in which case there was a serious risk of a national railway strike. It had become apparent that the two craft unions would beprepared, so long as there was an assurance that the interim increase would not prejudice consideration of the findings of the report, toaccept an interim increase of 4 per cent, or 5 per cent.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in his view, to offeran interim increase of 5 per cent, would be to surrender to thedemands of the National Union of Railwaymen in the face of threats of strike action; and many sections of opinion would criticise theGovernment for giving way. When the Guillebaud Report became available, the unions would expect substantial further increases.Moreover, a settlement at 5 per cent, would set a pattern for otherwage settlements.In discussion it was generally recognised that the offer of anincrease of 5 per cent, would be widely regarded as giving in to the threat of a strike. This criticism would be strengthened if, as was likely, it became known that the N.U.R. had refused a settlement at per cent. There was little public sympathy with the N.U.R. in theirinsistence on an immediate specific offer, when it was known that thereport of the Guillebaud Committee would be available in two orthree weeks&apos; time. It might well do lasting damage to the reputation of the Government if they were associated with a settlement at 5 percent, in these circumstances. From this point of view there was muchto be said for instructing Sir Brian Robertson not to increase the offer of 4 per cent, which he had made.On the other hand, the fact that the findings of the guillebaud committee were likely to support the case for much higher wage increases made it difficult to risk a strike by refusing an increase ofmore than 4 per cent. If a strike on this issue were in progress whenthe Guillebaud Report became public, it would be difficult to reach a settlement without conceding an increase of considerably more than
5 per cent. Moreover, it would be assumed that the Governmentshould have had some knowledge of the findings which the guillebaud Committee were likely to reach. The Government wouldbe held to be greatly at fault for not having brought about a.settlement at 5 per cent, when they knew, or should have known,that the Guillebaud Committee would find that much higher increases would be justified. Such a situation might well be economicallyworse, and would almost certainly be more damaging politically, thanthe concession of an increase of 5 per cent. now.It was suggested that in conceding 5 per cent, it might be possibleto ensure that any subsequent general increase in railway wages, as distinct from the adjustment of differential wage rates, should notbe available for a period of some months. Discussion showed thatit was the general view of the Cabinet that it would be unwise to try to obtain the acceptance of a specific condition of this sort by theunions. But it had always been recognised that if the findings of the guillebaud Committee were to be substantially implemented, thenecessary adjustments would have to be spread over a long period.Whether a settlement of the present dispute were reached or not,it would be necessary to deal with subsequent claims for a generalwage increase; it might well be easier to resist these claims if an interim payment of 5 per cent, had previously been conceded, sincepublic opinion would feel that the railwaymen had been treated withsympathy.It had also to be recognised that to refuse an increase of morethan 4 per cent, would have difficulties from the point of view of theMinister of Labour in his conciliatory function, since it appeared that Sir Brian Robertson was prepared to offer 5 per cent, and thatall the unions concerned would accept this figure.The Cabinet then considered how a settlement of the present dispute on the basis of 5 per cent, might be presented. It was thegeneral view that it would be best to justify this figure by emphasising the fact that it had been ascertained that such an increase would becontainable in the findings which the Guillebaud Committee were likely to make. It would, of course, be essential to avoid a situationin which the Guillebaud Committee were asked what interim figurethey would consider reasonable, since there was a danger that theymight suggest a higher figure than 5 per cent. The best coursewould be for the parties, after reaching an agreement on the basisof an increased offer, to seek, through an intermediary, confirmationfrom the Guillebaud Committee that this increased offer was likelyto be containable.In further discussion it was suggested that, if the offer which sir Brian Robertson had made were to be increased, it would be preferable to try to reach a settlement at A\ per cent. While an offer of this amount was unlikely to be accepted, it might neverthelesslead the N.U.R. to make a counter proposal of 5 per cent., and soensure a settlement at that figure.The Home Secretary, summing up, said that the Cabinet hadto choose between difficult alternatives. It was probable that in the short-term a decision to refuse to increase the offer of 4 per cent.,and to face a strike, would commend itself to a large section ofpublic opinion, although the harm which would be caused to the economy by a national rail strike should not be underestimated. Intwo or three weeks&apos; time, however, such a decision would be undermined by the publication of the Guillebaud Report, whichwould reveal that a much higher increase would be justified. Atthat stage, public opinion might well turn strongly against theGovernment, which would be assumed to have had foreknowledge ofthe findings of the Guillebaud Committee, for allowing a national strike to develop by failing to agree to a settlement at 5 per cent.
Kenya. 2.   The Colonial Secretary reported that- he had that day(Previous        presented to the four parties to the Kenya Constitutional ConferenceReference:      a plan for constitutional advance which had been worked out inC. C. (60) 7th    consultation with the leader of the New Kenya Group.  The planConclusions,    was wholly satisfactory to Her Majesty&apos;s Government in that it didMinute l.)       not contain provision for full adult franchise or for a Chief minister or for any of the other constitutional features which  wereunacceptable to us. The plan had been accepted by both the Africanelected members and the Asians but, contrary to expectations, it hadbeen rejected by the New Kenya Group.  The leader of the Groupwas, however, now attempting to persuade his colleagues to acceptthe plan.In a short general discussion on the future of Kenya, it wassuggested that it might be possible to safeguard the position of theEuropean minority after the country had attained independenceeither by some form of bicameral government or by the introductionof some residual power or veto analogous to that proposed for theTurkish minority in Cyprus.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Colonial Secretary on developments at the Kenya Constitutional Conference.Cabinet Office, SWA,12th February, I960.The Government would then be faced with the invidious task of having to seek a settlement, probably at a higher cost. It was evidentthat, with these considerations in mind, the consensus of opinion inthe Cabinet was that it would be preferable to seek an immediatesettlement on the basis of an interim increase of 5 per cent, to bepaid after receipt of the Guillebaud Report. It might be preferable to attempt to reach a settlement at a figure of A\ per cent., but theMinister of Labour should be given discretion to handle thenegotiations in the manner he judged best. There would be considerable presentational advantage in linking an offer of 5 percent, with an approach to the Guillebaud Committee on the lines suggested in discussion and the settlement should provide for this.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that Sir Brian Robertson should be authorised tooffer an interim wages increase of up to 5 per cent., back-dated to 11th January, 1960, to be paid after receipt ofthe Report of the Guillebaud Committee and subject tothe same conditions as the earlier offer.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour to be guided by the views expressed in discussion in his further handling of thenegotiations.
