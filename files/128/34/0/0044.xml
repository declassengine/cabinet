C.C. 4^Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.aircraft industry.SupersonicAirliner.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 42ndConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 126) reporting the results of had discussions with the Minister of Aviation and the Minister of Defencefollowing the Cabinet&apos;s previous consideration of the proposal toundertake design studies for a supersonic aircraft.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that though he had some doubt whether design work on a supersonic airliner with a speed of only Mach 2-2 would be justified, the Minister of Aviation had confirmed that we would not be technically capable of competing withthe Americans at the higher speeds of up to Mach 3. He was therefore prepared to accept that contracts to the value of  \ million should beplaced, with one airframe firm and one engine firm, for design studiesover the next twelve months. This was subject to the proviso thatthere was no commitment to proceed beyond this stage, and on theunderstanding that unless British firms undertook these studies itwould be impossible for us to explore the possibility of a joint, projectwith American and perhaps with French firms. We could not afford to proceed with the development and production, as a solely Britishventure, of an extremely expensive aircraft for which the total world market would be very restricted.In discussion the Cabinet recognised that it would be preferable for British firms to concentrate initially on the designs they were bestqualified to produce. We should thus have a competitive basis for negotiations with a view to co-operation with the United States, orcontinental countries, on whatever project might eventually be agreed.The development of designs for supersonic aircraft of Mach 2 - 2 speed(which could be a serious competitor to existing airliners at a relativelyearly date) was further advanced in this country than in the UnitedStates. Moreover, the United States industry would be anxious toplay any part they could in meeting the future aircraft requirements ofthe British Overseas Airways Corporation which represented a significant part of the world market for advanced types of airliner.The Prime Minister said that there was general agreement thatat this stage design studies costing million should be authorised,without any commitment as to subsequent development for asupersonic airliner of Mach 2-2 speed. This would enable us toparticipate in further discussions about the possibility of co-operationwith other countries. Since the world market for supersonic airlinerswould in any case be restricted, we should consider whether prospects for the sale of any type in the development of which we were interestedcould be improved by closer co-operation with the airlines of othercountries -in particular, perhaps, those of Scandinavia or of othermembers of the European Free Trade Association. The terms inwhich the decision to undertake design studies was announced wouldrequire careful consideration.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Minister of Aviation should authorise one aircraft firm and one engine firm to continue design workon a Mach 2 - 2 aircraft within a maximum expenditure of 500,000 over a period of twelve months.(2) Took note that the Minister of Aviation would inform thePrime Minister of the terms in which he proposed to announce the decision recorded in Conclusion (1) above.
(3) Invited the Minister of Aviation to arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the possibility of collaboration with the United States or other countries in the jointdevelopment of a supersonic airliner.3.   The Cabinet had before them:  (i) a note by the Deputy Secretary of the Cabinet (C. (60) 129)covering a report by officials on the implications of developing blue streak as a satellite launcher for space research; and(ii) a note by the Prime Minister (C. (60) 130) setting out thepolitical considerations relevant to the future of BLUE STREAK.The Prime Minister said that following the Cabinefs earlier decision that development of BLUE STREAK as a staticmedium-range ballistic missile should be abandoned, officials had been instructed to analyse the arguments for and against its development as a launcher for satellites. Their report showed that a Britishlauncher was not essential for any expansion of our existing programme of space research for scientific purposes and that thecommercial potentialities of space research were still uncertain. Itwas necessary to consider the effect of a decision to abandon blue streak on our national prestige and whether such a decision wouldinvolve excessive dependence on the United States in a field where the potential advantages to be gained, though still speculative, might be significant to our position as a world power. There was no doubt thatthe United Kingdom, with limited resources, should be selective in deciding what new projects it could afford to undertake. If theCabinet felt that in principle it would be wrong to abandon blue streak altogether, they might wish to consider whether we couldminimise the cost to ourselves, and perhaps also obtain some political advantages, by seeking the co-operation of other countries in thefurther development of the project.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it might be possilbe within the limits of our resources for the United Kingdom to undertake a useful programme of space research, involving the development ofsatellites and instruments for scientific purposes; but, even ifcompensating savings could be found elsewhere, it was doubtfulwhether we should be justified in undertaking the development of alauncher at an estimated cost of over  50 millions during the next four or five years. Thus there was much to be said for the immediatecancellation of all further work on BLUE STREAK. If this decision were not taken now, and the present provisional programme were tocontinue for the time being, the alternative courses to be consideredshould include the possibility of acquiring United States launchers.Suitable American rockets might be available at a price comparable to the production cost of BLUE STREAK, and comparatively little&apos;additional expenditure would be required to adapt British satellitesand our facilities in this country and in Australia for use with UnitedStates launchers.In discussion the general feeling of the Cabinet was that theimmediate cancellation of BLUE STREAK would be undesirable,both as regards the effect on opinion in the United Kingdom and asregards our prestige abroad. Moreover, it would not be practicable to cancel the project without full prior consultation with the australian government.There was general agreement with the view that national resources were inadequate for the United Kingdom to undertake on its own allthe various projects which might seem desirable on grounds of prestigeor for other reasons. It could, however, be argued that space researchwas an outstanding new field of development and that, apart from itsprestige advantages, a British launcher programme might become essential if we were to maintain our leading position in worldSpaceResearch.Blue Streak.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 27thConclusions,Minute 2.)
C.C. 44 (60)communications. If, for communications or other purposes,commercial applications of space research were to become evident,other countries, including the United Kingdom, could not rely onobtaining American launchers for their own purposes.It must, however, be admitted that the commercial potentialities of space research were still highly speculative. It might well beimpossible to justify proceeding with the project as a purely Britishventure. There could be no certainty of finding compensating savingselsewhere; in any case, whether the development of BLUE STREAKproceeded or not, the utmost restraint should be applied over the wholefield of Government expenditure. There was, however, the possibility that the Australians and the French, and perhaps some other european countries, would be willing to contribute towards a co-operativeproject. The design on which BLUE STREAK was based had originally been made available to us by the United States Governmentfor defence purposes. It would therefore be necessary to confirm assoon as possible that satisfactory understandings about the use of blue STREAK for a co-operative space research project could bereached with the United States Government and, as necessary, withthe American firms which had supplied the original designinformation. The Americans might not raise undue difficulties onthis account, since we could represent to them that any co-operativeprogramme would be directed mainly to scientific purposes. It wouldbe necessary to deal with the apprehensions of the United states authorities about continental countries, particularly France, acquiringinformation about the design of large rockets that might have militarysignificance.On the assumption that the goodwill of the United states authorities could be obtained, it was suggested that any approachtowards a co-operative project should envisage the participation notonly of Australia and France, but also of members of the european free Trade Association and other suitable European countries.Particular attention would have to be paid to the position of Germany,but German participation, and that of some of the smaller countries,might be limited to satellites and instrumentation rather thandevelopment of the launcher itself.Summing up The Prime Minister said that there was generalagreement that the United Kingdom should not contemplate relying on United States launchers for any major programme of space researchinvolving the development of sophisticated satellites, though we could continue to co-operate with the Americans in scientific programmessuch as that already being undertaken in connexion with the UnitedStates &quot; Scout&quot; programme. The Cabinet felt that it would be premature to take a final decision either to proceed with thedevelopment of BLUE STREAK over the next four or five years orto abandon it altogether. We could not afford on our own anadditional commitment of more than  60 millions for space research.Nevertheless the existing programme should be allowed to continue on a provisional basis at a cost of about  1 million a month until theend of the year. This would provide an interval of two or threemonths in which to explore the possibilities of undertaking aco-operative project with other countries. For that purpose, the first step would be to inform the Australian Government of our generalintention and to arrange for urgent consultations with them. At thesame time, we should inform the United States Government, and seek such clearance as might be necessary, with the american administration and industrial interests. The French Governmentshould also be informed of our intention in very general terms. Indue course, after the views of the Australian and United states authorities were known, the possibilities of developing blue streak as part of a co-operative programme for space research in collaboration with France and, as appropriate, other European
countries including members of the European Free Trade Associationshould be explored.A final decision on BLUE STREAK ought to be reached by theend of October. Meanwhile, an announcement of the governments intention to continue the project provisionally should be restricted to a statement that Ministers were giving further consideration to thefuture of BLUE STREAK, and any reference to the possibilities ofinternational co-operation should be restricted to an indication that further discussions were taking place with the Australian Government.It would be undesirable that a decision whether or not to complete the development of BLUE STREAK should appear to be contingent on the participation of France or other countries in a joint project.The Cabinet -(1) Agreed that the development of BLUE STREAK as a satellitelauncher should proceed on a provisional basis until theend of 1960, and that the possibility of securing theco-operation of other countries in a joint project shouldbe explored, as indicated by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation, in consultation with theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to submit to thePrime Minister the terms of an announcement indicating that further consideration was being given to the futureof BLUE STREAK.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (60) 108) about reform of the law restricting activitieson Sundays.The Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the home department said that the law restricting Sunday entertainments,Sunday trading and licensing hours on Sundays no longer.reflectedpublic opinion. While there was a growing body of opinion in favourof reform, there was no general agreement as to what changes shouldbe made. It would therefore be necessary to have some form ofenquiry before any proposals for legislation could be framed. he therefore proposed, with the agreement of the Home AffairsCommittee, that a Joint Select Committee of both Houses ofParliament should be appointed,at the beginning of the following session to enquire into the amendment of the lawon Sunday observancein England and Wales. In order that the many organisationsinterested in the subject should be given as much time as possible toprepare their evidence, the Home Secretary saw some advantage in announcing the appointment of the Select Committee before the summer recess.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the case for changesin the law on Sunday observance was less strong in Scotland and thathe would not, therefore, wish the terms of reference of the proposedSelect Committee to go beyond England and Wales.In discussion it was pointed out that, while there was an arguablecase for reform, the opponents of any change, who were in the natureof things more active than its advocates, would certainly cause theGovernment considerable political difficulty especially if, as was contemplated, legislation were introduced at a relatively late stage inthe Parliament. On the other hand, experience showed that difficultiesof this kind often proved in the event less formidable than had been expected. If the Select Committee were to cover neither Scotlandnor Sunday licensing in Wales (with which it was proposed to deal inthe Licensing Bill to be introduced in the session of 1960-61), muchcontroversial matter would be outside the scope of the enquiry. a select Committee could be expected to work more quickly than either a Royal Commission or an Interdepartmental Committee. If it were possible to produce an agreed report, the subsequent process ofSundayObservance.(previous reference:CC. (58) 23rdConclusions,Minute 1.)
5. The Foreign Secretary said that the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations had asked the United Kingdom representative forassistance in requesting the Governments of the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland, Nigeria, Kenya, Tanganyika and Ugandato grant a blanket clearance for the over-flight of their territories by aircraft of a number of countries, including the Soviet Union, whichhad been put at the disposal of the United Nations for transportingforces to serve under United Nations command in the Congo Republic,and food and other supplies needed by the Congo population. Aswell as allowing the over-flight of their territories these african governments might be asked to give other forms of assistance to aircraft engaged in these operations. It was understood that a similarrequest had been made to other countries with responsibility forterritories in Africa. A blanket clearance was thought to be necessary because the United Nations operations had increased to such an extent that it was not practicable to request advance clearance for everyflight.It was likely that a resolution would be introduced in the security council, probably by Tunisia and Ceylon, which would call for thewithdrawal of Belgian troops from the Congo Republic as soon aspossible. It would be undesirable for the United kingdom representative to veto a resolution if this could be avoided, but at thesame time we would not want to subscribe to a resolution whichexplicitly required Belgian troops to withdraw from the Congoaltogether and to abandon their bases there. Moreover we should do nothing to encourage the entry of United Nations forces intoKatanga.It was the general view of the Cabinet that we should accede tothe request of the Secretary-General as regards the over-flight of african territories for which we had responsibility by aircraft insupport of the United Nations action in the Congo Republic, on condition that the Government despatching the aircraft should notify the territories concerned that a flight or series of flights was being undertaken, and on condition that the United Nations authoritiescertified that these flights were being made for the proper purposes.In further discussion it was suggested that the resolution whichwas likely to be introduced in the Security Council could best be improved to meet our views by relating the withdrawal of Belgiantroops to the extent to which United Nations forces found it practicable to take over responsibility for law and order. It was essential to keep the discussion of this question in the Security Council,congo republic.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 43rdConclusions,Minute 1.)C.C. 44 (60)legislation would be greatly simplified: if it did not, it would be opento the Government to take the line that in the absence of any broadagreement legislation would not be justified.The Prime Minister said that the balance of opinion in the Cabinetappeared to be in favour of appointing a Joint Select Committee,although there would be some advantage in first sounding opinion among the Government^ supporters in the autumn. It would on thewhole be preferable not to make any announcement until after the summer recess.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposal in C. (60) 108 for theappointment of a Joint Select Committee on the law of sunday observance in England and Wales.(2) Agreed that any announcement of the Committee&apos;appointment should be deferred until after the summer recess.
and not to allow it to go to the General Assembly. The UnitedKingdom representative at the United Nations would therefore haveto be given wide discretion in dealing with any such resolution, inconsultation with the representatives of our allies, including theBelgian Foreign Minister who was at present in New York.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, in the light of their discussion,to send instructions to the United Kingdom representative at the United Nations about the over-flight of british territories in Africa and about the forthcoming proceedings in the Security Council.Europe. 6.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that, following the(Previous        conference which had been held in Paris in the previous January to reference:      discuss the future of the Organisation for European EconomicC.C. (60) 41st   Co-operation (O.E.E.C.), a report had been produced recommendingConclusions),    the replacement of O.E.E.C. by a new Organisation for EconomicReorganisation Co-operation and Development (O.E.C.D.) which would include theofO.E.E.C.      United States and Canada in addition to the former constituents ofO.E.E.C.   A draft convention, which was broadly acceptable to ourselves, had now been prepared and was to be considered by ministers  of  the  Governments  concerned  and  the  european commission at a meeting on the following day.  The purpose of themeeting was to determine only whether the draft convention was generally acceptable: there would be no question of signing it until it had been further discussed towards the end of the year.   It was intended that the preliminary meeting of Ministers should appoint a Secretary-General Designate of the new Organisation.Considerable divergences of view were likely to emerge at themeeting on the following day, especially on the trade functions ofO.E.C.D. While many European countries wished that it shouldhave specific trade functions, both France and the other Common-wealth countries thought that it should have none, our own viewbeing somewhere between these two extremes. The United States,moreover, would be unwilling to accept any detailed obligations inrespect of trade.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Oversea 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ColonialCivil Service.    Secretary (C. (60) 116) about the position of Her Majesty&apos;s OverseaCivil Service.The Colonial Secretary said that expatriate officers recruited fromthe United Kingdom by the Governments of colonial territories were finding themselves in an increasingly difficult position as the territoriesprogressed towards and emerged into independence. Their salaries and allowances, which were considerably higher than those of locallyrecruited officers, were borne wholly by the local governments, who,on attaining independence, were reluctant on grounds of economy to retain the expatriate officers in their employment. The consequentuncertainty about their personal future was having a damaging effecton the morale of the expatriate officers, who were resigning in increasing numbers when, or even before, their territories becameindependent. Since the standard of education and of administrativeability among the locally recruited officers was in many areas still ata low level, the point had been reached at which there was real dangerof a breakdown of administration in some of the territories which were
approaching independence, especially in those in East Africa. Ineffect, the whole of the United Kingdom&apos;s colonial policy was thereforeat stake.In the past the Government had been preoccupied with their duty to do justice to the expatriate officer whom the new independentGovernment was unwilling to retain in employment. A new approach was now necessary to make conditions of service such as wouldinduce as many expatriate officers as possible to remain in theemployment of the local governments and to induce the local governments to retain them. The Colonial Secretary therefore proposed that, for the future, the &quot; expatriate&quot; element in the emoluments of the officers in question -that is, the excess of theiremoluments over those of locally recruited officers should be borne,not by the local government, but by the United Kingdom Exchequer.The cost of this proposal was estimated at about  24 millions a year.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the rapid increase in expenditure overseas, together with the relatively small return ityielded, was resulting in an alarming deficit on overseas account. Hecould not contemplate an additional commitment of anything like the size proposed. If the situation in the Colonial territories was so serious that some additional expenditure must be undertaken, hecould agree to it only on condition that compensating reductions were accepted in analogous expenditure elsewhere.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that some means must be found of averting a breakdown ofthe administration in the Colonial territories, especially in Africa.The political effect of a breakdown would be disastrous and it might in the long run involve expenditure far greater than that proposed bythe Colonial Secretary. On the other hand, it might be possible to devise a scheme which would achieve the main object in view andat the same time cause less difficulty to the Exchequer. Could it, forexample, be made selective and limited to those territories where thedanger was greatest, i.e., to East Africa, or possibly to Africa as awhole? Alternatively, it might be possible to persuade the local governments, both before and after independence, to bear the wholeor at least part of some elements in the scheme, e.g., the  7 millionsestimated for passage allowances between the territories and theUnited Kingdom. On the question of compensating reductions,consideration should be given to the relative priority of the scheme proposed by the Colonial Secretary and, for example, loans for majorcapital development in the independent Commonwealth countries,which were unlikely ever to be repaid.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the commonwealth secretary, to consider urgently in the light of their discussionhow the scope of the scheme proposed in C. (60) 116 could best be reduced and whether compensating reductions couldbe made in oversea spending for which they were responsible:and to report to the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st July, I960.
