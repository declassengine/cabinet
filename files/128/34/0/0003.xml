Germany.(previous references:C.C. (59) 54thConclusions,Minute 2 andC.C. (59) 41stConclusions,Minute 2.)Armaments.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to circulate, for consideration at their next meeting, a memorandum about the Germanrequest for an amendment of the Brussels Treaty to permitGerman manufacture of warships up to 6,000 tons and influence mines.Cyprus.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 2ndConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Foreign Secretary made a report to the Cabinet aboutthe course of the negotiations with the Cypriot representatives. the exact details of the United Kingdom&apos;s requirements for the proposedsovereign areas had not yet been disclosed to them, though the greek and Turkish Governments knew what our final position would be.Considerable progress had been made in the negotiations about sites and facilities, though certain points regarding training facilities, thecontrol of Nicosia airfield, and the use of air space over Cyprusremained to be settled. The Cypriot representatives had been provided with a statement of our intention to permit or invite the authorities ofthe Republic to operate certain local administrative services in the sovereign areas; it was understood that this would not derogate fromthe principle of United Kingdom sovereignty in these areas, but he proposed to seek the confirmation of the Lord Chancellor on thispoint. Negotiations had also continued about a number of miscellaneous financial provisions, and he would seek to safeguard theposition on all of these in reaching a final settlement. As regardsfinancial assistance, the Cypriots had asked for a substantial butunspecified immediate capital grant, together with an annual grant of 3 millions in return for the retention of the sovereign areas and theuse of sites and facilities in the Republic.In view of the importance of securing a satisfactory settlement,he thought it would be advisable to increase the amount of financialassistance which we had hitherto been prepared to afford. The offerthat had been made of Commonwealth assistance loans of  5- millions for specific projects was not particularly attractive to theCypriot representatives. While it would be best to leave this offeropen, it would be necessary, in order to reach a settlement, to beprepared to make available a total grant of  8 millions, or even  10millions in the last resort. The extent to which the Cypriot authorities could draw on this grant year by year could be restricted. A sum of1. The Foreign Secretary said that the Federal GermanGovernment had made a request, which would come before theCouncil of the Western European Union, for an amendment of the brussels Treaty which would permit Germany to manufacturewarships of up to 6,000 tons (instead of 3,000 tons as at present) and influence mines. It was in our interest to encourage Germany tobear a greater share of the burden of the defence of Western Europe,but at the same time it had to be recognised that the British peoplehad a natural dislike of German rearmament. It was important tomaintain the principle that Germany should not be allowed to manufacture strategic armaments of an offensive character. It might,nevertheless, be possible to accept the present German request, at least in part, but the details of the proposal would have to be carefully examined. He proposed to consult the French Government about therequest, and there would be an opportunity to discuss the question,and the way in which any decision should be presented, at the meetingof the Council of the Western European Union in London in thefollowing week.In discussion the view was expressed that further considerationof this question should have full regard to the effect which acceptanceof the German request might have on the forthcoming meeting between the Heads of Governments.
 3 millions for the first year might be appropriate, but this should include  500,000 to be paid specifically to the Turkish Cypriotauthorities, who had benefited less than the Greek Cypriots in the division of certain assets.He proposed, if possible, to make clear to Archbishop Makarioswhat the final United Kingdom position was on all the above matters,including the amount of financial assistance, before the Archbishopreturned to Cyprus, as he planned to do on the following day. Thatwould allow the Archbishop about a week in which to reply, since theBill to provide for the establishment of an independent Republic of cyprus on 19th March would have to be published on about4th February.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was extremelydifficult to contemplate financial assistance on the scale now suggested,especially if this was to be in addition to the loan assistance whichhad already been offered. There was no economic justification forany assistance by way of grant, and it would be an undesirableprecedent to link assistance to the provision of defence facilities. Itwould hardly be possible, in view of the Estimates position, to accommodate this expenditure in the financial year 1960-61. If any payment by way of grant had to be made, it would be preferable fora large proportion of it to be paid before the end of the current financial year. It was also essential that any continuing paymentshould taper off over the next few years, and it might be necessaryto insist on a longer period than five years. He was, however, unableto decide what assistance could be afforded without furtherconsideration.In discussion the following points were made:(a) Financial assistance on the scale now suggested would be an embarrassing precedent in future negotiations with colonial territorieswhose case for assistance might be more deserving. On the otherhand, the circumstances of the Cyprus settlement were peculiar, andthe defence facilities which we would enjoy were extensive and valuable.(b) It was suggested that, if financial assistance were madeavailable in return for the defence facilities, it would not be realisticto expect the assistance to be terminated after a few years. On theother hand, that might be the time when Commonwealth assistanceloans would become of value to the Cypriot authorities.The Home Secretary, summing up, said that a satisfactory settlement was of the highest importance, not only for political reasons, but in the interests of international relations and world peace.Despite the financial difficulties, the Cabinet hoped that, if it wasnecessary in order to reach a settlement which safeguarded our essential interests, some additional financial assistance might bepossible, even if this meant curtailing other expenditure. On theother hand, it was difficult to accommodate additional expenditure inthe next financial year. It would therefore be necessary for theChancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation with the foreign secretary, to consider to what extent and by what means the need to provide additional financial assistance for Cyprus could be met.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary, to consider to what extent and by what means the need to provide additional financialassistance for Cyprus could be met.Parliament 3.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
MaldiveIslands.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 37thConclusions,Minute 3.)The Cabinet-Took  note with  approval of this  statement  by  theCommonwealth Secretary.Kenya.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 2ndConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Colonial Secretary said that the African elected members had withdrawn their request that Mr. Koinange should be appointed as a second special adviser to them at the conference now in progress and that the New Kenya Group had for their part withdrawn their objection to his admittance to the accommodation provided for the african members in Lancaster House. The conference was now infull session and in an atmosphere better than that which might havebeen expected before the dispute over Mr. Koinange had occurred.While there was no hope of reaching an agreement acceptable to theUnited Party, the Colonial Secretary thought there was some chanceof a settlement which would be acceptable to the New Kenya group and the Asians and tolerable to the African elected members.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Colonial Secretary.Education.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 62ndConclusions,Minute 2.)Youth Service.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Education (C. (60) 9) about the report of the Committeeon the Youth Service under the chairmanship of Lady Albemarle.The Minister of Education said that the Education PolicyCommittee had agreed that all the main recommendations forGovernment action in the Albemarle report should be accepted andhe sought authority to make a statement on the lines annexed to his memorandum on the day on which the report was to be published(3rd February).The Education Policy Committee had, however, felt some difficulty about the recommendation that a Youth ServiceDevelopment Council should be appointed. There was no doubtthat there was a need for such a Council, whose functions would beto put forward proposals for experimental developments in theService and to stimulate the local education authorities and voluntary organisations to put them to the test.   It was desirable that the4. The Commonwealth Secretary said that a satisfactory agreement with the Government of the Maldives was now in sight.They had undertaken to make over to us Gan Island and part ofHittadu Island as a gift for thirty years in return for our external defence of the Maldives, and would accept a permanent representativeof Her Majesty&apos;s Government in their capital. We would pay theMaldivians about  40,000 which had already been committed inconnexion with resettlement from Addu Atoll. In return for thedefence facilities we proposed to make them a gift of  100,000 (or,at most,  150,000) towards their general expenditure and a grant of 700,000 (or, at most,  750,000) for technical developments to be paidover a period of not less than five years. The authority of theMaldivian Government over the Addu Atoll would be restored overa period of years on conditions to be approved by ourselves.In discussion it was recognised that it would have been preferable to have secured occupation of Gan for longer than thirty years. Thisperiod, however, was acceptable for defence purposes; moreover, itmight be extended, since provision for this was contained in theproposed agreement. There was no question of developing a full-scale naval base on the island.
Council should consist of relatively young people with an imaginativeapproach to the problems of the Service. If such a Council were anindependent advisory body it might embarrass the Government by putting forward proposals which would be too expensive. TheMinister therefore proposed that the Council should be a mixed bodyof representatives of the Government and independent members,with himself in the chair. This would enable him to control theCouncil, and it would ensure the closest possible contact betweenthe Government and those directly interested in the Service.In discussion there was general agreement that the main recommendations of the Albemarle Committee should be accepted.It was also agreed that the Minister^ proposal for a Youth ServiceDevelopment Council, for which there were precedents in other fields,should be adopted and that the constitution of the Council shouldbe indicated in his statement. It should, however, be made clear alsothat the proposed Council might be only a temporary arrangement.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) The decision to accept the Albemarle Committee^recommendations should not prejudice the proposals underconsideration for the development of services for young peoplethroughout the Commonwealth. It would be necessary also toco-ordinate the development of the Youth Service in this country with whatever action were taken on the wider provision of sportsfacilities resulting from the recommendations of the committeeappointed by the Central Council of Physical Recreation and nowsitting under the chairmanship of Sir John Wolfenden.(b) The provision of sports facilities should be mentioned inparagraph 6 of the Minister^ statement.(c) Paragraph 8 of the statement should be amended to makeit clear that the direct Exchequer grant towards the expansion of thepresent number of full-time youth leaders related only to their training.(d) The reference to a five-year programme of building for the youth Service should be omitted from paragraph 10.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the conclusion of the Education Policy Committeethat all the main recommendations of the AlbemarleCommittee&apos;s report, &quot; The Youth Service in England andWales &quot;, should be accepted.(2) Authorised the Minister of Education to make a statement on the report on the lines of the draft annexed to C. (60) 9,amended to take account of the points made in their discussion.industrial disputes.previous reference:C.C. (59) 41stConclusions,Minute 4.)railway wages.7. The Minister of Transport said that a committee underProfessor Guillebaud had been set up by the British transport commission (B.T.C.) and the three railway unions in the autumn of1958 to examine and report on the wages structure of the railways.The committee&apos;s report was not likely to be received by the partiesuntil April 1960, and the long delay had led to unrest amongrailwaymen. In order to allay their concern, Sir Brian Robertson,chairman of the B.T.C., after consultation with the General Secretaryof the National Union of Railwaymen (N.U.R.), had issued astatement on 11th January that the B.T.C. would consider as soonas the Guillebaud report was received what interim wage increase could be made, and that any such increase would be made retrospective to the date of the announcement. The membership ofthe NU.R. were not, however, satisfied by this statement, and theexecutive of the Union had now informed Sir Brian Robertson that
if he did not make an interim increase in wages now there wouldbe strike action which they would have to support and extendnationally. The Wages Policy Committee had considered what advicethe Government should give to Sir Brian Robertson in thesecircumstances. They felt that, if it were decided to make no offer,there was a prospect of a national railway strike in circumstances in,which public sympathy would tend to be on the side of the railwaymen. After receiving informal information that therecommendations likely to be made by the Guillebaud Committeewould justify an increase of 9 to 10 per cent, to railwaymen in general,with increases of up to 15 per cent, where changes in differentialswere recommended, theWages Policy Committee thought that an offer to pay an interim increase of 4 per cent, could be justified. It wouldbe for Sir Brian Robertson to negotiate such an increase with theunions and then to seek by letter Professor Guillebaud&apos;s endorsementthat the proposed interim increase would not be incompatible withhis final recommendations. It was known that other members ofthe Guillebaud Committee favoured an interim increase of 5 or 6per cent., and it was therefore clear that it would be inadvisable topermit any open consultation between the unions and the committee.In negotiating the interim increase, Sir Brian Robertson should makeit clear that the increase took the place of that foreshadowed in thestatement of 11th January, and should attempt to persuade the unions to drop their claim for shorter hours. The cost of the interim increase would amount to about  14- 15 millions a year. The. Governmentwould have to resort to further deficit financing to pay for this.In discussion the view was expressed that, while there would be some criticism in Parliament and elsewhere if the B.T.C. concededan interim wages increase in the face of pressure from unofficialelements in the N.U.R., public sympathy would in general side withthe railwaymen, who were known to be underpaid. The statementalready made by Sir Brian Robertson had virtually conceded anincrease from 11th January, and the offer of an immediate interim increase of 4 per cent, would not in itself be an additional financial commitment. It would help, presentationally, if the payment of theincrease were linked to the urgent need to maintain railway services by encouraging railwaymen not to transfer to better paid jobs. Ifthe unions refused an offer of a 4 per cent, increase now andthreatened strike action, the public would be likely to recognise thatthe B.T.C. had made a reasonable offer in present circumstances,particularly as the Guillebaud report was likely to be available to theparties in two months&apos; time, and might not be critical of theGovernment if there were a strike.Ministers expressed concern at the problem of financing a wage increase. The deficit of the B.T.C. was at present financed byExchequer loans: there was no prospect that these could be repaid,and Parliament might take the view that they were being misled ifthe deficit were increased as a result of the wage increase. this problem would be intensified when the Guillebaud recommendations were made, since present indications suggested that they might increase the cost of running the railways by some  40 or  50 millions a year. It was important that Sir Brian Robertson should be encouraged to increase fares and charges selectively where this wouldnot in his judgment lead to loss of revenue. This would help to bring home to the public that increased wages had to be paid for.The Home Secretary, summing up, said that the choice laybetween a limited concession on railway wages now, with the probability of some public criticism, and the virtual certainty of astrike, the settlement of which would be bound to involve someinterim payment. It was the view of the Cabinet that on balanceSir Brian Robertson should be advised to offer an interim increaseof not more than 4 per cent, now, payable from 11th January, 1960,
and, if that were accepted by the unions, to seek the assurance ofthe Guillebaud Committee that such an increase would not be incompatible with their proposed recommendations. If the unionsrefused to accept an interim increase of 4 per cent., Sir BrianRobertson should be advised to resist any further concession and,if necessary, to face a strike. It would be desirable to review urgentlythe Governments emergency arrangements, and he would put this in hand.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Minister of Transport should authorise theChairman of the British Transport Commission to offer the railway unions an interim wage increase of not morethan 4 per cent., payable from 11th January, 1960; and,if that figure were agreed, to ascertain from the guillebaud Committee that the increase would not be incompatible with their recommendations.(2) Took note that the Home Secretary would review theGovernments emergency arrangements.InternationalDevelopmentAssociation.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 23rdConclusions,Minute 7.)8. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the international development Association (I.D.A.) was designed to provide funds for development in less advanced countries on easier terms than thosenormally prescribed by the International Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment (I.B.R.D.). The Cabinet had decided in the spring of1959 that the United Kingdom should take part in a study of theplan for an I.D.A., but that the scale of the project and of theUnited Kingdom contribution to it should be left for later decision.It was now proposed in the draft Articles of Agreement of the I.D.A.that the initial fund should be $1,000 millions, and that the UnitedKingdom subscription should be $131-2 millions, or  46-9 millions.Only 10 per cent, of the United Kingdom contribution would becalled initially. So far, the British Commonwealth had gained more from loans by international organisations for development assistancethan the United Kingdom had had to subscribe, and it appeared tobe in our interest to join the I.D.A., whose loans would not be tiedto the exports of a particular country. If there were sufficient support, the I.D.A. was likely to come into force in September 1960.One unsatisfactory point in the draft Charter was a provision whichpermitted the I.D.A., if it so wished, to require guarantees from ametropolitan country in respect of loans to its dependent territories.The value of the I.D.A. for the United Kingdom and our colonies would be seriously impaired if the Association made a general practice of requiring guarantees of that kind. The ExecutiveDirectors of the I.B.R.D. had already started discussions forapproving the draft Articles of Agreement. The Economic PolicyCommittee had therefore decided to authorise our representative toindicate our willingness to participate in the I.D.A. on the basis ofthe Charter as now drafted, subject to placing on record our understanding that loans would be made to our dependent territorieswithout any requirement of a guarantee from the United Kingdom.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement by theChancellor of the Exchequer.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,26th January, 1960.
