Meeting of heads ofGovernment,1960.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.They also considered alternative forms of a Governmentamendment to a Private Member&apos;s Motion, due to be debated on20th May, calling for an immediate and substantial increase in old age pensions. They agreed that the amendment should draw attention to the improvements effected since 1951 and should express the confidence of the House that the continued sound management of the national economy would enable pensioners to share in thecountry&apos;s increasing prosperity.It was proposed that the House should adjourn for the whitsun recess on 3rd June.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Housing and Local Government (C. (60) 82) about the redevelopment of a site on the north side of Piccadilly Circus.C.C. (59) 60th. The Minister of Housing said that the proposal for theConclusions, redevelopment of this site had attracted much unfavourable attentionMinute 9.) and, with the Cabinefs approval, he had called the case in for decision by himself. After a public enquiry he had concluded thatthe proposal must be rejected, on the ground that the design of theproposed building was not architecturally satisfactory in relation tothe site and to the Circus as a whole. He proposed to discuss withthe London County Council, as planning authority, the possibilitiesof formulating a comprehensive plan to which developers of this andother sites in the Circus would be asked to conform.Discussion showed that there was general support in the cabinet for the Ministefs proposals. The formulation of a comprehensive plan might provide an opportunity to demonstrate in PiccadillyCircus the advantages of segregating pedestrian and vehicular traffic,and this should be discussed with the London County Council.PiccadillyCircus.(previous reference:1. The Cabinet took note of the attitude which Mr. Khrushchevhad taken up at the outset of the Summit Meeting in Paris on theprevious day. In a preliminary statement about reconnaissance flights by United States aircraft over Soviet territory, he had askedfor an expression of regret that these flights had been undertaken,an undertaking that those responsible would be brought to account and an assurance that no further flights of this kind would be made.President Eisenhower had said, in reply, that there would be nofurther flights of this kind while he was President. Mr. Khrushchevhad not, however, been satisfied with this and had said that he wouldnot be willing to proceed with the conference unless his two other points were met. The Prime Minister had been active during theprevious day in seeking means by which the business of the Meetingcould be commenced; but, according to the latest information,Mr. Khrushchev was still threatening to leave Paris unless his initialdemands were met in full. He had suggested that in presentcircumstances it would be better if the Meeting were now postponed until after the Presidential Election in the United States.The Cabinet took note of this situation and invited the HomeSecretary to send to the Prime Minister on their behalf an assurance of their support for his efforts to find a way out of the difficultiescreated by Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s initial statement.
Meanwhile it should be possible to give to the developers of thisparticular site a general indication of the type of development whichwas likely to conform to the comprehensive plan.The Cabinet Approved the proposals put forward in C. (60) 82 on the redevelopment of Piccadilly Circus.commercial policy.relaxation of import restrictions.(Previous.Reference:C.C. (60) 2ndConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (60) 83) on the relaxation of import restrictions.The President of the Board of Trade recalled that, when theyhad last discussed this question on 18th January, the Cabinet hadenvisaged that a further step would be taken in the spring by relaxing the restrictions on imports of milk, dye-stuffs and canned fruit. TheUnited States authorities were already pressing for early action inrespect of canned fruit, and this pressure would probably be intensified during his forthcoming visit to the United States. Therewere in fact no economic grounds on which we could justifycontinuance of these restrictions in respect of canned fruit. On theother hand, there were powerful political arguments in favour offurther delay. Apart from the general argument that such action might appear inconsistent with the steps we had recently taken to restrain internal demand, a number of difficult issues had arisen inour economic relations with the United States. We had reason to bedissatisfied with their attitude over shipping, the wool tariff and our economic relations with Europe. For all these reasons this was not an appropriate moment at which to promise further relaxation of restrictions on dollar imports. He therefore proposed that no suchaction should be taken at the present time and that, if he were pressed on this point during his visit to the United States, he should take theline that, when we were in a position to undertake further relaxations,canned fruit would be among the first of the products with which weshould deal.In discussion the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said thatthis response would be disappointing to the Americans and mighttend to worsen Anglo-American relations on economic questionsgenerally. It was however the general feeling of the Cabinet that itwould be inexpedient at the present time to make any further relaxation of the remaining restrictions against dollar imports.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that there should be no further relaxation of restrictions on dollar imports at the present time.(2) Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to say, during his forthcoming visit to North America, that when wewere in a position to take further action of this kindcanned fruit would be among the first of the products inrespect of which existing restrictions would be relaxed.Commercial 5.   The Commonwealth Secretary said that the price of butterPolicy. had been falling in the United Kingdom and that the New ZealandButter. and Australian authorities had urged that the Polish butter quota,0?previous which in the special circumstances of 1959 had been fixed at 20,000Reference: tons a year, should be substantially reduced in the second half ofC.C. (59) 48th 1960.   He considered that our relations with New Zealand and conclusions, Australia might suffer if, in the course of the Polish trade discussionsMinute 3.) now starting in London, a quota larger than 7,000 tons were offered to the Poles for the second half of the current year.  He recognised
CC. 31 (60)the industrial advantages that would flow from the successful conclusion of negotiations with the Poles and the difficulty of restricting imports from the countries of the European Free trade association; but in the long term it was important for our ownexport trade to retain the goodwill of Commonwealth customers and,if prices continued to fall, we could not ease the position for Australiaand New Zealand without placing some restriction on imports from poland.The President of the Board of Trade said that the Poles had justagreed to resume negotiations for a trade agreement on the basis ofan assurance that the cut in their bacon quota would be restored.They had asked for an annual butter quota of 22,000 tons; and theywould have good cause to complain if, after what we had done onbacon, we now reduced this below the current level of 20,000 tons.The chance of increasing our exports of manufactured goods to poland would be seriously prejudiced and, since Polish butter formedabout only 5 per cent, of the total supplies to the United Kingdom,any reduction of the quota could produce only a marginal benefit for New Zealand and Australia. If negotiations with the Poles wereto break down on this issue the Government would be exposed tosevere criticism from industrial producers.In discussion it was suggested that, if the price of butter were to fall throughout the remainder of the year and in 1961, efforts couldbe made to seek the co-operation of the countries of the european free Trade Association in avoiding excessive imports that would be detrimental to producers in New Zealand and Australia. Futurelevels of prices and supplies were difficult to forecast, but there wasa danger that excessive stocks might accumulate over the next12 months. It might therefore be expedient to inform the Poles thatthe special addition of 5,000 tons made in 1959 to the basic annualquota of 15,000 tons could not be continued indefinitely, but thatwe would accept a quota (equivalent to the actual level of deliveries in the last six months) of 17,000 tons for the period of 12 months from July 1960 onwards. On the other hand, though a reduction of only 3,000 tons in our total butter imports of about 450,000 tons ayear would be unlikely to prevent a general fall in the price of butter,any proposal to reduce the Polish quota at this stage would seriouslyimpair the prospect of making a new trade agreement with Poland.The Cabinet, in considering the bacon quota, had recognised theimportance of offering the prospect of a stable import trade for areasonable period, and it could be expected that the Poles would react adversely to any suggestion that the current level of butterimports could not be maintained for the next 12 months.Summing up, the Home Secretary said that, in view of theimportance of the current trade talks with the Poles, the balance ofadvantage appeared to lie in adopting a quota of 20,000 tons for imports of Polish butter for the 12 months to the end of June 1961.This should be done in a manner which did not pre-judge decisions about the future level of supplies and it should be made clear to thePolish negotiators that no commitment could be accepted for thelevel of butter imports after July 1961.The Cabinet-Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrange forthe Polish authorities conducting negotiations for a trade agreement with the United Kingdom to be informed thatthe quota for imports of Polish butter would be fixed at20,000 tons for the period from July 1960 to June 1961, butthat the level of imports thereafter would be determined inthe light of the general supply situation.
6. The Cabinet were informed that good progress had beenmade in the discussions on the question of Finland&apos;s association withthe European Free Trade Association. The Finns were anxious tofind a form of association, short of membership; they had asked forno concessions on agriculture; and all but one of the difficultieswhich had arisen in the negotiations were likely to be resolved before or at the forthcoming meeting of the Association in Lisbon. Theone major difficulty arose from Finland&apos;s most-favoured-nationobligations to the Soviet Union. Finland could not in practicerange herself with the Association unless she were able to discriminate against the Soviet Union. It was not yet known whether she wouldbe willing, or able, to reach an understanding with the Soviet union which would enable her to do this.In discussion the question was raised whether the interests of paper manufacturers in the United Kingdom would be prejudicedif Finland ranged herself with the Association. The President of theBoard of Trade said that, while there might be some small net increase in imports into this country, the main effect would be toreduce the volume of imports from other Scandinavian countries.The Cabinet-Agreed that, if Finland were able to give satisfactoryundertakings about her most-favoured-nation obligations tothe Soviet Union, the United Kingdom representatives atthe Lisbon meeting of the European Free Trade Associationshould support Finland&apos;s association with the organisation;and authorised them to initial an agreement for thatpurpose.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary on relations with Kuwait (C. (60) 81).The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that under the exclusive Agreement of 1899 the United Kingdom Government was responsible for the external affairs of Kuwait and had jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners there. The Agreement was stillin existence, but it no longer reflected the actual position or theinternational status which Kuwait was now assuming. While weshould not take the initiative in seeking a modification of the Agree-ment, it was desirable that, if the Ruler himself raised the matter, ourlocal representatives should be able to say that the United KingdomGovernment would be ready to consider revising the Agreement.There was at present no indication that the Ruler wished to makeany such proposal and consideration of the form of a new agreement could be deferred until the circumstances prevailing at the time were known.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that we should refrain from taking the initiative in suggestingany modification of the 1899 Agreement. It was also felt to be unnecessary to authorise our representatives in the area to say atonce, if the Ruler raised the matter, that the United Kingdom wouldbe ready to modify the Agreement. The initial reply could be restricted to an expression of sympathetic interest and an undertaking to refer his request to London. The manner in which any negotiations were conducted and the form of a new Agreement wouldbe a matter for decision by the Cabinet at the time.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to arrangefor the United Kingdom authorities in the Persian Gulf tobe instructed that, in response to any request from the Rulerof Kuwait for the modification of the Agreement of 1899,they should undertake to refer the request to the UnitedKingdom Government for consideration.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,\17th May, 1960.Decimal 8.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCoinage.        Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 76) on the possible introductionof a decimal coinage.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a committeeappointed by the British Association had recently recommended theadoption of a decimal system of coinage, for which there was said tobe fairly widespread support in trading and professional circles. TheGovernment would be expected to give an early indication of theirattitude to this report. It might be desirable also to indicate the government&apos;s view on the question whether a decimal coinage, if adopted, should be based on a unit of 10 shillings or of a pound.While the former would be more convenient, its probable effect onthe status and stability of our currency was such that a unit ofone pound was to be preferred.In discussion it was generally agreed that, while theGovernment should not at present imply general approval for thedecimal system by welcoming the committee&apos;s report, they could appropriately announce that they would welcome public discussionof it. The announcement should, in addition, point out the difficultyof the choice between 10 shillings and a pound as the unit on whicha decimal system should be based.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to submit to thePrime Minister a draft statement on the lines agreed in their discussion on the possible introduction of a system ofdecimal coinage.
