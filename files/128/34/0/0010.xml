Cyprus. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that a report had now been(Previous        received from the Governor of Cyprus on the Outstanding questionsReference:      on which agreement had not yet been reached in the negotiations.C.C. (60) 9th    He proposed that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for conclusions,    the Colonies should return to Cyprus in time to resume negotiationsMinute 4.)       on 22nd February and should, in accordance with the Cabinetsdecision at their last meeting, seek to reach agreement on all outstanding issues except the size of the sovereign areas. He shoulddecline to discuss this last issue until all others had been settled anduntil some definition had been put forward of the special facilities which might be granted in the adjoining areas if, in the last stage ofthe negotiations, we were prepared to concede some relatively smallreduction in the size of the sovereign areas. The Greek and turkish governments had been informed that we intended to follow thiscourse. It should become apparent by the end of the following weekwhether or not Archbishop Makarios intended to reach any agreement.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement by the foreign secretary.Federationof rhodesia and Nyasaland.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 6thConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the colonial secretary (C. (60) 27) on the release of detainees and constitutional developments in Nyasaland; and a memorandum by the Common-wealth Secretary (C. (60) 28) on constitutional developments in southern Rhodesia.The Prime Minister said that, as the Cabinet had already beeninformed, it had not been possible for him, during his visit to salisbury, to reach agreement with Sir Roy Welensky, the PrimeMinister of the Federation, on the release of Dr. Banda and on theopening of talks on constitutional advance in Nyasaland. TheGovernments proposals on these questions had been -put to Sir roy welensky and Sir Edgar Whitehead, the Prime Minister of SouthernRhodesia, after he had left the Federation and they had then reactedvery strongly against them. It had therefore been arranged that theCommonwealth Secretary should visit the Federation for personaldiscussions with them. While the constitutional responsibility for lawand order in Nyasaland lay with the Governor and the ColonialParliament. 1-.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Home Secretary said that he thought it would be expedient for the Prime Minister to make a considered reply in the near future to the suggestion that the proceedings of Parliament should betelevised. His advice was that a negative reply should be given:he would submit a draft for consideration by the Cabinet.It was also desirable that an early statement should be made onthe extent to which the working of the nationalised industries shouldbe made the subject of Parliamentary Questions. There was some small scope for broadening current practice on this point. A draft statement would be submitted for consideration by the Cabinet.The Home Secretary said that the Governments legislative programme would become congested towards the end of the sessionunless mote of the Bills could be got ready for early introduction.Ministers responsible for Bills which should be passed before theend of the session should do their utmost to expedite the submission of draft Bills to the Legislation Committee.
Secretary, it must be recognised that Sir Roy Welensky and Sir EdgarWhitehead were entitled to be consulted, if only because they wouldbe called upon to supply any reinforcements required to restore thesituation if serious disorder broke out in Nyasaland.The Cabinet had already agreed that it would become increasingly difficult to justify Dr. Banda&apos;s continued detention.Moreover, the best hope of regaining normal conditions in Nyasalandlay in opening discussions with Dr. Banda on constitutional advance in Nyasaland. Unless some constitutional progress were made there,the Federation was unlikely to secure the degree of African confidencenecessary for its survival. The Commonwealth Secretary would again put all these arguments to Sir Roy Welensky and Sir EdgarWhitehead. He would assure them that our proposals for constitutional development in Nyasaland would be modest: theywould not in fact carry Nyasaland beyond the point already reached by Northern Rhodesia. Moreover, it was not intended thatthey should be brought into effect until after the Federal Review.He would try to avoid going into the question whether Dr. Bandawould take part in that Review; that would depend on what happenedafter his release.It was hoped that the Commonwealth Secretary would be ableto report the outcome of his discussions by 23rd February. TheColonial Secretary would then begin his visit to the Federation on29th February and during the course of his visit, on 8th March,Dr. Banda would be released. The Monckton Commission would,on present plans, arrive in Nyasaland on 21st March. Subsequently,discussions on constitutional developments in Nyasaland could takeplace in London at the beginning of June.In order to reach an understanding with Sir Roy Welensky andSir Edgar Whitehead, the Commonwealth Secretary might have tooffer a conference to consider the withdrawal of the reserved powers in respect of Southern Rhodesia, on the basis that these would bereplaced by adequate constitutional safeguards for Africans in theterritory. This conference might also be held in London in June.This offer should be made only if satisfactory arrangements for therelease of Dr. Banda and for constitutional development in Nyasalandwere accepted. The Commonwealth Secretary would have to makeit clear that the United Kingdom Parliament might find it difficultto accept these changes in the constitution of Southern Rhodesiaunless they were accompanied by some improvement in the franchiseand in land policy. The purpose of the constitutional conferenceson Nyasaland and Southern Rhodesia in June would be to carrymatters forward towards an agreement but not to complete it untilthe Monckton Commission had reported and the Federal review was about to begin.The Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s discussions might well beunsuccessful; for it was known in Salisbury that the Governor of nyasaland, and to a lesser degree the Governor of Northern Rhodesia,shared the belief that the early release of Dr. Banda would involve an unjustifiable security risk. In that event the United KingdomGovernment might be faced with a serious situation. They mightbe forced to choose between abandoning their plans for the release.of Dr. Banda and the opening of talks on constitutional development in Nyasaland, and being seen to do so under pressure from theGovernments of the Federation and of Southern Rhodesia, or takingthe risk that Southern Rhodesia might secede from the Federationor that the Federal Government might make a unilateral declarationof independence.The Commonwealth Secretary said that many Europeans in theFederation were seriously alarmed by recent developments which,as they thought, afforded too much encouragement to Africannationalist aspirations. Sir Roy Welensky and Sir Edgar Whiteheadmight feel that in present circumstances they should resist any further
Nigeria. 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Colonial(Previous        Secretary (C. (60) 25) on the grant of independence to Nigeria.Reference:C.C. (58) 76th The Colonial Secretary recalled that, at the ConstitutionalConclusions, Conference in 1958, an undertaking had been given that if early in minute 4.) I960 a newly elected Federal Parliament asked for independencefor Nigeria the request would be granted and legislation enabling thecountry to become fully independent on 1st October, 1960, would beintroduced. The formal request had now been received and, as therewas no reason why the Governmenfs undertaking should not behonoured at once, the Colonial Secretary proposed to introduce thenecessary legislation, which would be short and uncontroversial, afterthe Whitsun recess. The request for independence had been coupled with a request for our support for Nigeria&apos;s application for full commonwealth membership. While a formal application could notbe made until after the Royal Assent had been given to the NigeriaIndependence Bill, this matter might be discussed informally at themeeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers in May.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith these proposals. The point was made, however, that inconnexion with the defence agreement which was about to be negotiated with Nigeria it should be made clear that the UnitedKingdom Government were not committed to give financial assistance for defence purposes after Nigeria had become independent.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (60) 25 for the grant of independence to Nigeria.concessions to African opinion. Nevertheless there was some chance that they could be persuaded to accept the proposals for constitutional advance in Nyasaland, particularly if they could be told that aconference would be held in the summer to consider the withdrawalof the reserved powers in respect of Southern Rhodesia. They wouldbe much more reluctant to acquiesce in the early release of Dr. Banda.The Colonial Secretary said that he recognised that it wasnecessary to do everything possible to meet apprehensions that the government&apos;s plan would lead to disorder. Adequate precautionshad in fact been taken. It was not now envisaged that reinforcements from the United Kingdom would have to be employed. It might bethat Dr. Banda would refuse to give evidence to the monckton commission unless all detainees in Nyasaland were released; butit was likely that, if released, he would be willing to take part inconstitutional discussions. It was essential that, in return for our agreement to hold a constitutional conference on Southern Rhodesia,we should obtain agreement to the early release of Dr. Banda.Without this there was little prospect of securing African co-operation in talks on constitutional development in Nyasaland.In discussion it was suggested that, in view of the likely reactions of Sir Roy Welensky and Sir Edgar Whitehead, we should be readyto consider retaining Dr. Banda in custody until a date somewhatlater than 8th March. The Commonwealth Secretary should be free to seek further instructions on this point, in the light of the progress made in his talks.The Cabinet-Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to conduct discussions with Sir Roy Welensky and Sir Edgar Whitehead on thelines indicated in the course of their discussion.
5. The Colonial Secretary reported that the Colonial PolicyCommittee had considered the recommendations of the constitutional committee in Uganda and had approved proposals for constitutional development there which would be announced by the Governor in thefollowing week. The main proposals were that the existing ExecutiveCouncil should be replaced by a council of Ministers with an unofficialmajority, and that the Legislative Council should be predominantlydirectly elected on a common roll, though the Governor would havepower to nominate members so as to retain a Government majority.It was not proposed to accept the recommendation that there shouldbe a Chief Minister. The Constitutional Committee had also recommended the introduction of universal adult suffrage. In viewof the repercussions which this would have on other territories, he proposed that for the present the Governor should say on this point that the Uganda Government were sympathetic to the principle ofa wide extension of the franchise and that the detailed implicationswere being studied. These decisions on constitutional advance were likely to provoke hostile reactions from the Kabaka of Buganda,whom it might in the last resort be necessary to replace, and from theother rulers. He therefore proposed that, at the same time asannouncing the Governmenfs intentions in regard to therecommendations of the Constitutional Committee, the governor should renew the pledge to maintain the position of the rulers andshould also announce that it was intended to set up an enquiry intothe future pattern of government in Uganda.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet with these proposals for constitutional advance in Uganda,which would be slower than in Tanganyika but faster than that nowproposed for Kenya. Some misgiving was expressed about the effectof the proposed announcement on the extension of the franchise.Since, however, a number of important recommendations of theConstitutional Committee were to be rejected, it was desirable thatthe Government should show a sympathetic attitude to the principleof universal adult franchise. On balance, therefore, it was agreedthat the formula proposed by the Colonial Secretary should beadopted.The Cabinet Approved the proposals for constitutional development in uganda, as outlined by the Colonial Secretary.Channel Tunnel,(previous reference:C.C. (59) 45thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Transport and the Foreign Secretary (C. (60) 12 and C. (60) 18)about the Channel Tunnel project.The Minister of Transport said that officials had now examined&apos;the problems involved. Their conclusions were that, despite theserious effects on the ports of Dover, Folkestone and Newhaven, the project would be acceptable on economic grounds; that it should beprivately financed; and that, if it proved a commercial proposition,there might be considerable political advantages in it. A finalassessment could not be made until the International Study group had completed its report, which was expected within the next fewweeks. Meanwhile it was desirable that the co-Chairman of theGroup should have a general indication of the Governmenfs attitude to the project. He might be told that the Government were preparedto look sympathetically at the project if a feasible and commerciallyviable scheme were produced which was capable of attracting thenecessary capital.The Foreign Secretary said that the French Government had made it clear that, while they did not intend to participate in the(previous reference:CM. (55) 23rdConclusions,Minute 11.)
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,18th February, 1960.project financially, they were in favour of it. British support for itwould be consistent with our general policy of cooperation with europe. A negative or even neutral attitude would lay theGovernment open to criticism. The project would offer a field for Anglo-French co-operation, and it would be important to consult theFrench Government at the right time about the further action to betaken.In discussion the following points were raised:(a) The Tunnel would practically eliminate Dover, Folkestoneand Newhaven as passenger ports and would also affect Harwich;and a considerable unemployment problem would be created in thesetowns. Nevertheless, the project was likely, on balance, to be toour general economic advantage.(b) In view of the size of the undertaking, it was probable thatGovernment financial assistance in some form or other would in due course become necessary. In any case the project would place anadditional burden of capital investment on the railways. From thispoint of view it would be unwise to give any indication at this stage that the Government welcomed it.(c) The view was expressed that, with the rapid developmentof air transport, the economic arguments for a Channel Tunnel were of less weight than they had been. It would not be possible to takea definite view about its commercial prospects until the InternationalStudy Group had completed their report. It would then be necessaryto examine the project in detail, and to obtain the views of industry on it.(d) The military advantages or disadvantages were not of sufficient weight to be decisive either way.The general view of the Cabinet was that, on grounds ofinternational policy, an indication of the Governments attitude tothe Channel Tunnel should be given in the terms proposed by theMinister of Transport.The Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations in C. (60) 12.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of transport to consider the timing of further consultations with theFrench Government about future action in respect ofthe Channel Tunnel project, and about the timing of any announcement of the Governments attitude towards the project.
