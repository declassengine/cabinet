Battle of britain:PermanentMemoirial1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Air (C. (60) 125) about the possibility of apermanent memorial to commemorate the Battle of Britain.The Secretary of State for Air said that those who had lost their lives in the Battle were commemorated in the Battle of Britainmemorial chapel in Westminster Abbey, but there was no memorialto commemorate the event itself. He felt that public opinion would welcome such a memorial, which should preferably be erected by thenation rather than by the Royal Air Force. If the Cabinet approvedthis proposal in principle, the Minister of Works might be asked toappoint a small committee to consider what form the memorial shouldtake.In discussion the Cabinet noted that, except for the chapelin Westminster Abbey, there were no public memorials in Londoncommemorating victories in the Second World War. The proposal fora Battle of Britain memorial to be erected by the nation would require a resolution in Parliament. It would be desirable to avoid anycontroversy about the respective achievements of the three Services inthe war. It was suggested that the unique signiiicance of the Battle of britain would become established as a matter of history, whether ornot a memorial was erected.The Prime Minister suggested that further consideration shouldbe given to the proposal for a Battle of Britain memorial in relation tothe general question whether there should be memorialscommemorating other victories in the Second World War.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theService Ministers and the Minister of Works, to consider thedesirability of erecting public memorials commemoratingvictories in the Second World War, and to report to theCabinet.Nuclear *2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the weapons        Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Defence (C. (60) 123) on thePOLARIS      facilities which the United States Government wished to obtain for(Previous        their submarines in Scotland.Reference:C.C. (60) 48th The Minister of Defence said that we had originally proposed to conclusions) the United States Government that they should offer us a simpleoption to buy POLARIS submarines, if at any time we wished to doso, in return for the facilities we provided in Scotland. The UnitedStates Government, however, were only willing to offer us the optionin a form which would associate our own possible requirements withthe project they had put to the North Atlantic Council for mediumrange ballistic missiles to be deployed on the Continent of Europe.This project was unwelcome to us and since there was little prospect,on financial grounds, of our being able to afford polaris submarines for several years, it would be preferable to omit any reference to the option from the proposed agreement to provide thefacilities for the United States submarines in Scotland. The UnitedStates naval authorities regarded the Clyde area as the only suitableplace for the facilities they needed. While this choice, near a largecentre of population, would no doubt give rise to some controversy, he felt that it should be accepted. The project would be of generaladvantage to the West, and our association with the United States init would enable us to bring additional influence to bear on the* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET58020-4 b 2
development of this important new element in deterrent power. Butit remained necessary to secure satisfactory arrangements for consultation and control over the use of the facilities.The Foreign Secretary said that we could not expect to have thesame degree of control over the operations of United States submarinesas we had over those of United States aircraft based in the UnitedKingdom. He felt, however, that it should be possible to reach an understanding with the United States Government which would be satisfactory to public opinion in this country. The United states authorities were willing to give a private assurance on control outside territorial waters that would reaffirm the undertaking given by president Eisenhower in 1953 that in the event of an emergency theUnited States would take every possible step to consult with Britainand other allies. As regards any public statement on this point, theUnited States might wish to avoid an undertaking which might undulyrestrict the facilities they had in other countries, such as Japan. our aim should be to reach agreement on a formula for public use whichwould indicate that in an emergency the United States Governmentwould use their best endeavours to consult with their British and other allies on the use of POLARIS missiles as well as on the use of nuclear weapons generally.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It would be preferable that the proposed public statement should not indicate that there could be no certainty of consultation inan emergency. We should endeavour to obtain the agreement of theUnited States Government to a form of words as close as possible tothe private assurance they had already offered us. The other conditionswhich had been agreed, on consultation and control in territorial waters, were satisfactory; but their importance should not be over-emphasised in any public statement, since it would be generally feltthat the main problem was control over the launching of missiles fromsubmarines at sea.(b) Responsible public opinion would be likely to support thegrant of the facilities proposed, though some adverse comment inScotland might be caused initially by the choice of the Clyde area. Itwould be helpful to make known any information that could be givenabout nuclear storage facilities which United States forces had nearlarge towns in their own country.(c) The extent to which satisfactory arrangements could be madefor the reception of United States sailors and their families could notbe determined until there had been consultations with localauthorities. It was, however, important that there should be nopremature disclosure of the project. Any activities likely to attractattention, including consultations with local authorities, should be deferred until an agreement had been announced. It should, however,be possible to proceed with unobtrusive arrangements for the laying of moorings when the United States Government had confirmed their agreement to the use of Holy Loch.(d) The financial arrangements to be made with the United StatesGovernment should, so far as possible, be similar to those adopted for united States Air Force bases in the United Kingdom. In general the aim should be that the United States would pay for all their require-ments except land.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that theUnited States Government had been informed that the proposals under discussion with them were subject to endorsement by theCabinet. He felt that the proposals were in general acceptable and tothe mutual advantage of both countries. It would be recognised thatwe could not have the same degree of control over the operation ofUnited States submarines at sea as we had over United States aircraftbased in the United Kingdom, and it would be necessary to make it
CommonwealthEconomicConsultativeCouncil3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that three mainsubjects would be discussed at the meeting of the commonwealth economic Consultative Council in the following week.The first was the general question of the sterling area balance ofpayments and the world economic situation. It was hoped that commonwealth Finance Ministers would express opinions about theprospects of world trade. There would be particular interest inascertaining the Canadian view of the likely duration of the presentpause in economic expansion in the United States.On the subject of development, the meeting would considerreports by Commonwealth officials on Commonwealth co-operation in African development, and on exchanges of technical and other experts between Commonwealth countries. These matters had bothbeen raised at the meeting of Commonwealth Prime Minister in May.While it did not seem possible to propose a special scheme for Africandevelopment, we should as far as possible support a constructivepolicy for the provision of expert assistance between commonwealth countries.The other main subject was that of the closer association of theUnited Kingdom with European countries. The Lord Privy Sealwould explain to Commonwealth Ministers that recent meetings withthe Federal German and Italian Governments made the prospects fora settlement more encouraging. This made it necessary to explore thevarious possibilities for a settlement in Europe, with a view to seeinghow far the interests of Commonwealth countries might be affected.In order to avoid causing alarm, it would be necessary to make it clearthat we were not at present engaged in negotiations with members ofthe European Economic Community (E.E.C.) and that we were notputting specific proposals to the Commonwealth.The Lord Privy Seal said that he would explain that there were broadly two possibilities. The first, which had been mentioned by theGerman Government, was that the E.E.C. might as a unit join theEuropean Free Trade Association (E.F.T.A.). It would not serve our interests to propose a solution of this sort ourselves; and, although itmight have political attractions for the E.E.C. since it would allow them to develop their separate political entity, it was not in fact likelyclear that, as with all nuclear weapons, we could rely on theco-operation of the United States as a matter of good faith betweenallies.In view of the conditions put forward by the United states authorities, it would be preferable not to press further at this stage foran option to obtain POLARIS submarines of our own. any requirement there might be would be more likely to be met throughthe close relations between the Royal Navy and the United states navy and the willingness of the United States Government further todevelop technical co-operation.The terms of the announcement would need further considerationwhen agreement had finally been reached with the United StatesGovernment. Meanwhile, the United States Government should beinformed that the proposals already put to them were in generalacceptable to the Cabinet, subject to a satisfactory formula for apublic statement on control.The Cabinet.......Approved the proposals in C. (60) 123, subject to the points made in discussion and to agreement being reached with theUnited States Government about a satisfactory public state-ment regarding consultation and control.
to be acceptable to the E.E.C. because it was very similar to theoriginal free trade area solution which they had already rejected. But,if this solution were proposed, it would not give rise to difficulties asregards Commonwealth free entry and there would be no question ofthe United Kingdom having to accept the common agricultural policyof the E.E.C.The broad alternative would be some form of closer association between the United Kingdom and other members of E.F.T.A. and theE.E.C., which would involve to some degree the acceptance of acommon external tariff. This immediately raised problems of commonwealth preference and free entry. The difficulty at theforthcoming meeting with Commonwealth Ministers would be toobtain their views on how much derogation from the principle of free entry would be tolerable without unduly alarming them. He fullyagreed that it would be essential to make it clear that we were not atthis stage in the course of negotiations with the E.E.C. and that wewere not putting specific proposals to Commonwealth countries.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith the way in which it was proposed to explore the Europeanproblem at the meeting of the Commonwealth Economic consultative council. It was important to avoid arousing suspicions that we intended to seek a solution at the expense of commonwealth interests. Similarly it would be undesirable at present to let theimpression develop that any solution would be bound to be tothe disadvantage of British agriculture and horticulture. In this connexion it was fortunate that some of the members of the E.E.C. hadgood reasons for not pressing forward with their common agricultural policy.The Cabinet Approved the course which the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Lord Privy Seal proposed to follow at the meeting ofthe Commonwealth Economic Consultative Council.Distributionof IndustryNorth BritishLocomotiveCompany(previous reference:C.C. (60) 45thConclusions,Minute 7)4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Scotland and the Minister of Transport (C. (60) 132 and 133)about the North British Locomotive Company.The Secretary of State for Scotland recalled that this company,which employed over 3,000 people in Glasgow, would, unless theysucceeded in obtaining new contracts for the manufacture oflocomotives, be obliged to discharge almost the whole of their labour force by the time their existing orders were completed in the early part of 1961. Under new management the efficiency and competitive-ness of the company had been substantially improved and there was reason to hope that, given more time, its position could be still furtherimproved and its activities diversified. Its tender for the manufactureof a new type of diesel locomotive required by the British transport commission had, however, proved to be some 8 to .10 per cent, abovethe lowest tender submitted and some 4 per cent, above the lowesttender likely to be regarded by the Commission as acceptable. the delivery dates offered by the company were, moreover, unattractive tothe Commission.The Secretary of State proposed that the special preferencescheme (which provided that, if firms in development areas were awarded less than 25 per cent, of a Government contract incompetitive tender, they were given the opportunity to revise theirtenders so as to obtain up to that proportion of the contract at no extra cost to the Department concerned), should be applied to this contract, and that the Commission should be asked to approach thecompany on that basis.  Although the special preference scheme at
present applied only to Government contracts, a Treasury working party had recommended its extension to the nationalised industries and this recommendation was being considered by the Departmentsconcerned. The only alternative to this proposal seemed to be notonly a substantial increase in the level of unemployment in Glasgowbut, in yet one more nationalised industry, the concentration of allmanufacturing capacity in the south.The Minister of Transport said that, while he was impressed bythe difficulties which&apos;would be caused by the closing down of thecompany, he felt serious objection to the course proposed. He was doubtful whether it would be proper to ask the Commission to invitethe company to tender again at a lower price in order to meet the pricequoted by one of their competitors, and whether it was right to reducethe size of the contract placed with a company which intended toremain in the business of manufacturing locomotives in order to obtaintime for another company to diversify their activities. Nor was itcertain that the North British Locomotive Company, even if able toreduce their prices, would be able to meet the delivery dates requiredby the Commission.Discussion showed some division of opinion in the Cabinet onthis issue. There was considerable force in the objection to extending the special preference scheme in a particular case before the general question of its extension to the nationalised industries generally hadbeen decided. Any interference with the commercial judgment of theBritish Transport Commission would be politically unwelcome and difficult to reconcile with the Governments determination to make the nationalised industries more efficient. On the other hand, the NorthBritish Locomotive Company had received from the Exchequer a loan of  1J millions which would be lost if they were obliged to close down.Any aggravation of unemployment in Scotland would have an unfortunate political impact. Moreover, if the company were able onreconsideration to offer more satisfactory delivery dates, the course proposed would not involve the Commission in additional expenditure. The case for giving the company specially favourable treatment would, however, be weakened if any of the other tenders forthe contract came from firms in development areas.The Prime Minister said that more information was required before a decision could be reached. The Cabinet should be more fully informed of the manner in which the special preference scheme had operated as regards Government contracts in particular whether ithad ever been applied to individual firms and what had been there actions of private industry to it. They should also be informed what other firms in development areas, if any, had tendered for theTransport Commission^ contract and whether the Commission^ ownworkshops were among the tenderers. If so, it would be useful to know the extent to which account was taken of overhead costs inthe calculation of the workshops&apos; tender. This additional information should, if possible, be put before the Cabinet at a meeting in thefollowing week.The Cabinet (1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to circulate a memorandum describing the working of the specialpreference scheme for Government contracts and setting out the arguments for extending it to the nationalised industries.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to ascertain from the british transport Commission whether any firms in development areas, other than the North British Locomotive Company,had submitted tenders for the new type  of diesel
mSooth-east asia treaty organisation laos(previous reference :C.C. (59) 60thConclusions,Minute 7)5. The Foreign Secretary said that the King of Laos had apparently withdrawn his support from the coalition government ofPrince Souvanna Phouma and there was reason to think that GeneralPhoumi, who had until recently been supported by the United StatesGovernment, would, unless he were able to obtain the Premiership,divide the country in arms. This might well lead to intervention by countries belonging to the Sino-Soviet bloc, in which case the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation might be called upon to take action.The situation might deteriorate and he would keep the cabinet informed.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.(previous reference :C.C. (60) 49thConclusions,Minute 2)Congo Republic 6. The Foreign Secretary said that the United Kingdom Govern-ment had been giving full support to the United Nations in theirintervention in the Congo. The United Nations now had some 15,000troops in the country but Mr. Lumumba, who claimed to be PrimeMinister of the Congo, had been successful in obtaining considerable support, probably including some military personnel, from the soviet bloc. The latest known development was that Colonel Mobutu,formerly Chief of Staff of the Congolese Army, had declared that theArmy was taking over supreme power in the country and thatMr. Lumumba, Mr. Ileo, the nominal Prime Minister, and PresidentKasavubu had been suspended from their functions until the crisis wasresolved. Our representative at the United Nations had been instructed to support a resolution in the Security Council calling on individual countries to refrain from intervention in the Congoand expressing support for the actions taken and proposed bythe Secretary-General.Discussion showed that there was general agreement with thecourse proposed by the Foreign Secretary. Open support of ColonelMobutu or opposition to Mr. Lumumba was likely to prove counter-productive, though it would be right to follow this course privately.The Cabinet Agreed that the United Kingdom Government shouldcontinue to give full support to the United Nations&apos;intervention in the Congo.Middle East(previous references :C.C. (60) 31stConclusions,Minute 7 andC.C. (58) 73rdConclusions,Minute 2)Jordan7. The Foreign Secretary said that, following the assassinationof the late Prime Minister of Jordan, the King of Jordan had mobilisedthe Army and had indicated that he was contemplating military actionagainst Syria. The Secretary-General of the United Nations had,however, offered his good offices in obtaining satisfaction for theassassination of the Prime Minister and, under pressure from theUnited Kingdom and the United States Governments, the Kingappeared to be less determined to attack Syria. If, however, theSecretary-General failed to satisfy the Jordan Government, or if therewere renewed provocation by the United Arab Republic ora secessionist movement in Syria, there was still a considerable risk that the King might undertake some military adventure.locomotives; and whether the Commission^ own work-shops were among the tenderers and, if so, on what basistheir tender was calculated.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at an early meeting.
united nations(previous reference:C.C. (59) 57thConclusions,Minute 4)GeneralAssembly8. The Prime Minister said that it had now been announced thatthe President of the United States would speak at an early stage at theforthcoming General Assembly of the United Nations. The Presidentdid not, however, propose to remain in New York for the debate nor was he prepared to participate in discussions with other representa-tives. There was a serious danger that the Soviet Union leader,Mr. Khrushchev, with the help of the representatives of otherCommunist countries, would dominate the meeting and secureconsiderable political advantage. In particular, he would seek to impress the representatives of the new members of the United Nations,who were mostly African States. It was probable that, in addition tothose already known to be going, a number of other Heads ofGovernment would attend the General Assembly, including the PrimeMinister of India and the President of Ghana. In these circumstances it might be desirable for him to be prepared to attend the general assembly at some stage, in order to make some constructive counterproposals to whatever statements might be made by Mr. Khrushchev.Moreover, it might be necessary to take action in the general assembly in order to prevent a serious deterioration in the situation inthe Congo.Discussion showed that the Cabinet agreed that it was likely that circumstances might demand the presence of the Prime Minister atsome stage in the General Assembly. A final decision about this, andthe question at what stage such a visit should take place, could onlybe settled in the light of developments in the next few days, and perhaps not until the President of the United States and the leader ofthe Soviet Union had spoken in the debate.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would defer for the timebeing a decision whether to attend the General Assembly ofthe United Nations.Council ofEurope(previous reference:CM. (55) 21stConclusions,Minute 4)9. The Lord Privy Seal said that a Council of EuropeConvention for the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes had been signed in 1957 and had since been ratified by six of the fifteen member Statesof the Council. The objections to ratification by ourselves had nowbeen overcome and, with the agreement of the Colonial Secretary andthe other Ministers concerned, he proposed that we should now ratify the convention, with the reservation that disputes concerning a colonial or a dependant territory would be expressly excluded.The Cabinet-Agreed that the United Kingdom Government should ratify the Council of Europe Convention for the Peaceful Settle-ment of Disputes, subject to the reservation that disputesconcerning a colonial or dependent territory should be excluded.C.C. 50 (60)The Minister of Defence said that in these circumstances theposition of the United Kingdom military mission in Jordan wasdelicate. On balance it would not be advisable to withdraw themission unless and until Jordan became involved in open hostilities.Meanwhile, a plan had been completed for the evacuation of british nationals if necessary, but no other military action by British forces was at present contemplated.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Foreign Secretary andthe Minister of Defence.
international monetary Fund(previous reference:C.C. (60) 40thConclusions,Minute 2)10. The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that on 7th july the Cabinet had deferred a decision on the question whether the UnitedKingdom should assume the obligations of Article VIII of theInternational Monetary Fund Agreement. It was likely that, at theforthcoming meeting of the Fund, Germany and perhaps other european countries would indicate that they were ready to move to article VIII. For the United Kingdom, such a move would be littlemore than a formal recognition of the existing situation. He invited the views of the Cabinet on the question whether we should encourageor discourage this step.In discussion the Cabinet confirmed their earlier view that therewas no strong reason why we should encourage such a move at thepresent time. On the other hand, if the other countries principally concerned decided to accept the obligations of Article VIII, confidence in sterling would be damaged if we were to hold back. It was therefore desirable that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should have discretion,at the forthcoming meeting of the Fund, to follow whatever courseseemed desirable, having regard to the indications which othercountries might give of their intentions in this matter. We should notencourage other countries to initiate the move; but, if there were ageneral desire to take such a step, we should not seek to discourage itand should be ready to participate in it.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to be guided at theforthcoming meeting of the International Monetary Fund bythe views expressed in their discussion as regards a move to article VIII of the International Monetary Fund Agreement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th September, 1960.
