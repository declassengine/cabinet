1135CC. 30Cyprus.(previous reference:CC. (60) 25thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Foreign Secretary said that, although a number of othermatters of importance were still outstanding e.g., the amount offinancial assistance and the exact delimitation of the sovereign areas there were indications that the point to which the Greek Cypriotsnow attached most importance was the future of the sovereign areasin the event of our deciding that it was no longer necessary to retainBritish sovereignty over them. The Greek Cypriots wanted some assurance that these areas would never be ceded to Turkey, and thatthere would be no danger of a Turkish veto on their reversion to theRepublic of Cyprus. On the other hand, it was important for us toavoid any commitment about the future of the areas which would givethe Greek Cypriots an incentive to work for the removal of british sovereignty over them. Moreover, we might, in certain circumstances,wish to transfer our bases to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat the possibility of a satisfactory settlement of the whole Cyprusquestion ought not, in the last resort, to be jeopardised by refusing togive the Greek Cypriots some reassurance about the future ofthe sovereign areas. Officials of the Departments concerned were examining what form such a reassurance might take.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Law of theSea.(previous reference:CC. (60) 29thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Foreign Secretary recalled that the Cabinet had agreed at their last meeting that the Canadian and United States Govern-ments should be invited to take the initiative in approaching othercountries which might be willing to support a convention dealing with both the territorial sea and fishery zones, on the lines of the proposal which had failed to secure the necessary majority at the recentInternational Conference on the Law of the Sea. The CanadianPrime Minister had been found unwilling to commit his Governmentto this course without consultation with his Cabinet; and a parallelapproach had therefore been made to the United States Government.Their reaction was not yet known, but it was becoming increasinglyurgent to initiate also discussions designed to lead to an agreementdealing with fisheries alone among the North Atlantic countries.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that, while it would be preferable to await the reactions of theUnited States Government to the approach to which the foreign secretary had referred, we must now take the initiative in callingtogether a preparatory conference with Norway, Iceland and otherNorth Atlantic countries to discuss the formulation of a fisheriesagreement. Unless the Canadian and United States Governmentsproved finally unwilling to support a parallel convention dealing with both the territorial sea and fisheries, we should advance the conception of a North Atlantic fisheries pact as within the context of amore general convention.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries, to propose to the icelandic, Norwegian and other Governments an earlyconference to discuss the conclusion of a North atlantic fisheries pact.
Meeting ofCommon-wealthPrimeMinisters,1960.(previous reference: &apos;C.C. (60) 29thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet were informed of the further progress of theMeeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.The South African representative, Mr. Eric Louw, had asked that a restricted meeting should be held, attended only by Heads of delegations, so that he might refer to the personal criticisms whichthe Prime Minister of Malaya had directed against him in a statement to the Press. At this restricted meeting, which had been held on theprevious day, the other Heads of Delegations had taken theopportunity of expressing their views on the racial policy of the UnionGovernment and its effects on relations between South africa and other members of the Commonwealth. In this way, as a result ofMr. Louw&apos;s own initiative, the Prime Ministers had been able fully to ventilate their feelings about racial discrimination in South Africa.There remained, however, the problem of finding an acceptable meansof dealing with this subject in the communique to be issued at the endof the Meeting. The alternatives were to include in the communiquea brief objective statement of the course which the discussions hadtaken or, if that were not acceptable to Mr. Louw, to issue a separatestatement in which the views of the other delegations would be morefreely expressed. The Cabinet considered that the first of these alternatives was to be preferred.The Cabinet were also informed that it had not been possible to dissuade Mr. Louw from raising at the Meeting the question whetherSouth Africa could remain within the Commonwealth after adopting a republican form of Constitution. On the other hand, it now appeared that other Commonwealth delegations were unlikely, in a discussion on that question, to oppose South Africa&apos;s continued membership. It seemed likely that, if this matter were raised,the other Commonwealth delegations would content themselves withtaking note of the intentions of the Union Government without committing themselves finally to the view that South Africa could continue in the Commonwealth if she became a republic.The Cabinet Took note of this report on the further progress of theMeeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.Common-wealthMinisters.DiplomaticImmunity.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (60) 77) on diplomatic immunity for commonwealth Ministers and their staffs while on official visits to theUnited Kingdom and for the staffs of Commonwealth organisationsestablished in this country.The Minister of State, Commonwealth Relations Office, said that under section 4 of the International Organisations (Immunities and privileges) Act, 1950, the diplomatic immunities enjoyed by foreignenvoys could be conferred on representatives of foreign Powersattending international conferences in the United Kingdom. the attorney-General had advised that Ministers of commonwealth countries attending conferences here did not enjoy diplomaticimmunity and privileges, and it seemed appropriate that legislation should be introduced to put them in a not less favourable position than the representatives of foreign Powers.In addition the Minister of State suggested that consideration should be given to the possibility of according to commonwealth organisaitons established in this country immunities similar to thoseaccorded under the Act of 1950 to international organisations which included foreign Powers.Discussion showed that there was general agreement that legislation should be introduced at an appropriate time to make possible the grant of immunities to Ministers of Commonwealth
90countries and their staffs visiting the United Kingdom on the same lines as were provided by the Act of 1950 in relation to representativesof foreign Powers. Further consideration should, however, be givento the proposal to accord immunities to the commonwealth economic Committee and other Commonwealth organisations whichwere, or were to be, established in this country, especially in relationto liability to United Kingdom income tax. While, therefore, thedecision on Ministers attending conferences could conveniently be announced to the Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers that week, it would be preferable not to mention the second proposal until it had been further examined. With the increasing number ofmissions and organisations to which diplomatic immunities wereaccorded, it might even be necessary to consider whether theGovernment should not assume ultimate responsibility for the civil liabilities which were extinguished.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would inform theMeeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers that theGovernment intended to introduce legislation for thebenefit of Commonwealth Ministers and their staffsattending conferences in this country, on the lines of theInternational Organisations (Immunities and Privileges)Act, 1950.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, to give furtherconsideration to the question of according diplomaticimmunities to Commonwealth organisations established inthe United Kingdom.Pensions.(previous references:C.C. (59) 62ndConclusions,Minute 6 andC.C. (59) 30thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the LordChancellor and the Minister of Pensions (C. (60) 79 and 80) on the timing of the next increase in retirement pensions.The Lord Chancellor said that the Social Services Committee had considered three alternative methods of timing the first move to giveeffect to the Governmenfs Election pledge that they would &quot; ensurethat pensioners continue to share in the good things which a steadilyexpanding economy will bring &quot;.The first method was to introduce legislation before the summer recess to effect an increase in pensions in the coming autumn. TheCommittee were, however, satisfied that there was no satisfactorymeans of financing such an increase: it would be inappropriate toincrease contributions so shortly before the inception of the newgraduated pensions scheme in April 1961 and the Committee had accepted the view of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that an increase should not be financed either directly by the Exchequer or by further reduction of the National Insurance Fund.The second alternative was to legislate in the coming autumn fora pensions increase to take effect in the following April. TheCommittee had been impressed with the view that this course was likely to arouse strong pressure for postponement of the new scheme,since employers would demand more time to consider, in the light ofchanged circumstances, whether or not to contract out of it. If,however, it was reasonable to think that such pressure could be successfully resisted, this second alternative was likely to be the most satisfactory.The third course was to defer legislation until after April 1961,which would mean either introducing a Bill so shortly after that date as to lay the Government open to a charge of bad faith or deferring
the actual operation of the increase in pensions until the early part of1962 over two years after the General Election.The Social Services Committee had concluded that the best course was to reconsider the matter in the autumn, and the LordChancellor proposed that a Bill should be prepared in the meantime.The Government would then be in a position to decide whether tointroduce it in the autumn or to defer it until some time in 1961.The Minister of Pensions said that it was difficult to assess howstrong would be the pressure for postponement of the new scheme ifthe Government were to introduce in the autumn of 1960 legislationchanging the rates of both contributions and benefits. He was satisfied that there would be at least some risk that the Governmentwould be compelled to give way, which would be very damaging tothe Exchequer; and from this point of view it was desirable that any move to increase pensions should be made as long as possible inadvance of the date for the new scheme. Pressure was already building up for a pensions increase in fulfilment of the Governments pledgeand it must be expected that this would be intensified when theGovernment Actuary&apos;s quinquennial report on the National insurance fund and the Ministers review of the adequacy of current benefitswere published. Moreover, the highest pension increase which was at present contemplated was likely to be regarded as modest in comparison with public expectation and this was a strong argument infavour of introducing it sooner rather than later. The national insurance Fund totalling over  1,450 millions was already being rundown by about  50 millions during the current financial year, and inthe Minister&apos;s view it would not be out of the question to finance apensions increase operating from, say, mid-December either byrunning down the Fund by a further  35 millions or by diverting the 30 millions surplus in the Industrial Injuries Fund.The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded the Cabinet that ithad been the established policy of the Government not to increasenational insurance benefits without a corresponding increase in contributions. To depart from this would be wholly incompatible with the Governments current economic policies and, while it seemedgenerally agreed that an autumn increase in pensions could not be financed by an increase in contributions, even that course wouldinvolve an increased charge on the Exchequer of some 10- 15 millions during the remaining part of the financial year. Inthe Chancellors view the earliest date for which the Governmentshould contemplate a pensions increase was April 1961 when it could appropriately be financed by increased contributions; but, if therewere any question that the legislation required to effect an increase from that date might lead to a postponement of the new pensions scheme, he would prefer to postpone it until after the introduction ofthat scheme. He must, moreover, warn the Cabinet that the increasing cost of the National Health Service was likely to make itimpossible to avoid an increase in the health service contribution inthe following spring or even sooner.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat the arguments against effecting any pension increase before april 196.1 were decisive. There had been a material increase in thegeneral standard of living since the last pension increase in January1958, but the Election pledge had contained no specific commitment on either the timing or the amount of a pension increase and there hadbeen no increase in the cost of living such as would justify an earlymove. Pressure for an increase before the following spring would doubtless become embarrassing, but in the last resort it might bepossible to anticipate a general increase in pensions by an increase inthe scale rates of national assistance, the effect of which would be to benefit those whose need was greatest. If legislation for a pensionincrease was to be introduced in the following autumn it would benecessary to make progress with drafting a Bill during the summer
SECRET - 7.C.C. 30 (60)and for this purpose to reach a decision on the form, if not the actualamount, of the increase, e.g., whether there should be differential ratesof pension for the older pensioners.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that legislation to increase retirement pensions shouldnot be introduced before the summer recess.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for the social services Committee to give further consideration to theform which a future pension increase might take.(3) Invited the Minister of Pensions thereafter to arrange for thepreparation of a Bill; and in due course to consult theSocial Services Committee on the timing of any announce-ment on the introduction of the Bill.(4) Invited the Minister of Pensions to consult the Social services committee on the wording of his report on the adequacy of current benefits, following the Government Actuary&apos;squinquennial review of the national insurance scheme.commercial policy.(previous references:C.C. (60) 28thConclusions,Minute 6 andC.C. (60) 16thConclusions,Minute 2.)Japan.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 78) suggesting the course to befollowed in negotiations for a commercial treaty with Japan.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Cabinet had authorised the President of the Board of Trade to resume negotiationswith Japan for a commercial treaty which would remove quantitative restrictions on Japanese exports to the United Kingdom, subject tothe safeguards that we should maintain restrictions on certain sensitiveproducts and retain the right to reimpose restrictions on other products if necessary. Our negotiators were in Tokyo and the talkswere already due to start. The President had suggested that theyshould tell the Japanese that we were ready to consider the terms of atreaty on the understanding that we would maintain restrictions onthe goods listed in Annex A to C. (60) 78. He would leave it to theJapanese to infer that the goods listed in Annex B, which were at present subject to restrictions, would be freed.If it became necessary to go further in order to secure asatisfactory agreement, the President thought we might have toconsider reducing or abolishing over a period the restrictions on someof the goods listed in Annex A. On the other hand, the economic policy Committee thought that canned pilchards, ships and boats, andclocks (all in Annex B) were sensitive items, and the President had undertaken to consider adding these to the list in Annex A if itappeared that the terms we were likely to obtain would not be entirely satisfactory. The President would keep the Cabinet informed aboutthe progress of negotiations and they would be able to consider theproposed agreement as a whole before any commitments were accepted.In discussion it was suggested that, since we were committedinternationally to placing our trade relations with the rest of the free world on a non-discriminatory basis, the Japanese might consider thatthe list in Annex A (which accounted for items making up half oftheir export trade) was too wide and tantamount to continueddiscrimination. On the other hand, they probably attached importance on political grounds to the conclusion of a treaty and theymight, therefore, be willing to pay this price. In the negotiations itwould certainly not be wise to adopt any more forthcoming position,at least until we were clear what restrictions the Japanese proposed toremove on our exports to Japan.   Tactically it might even be
Parliament. 7..  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.It was pointed out that, in order to meet the Parliamentary time-table, it was very desirable that the legislation consequent on theproposal that Ghana should remain in the Commonwealth afterbecoming a republic on 1st July should be introduced in the UnitedKingdom Parliament without delay. If, as was expected, the Meetingof Commonwealth Prime Ministers were to decide later that day thatGhana should remain in the Commonwealth as a republic, it wouldbe necessary for an announcement of this decision to be made publicimmediately., . preferable to include all sensitive items in our original list and tomake reductions only in return for worthwhile concessions.During the past year the value of Japanese exports to the UnitedKingdom had been  43 millions and that of her imports from usbetween  32- 35 millions. On political grounds it was important tomaintain Japan&apos;s position as part of the free world, and the extensionof trade between the two countries might be a significant factor forthis purpose. The terms of any agreement should, however, offer theprospect of significant economic advantages for the United Kingdom.Particular attention should be paid to safeguarding the position ofindustries manufacturing small items, such as clocks, and furtherconsideration might be given to the retention of import controls on non-transistorised radio and television apparatus and gramophones.We should recognise, however, that the addition to the listin Annex A of the items which the Economic Policy Committee felt to be sensitive might mean that two-thirds of the products exportedby Japan were subject to discrimination.Summing up the Prime Minister said that careful attention shouldbe paid to the way in which the negotiations with the Japanese were opened. There was a danger that if the talks were not going well itwould not be practicable to add to the list of sensitive items at a later stage; in any event, it would be desirable at the outset to concentrateas far as possible on the idea that both parties would provide a general indication of the concessions they would be prepared to consider.This was not a matter which need be hurried, and it might be to our advantage to learn the outcome of the commercial discussions whichthe Japanese were already holding with the Americans and the canadians. These factors should be taken into account in startingnegotiations on the basis suggested by the President of the Board ofTrade. The Cabinet should be kept informed of all significantdevelopments and should be consulted before any binding commit-ments were undertaken.The Cabinet-Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to open negotiations for a commercial treaty with Japan, as proposedin C. (60) 78, taking into account the points made in their discussion.
