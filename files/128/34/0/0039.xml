Disarmament.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 38thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Foreign Secretary said that the Governments of theUnited States and France were not in favour of an immediatemeeting of the Disarmament Commission and this suggestion wasnot likely to be pursued further. The Commission normally metimmediately before the General Assembly; and there might be a more general measure of support for the suggestion that the date of thismeeting should on this occasion be slightly advanced.Present indications were that the Soviet Government intendedto continue negotiations in the Conference on Nuclear Weapons Tests.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements by the Foreign Secretary.Cyprus.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 38thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet took note that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies had reached a final settlement ofall the issues outstanding in his negotiations with the Cypriot leaders.A financial settlement had been made within the limits approved bythe Cabinet on 30th June. This provided for general aid of 12 millions over a period of five years and, in addition, for specificpayments and commitments for particular purposes amounting to 2 - 34 millions. Final texts of the various agreements were now being prepared, and it was hoped that these would be initialled on 6th or7th July. They would be embodied in a White Paper which wouldbe presented to Parliament on 8th July.The Cabinet Took note of the arrangements for announcing the details ofthe settlement on the future of Cyprus.Cuba.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 10thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that the United StatesGovernment were taking such political and economic action as was open to them to bring pressure on the present Government of Cuba.In this the primary interest and responsibility was theirs. But Britishinterests were also involved, and it was important that the UnitedKingdom Government should not appear to be ignoring the protectionof those interests. A formal protest had been made to the CubanGovernment against the seizure of the refinery of the Shell petroleum company.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Shipping.CunardLiners.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 48thConclusions,Minute 1.)*4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the paymaster-General (C. (60) 90) on the replacement of the Cunardliners, the Queen Mary and the Queen Elizabeth.The Paymaster-General recalled that the Government had statedin their Election Manifesto that they intended &quot; to support the replacement of the &apos; Queen&apos; liners&quot;, and that they had sinceappointed a small Committee under the Chairmanship of LordChandos to advise them, on the assumption that the two liners wouldbe replaced, on such questions as the type of ship best suited for thepurpose, how it should be built and operated and how this shouldbe financed. The Chandos Committee had recommended that the queen Mary should be replaced by a ship of gross tonnage of* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
75,000 and that a decision on the replacement of the Queen Elizabethshould be deferred until 1968. It had also been recommended thatExchequer assistance for the replacement of the Queen Mary shouldbe subject to the capital cost not exceeding  30 millions, of which the cunard Company should be responsible for finding  12 millions asequity capital. The remainder, not exceeding  18 millions, should beprovided by the Government as loan capital bearing interest atA\ per cent, from the date on which the ship came into service andredeemable within 25 years (or less if the gross yield on the Cunardequity exceeded an average of 7 per cent). Interest would not be payable on the Government loan during the construction period,except to the extent that any Exchequer money drawn in the first twoyears would bear interest at 2\ per cent, for the remainder of theperiod.A sub-committee of the Economic Policy Committee had considered these recommendations and had concluded that failure to replace the Queen Mary would end our traditional supremacy inthe weekly trans-Atlantic service and that this would be damaging toBritish prestige and to our earnings of foreign currency. while recognising, therefore, that the Chandos recommendations containedan unusually large element of subsidy and might well be improved in certain respects by further negotiation with the Cunard Company,they considered that the conditions were not so onerous as to release the Government from their Election pledge.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that if increases in taxationwere to be avoided over the next few years it would hardly be possiblefor the Exchequer to take on any additional commitments. this project was not, in his view, an economic use of the national resources. The rate of interest and other features of the financial terms proposed would entail, at the best, an Exchequer subsidy ofsome  8 millions; and if, through a decline in the demand fortrans-Atlantic travel by sea, the project proved financially unsuccessfulthe commitment might be substantially greater. The terms proposedrepresented too high a price for a prestige project, especially in viewof other claims on the Exchequer, and were so unfavourable as to release the Government from their Election pledge. In his view, theright course was to retain only one ship on the trans-Atlantic serviceand to attempt to develop the service in co-operation, rather than in competition, with France and the United States. If, nevertheless, theCabinet decided to support the replacement of the Queen Mary, some improvement in the financial terms proposed was essential.Discussion showed that it was the general feeling of the Cabinetthat the replacement of the Queen Mary should be regarded as aneconomic rather than a prestige proposition and that it was reasonable to hope that it might prove financially successful. This view was supported by a recent report by an independent organisation, which contained carefully prepared forecasts of future trans-Atlanticpassenger traffic by sea and air. In 1958 the number of passengerscarried by sea had been about 940,000, representing 44 per cent, ofthe total of some 2 millions: it was estimated that by 1975 the totalnumber of trans-Atlantic passengers would have risen to over millions and that, while the proportion of those carried by sea wouldhave dropped to 29 per cent., their absolute number would have beendoubled. A new liner would have a worthwhile dollar-earning capacity, not merely through the passage money paid by landing anincreased number of visitors in the United Kingdom. Theconstruction work would provide a much needed stimulus to the shipbuilding industry.It would, however, be very desirable to obtain some improvementof the terms on which Exchequer assistance might be provided. Ifthe project were a financial success, the terms recommended by theChandos Committee would result in the Cunard Company&apos;s obtaining the whole profit. In view of the level of subsidies already provided
commercial policy.relaxation of import restrictions.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 31stConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 100) proposing the removal of restrictions on imports of canned fruit and a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (60) 105) on the cost of relaxingimport restrictions.The President of the Board of Trade said that there was no economic justification for retaining the restrictions on the import of canned fruit. The canned fruit industry in the United States and canada would welcome the removal of these restrictions, and it was important to retain their goodwill in the interest of maintaining andC.C. 39 (60)by the French and United States Governments, there was no hopethat the Company would agree to a rate of interest higher thanA\ per cent., but efforts should be made to negotiate improvements in the following respects:(i) On the basis of the estimated profits, the full rate of interest on the Government loan should be payable in respect of theconstruction period.(ii) The Company had already agreed to accelerate redemptionof the Government loan if the gross yield on their equity shouldexceed an average of 7 per cent., but they should now be invited toagree either to pay an increased rate of interest in those circumstancesor to forego any reduction in the rate if the yield fell below 3 per cent.This would be preferable to any arrangement by which the actualprofits earned were shared between the Company and theGovernment.(iii) The Government should not be expected to assume any responsibility for insurance of the ship.Summing up this part of the discussion the Prime Minister saidthat the general view of the Cabinet was that the Government should proceed with replacement of the Queen Mary on the best terms theycould obtain from the Cunard Company. As a matter of tactics,however, they should represent to the Company that they were willingto proceed with the project only if the Company would make concessions on the lines agreed in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.In further discussion it was agreed that the advice of theAdmiralty should be taken into account in drawing up the specificationfor the new ship. The specification should be submitted for theGovernments approval and competitive tenders for the contractshould thereafter be invited, as recommended by the ChandosCommittee, from the main shipbuilding areas of the country.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Government should support the replacement of the Queen Mary on the best terms they could obtain from the Cunard Company.(2) Invited the Paymaster-General, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofTransport, to formulate on the lines agreed in their discussion revised terms of Government assistance for negotiation with the Company.(3) Invited the Minister of Transport, in the light of conclusion (2), to enter into negotiations with the cunard company and in due course to inform the Cabinet of theresult.(4) Agreed that, in due course, competitive tenders should beinvited for the construction of the new ship.
increasing British exports to North America. It was not likely thatthis relaxation would result in any significant increase in our importbill, since our consumption of canned fruit was already high. there might be some substitution of dollar imports for Commonwealthcanned fruit, but the Commonwealth product would continue to enjoy a substantial tariff preference. He therefore proposed that thewithdrawal of the import restrictions on canned fruit, and also ondollar wines, beer and gin, which were of negligible commercialimportance, should be announced by 15th July. This was the date when the trade would expect to learn about the arrangements for thenext quota year, which would begin on 1st September.The Commonwealth Secretary said that there was a considerablerisk that this action would affect adversely the import of canned fruitfrom Commonwealth countries. The Commonwealth countries concerned should therefore have reasonable notice of our intentions.It was particularly necessary that Australia should have this advancenotice, because of current difficulties in connexion with purchases of australian wheat by United Kingdom millers. A more generalobjection to this proposal was that a further relaxation of import restrictions at this time might seem inconsistent with the recentmeasures which the Government had taken to restrain internaldemand and to improve the balance of payments. The attitude ofthe United States Government to the wool textile tariff and othermatters had not been very helpful and it was unlikely that this wouldbe affected by the early removal of restrictions on canned fruit. Onall these grounds it might be preferable to postpone for some time theaction proposed in C. (60) 100.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The other Commonwealth countries concerned had beenaware for some time that the restrictions on the import of canned fruit were likely to be removed when any further measures of this sort became possible.(b) The increase in the import bill due to the removal of restrictions during the past two years amounted at present to about 100 millions a year, of which rather more than half representedadditional dollar expenditure. But total imports into the UnitedKingdom had increased by about  830 millions a year comparedwith two years ago, and the cost of removing restrictions represented at most about one-eighth of the total increase in the import bill. Onthe other hand, it could be argued that any further increase in thecost of imports was a serious matter, in view of the balance ofpayments prospects.(c) Although it was generally agreed that the removal of import restrictions was in the best interests of our exports, it might be thatthose interests would be better served if a relaxation in respect of canned fruit were deferred until the beginning of 1961. A moderateincrease in the existing quotas would be sufficient to show that wewere aware of the importance which North American suppliersattached to this matter.The Cabinet (1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to make an early announcement of a moderate increase in the quotas forcanned fruit from 1st September, 1960.(2) Agreed to reconsider in due course the removal of restrictionson imports of canned fruit early in 1961.Colonial 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the colonial development Secretary (C. (60) 101) about the future functions and financialCorporation.    structure of the Colonial Development Corporation.
The Colonial Secretary recalled that in the previous year it had become apparent that the Corporation would be unable to dischargeits obligations under the Overseas Resources Development Act anda Committee had been appointed, under the chairmanship of LordSinclair of Cleeve, to consider whether any change in its financial structure was required. The Committees report, which had been published as a White Paper, was to be debated in the House ofCommons on an Opposition Motion on 7th July. The principal objectof the Motion was to secure that the Corporation was empowered toextend its activities into territories which had been grantedindependence and, although this proposal was favoured by some ofthe Government^ own supporters, the Colonial Secretary intendedto resist it.It had already been agreed between Ministers that, although agood case could be made for winding up the Corporation, it was politically necessary to keep it in being, although its future operations should remain confined within the limits of its present borrowing powers  130 millions from the Exchequer and  20 millions fromother sources and it should be subjected to more stringent financialrestrictions than hitherto. There were, however, three points onwhich agreement remained to be reached. *The first of these concerned the power of the Corporation toundertake additional equity-type business, where the risk of capitallosses was the greatest. Its existing commitments in this type of investment amounted to about  37 millions and it had been agreedthat this should be increased by about  3 millions so as to allow forthe expansion of existing projects. But in the Colonial Secretary&apos;view this was not enough: the limitation would be acceptable neitherto the Corporation itself nor to Parliament, and he proposed thatwholly new equity-type business should be allowed up to a limit of,say,  3 millions.The Colonial Secretary also felt great difficulty in accepting theproposal that the Corporation should not be relieved of the obligationto Tepay advances from the Exchequer for equity-type investment.The Treasury had proposed that this obligation should be retainedand that, if the Corporation was unable to meet it, Parliament shouldbe asked to vote the amount concerned as a subsidy above the line.In his view, however, this would perpetuate what the SinclairCommittee had termed &quot; a hopeless situation &quot; and would deprive the Corporation of any incentive to expand its activities.In order to improve the Corporations chances of borrowing from private sources the Sinclair Committee had recommended that itsprivate borrowing should rank for repayment above advances receivedfrom the Exchequer. This was clearly not acceptable, but theTreasury had proposed that private borrowing should rank afterExchequer advances in respect of straightforward lending and onlyon a par with those in respect of equity-type investments. On this the Colonial Secretary proposed, by way of compromise, that theranking of the Corporations private borrowing in relation toadvances from the Exchequer should be specially determined by theTreasury on each occasion.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that on the last point hewas prepared to accept the compromise proposed by the colonial secretary or, alternatively, to agree that private borrowing by theCorporation should rank after Exchequer advances for straight-forward lending but before those for investment in equity projects.On the other two points, however, he felt serious difficulty in making any further concessions. Experience of equity-type businessconducted by the Corporation had been unfortunate: the risk ofcapital losses was real and, while he was prepared to agree to some
additional advances to allow for the expansion of existing projects,he considered that the limit on the total should be fixed at a level which would only allow the Corporation to undertake additionalbusiness of this type by realising some of its existing equityinvestments. When losses did occur and must be written off, it wasa matter of financial propriety that the Government should bring them into the open by inviting Parliament to vote the necessarysubsidy.The Chancellor saw, however, no reason why a general statement should not be made in the coming debate to the effect that theCorporation would retain the power to make equity-type investmentssubject to some limitation on the total, which it would hold as arevolving fund. The appropriate amount of such investments andthe methods of controlling and accounting for them would be subjectsfor negotiation with the Corporation.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that the Corporation should be allowed some freedom toundertake new equity-type business and that this should be made clear in the debate. The limit on the total of such business and themethods of controlling it in particular the method of accounting for it to Parliament need not, however, be announced until after thesequestions had been discussed with the Corporation.In further discussion it was agreed that the Government shouldtable an amendment to the Opposition Motion looking forward to future successes by the Corporation in assisting the economic development of overseas dependent territories.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Colonial Secretary(a) after  consultation  with  the   Chancellor  of   theExchequer, to make a statement in the debate on 7th July on the future power of the colonial development Corporation to engage in equity-typebusiness, on the lines agreed in their discussion.(b) to give further consideration, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to the ranking of theCorporation^ private borrowing in relation toadvances from the Exchequer.(2) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to table an amendment tothe Opposition Motion on the future of the corporation in the terms approved in their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,5th July, 1960.
