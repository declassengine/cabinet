Germany. 1.   The Foreign Secretary  referred to  the  apprehensions,Armaments. expressed in the Cabinefs discussion of 3rd February, about the(Previous German proposal to seek facilities for training their armed forces and reference: establishing storage depots in Spain. This proposal had since thenC.C. (60) 5th excited considerable public alarm. He was glad to be able to informConclusions, the Cabinet that the German Government had now agreed that itMinute 3.)      should be considered by the North Atlantic Council.   It would bediscussed in the first instance by the forthcoming meeting of defence ministers.In this connexion it was suggested that the Government could with advantage review their policy towards the rearmament ofGermany. Public opinion was uncertain on this subject, and it seemed desirable that the Government should give a clearer lead on it.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to circulate a memorandum on german rearmament for consideration by the DefenceCommittee.AirCorridor toBerlinThe Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of exchanges whichhad been taking place with the French and United States Governmentsabout the height at which jet aircraft should fly in transit over eastern germany to Berlin. A convention had been established that aircraft should not fly above 10,000 ft. on this route. So low a ceiling wasinconvenient for jet aircraft, and the United States authorities hadbeen inclined to argue that the convention should be ignored. TheForeign Secretary had thought it preferable to avoid any provocativeaction and to handle this as a technical, rather than a political,question. He hoped that the French and United States governments would agree that it should be taken up on that basis with the technicalauthorities responsible for controlling air traffic into Berlin.The Cabinet (2) Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Cyprus.(Previous-Reference:C.C. (60) 10thConclusions.Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence (C. (60) 44) about the extent of the British sovereign areasin Cyprus.The Foreign Secretary said that the course of the negotiations with were being conducted in Cyprus by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary. of State for the Colonies made it possible to hope that anagreement could be reached fairly soon on all matters other thanfinance and the size of the sovereign areas. Some of the details ofthe financial arrangements required further study. The Cypriots wereurging that our declaration .about the manner in which they mightshare in the administration of the sovereign areas should be a legally binding instrument. This request must be resisted. We should alsodecline to give any formal undertaking that if we terminated our occupation of the areas we would cede them to the Republic of cyprus.In discussion it was agreed that neither the size of the sovereignareas nor the total amount of the financial assistance should be covered in the current negotiations in Cyprus. If all other matterscould be brought to a conclusion in those negotiations, an attemptcould then be made to reach a final settlement on the two major questions.The Minister of Defence said that by drastically pruning our original requirements we had reduced the size of the sovereign areas to a total of 122 square miles. If it became necessary to make some
further concession, in order to achieve a final settlement, a further reduction to about 105 square miles could be offered. But this couldonly be done if there were a firm understanding that we should retainin the places which would then be excluded from our areas all thefacilities we required. No further reduction could be justified on military grounds. But if the future course of the negotiations made it clear that it was not possible to reach agreement on the basis of105 square miles, he would have to consider whether any furtherminimal adjustment could be tolerated.In discussion- it was suggested that the Cypriots might find it easier, for presentational reasons, to accept a total area of just under100 square miles, even if this entailed providing us with all necessary facilities in the adjacent areas. It might be possible, for this purpose,for us to accept the exclusion of some part of the Akrotiri Salt Lakefrom the western district. Alternatively we might be able to give up,on suitable conditions, the area in the eastern district which we wishedto reserve for the construction of an additional airfield.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement and of thepoints made in the discussion.national health service.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 44thConclusions,Minute 1.)Medicines forPrivatePatients.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Health (C. (60) 43) about the provision of medicines forthe private patients of general practitioners.The Minister of Health recalled that, in the previous July, theCabinet had agreed that the Government should not concede theprovision of medicines for private patients on National Health Serviceterms but that the possibility of making the concession at a later date should not be excluded. Recently there had been heavy pressure forthis concession from Government supporters in Parliament. If itwere decided to make this concession, it should be announced at an appropriate stage that the Government intended to introduce thenecessary legislation during the next session of Parliament.In discussion it was pointed out that the proposed concession had come to be expected by Government supporters. Moreover, it wasnot inconsistent with the principle that patients should be allowedto avail themselves of some, but not all, parts of the National health service. On the other hand, there were powerful arguments against it. It was likely that the cost would considerably exceed the estimateof  2^ millions a year, because the concession would almost certainly lead to the spread of extravagant standards of prescribing not only toa substantially increased number of private patients but also,gradually, throughout the Service. It would tend to increase theproportion of private practice; but, if the recommendations of theRoyal Commission on the Remuneration of Doctors and Dentistswere accepted, this would not result in any reduction of the cost ofthe general practitioner service. It might discredit that service by encouraging the development of two different standards of treatment.To concede medicines on National Health Service terms to private patients might, moreover, revive pressure for some form of financialassistance to those who chose to send their children to non-^maintainedschools.Even if the concession had ultimately to be made, the present wasin any event an inopportune time at which to make it. The increasingcost of the National Health Service was a matter of grave concernand might necessitate an early increase in the weekly contribution.The efforts which were being made to contain the expenditure ondrugs included an experimental scheme for a voluntary limitation ofthe amount of drugs prescribed by doctors: the Government had undertaken that, if this scheme proved successful, they would review
WagesPoMcy.ElectricitySupplyindustry.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 55thConclusions,Minute 9.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 41) about a wage claim in theelectricity supply industry.The Minister of Power said that in December 1959 the industry had reached agreement on a reduction in normal weekly hours,without loss of pay, with effect from 1st February, 1960. This would cost between  3 and  5 millions a year. Subsequently the unions hadpresented a claim for a substantial increase in hourly rates. This hadbeen rejected on 17th February by the representatives of the electricity council who said, however, that they would be prepared, without commitment, to look at the matter again in some months&apos; time whenthe effect of the recent settlement on hours had been assessed. TheCouncil had made it clear that they would then be prepared toconsider some redefinition and regrouping of occupations within theindustry, which might entail improvements in pay for a limited numberof skilled workers. The union representatives had not accepted thisrejection of their claim, and they would renew it at a formal meetingon 17th March. If it were then again rejected, there was a possibilityof at least sporadic strike action. In view of the effect on otherindustries, particularly engineering, of conceding a general wage increase in addition to the reduction in hours, the Wages PolicyCommittee recommended that the Chairman of the Electricity council should be told, in response to a request which he had made, that theGovernment would support him in resisting the wage claim. If this were done, the Chairman could at the same time be asked to what extent he thought that strike action would be likely to result fromthe rejection of the claim. He should also be asked to provide assoon as possible an assessment of the effect of a redefinition ofoccupations within the industry, and of the extent of any consequentialwage increases. Meanwhile, officials should be asked to consider what emergency arrangements might have to be made if strike action were taken.In discussion the following points were made:(a) Although the terms of the joint statement issued on17th February, which promised a re-examination of the wholequestion of wages in some months&apos; time, were unfortunate, theC.C. 15 (60)the possibility of abolishing the prescription charge when the trial period came to an end in January 1962. That might provide a more appropriate context in which to make the proposed concession to private patients.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that thegeneral view of the Cabinet was that, whatever might be the ultimatedecision, the present was not an opportune time for reaching orannouncing a decision to make the proposed concession. pressure for it must therefore be resisted and for this purpose a statement should be prepared, relating the proposal both to the statement madeby the Minister of Health in November 1959, that the Governmentwould reconsider the matter if it were shown that the present position was endangering the existence of private practice, and to the wholecomplex of problems mentioned in the Cabinefs discussion.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that for the time being the Government should notpromise legislation to enable private patients to besupplied with medicines on National Health Service terms.(2) Invited the Minister of Health to prepare and submit to thePrime Minister a statement of this decision on the lines indicated in the Cabinefs discussion.
british transport commission.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 12thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet were informed of the terms of a statement ofthe Governments policy towards the British Transport Commission,which had been prepared by the Prime Minister in consultation withthe Ministers concerned.The Prime Minister said that he proposed to make this statement in the House of Cornimons on 10th March. The Chairman of theCommission was to meet representatives of the unions on the same day, in order to discuss how the report of the Guillebaud Committeeshould be handled. The Chairman would, in due course, need furtherguidance from the Government about the phasing of any measuresto implement the report. The statement of policy included anannouncement that the Government accepted the objective underlying the report, that fair and reasonable wages should be paid to those engaged in the industry. But it made it clear that this involvedacceptance by all the interests concerned the unions, theCommission and the public of the need for radical changes in the structure, finance and management of the Commission and itsundertakings. The central problem was how to relate any further action on railway wages to this reorganisation, especially thedevelopment of a smaller and more economic railway system.The Minister of Transport said that the Chairman of theCommission had now informed him that the cost of implementing the guillebaud report would amount to  40- 45 millions, including thecost of the 5 per cent, interim increase already granted. He had also told him that it would be unwise to count on obtaining more than anadditional  5 millions from increases in fares and charges. Theattitude of the unions to the Guillebaud report would be clearer after their meeting with the Chairman of the Commission in two days-time; but they were likely to demand that the ^conclusions of thereport should be immediately accepted in principle and that, ifincreases in wages could not become effective until regrading hadbeen worked out, the increases should -be back-dated. In this connexion, the report had reached the conclusion thata general wage increase could only be made in conjunction with a reconstruction ofgrades.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had alwaysenvisaged that the conclusions of the Guillebaud report would be implemented by degrees over a considerable period, and that a higherChairman of the Electricity Council would resist any attempt to use this as a means of obtaining a general wage increase in the industry.(b) Either side was entitled to propose that the wage dispute should be made the subject of arbitration. But, while the electricity council could not refuse arbitration if it were proposed by the unions,the Council should not take the initiative in proposing it.(c) It would not be possible to estimate the risk of strike action until after the meeting on 17th March. If there were only sporadicor local stoppages, it would probably be unnecessary to declare anemergency or to contemplate the use of troops to maintain services.But if troops were so used, something over one-half of the supply ofelectricity could be kept in operation.id) While it would be right for the Government to assure theChairman of the Electricity Council of their support in resisting thepresent wage claim, they would be entitled to reconsider the positionin the light of the outcome of the meeting on 17th March and of any subsequent developments.The Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations made in C. (60) 41.(2) Invited the Minister of Power to inform the Chairman of theElectricity Council accordingly.
Assistanceto OverseaTerritories.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 38) covering a draft of a white paper on United Kingdom assistance to oversea territories.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the draft White Paper,which had been approved by the Economic Policy Committee, set outthe facts regarding the present scale of our assistance to overseadevelopment. The subject raised fundamental questions of financial,economic and oversea policy, and of public relations, which he intended to bring again before the Cabinet for a wider discussionwhen further reports were available on the balance of payments and external investment.The Cabinet Approved, subject to minor drafting amendments, the draft white Paper on United Kingdom assistance to overseaterritories annexed to C. (60) 38, and authorised theChancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for its publicationon 14th March.british guiana.(previous reference:CM. (56) 30thConclusions,Minute 6.)7. The Colonial Secretary said that the delegates to theConstitutional Conference on British Guiana, which had opened onthe previous day, were pressing him to commit the Government tothe early grant of independence for the Colony. While he intendedto put before the Conference certain proposals for constitutional advance, there could be no question of independence in the nearfuture and in the circumstances it was possible that the conference might break down at an early stage.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Colonial Secretary.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th March, 1960.wage structure would only apply to an industry that had been reducedconsiderably below the size of the present railway system. The costof implementing the report would make it essential to re-examine theburden on the Exchequer of the total expenditure on the railways.In discussion various minor changes in the wording of thestatement of policy were approved.The Cabinet (1) Approved the statement of policy towards the british transport Commission which the Prime minister proposed to make in the House of Commons on10th March.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to report to the PrimeMinister the outcome of the meeting between the british transport Commission and the unions on 10th March.
