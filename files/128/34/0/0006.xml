1. The Foreign Secretary said that the Cabinet would be awarefrom the announcement made on the previous day by the governor of Cyprus that talks with the Cypriot leaders had broken down.The main issue was the extent of the sovereign areas, though therewere also considerable differences about the administration of theareas and about finance. It seemed clear that Archbishop Makariosdid not wish to conclude an agreement at present, no doubt because he thought that in time he could secure further concessions.It would be necessary in due course to consider the alternative courses that might be followed. For us to leave Cyprus altogetherwould be seriously detrimental to our whole position in the middle east. To revive the possibility of partition would, in view of theimprovement in relations with Greece and Turkey, be politicallyundesirable. To resume negotiations immediately with Archbishop Makarios would involve further concessions with no assurance thatan acceptable settlement would follow. It might be possible toproceed with constitutional developments in Cyprus, while leaving the question of the sovereign areas and the establishment of anindependent republic in abeyance for some period, such as threeyears. For the immediate future there seemed no alternative but tomaintain our position and to seek the views of the Greek and turkish governments.Discussion showed that the Cabinet thought it desirable toobtain a more general recognition by public opinion of the lengthsto which we had gone in our endeavours to meet the Cypriot pointof view. The statement issued in Cyprus on 8th February might givethe impression that Her Majesty&apos;s Government had adopted a finalposition in a somewhat arbitrary fashion. It was unfortunate that,as a result, the Turkish Cypriot leader, Dr. Kutchuk, had criticisedthe decision to break off negotiations and expressed solidarity withthe Greek Cypriots.The reply which the Foreign Secretary would make to private notice questions in Parliament that day might with advantage refer,in appropriate terms, to the general nature of our proposals andindicate the extent to which we had gone to meet Cypriot wishes.It would be helpful to associate the Greek and Turkish governments with the view that our military requirements had been reduced toa minimum and were reasonable; but, although this would be inaccordance with the views which had been expressed privately, theGreek Government might be endangered by a public statement tothis effect. It might, however, be possible to indicate that our proposals had been based on what we understood to be a definition of defence requirements accepted as a reasonable minimum by themilitary authorities of our two Allies.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to be guided by their discussion in replying to private notice questions in Parliament onthe situation in Cyprus.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for a meeting ofthe Ministers concerned to consider future policy inrelation to Cyprus.2. The Minister of Transport said that on the. previous day the committee under the chairmanship of Professor Guillebaud had informed Sir Brian Robertson, Chairman of the British transport commission, and the representatives of the three railway unions thattheir report would be available in the week beginning 29th February,which was several weeks earlier than had been expected. Theunions&apos; representatives, after meeting representatives of theTrades Union Congress, had thereupon sought a meeting with sir Brian Robertson.   At that meeting Sir Brian Robertson hadSECRET56650-6 83 2Cyprus(previous reference:C.C. (60) 5thConclusions,Minute 4.)IndustrialDisputesRailwayWages&apos;(previous reference:C.C. (60) 5thConclusions,Minute 1.)C.C. 6 (60)
said that, as soon as possible after the report of the guillebaud committee was available, he would be prepared to discuss the findings of the report as a whole with the trades unions. He had undertakenthat within a week of the receipt of the report he would make an offer for an interim increase for all the staff under discussion, thisinterim increase to be backdated to 11th January. Sir BrianRobertson had not said that the offer of an interim increase wouldhave to be related to the financial position of the Commission.The representatives of the National Union of Railwaymen(N.U.R.) had indicated that this undertaking would not meet their requirements and had asked Sir Brian Robertson to specify whatwould be the amount of the interim increase. Since this could notbe done, the representatives of the unions were now consideringthe position.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat the amount of an interim increase should not be specified inadvance of the receipt of the report of the Guillebaud Committee.Public opinion would regard a strike by the N.U.R. on this issue,only a fortnight before the date when the report of the guillebaud committee might become available, as completely unjustified. It was recognised that the fact that the report of the Guillebaud Committeewould now be received earlier might well make it more difficult foran interim increase to be limited to 4 per cent. On the other hand,the interim increase would clearly be related to the specialcircumstances of the railways and the findings in the report.The Cabinet were later informed that the representatives of theN.U.R. had now issued a statement to the effect that the situation was not acceptable to them, and that the strike would still takeplace. It was understood that representatives of the three unions would again meet representatives of the Trades Union Congresslater that day, and it was possible that the representatives of theunions would then seek a further meeting with Sir Brian Robertson.The Home Secretary said that the Wages Policy Committeewould meet later that day to consider any further developments.He had also made provisional arrangements for the ministers concerned to meet on the following day to consider what emergencyplans might be necessary. In the meantime, in view of the termsof the statement which had been issued by representatives of theN.U.R., it was desirable that the terms of the undertaking which sir Brian Robertson had given to representatives of the unions onthe previous day should be made public.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Transport to propose to the Chairmanof the British Transport Commission that the terms ofthe undertaking which he had given to representatives ofthe railway unions on the previous day should be made public.(2) Took note that the Wages Policy Committee would considerthe situation later that day.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer on economic relations with the irish republic (C. (60) 19).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, after consultationwith the other Ministers concerned, he recommended that, in thediscussions with Ministers from the Irish Republic which were to begin on 12th February, we should offer to remove the existingsmall differential between the guaranteed price of cattle and sheepbred in the United Kingdom and that paid for animals imported from the Irish Republic for finishing in the United Kingdom.  ThisIrishRepublic(previous reference:C.C. (59) 41stConclusions,Minute 8.)
concession would be much more limited than the proposals putforward by the Government of the Irish Republic, but might enable us to obtain in return useful tariff concessions. The direct annual cost of the proposed concession for attested store cattle might eventually rise to three-quarters of a million pounds; for sheep thecost would be less than  100,000. The Minister of Agriculture andthe Secretary of State for Scotland considered that the proposals would not be unacceptable to United Kingdom farming interestsgenerally, provided that the cost was not taken into account in the review of agricultural prices. The Government of Northern ireland had voiced strong objections to the proposals on the ground thatthey would adversely affect Northern Ireland producers, particularly the removal of the differential subsidy for sheep. But, unless the concession was offered in respect of sheep as well as cattle, it wouldnot be possible to reach an agreement with Ministers from the irish republic during their forthcoming visit to London. The advantages to be obtained on the United Kingdom side would include the waiverby the Irish Republic of certain preferences against members of theEuropean Free Trade Association (E.F.T.A.); and we could alsohope to obtain some concessions on industrial goods.Discussion showed that the Cabinet recognised the advantages that might follow from responding, so far as possible, to the moreco-operative attitude recently shown by the Government of theIrish Republic both as regards general political questions and their economic relations with the United Kingdom. While any improvement in relations between Northern Ireland and the Republicwould be extremely slow, an increase of trade between the UnitedKingdom and Southern Ireland might provide long-term politicaland economic benefits, including benefits to Northern Ireland. Theposition of the Republic of Ireland, as an under-developed country,was unsatisfactory on all counts and it might be in our interest toconsider whether further efforts should be made to expand theireconomy by developing the tourist trade from Great Britain. Itshould, however, be recognised that the Northern Ireland authorities,and Government supporters from Northern Ireland, would be critical of any assistance given to the Republic in advance of any specificimprovement in the situation on the border.Summing up, the Home Secretary said that care should betaken not to exacerbate feelings in Northern Ireland. It would be easier to explain the proposed concession to the Northern ireland government if it were limited to cattle. On the other hand, thegeneral view of the Cabinet was that the possibility of obtainingeconomic and political benefits would justify offering concessions in respect of sheep as well as attested cattle. If our offer were toinclude removal of the differential subsidy for imported sheep aswell as cattle, the only way in which we might meet the apprehensions of the Northern Ireland Government would be by trying to ensurethat there was adequate veterinary control over attestation in theRepublic. He would seek the acquiescence of the Prime Minister ofNorthern Ireland in the proposals put forward by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary to inform the Prime Minister ofNorthern Ireland of their intention to open negotiations on economic relations with the Irish Republic on the.  lines indicated in his summing-up.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, invited the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer to arrange for negotiations with ministers from the Irish Republic to be conducted in accordancewith the proposals contained in C. (60) 19.
NationalHealthServiceContributions(previous reference:C.C. (60) 5thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, following thediscussions by the Cabinet and the Economic Policy Committee inthe previous week, he had decided not to press his proposal forimmediate legislation to increase the National Health Service weekly contribution by one shilling, as a means of meeting part of the large increase in the estimated cost of the Service. He remained, however,of the opinion that this was the right course and he reserved his rightto bring his proposal again before his colleagues before the date ofthe Budget, if he should reach the conclusion that an announcementat that time was desirable.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of this statement by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.Farm Price 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the review, Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 20) on the current Farm Price1960-61 Review.The Minister of Agriculture said that for several years the farming industry had maintained that their income had been fallingrelatively to that of the rest of the community, and for the first timethe figures showed this to be true. The net income of the industry,adjusted to the basis of normal yields, was estimated to be slightly lower in 1959-60 than in either of the two preceding years; and, interms of the real value of money, it was said to be 5 per cent, lower than in the peak year 1948. The Farm Price Review Committeewere agreed that the object of the review, must be to prevent increases in the production of certain commodities, notably sheep, wool, milk and eggs, which would be uneconomic in relation to prospectivedemand. This could be achieved by a reduction of  11 millions inthe total value of the agricultural guarantees. This figure, if addedto the net increase of  11 millions in the costs of review commodities,would allow the industry to retain as an incentive  3 millions outof the  25 millions which might, as in previous years, be estimated to be the value of the gain to them from increasing efficiency. Inorder to secure a reduction of  11 millions, the Government might make an initial proposal to reduce the total value of the guaranteesby  14 millions. On this basis it had to be recognised that an agreed settlement with the industry this year was unlikely;The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he doubted whetherthe reduction proposed by the Minister of Agriculture was sufficientto secure the agreed objectives. The reduction in the last two years in the net income of the industry on a normal yield basis was onlymarginal. He would regard a reduction of no more than  11 millions as encouraging Uneconomic production and likely to lead to analarming increase in the cost of Exchequer support. He proposed,therefore, that the Governments initial suggestion should be the. maximum reduction of about  20^ millions and that in thenegotiations an attempt should be made to keep as near as possibleto this figure. An imposed, as distinct from an agreed, settlementmight occasionally have a salutary effect on the industry.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat, if the Governments initial proposal for a reduction was at too high a level, there was a danger that the National Farmers&apos; unions would be forced to make excessive counter-proposals. On balance,therefore, it was generally agreed that the Governments initialproposal should be for a reduction of  15 millions in the total valueof the agricultural guarantees and that in the subsequent negotiations that figure should not be reduced below  13 millions, or possibly 12 millions.
EmploymentDistributionof Industry(previous reference:C.C. (59) 51stConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (60) 16) about industrialdevelopment on Merseyside.The President of the Board of Trade said that the Ford motor company and the Standard Motor Company were both planning toestablish with Government assistance large car plants on Merseyside.In addition, Vauxhall Motors Limited, who had been refusedpermission to undertake the whole of their next phase of expansion in Luton and Dunstable, had decided that the most suitabledevelopment district for them would be on the south side of the mersey. None of these three firms had been willing to undertakedevelopment on the north-east coast or in Scotland and, while thePresident did not think that he should protect the Ford motor company by refusing Vauxhall Motors Limited permission to goto Merseyside, he would, when the proposals of all three firms hadbeen agreed, consider removing Merseyside from the list ofdevelopment districts.Discussion showed general agreement with these proposals,although it was recognised that the siting of all these developmentson Merseyside was likely to involve substantial encroachment onvaluable agricultural land.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in C. (60)  16 for industrialdevelopment on Merseyside.In further discussion it was agreed that in the interests of the pig industry there must on this occasion be some increase in the guaranteed price of pigs. The Agriculture Ministers had proposedan increase of one shilling per score: this was certain to cause adversereaction from Denmark, although the proportion of Danish baconconsumed in this country had substantially increased in recent years.On the other hand we had given an undertaking to the danish government that we would not use the Farm Price Review as a meansof frustrating the tariff reductions which we had agreed to make.While the Danish Government might be prepared to tolerate anincrease of 6d. in the guaranteed price for pigs, any greater increase would certainly lead to resentment and possibly even to their refusing to ratify the European Free Trade Association convention.Summing up the discussion, the Home Secretary said that theGovernments initial proposal to the farming industry should be thatthe value of the agricultural guarantees should be reduced by 15 millions and that the distribution of this figure among the variouscommodities, including the question of the increase in the price for pigs, should be further discussed by the Farm Price review committee. That Committee should also give further considerationto the final figure which the Government might be prepared to accept.It might be necessary for the Cabinet to consider the matter furtherduring the negotiations with the farmers&apos; representatives.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Agriculture Ministers to make an initial proposal,in the current Farm Price Review, for a reduction of 15 millions in the total value of the agriculturalguarantees.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for the ministerial Committee on the Farm Price Review to give further consideration to the distribution of this figureamong individual commodities including the question ofan increase in the price for pigs.
Federation of rhodesia andNyasalandNyasalandEmergency(previous reference:CC. (60) 2ndConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The Commonwealth Secretary said that it had not beenpossible for the Prime Minister, in the course of his visit to theFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, to have a full discussionwith Sir Roy Welensky, the Prime Minister of the Federation, aboutthe release of detainees, including Dr. Banda, under the Nyasalandemergency. When the proposals for the early release of Dr. Bandaand for the visit of the Colonial Secretary, to Nyasaland for thepurpose of constitutional discussions had been communicated toSir Roy Welensky, his reaction and that of Sir Edgar Whitehead,the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, had been extremelycritical. It had accordingly been necessary for the Prime Ministerto invite Sir Roy Welensky to visit this country to discuss the whole situation with the Prime Minister immediately after his return.Unfortunately it seemed that this invitation had not been sufficientto meet Sir Roy Welensky;s apprehensions. He was likely to ask that the departure of the Central African Advisory Commission,under the chairmanship of Lord Monckton, to the Federation shouldbe postponed until after his discussions with the Prime Minister hadbeen satisfactorily concluded. A postponement of the departure ofthe Monckton Commission, or a public request for this bySir Roy Welensky, would reveal that a very serious situation had developed. The Commonwealth Secretary therefore proposed tosend a message to Sir Roy Welensky, urging him to refrain fromasking that the departure of the Monckton Commission should be postponed, and to avoid giving any public indication about thepresent situation until the proposed discussions with the PrimeMinister had taken place.In discussion the view was expressed that the apprehensions ofSir Roy Welensky and Sir Edgar Whitehead were genuinely felt.Recent developments in Africa, particularly those in the belgian congo, had given rise to widespread anxiety among the white settlers.They felt that the United Kingdom Government were always led bycircumstances into negotiating with the extreme African nationalists,which made it impossible for the position of the settlers to be adequately safeguarded.The Cabinet Agreed that a message should be sent to the Prime Ministerof the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland on the lines proposed by the Commonwealth Secretary.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,9th February, 1960.
