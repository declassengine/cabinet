congo republic.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 44thConclusions,Minute 5.)Europe.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 44thConclusions,Minute 6.)reorganisation of O.E.E.C.2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a meeting had recently been held in Paris at which Ministers of the Governmentsconcerned and representatives of the European Commission had discussed the future of the Organisation for European economic co-operation. He was glad to say that this discussion had notrevealed any acute divergences of view. There had been a sufficientmeasure of agreement to allow work to go forward on the draftconvention for the new Organisation for Economic Co-operation andDevelopment. The meeting had also agreed, after some difficulties,on the selection of a Secretary-General designate of the new organisation.The Cabinet -Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Parliament. 3.   The Cabinet were informed that a small amount ofGovernment business would remain unfinished when Parliament rosefor the summer recess on 29th July. It was therefore proposed that parliament would reassemble on 25th October and be prorogued on27th October. The new session would be opened on 1st November.agricultural policy.farm improvement.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 58thConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 118) about the development ofthe Farm Improvements Scheme.The Minister of Agriculture recalled that this scheme, which hadbeen introduced in 1957, provided for Exchequer grants at the rateof 33J per cent, on long-term capital improvements to farms.Government expenditure on it was limited by the Agriculture act of that year to  50 millions over a period of 10 years, with power by Order to increase the limit to  55 millions. Expenditure was nowoutstripping the original estimate embodied in the Act: during the1. The Foreign Secretary made a brief report on developments in the situation in the Congo Republic. In Press comments a somewhat exaggerated importance was being attached to the attemptto deny to the Belgian troops the use of their bases in the Congo,and also to the possibility that the United Nations would interveneover Katanga&apos;s attempt to secede from the Republic. In his public statements he proposed to continue to stress two points namely,that the first need was to restore law and order in the Congo and that united Nations forces should not be used to further constitutional changes within the Republic.The Minister of Defence said that, in view of possible disordersin British territories in Central Africa, some reinforcement of the strategic reserve in Kenya was desirable. A Royal Marinecommando which was to have been sent from Aden for this purposecould not now be moved, because of a potential threat to public orderthere; and he proposed to send instead an infantry battalion fromthe United Kingdom.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.
current year it was estimated to reach  8 millions and, while this level was unlikely to be exceeded, the 10-year total would, at thepresent rate of progress, amount to something between  70 and 85 millions. On the other hand, any reduction in the scope of thescheme would provoke unfortunate reactions from farmersthroughout Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Account shouldalso be taken of the fact that the scheme was one of the best ways of reducing production costs, and had already proved an effective meansof reducing guaranteed prices in the annual Farm Price Review.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that the scheme wasproving valuable, although it appeared to be leading to increased production without any corresponding reduction in Exchequerassistance to the industry. It was, however, only one of manyschemes for Government expenditure which were outrunning theoriginal estimates of cost and were leading to the consumption of asteadily growing proportion of the national income. When theoriginal Bill was before Parliament, the Governments right to make changes in the terms of the scheme had been expressly reserved. Itwould be consistent with the statements then made if the rate of grantwere now reduced from 33^ per cent, to 25 per cent., as a means of keeping total expenditure within the statutory limit. The onlysatisfactory alternative would be to compensate for increased expenditure under this scheme by reductions in other forms of exchequer assistance to agriculture, e.g., production grants.Discussion showed that there was considerable support in theCabinet for the view that it would be unwise to reduce the percentageof the grants payable under this scheme, since this would be unfair tothose who, for reasons of their own, had planned to apply for grant in one of the later years of the scheme. On the other hand, anunrestricted commitment had never been contemplated. one possible way of keeping expenditure within its present limit would beto limit it by administrative means to  5 millions in each of the nextfew years. This course would not, however, retard the submission of applications and it was likely that so great a volume of arrearswould accumulate that it would be necessary to consider extending thepresent 10-year duration of the scheme. The alternative of makingcompensating cuts in the production grants at the time of the nextFarm Price Review might also be considered, even though it was open to the objection that these were payable to the occupiers of farms, more than half of whom were tenants, while the benefit of the grants under the Farm Improvements Scheme accrued mainly to theowners.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that thebalance of opinion in the Cabinet seemed to be in favour ofmaintaining the present rate of grant. At the same time, it wouldbe difficult in present circumstances to justify an increase in thestatutory limit on the total of Government expenditure under thescheme. Since, however, this was expected to suffice for another twoyears at the present rate of expenditure, an immediate decision wasnot required. Further consideration should be given to thepossibility of limiting expenditure by administrative action or ofmaking compensating cuts in production grants or other forms of exchequer assistance to agriculture. A decision on the future of thescheme could then be taken in the autumn, in time for the following year&apos;s Farm Price Review and decisions on the Estimates of theMinistry of Agriculture for 1961-62.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Agriculture to give furtherconsideration to the possibility of limiting expenditure underthe Farm Improvements Scheme by administrative methods and of finding other compensating savings by reductions inother forms of Exchequer assistance to agriculture; and tobring the matter before them again in the autumn.
GovernmentInformationServices.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 36thConclusions,Minute 1.)South America.5. The Cabinet had before them a report by the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster (C. (60) 106) on his recent visit to SouthAmerica.The Chancellor of the Duchy said that in the course of visits toeight of the 10 independent countries in South America he had been much impressed with the spirit of friendliness and respect for theUnited Kingdom which he had met everywhere. There was scope for developing closer relations with the Latin American countries andthere would be significant political and economic advantages in doing so. While the limitation of our own resources might preclude any large increase in investment in the expanding activities of thecontinent, the Chancellor hoped that opportunities could be found for at least some increase: there was no doubt that this would be welcomed and that there was widespread apprehension that we mightmiss opportunities open to us. The development of closer culturalrelations and, in particular, of exchanges of visits between people inall walks of life would be specially profitable.The Cabinet Took note of the report by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster on his recent visit to South America.EconomicSituation.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 36thConclusions,Minute 3.)Balance ofPayments.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 131) covering a report on thebalance of payments prospects for 1960 in relation to futurecommitments for capital expenditure overseas.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in 1960 the surpluson current balance was expected to be less than  100 millions, whichwas considerably lower than the surplus of  145 millions in 1959.The main cause of this deterioration was the greater rise in importsthan in exports. An improvement in the invisible account wouldhave helped appreciably to offset this deterioration but for asubstantial rise forecast in Government expenditure overseas.Against the small current surplus there had to be set an estimated nettotal of  375 millions of capital payments abroad. This included 60 millions of new overseas lending by the Government, but was mainly accounted for by a large increase in net private investment in both sterling and non-sterling countries. As a result there was likely to be an overall deficit in 1960 of over  250 millions. Thiswould have to be financed either out of the reserves, or by anincrease in holdings of sterling by overseas countries. *Looking further ahead there was little reason to hope for muchimprovement in the current position, and a high rate of investmentabroad was likely to continue. Drastic direct measures, such as theimposition of quantitative import controls or an attempt to restrictprivate investment overseas, would be undesirable, since they would adversely affect confidence in sterling without achieving any quickor lasting improvement. It was therefore essential to weigh thebalance of advantage very carefully before accepting futurecommitments overseas, and to pursue a policy of restraint at home.In discussion the following points were made :(a) The expansion of private investment overseas was said to be essential to safeguard the future of our exports. It could be argued that the same consideration applied to Government lending abroad,for example, Commonwealth assistance loans. Nevertheless, if itwas not possible to control private investment overseas withoutaffecting confidence in sterling, it might be necessary for theGovernment to limit its own lending.(b) A disturbing feature was the rate of increase in the growth of private investment overseas, in both sterling and non-sterling
countries. In many cases it was not possible to repatriate the foreignearnings of these investments. An alternative to introducing controlover private investment abroad would be to make investment in theUnited Kingdom more attractive. But a policy of restraint at home,particularly if it bore more hardly on investment than on consumption, would have the opposite effect.((c) In only one of the last 10 years had the current balance beenlarge enough to finance overseas expenditure of the ordercontemplated in 1960. It now seemed unrealistic to expect a current balance of  300 millions to  400 millions. A futher report was to beprepared for the Economic Policy Committee on the balance ofpayments prospects in relation to future commitments for capitalexpenditure overseas.(d) The countries of the West had so great a political interest in providing sufficient investment in under-developed countries that every effort should be made to mobilise their full resources for thispurpose. The Federal German Government were still playing far too small a part in this. In view of the size of our own military expenditure in Germany, it should be possible to persuade them to do more.(e) In recent months there had been a sharp increase intransactions in sterling securities in Hong Kong and other freemarkets in the sterling area, whereby United Kingdom residentsbought for foreign exchange at a discount sterling securities held bynon-residents. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was hoped that this tendency would decrease, but he would make afurther report on it to the Economic Policy Committee in due course.The Cabinet-Took note of C. (60) 131 and of the points raised in thediscussion.Distributionof Industry.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 6thConclusions,Minute 6.)North BritishLocomotiveCompany.7. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Presidentof the Board of Trade and the Secretary of State for Scotland(C. (60) 120 and 127) about the position of the North BritishLocomotive Company.The President of the Board of Trade said that this company,which employed some 3,300 people in Glasgow, was in process of completing a number of orders for the manufacture of diesellocomotives for the British Transport Commission. These would all have been completed by June 1961; and, since the company now had virtually no other work, almost the whole of their labour force would by that time have had to be discharged. A new managementhad recently been appointed and there was reason to think that thecompany&apos;s efficiency had been and would continue to be improved.They were hoping to obtain orders from the Transport commission for new types of diesel locomotives for delivery in 1962-63 but theyneeded work to support them until that time. The Commission were willing for that purpose to place a repeat order for 20 locomotivesof an existing type but, since they had no genuine need for these, theorder would only be placed if the Commission^ investment ceilingfor 1961 were raised to accommodate the value of the order and if at was understood that they would be taking ithe locomotives in place of later types, which were expected to be materially cheaperboth in initial and in running costs. The capacity of the locomotivemanufacturing industry in this country greatly exceeded any probablelong-term needs and in these circumstances the future viability of theNorth British Locomotive Company was open to doubt.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he appreciated thedifficulty of allowing the Transport Commission to place orders which were known to be relatively uneconomic. The alternative was,however, not only a substantial increase in the level of unemployment
in Glasgow, but, in yet one more nationalised industry, the concentration of all manufacturing capacity in the south. The NorthBritish Locomotive Company needed a period in which to make themselves more efficient and competitive and at the same time todiversify the work they could undertake. There was reason to thinkthat, if they could receive an early assurance of orders from theTransport Commission for delivery of the new type of locomotivesin 1962, they might find it possible to avoid discharging employees to the extent originally feared.Discussion showed it to be the general feeling of the Cabinetthat, since the whole of the Government^ announced policy for therailways was directed to improving their efficiency, it would beimpossible to defend increasing the Exchequer commitment to themfor the purpose of buying a number of locomotives known to beobsolete and comparatively expensive. If a major contraction inthe locomotive manufacturing industry must be expected, it mightbe difficult to keep this company afloat for very long, thoughexperience suggested that, even in the absence of a repeat order fromthe Transport Commission, they might find some means of survivinguntil orders for the new types could be obtained. Efforts should bemade to secure an early decision by the Transport Commission onthe tenders for the new types.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the British Transport Commission should not beauthorised to place a repeat order with the North BritishLocomotive Company for locomotives of existing types.:(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to maintain contact withthe Commission, with a view to an early decision onorders for new types of locomotive for delivery in1962-63.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,25th July, I960.
