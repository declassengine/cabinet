Cyprus.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 17thConclusions,Minute 3.)Middle East.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 65thConclusions,Minute 3.)Geneva 2.   The Foreign Secretary referred to the important developmentsConference on   which had taken place in the preceding week at the Geneva ConferenceNuclear Tests,   on Nuclear Tests.   The Soviet Government had now offered (i) to(Previous        accept a treaty prohibiting all nuclear tests in the atmosphere, in outerReference:       space or under water and all underground tests above a seismicC.C. (59) 23rd   magnitude of 4 - 75; and (ii) to undertake, jointly with the United StatesConclusions,     and the United Kingdom, research designed to improve the means ofMinute2.)       detecting explosions below the limit of 4-75, on condition that all parties undertook to refrain from making tests below that limit duringthe period of the research programme.   Thus, in effect, the russians were ready to accept the latest United States proposals provided theywere accompanied by a moratorium.   We had ourselves endeavoured to persuade the United States Government to include provision for a moratorium in their original proposals.    Subject therefore toelucidation of certain details, the Russians seemed to have come round to the view which we ourselves had urged upon the Americans; andit was to be hoped that the latter would now be ready to accept thisRussian offer.   If so, the possibility of a satisfactory agreement wasin sight.The Prime Minister said that we now had an opportunity to conclude an agreement which might be a turning point in the historyof international negotiations on disarmament. The United StatesGovernment must be brought to appreciate the significance of this opportunity. He hoped they would be ready to accept the Russianproposals in principle. Certainly, it must be made plain to them thatwe should find it very difficult to refrain from indicating publicly our readiness to accept an agreement on the lines now envisaged by theRussians.Foreign Aflairs. 1. The Foreign Secretary made a brief report to the Cabinet onIsrael. the conversations which had been held with the Prime Minister of israel during his recent visit to London. Mr. Ben Gurion had urged,in particular, that we should continue to supply Israel with moderndefensive armaments. He had argued that the Egyptians were less likely to pursue adventurous policies if they knew that Israel wascapable of offering an effective defence.The Foreign Secretary said that he had now obtained the viewsof the Greek and Turkish Governments on the suggestion that the major questions still outstanding in the negotiations on Cyprus shouldbe settled at an early meeting of Foreign Ministers. Both these governments considered that it would be premature to convene sucha meeting at the present stage. They thought it wiser to wait for alittle longer in the hope that a wider measure of agreement would emerge from the negotiations now proceeding in Cyprus. In thesecircumstances the proposed meeting of Foreign Ministers must be deferred for the time being.The Foreign Secretary said that at the forthcoming meeting of theMilitary Committee of the Central Treaty Organisation proposals would be made for the establishment of a permanent commandstructure similar to that which served the South-East Asia treaty organisation. This proposal would be regarded by the SovietGovernment as provocative, and it was inexpedient that it should go forward for adoption by the Council of the Organisation shortly beforethe Summit Meeting. He hoped to be able to arrange for it to be deferred.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Foreign Secretary.
Discussion showed that there was general support in the cabinet for the view expressed by the Prime Minister.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister and the Foreign secretary would take all practicable steps to impress upon the UnitedStates Government the importance of securing aninternational agreement for the prohibition of nuclear testson the basis of the latest proposals by the Soviet Government.3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Home Secretary(C. (60) 48) covering a report by a Committee of Ministers appointedto consider the future of Carlton House Terrace.The Minister of Housing said that the report was based on theunderstanding that the Foreign Secretary no longer regarded CarltonHouse Terrace as a suitable location for the permanent accommodation of all departments of the Foreign Office. It wouldprobably be impossible to adapt these buildings satisfactorily for use as Government offices, and the cost of doing so would be very greatin comparison with that of new building. The estimated needs of departments in the Whitehall area over the next ten to fifteen yearscould be met by the development of other sites which were actuallyor potentially available. The committee therefore recommended thatCarlton House Terrace should be released to the Crown EstateCommissioners, who were ready to develop the whole area on a unifiedplan in such away that both facades of the Terrace would be preserved.The Commissioners should be invited to agree with the Governmentthe purposes for which the area should be developed. Meanwhile,the Foreign Office staff who at present occupied the Terrace could betransferred to Queen Anne&apos;s Mansions. It was unlikely that theMinister of Works would be able to secure an extension of his leaseon those premises, which expired in 1968. It was to be hoped,therefore, that it would be possible reasonably soon to prepare aphased long-term plan for the use of the various sites which were, or would become, available for Government accommodation in the whithall area.The Foreign Secretary confirmed that he did not wish the CarltonHouse Terrace area to be redeveloped as a permanent location for his department. He hoped that it might be possible by 1968 to accommodate all departments of the Foreign Office in a new buildingon the site between Downing Street and King Charles Street. In this connexion the Cabinet were informed that efforts were being made totransfer the India Office Library to a building in some other part ofLondon.In discussion it was agreed that, while redevelopment of theCarlton House Terrace area should comprise residential as well asoffice accommodation, the Commissioners should be given as muchlatitude as possible in respect of its use, since they would then be theless likely to ask for help from public funds towards the cost ofredevelopment.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (60) 48.government offices.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 27thConclusions,Minute 9.)Carlton HouseTerrace.House of 4.   The Minister of Works said that the soundings that he hadCommons. made indicated that a considerable number of Government supportersAccommodation in the House of Commons would not welcome the construction of afor Members, temporary building in Star Chamber Court to provide additional(Previous accommodation for Members.   In these circumstances it would be reference: preferable not to announce in the forthcoming debate that it had beenC.C.

BroadcastingDevelopment.(previous reference:CC. (59) 11thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster-General (C. (60) 50) on the future of broadcasting in theUnited Kingdom.The Postmaster-General proposed that the Charter and Licenceof the British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.), which expired inJune 1962, should be extended to expire at the same time as the television Act in July 1964. This could be effected without legislation.On previous occasions an independent committee of enquiry had beenappointed to consider the renewal of the B.B.C.&apos;s Charter and Licenceand he proposed that on this occasion the future both of the B.B.C.and of independent television should be referred to such a committee.The problems on which they would be asked to advise would include,in addition to the respective functions of the B.B.C. and theIndependent Television Authority (I.T.A.) in providing broadcasting services, the methods by which they should be financed (including theprofits of the I.T.A.&apos;s programme contractors); the possibleintroduction of commercial sound radio and subscription television;the dissemination of services by wire and television for public showing;the possibility of a third television programme and additional viewinghours; and a number of technical problems, including that of standards of definition on which the Television Advisory Committee were expected to report in the following month. The committee should beappointed as soon as possible, partly because their work and thepreparation of the necessary legislation would occupy a considerable time and partly because early appointment of the committee wouldenable the Postmaster-General to resist mounting pressures for theextension of television services.In discussion it was agreed that the B.B.C.&apos;s Charter and Licenceshould be extended so as expire at the same time as the Television Act.Some doubt was expressed, however, about the need for anindependent enquiry: it was suggested that, as so many of the issues were political, it might be preferable for the Government to keep the formulation of policy in their own hands. The balance of opinion was, however, that in view of the complexity of the problem and itsgreat social importance, it would be helpful to the Government tohave a preliminary enquiry by an independent committee.In discussion on the composition of the proposed committee ofenquiry, there was general support for the view that young people should be strongly represented and that the committee should be large enough to embrace a variety of points of view.The Cabinet (1) Agreed (a) that   the  Charter   and   Licence   of   the   british broadcasting Corporation should be extended to29th July, 1964;(b) that an independent committee should be appointedto advise on the future of the Corporation and theIndependent Television Authority and on otherrelated problems.W SECRET 5CC. 19 (60)this means would be kept in mind. This would in fact involvepostponing the start of construction of this temporary building for about a year.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Works.
(2) Invited the Postmaster-General to consider further thechairmanship and composition of the committee ofenquiry and to submit his proposals to the PrimeMinister.BuildingSocietiesBill.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 54thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Home Secretary said that there would be very heavy pressure on the days available for Government legislation during theremainder of the current session of Parliament. It had already been necessary to defer two major Bills, namely, the Criminal Justice bill and the Covent Garden Market Bill, which had been mentioned inThe Queeris Speech. Although the Building Societies Bill had nowbeen approved by the Legislation Committee, it might be enough ifthe Government were to undertake to introduce it early in thefollowing session.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Bill would providea valuable protection to the investing public. It was likely that the registrar would make an order early in April prohibiting anotherbuilding society from inviting further deposits; and this, following theaffair of the State Building Society, would make it politically difficultto justify postponing legislation which had been promised in the queen&apos;s Speech. It might save Parliamentary time if the Bill were introduced in the House of Lords.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat every effort should be made to enact this legislation in the current session. The Bill should be published as soon as possible and shouldbe introduced in the House of Lords.The Cabinet Agreed that the Building Societies Bill should be introduced in the House of Lords as soon as possible.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,22nd March, 1960.
