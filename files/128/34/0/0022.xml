CC. 22 (60)1. The Prime Minister gave the Cabinet a brief account of his visit to Washington.Before his arrival, President Eisenhower had already decidedthat, in response to the proposals recently put forward by the SovietGovernment at the Geneva Conference on Nuclear Tests, the UnitedStates Government would be prepared to institute a voluntarymoratorium on nuclear weapons tests below a seismic magnitude of4 - 75, even though such tests could not be detected by existing controlmethods. This moratorium would be conditional on the conclusionof a satisfactory treaty for the suspension of nuclear tests above thatlimit and on agreement for a co-ordinated research programme forthe purpose of progressively improving control methods. In thecircumstances, he had thought that it would be unwise, in had discussions with President Eisenhower, to urge the United states authorities at this stage to define the period of the voluntarymoratorium.As regards European economic affairs, he had emphasised tothe United States authorities the danger of the economic division inEurope reaching proportions which would ultimately affect thepolitical unity of Europe. This was a view which he had previouslyexpressed publicly and privately to President Eisenhower and to theFrench President and the Federal German Chancellor, and it didnot imply hostility to the European Economic Community.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of this statement by the PrimeMinister.2. The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries reported that thegeneral atmosphere of the second International Conference on theLaw of the Sea, then in progress at Geneva, was more constructivethan that of the previous Conference. There was now some hopethat the necessary majority of votes might be secured for a compromise solution by which there would be a territorial sea of6 miles plus a further 6-mile zone in which the coastal State wouldhave exclusive fishing rights subject to the phasing-out over a periodof years of historic fishing rights claimed by other States. India andother Afro-Asian countries might now be willing to support thiscompromise if some limitation could be agreed on the movement of warships in the outer 6-mile zone. Within the territorial sea theinnocent passage of warships was secured by an agreement reached at the earlier Conference, but this did not apply to aircraft, eithercivil or military, which had so far figured little in the debates.In discussion it was recognised that the compromise solution towhich the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries had referred wouldhave to be formally put forward at a stage early enough to preventother countries from deciding to support a proposal for a 12-mile territory sea. At the same time, there was some danger that if the compromise were proposed too soon the chances of its acceptance byother European countries would be prejudiced. The tactics and timing best designed to secure its acceptance could be determinedonly in the light of the progress of the Conference.It was already the practice to notify to coastal States proposedmovements of warships within the territorial sea and the First Lordof the Admiralty was considering whether there would be anyunacceptable difficulty in extending this practice to the outer 6-milezone now proposed. There should, however, be no question of agreeing to consult the coastal State on movements of warshipswithin this zone.
South Africa.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 21stConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the termsof a resolution which the representative of Ecuador proposed totable at the meeting of the Security Council of the United nations which was at present considering the situation arising from the recent disturbances in South Africa.He said that there were obvious objections to this resolution.It repeated the allegations contained in the letter from therepresentatives of the Afro-Asian group of member countries, itreferred to earlier resolutions of the General Assembly which we hadnot accepted as valid, and it assumed that the disturbances affectedinternational peace and security. Moreover, the resolution calledupon the South African Government to alter their present internalpolicies, and it requested the Secretary-General to make such arrangements as would adequately help in upholding the purposes and principles of the Charter. Thus the resolution was clearlycontrary to the principle of Article 2 (7) of the Charter, whichprecluded interference in matters within the domestic jurisdiction ofmembers, and it would be consistent with the view which the UnitedKingdom delegate had already expressed if we were to vote against it.However, if we were to veto the resolution, this would undoubtedly lead to a successful demand for a special session of theGeneral Assembly, which would exacerbate the situation still more.Moreover, other Commonwealth countries, particularly Ghana and nigeria, would react strongly if we were to exercise a veto. In thesecircumstances, the best course might be to abstain from voting onthis resolution. In that event, it would not be advisable to seek toimprove its terms.The Commonwealth Secretary said that we should not vote infavour of a resolution which did more than record the discussion at the Security Council and inform the South African government about it. The Ecuadorian resolution went considerably further, andcalled for action by the United Nations. In view of the importancewe attached to Article 2 (7) it would be logical to vote against sucha resolution. But there were strong practical arguments against thiscourse. Our veto would lead to the prolongation of the discussions in the United Nations, and we could explain to the South african government that this would not be in their best interests. In view ofthe strong feelings of other Commonwealth countries the right course,on balance, would be to abstain.The Minister of Education said that there were strong arguments for voting for such a resolution as that proposed by Ecuador. In viewof the inevitable development of nationalist forces in Africa and elsewhere, it would not be possible in the future to rely on Article 2 (7)as   a   protection   against   international   interference   in   such(1) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to inform theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries whether wecould agree to notify coastal States of proposedmovements of warships within an outer exclusivefishery zone.(2) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries todetermine the best tactics to secure acceptance bythe International Conference on the Law of the sea of a 6-mile territorial sea plus a further 6-mileexclusive fishery zone subject to the phasing-out of historic fishing rights.
circumstances as had arisen in South Africa. In such casesinternational interference could be successfully resisted only if the policies in question were generally recognised to be reasonablyhumane. It would be in the best interests of the South african government if we were to persuade them that it was necessary onthis account to adjust their internal policies.In discussion it was pointed out that there was a moral, as wellas a purely legal, basis for the principle of non-interference in the domestic jurisdiction of a country. It was the general policy of theUnited Kingdom to assist dependent countries towards self-government and independence. In many cases these countries wouldbe faced in the early days of independence with serious internalproblems, which might often be racial in character, as in the caseof Ceylon and Malaya. It was not in the true interests of newlyindependent countries that they should be subject to internationalinterference at a critical time.At the same time, it was the general view of people in the UnitedKingdom that the racial policies of the South African authorities were objectionable, and the Government had often given publicexpression to that point of view. It would be offensive to publicopinion here, as well as in many other Commonwealth countries,if we were to vote against the Ecuadorian resolution as a whole.It was the general view of the Cabinet that in these circumstances the right course would be to abstain from voting on this resolution.It was likely that the French Government would also abstain. TheUnited Kingdom delegate should recall what he had previously said about the principle of Article 2 (7) and the views that had alreadybeen expressed about the attitude of the Government to the recentincidents in South Africa; and he should justify abstaining from a vote on the ground that the resolution went beyond the properscope of the Security Council.It was important that the discussions in the Security council should be brought to an end as soon as possible. If they wereprolonged, native African leaders might be invited to give evidence to the Council. This would be particularly undesirable since certainAfrican leaders had taken refuge in Bechuanaland. Although their return to South Africa could lawfully be demanded, it had beendiscreetly intimated to the South African Government that it wouldbe preferable for them to refrain from making such a demand. If,nevertheless, a demand were made, it would be possible to delayaction on technical grounds.The Prime Minister said that to abstain on the resolution seemedthe course least likely to lead to an immediate crisis in commonwealth affairs. It was possible that, after an interval, other commonwealth governments would realise that it was not in their interests to supportinternational interference in the domestic jurisdiction of another country. But they would want to feel that it was possible for them,where necessary, to influence the internal policies of another memberof the Commonwealth. Public opinion would similarly wish forsome reassurance in this respect. The forthcoming meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers would therefore be of great significance. Although the racial policies of the South african government would not be formally discussed in that meeting, itwould provide the best opportunity for bringing the opinion of therest of the Commonwealth to bear on the South African Government.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the UnitedKingdom delegate to abstain from voting on the proposedEcuadorian resolution in the Security Council.
EconomicSituation.Balance ofPayments.(previous reference :C.C. (60) 18thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 60), to which were attachedmemoranda by officials about the prospects for the balance ofpayments during 1960 and the likely scale of United Kingdomexternal investment and expenditure in the period 1960-63.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in 1960 there was likely to be a deterioration in the external monetary position of 200 millions, as compared with a deterioration (apart from certain special transactions) of  1001 millions in 1959. This might result apart from the effects of any loss of confidence in sterling in a fall of about  160 millions in the reserves. This was a matter of serious concern, especially since there was some reason to think that thefall in the reserves in 1960 reflected a trend which must be expectedto continue for a number of years.In discussion it was suggested that the estimated fall in the reserves in 1960 need not be regarded as unduly serious providedthat action could be taken to prevent its being substantially increasedby any loss of confidence in sterling. One possible course wouldbe to restrain any excessive growth of home demand for manufacturedgoods, but it might be necessary to consider also reductions inGovernment expenditure overseas.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of C. (60) 60 at a later meeting.5. The Minister of Transport said that the wages of railwayworkshop staff were not within the scope of the report of the guillebaud Committee. While a minority of them were analogous to the lowest grades covered by the report, some two-thirds werein engineering grades. In 1958 the British Transport commission had agreed to review the wages of the workshop staff in the light ofthe review of the wages of the grades within the scope of the reportof the Guillebaud Committee, and they had accordingly been authorised recently to offer the unions the choice between a 5 per cent,increase in wages or a reduction in hours to 42 per week. The unions had elected to receive the 5 per cent, increase but were pressing forretrospection to 11th January, the date from which it had been agreedthat the interim pay increases for the grades within the scope of the guillebaud report should operate. Trie Transport Commission had offered retrospection to 18 th January and were themselves willing to concede the additional week demanded.In discussion it was agreed that the establishment of any form oflink between the wages of the railway shopmen and those of the guillebaud grades must be avoided. It would almost certainly resultin a further successful claim by the shopmen as soon as further pay increases for the grades within the scope of the Guillebaud report had been agreed; and such a claim would have an immediate and serious effect on wage levels throughout the engineering industry.On the other hand, refusal of retrospection to 11th January wouldnot only be unwelcome to the Transport Commission but wouldprobably provoke unofficial strikes among the shopmen. On balance,therefore, the best course would be to concede retrospection to11th January, but at the same time to make clear that this was offeredunder the 1958 agreement and was not to be regarded as anapplication of the Guillebaud report.british transport commission.RailwayWorkshopStaff.(previous reference :C.C.

CC. 22 (60)Cabinet Office,1st April,S.W. 1,1960.Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Labour,to prepare a statement to be made by the British transport commission, offering a 5 per cent, increase in the basicwage rates of railway workshop staff backdated to11th January, 1960, and making clear that this was not anapplication of the Guillebaud report.
