2. The Foreign Secretary said that the Soviet representative atthe Geneva Conference on Nuclear Tests had indicated that it wouldbe several days before he could make any further statement, and it seemed likely that the Soviet Government were reviewing theirpolicy in the light of the failure of the Summit meeting. There was,however, reason to believe that the United States Government,despite opposition from powerful sections of American opinion,would continue to work for an agreement at this Conference; and itwas to be hoped that further progress towards this would be made.The prospects of the Disarmament Conference were, however,more doubtful. No progress was being made at present; and therewas some danger that, if the Conference continued, substantialdifferences of opinion between the Western Powers would be revealed.If these differences could be resolved, it would probably be preferableon balance to allow the Conference to remain in being, even though no real progress would be made. But if the views of the UnitedStates and French Governments on disarmament could not be reconciled, it might be necessary to ascertain privately from theSoviet Government whether they would agree that the conference should be adjourned.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Disarmament(previous reference:C.C. (60) 27thConclusions,Minute 2.)Indonesia.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 17thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignOffice (C. (60) 85) about the supply of ships and aircraft to Indonesia.The Foreign Secretary recalled that the Defence Committee had previously agreed that negotiations might take place for the sale to indonesia of small patrol vessels and unarmed Shackleton aircraft,but that as regards the supply of destroyers it would be necessary first to obtain the views of the Australian Government. The position hadbeen explained to the Prime Minister of Australia, who was content to leave the decision to the judgment of the United KingdomGovernment. But recent developments suggested that it might be preferable to defer action for the time being. The Indonesian government had reacted strongly to the decision of the dutch government to send an aircraft carrier and other reinforcements to new Guinea, and it seemed unwise at this time to introduce additionalarmaments to the area. Moreover, the Dutch Government had made certain enquiries about purchasing Shackleton aircraft for themselves;and they might abandon this intention if we were now to supplysimilar aircraft to Indonesia.It was, however, desirable to take some other action to improve relations with the Indonesian Government. At present we did littlecommercial trade with Indonesia, largely because we were notprepared to extend export credits for longer than three years. If theperiod of credit could be extended to five years, valuable commercialcontracts could be obtained.57280-^1Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Parliament would adjourn for the Whitsun recess on 3rd june and would reassemble on 20th June.
In discussion it was explained that the Dutch enquiry for thepurchase of Shackleton aircraft was extremely tentative, and could hardly be regarded as a sufficient reason for refraining from sellingsimilar aircraft to Indonesia. Since these aircraft were unarmedand could not easily be used for aggressive purposes, it was not reallynecessary to hold up negotiations for the sale of them to Indonesia.However, it would be essential, in the interests of maintaining good relations with the Dutch Government, whose attitude to our economic problems in Europe had been helpful, to allow sufficient time to explain to them our reasons for proceeding with the sale ofthese aircraft. It was generally agreed that, in the circumstances described by the Foreign Secretary, it would be advisable to postpone the supply of destroyers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in view of Indonesia^large commercial debt, an extension of the present export creditcover of three years would not be justified on economic grounds.He suggested that this question should be examined by the economic policy Committee.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, subject to Conclusion (2), negotiations could take place for the sale of eight unarmed Shackletonaircraft to Indonesia, but that a decision to supplydestroyers should be postponed.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the dutch government of the decision recorded in Conclusion (1).(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theEconomic Policy Committee to consider the question ofcommercial credits for Indonesia.industrial relations.(previous reference:C.C. (57). 52ndConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour (C. (60) 84) proposing discussions with employersand trade unions on problems in the field of industrial relations.The Minister of Labour recalled the pledge given by theGovernment at the time of the General Election that they would&quot; invite the representatives of employers and trade unions to considerafresh with them the human and industrial problems that the next five years would bring &quot;. Now that the last round of wage claimswas almost finished the time was opportune for a move to fulfil this undertaking. Constructive discussion was needed on a number ofindustrial problems such as the absorption of the increasing numberof young people into industry and the methods of training them, theneed for greater mobility of labour and problems of staff managementconsequent on technological developments. While some of these were within the scope of existing consultative bodies, including theNational Productivity Advisory Council for Industry (N.P.A.C.I.) andthe National Joint Advisory Council (N.J.A.C.) these bodies had not always proved effective. A new approach was now required, andthis might most suitably be inaugurated by a meeting of both sides of industry under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister, whichmight result in the formation of a steering committee to plan a seriesof studies by separate groups.Discussion showed that, while there was general agreement thatthe time was ripe for a fresh approach to these problems, there weredifferences of opinion in the Cabinet on the best method of approach.The proposed talks could not be expected to assist the Governmentto find answers to the fundamental economic issues of the day, suchas the problem of maintaining full employment without running intoinflation and balance of payments difficulties. Moreover, unless theywere to go further than discussion of the need for increased
5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (60) 86) about the position of SouthAfrican refugees in the High Commission Territories.The Commonwealth Secretary said that a number of refugees from South Africa, including some known Communists, were atpresent staying in the High Commission Territories. He had authorised the High Commissioner to issue temporary permits to reside in the Territories and none of the refugees had yet hadoccasion to apply for maintenance from official sources. Some ofthem, however, wished to leave the Territories and this would usuallyproductivity and wage restraint, which had been the constant themeof consultations with industry in the past, they were unlikely toproduce worth-while results and might even prove politicallydamaging. There were, however, more limited and concrete problems on which discussion with both sides of industry could be of real value e.g., in addition to those mentioned by the Minister of Labour,the level of profits and their relation to wages and the possibility of ensuring that account was taken of the general economic situationin wage negotiation and arbitration. There were also wider problems arising, for example, from the development of the European free trade Association and the European Common Market and theirrelation to one another on which it would be valuable to secure thesupport of both sides of industry for the Governments policies.But, unless the Government could be assured in advance that bothsides were willing to work seriously and constructively on thesepractical issues, there was a risk that any general meeting preside over by the Prime Minister might lead to anti-climax. It might therefore be better to begin with less formal discussions on a smaller scale, but even these were unlikely to be productive unless theGovernment had already formulated their own views before thediscussions began.Apart from the general economic problems with which indusrty was faced, there would be advantage if some progress could be madeon the problems of the individual worker, e.g., his position in relationto his trade union and the possibilities of a system of contracts ofservice. Technically, it might be preferable to raise these at a later stage, when the Government had gained the confidence of both sides of industry, and this would also give the Government more time to formulate their own plans.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that it wasagreed that the time was ripe for a fresh Government initiative tosecure more effective consultation in industrial relations. before a decision was taken on the best method of achieving this, further thought should be given to the various considerations advanced inthe Cabinet&apos;s discussion. A possible alternative would be for himto preside over a joint meeting of the National Productivity AdvisoryCouncil for Industry and the National Joint Advisory Council, witha view to the appointment of a joint committee to advise how best to put in hand studies of the practical problems with which theGovernment and industry were faced.The Cabinet1 Invited the Minister of Labour to give further thought, inthe light of their discussion, to the proposals put forward in C. (60) 84; and to submit for the Prime Ministersconsideration proposals for a practical plan of action togive effect to them.
involve transit through the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.For this purpose the Government of the Federation would not require that the refugees should hold passports and were willing toaccept travel documents issued by the High Commissioner on behalfof the United Kingdom Government (though not documents issuedby the Government of Ghana, to which some of the refugees wishedto travel). The issue of travel documents on a large scale would almost certainly provoke the Government of the Union to retaliateagainst the Territories or to seek to recover the refugees under theFugitive Offenders Act, 1881. Under this Act, as applied by anOrder-in-Council of 1913, the Union Government could issue a warrant for the arrest of a fugitive for any offence (including apolitical offence) punishable by law in the Union and a magistratein the High Commission Territories could not refuse to return thefugitive unless, in all the circumstances of the case, that would seemunjust or oppressive. On the other hand, public opinion in thiscountry would be hostile to a total refusal to issue any traveldocuments to these people, and there was some reason to thinkthat the Government of the Union would not object strongly to theissue of a limited number over a period of time. Meanwhile, private arrangements had been made by a citizen of Ghana to transporta number of the refugees by charter plane direct to the belgian congo, without landing in the Federation: this was likely to be unwelcome to the Government of the Union and an attempt shouldbe made to persuade the Prime Minister of Ghana to prevent itsrecurrence.Discussion showed that there was general support for theCommonwealth Secretary&apos;s proposals. We should try to dissuadethe Government of the Union from proceeding against any of the refugees under the Fugitive Offenders Act; but, if this proved impossible, a considerable delay in the operation of the Act couldbe secured by arranging for appeals to the Privy Council.Meanwhile, an amendment to the Order-in-Council of 1913 shouldbe prepared, so as to exclude political offences from the scope ofthe relevant part of the Act; but the amendment should not be made,nor the Governmenfs intention announced, unless the Union actuallyinvoked the Act.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in C. (60) 86.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.26th May, 1960.
