Cyprus. 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that the representatives of the(Previous Greek Cypriots had asked that the time-table for the establishmentReference: of an independent Republic of Cyprus should be postponed for one.C. (59) 51st month, from 19th February to 19th March, 1960, in order to allowConclusions, more time for the settlement of the outstanding questions which were minute 3.)      being considered by the current conference in London. This request was supported by the Turkish Cypriots, provided that the elections in Cyprus were also postponed for a month.The conference had not so far discussed the United Kingdom&apos;s requirements for sites and facilities outside the proposed sovereignareas, or the economic and financial aspects of a settlement.Considerable progress had, however, been made in discussions aboutthe sovereign areas. The conference had been persuaded that theUnited Kingdom&apos;s requirements in this respect were reasonable andmoderate. The prospects of reaching agreement on the sovereignareas had been materially improved by our willingness to agree that,while essential services should be retained under United kingdom control, certain local administrative functions in the sovereign areas should be operated by the authorities of the Republic on an agencybasis.In these circumstances further negotiations would be necessaryto reach agreement on all the points th t would have to be incorporated in the Treaty of Establishment or in the papers to be presented to Parliament. If the numerous outstanding issues were forced to a conclusion on the following day, the results might be unsatisfactory. Provided that it could be made clear that theinitiative came from the Cypriot leaders, it might be best to agree to postpone the time-table for one month. But this should be on the firm understanding that the Cypriot leaders should remain in Londonand endeavour to reach agreement on all outstanding issues beforethe end of the week, failing which the Principals of the LondonAgreement, including the Greek and Turkish Foreign Ministers,would reassemble to review the whole position. The foreign secretary said that, subject to the views of his colleagues, he would propose to issue a statement at once, embodying the points he had indicated.Discussion showed that the Cabinet agreed with the course proposed by the Foreign Secretary. It was important that, whileArchbishop Makarios was in London, he should be associated as closely as possible with the further negotiations. The UnitedKingdom representatives in these negotiations should bear in mind that only certain agreed minor modifications to the proposals alreadyput forward would be consistent with the essential requirement ofestablishing an effective military base in Cyprus. Any further discussions on the association of Cyprus with the commonwealth should be held in abeyance until later in the week. If by then theprospects of reaching agreement on the Cyprus settlement as a wholehad receded, urgent consideration should be given to the steps needed to maintain security throughout the Island of Cyprus for a further period of British administration.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, to arrange for negotiations for theestablishment of an independent Republic of Cyprus toproceed on the lines agreed in their discussion.
Kenya. 2.   The Colonial Secretary said that the African elected members(Previous        had boycotted the opening of the Kenya Constitutional Conference,Reference:       in protest against his refusal to admit Mr. Koinange as a secondC.C. (59) 57th   special adviser to their delegation. He was prepared to agree that theConclusions,     delegation could have a second adviser, in addition to the AmericanMmute 2.)      lawyer,   Dr.   Marshall,   who   had  already  been   chosen.    but mr. Koinange was personally unacceptable: he was one of the two men now outside Kenya who were regarded by the Government of kenya as having a special responsibility for the Mau Mau rebellion,and he would be liable to detention if he returned there.   To haveadmitted Mr. Koinange would not only have placed the Kenya government in an impossible position, but many of the european members would have refused to remain in the Conference.Efforts were being made to persuade the African elected membersthat, now that they had made their public protests, it would be intheir interest to take part in the remaining work of the Conference.In any case, it would be best for the Conference to continue, with aview to giving publicity to the constructive proposals which theUnited Kingdom Government would put forward in the course ofthe discussions.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the colonial secretary.Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland.NyasalandEmergency.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 1stConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Colonial Secretary said that the Governor of Nyasalandhad expressed some apprehensions about the proposed programme for the release of detainees, including Dr. Banda. It might help tomeet the Governors apprehensions if the date of his own visit toNyasaland, one of the purposes of which was the initiation of constitutional consultations, were to be advanced to March. Theannouncement of his visit could then be made sufficiently early to make it possible to consider releasing Dr. Banda in February.This would enable the Government to avoid appearing to agree tohis release only as the result of criticism in Parliament.The Colonial Secretary said that he proposed to consult thePrime Minister about this course of action, since the Prime Ministerintended to discuss the matter with the Governor of Nyasaland.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the colonial secretary.East AfricanLand Forces.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 1stConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposed transfer of responsibility for the East African Land Forces (E.A.L.F.).They had before them two memoranda on this subject (C. (60) 1 andC. (60) 4) by the Colonial Secretary.The Colonial Secretary said that the African Governors had given reassuring answers on the question of possible political objections by local leaders. If the Cabinet accepted in principle his proposal that the United Kingdom Government should assume fulladministrative and financial responsibility for these forces from 1st July, 1960, and that local contributions toward the cost need notbe sought, he would consult his colleagues again at a later stage aboutthe form and timing of any announcement which might be called forin the light of developments during the current Kenya conference.The financial implications of United Kingdom support for E.A.L.F.could not fail to be of considerable importance for the future of thethree East African territories.
5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Housing and Local Government (C. (60) 2) on legislation to secure more effective control of caravan sites.The Minister of Housing said that legislation for the more effective control of caravan sites was urgently required in order toprevent the recurrence of incidents such as had occurred at Egham,where eviction orders had been obtained against a substantial numberof caravanners who were unable to find alternative sites oraccommodation. His proposals, which had been approved by theHome Affairs Committee, envisaged a stricter machinery of control in particular, that planning permission to develop a site for caravansshould be a condition- of obtaining the licence required under thePublic Health Act, and that the period of grace provided by thepresent law before a licence need be obtained should be abolished.If these and related amendments in the law were made, and if their powers were increased-in particular, if they were empowered toprovide caravan sites themselves and for that purpose to buy landcompulsorily the local authorities could be expected to adopt a moreco-operative attitude towards the whole problem of the caravan sites.The present machinery for enforcing the planning law left excessiveopportunities for evasion and the Minister also proposed to replace the statutory provisions governing the action open to a developerupon whom an enforcement notice was served by simple appeal to himself (with an appeal to the High Court on any point of law). Thisproposal had the support of the Lord Chancellor and the attorney-General.legislative programme,1959-60.Caravan Sites.(previous references:C.C. (59) 54thConclusions,Minute 5* and.C.C. (58) 79thConclusions,Minute 6.)C.C. 2 (60)The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it had in general beenaccepted as normal and desirable that basic services, such as those. of local security, should increasingly become the responsibility of colonial Governments emerging towards independence. Anyappearance of reversing this trend could have serious repercussions.In any case, it would not now be possible to accept any additional commitments for the forthcoming financial year without comparableoffsetting economies.In discussion the Cabinet were reminded of the militaryadvantages that would follow from the resumption of full UnitedKingdom control over E.A.L.F. from 1st July, 1960, onwards.Further, it was noted that the problems and difficulties of the threeEast African territories might make it especially desirable to retain our military&apos; strength in this area, even though as a general rulepolicies of this kind were not adopted in relation to emergingCommonwealth countries.Summing up, the Home Secretary said that the general feeling ofthe Cabinet was that the Colonial Secretary&apos;s proposals were desirable in principle. But, in view of the difficulty of accepting the expenditure involved in the coming financial year, it would be necessary for theMinisters concerned, bearing in mind the possibility that it might bedesirable to make an announcement during the Kenya conference,to consider whether the implementation of the proposals could be postponed or whether the expenditure involved could be offset bymeans of economies elsewhere.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary, in consultation with . theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Defence andthe Secretary of State for War, to give further considerationto the question of the East African Land Forces on the lines indicated by the Home Secretary.
legislative programme,1959-60.ProfessionsSupplementaryto MedicineBill.(previous references:C.C. (59) 54thConclusions,Minute 5, andC.C. (59) 63rdConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Home Secretary said that consideration of the professions Supplementary to Medicine Bill in Standing Committeewas due to begin on 28th January. It would not be possible to reach a final decision on the form of the Second Schedule, which providedthat disciplinary bodies in the professions concerned should havepower to subpoena witnesses, until the report had been received from lord Simonds&apos; committee on subpoena by disciplinary tribunals. Inthe circumstances, it might be desirable either to defer the Bill, about which the Governments supporters in Parliament had expressedmisgivings, until the next session, or to defer until later in the sessionits consideration by the Standing Committee.The Minister of Health said that the Bill, which gave effect to a pledge contained in the Governments Election Manifesto of 1955,depended on a somewhat precarious agreement between the professions concerned. If there were any substantial delay thisagreement might disintegrate and the Bill be lost. It would thereforebe preferable to amend the Second Schedule so as to remove thepower of subpoena: it could then, if necessary, be further amended in accordance with whatever decisions were taken on therecommendations of Lord Simonds&apos; committee, either later in thepassage of the Bill or in subsequent legislation.In discussion there was general agreement that the passage ofthe Bill should proceed as planned, on the understanding that theSecond Schedule would be amended on the lines proposed by theMinister of Health. If, however, it appeared likely that there wouldbe any long delay before the report of Lord Simonds&apos; committee wasreceived, it might be necessary to reconsider this decision.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Home Secretary would consult LordSimonds on the length of time his committee were likelyto require for their work.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.To empower the local authorities to buy land compulsorily for theprovision of caravan sites might prove controversial but was essentialas a residuary means of dealing with sites and situations for which no other power would be adequate. It was understood that theSecretary of State for Scotland wished the Bill to apply to Scotland,but this would materially complicate both the drafting of the Bill andits handling in Parliament and might indeed imperil the passage ofthe Bill during the present session, which was made necessary by the continuous danger of further embarrassing incidents.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Housing, in consultation with theLord Chancellor and the Attorney-General, to give further consideration to the details of the enforcementmachinery proposed in the Annex to C. (60) 2.(2) Subject   to   the  further   consideration   referred   to   inConclusion (1), approved the proposals in C. (60) 2 and authorised the drafting of a Bill for introduction in thecurrent session of Parliament.(3) Took note that the Home Secretary would discuss with theSecretary of State for Scotland the application of theBill to Scotland.(4) Authorised the Minister of Housing, in consultation with theHome Secretary, to make an early announcement of theGovernments intentions.
Europe.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 1stConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave the Cabinet a general account of the meetings which had been held in Paris on12th-14th January to discuss economic questions.He said that the discussions were entirely taken up withprocedural issues, and the problem of relations between the european economic Community (E.E.C.) and the European Free trade association (E.F.T.A.) had not been dealt with in substance at all.It had been decided that a new group should be set up to discussquestions of aid; this would consist of donor countries, but wouldnot include Japan. It had also been agreed that the consideration ofEuropean trade problems should be undertaken by working partieswhich would be established by the members of the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) and the United Statesand Canada, following a meeting of officials in about a month&apos;s time.Although the size and composition of these working parties had notyet been settled, it had been agreed that their purpose would be toexamine, as a matter of priority, the relationship between E.E.C. andE.F.T.A. with due regard to the commercial interests of third countries. It had further been decided that a working group of officials would prepare an initial report on the adaptation, but notthe replacement, of the O.E.E.C.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that we had succeeded in maintaining our immediate objectives, namely the consilidation of E.F.T.A., the retention of O.E.E.C., and the association of theUnited States and Canada in European economic problems. he undertook to circulate a full report on the economic discussions inParis for the information of the Cabinet.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.commercial policy.Relaxation ofImportRestrictions.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 55thConclusions,Minute 5.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 3) proposing a further relaxation of restrictions in imports.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it would help to meetprotectionist pressures in the United States if an announcement wereto be made at the end of January that restrictions would be removed from a number of imports including tobacco, fish, synthetic rubber and transistors. The Anglo-American Film Agreement should bebrought to an end at the same time. The restrictions on a furtherlist of items, consisting mainly of milk, dyes and dyestuffs, and certaincanned fruit, might be removed in late February or March. The netaddition to the total import bill of the United Kingdom, as a resultof removing restrictions on both lists, would be about  5-6 millions a year. But this cost was far outweighed by the danger to our balance of payments from the possible growth of restrictive tradepolicies in the United States. Although the exclusion of canned fruit from the first list might lead to criticism in the United States, itwould be necessary to give further consideration to this item in thelight of consultations which were at present being held with theC.C. 2 (60)(2) Subject to the consultation referred to in Conclusion (1).agreed that the Professions Supplementary to MedicineBill should proceed as planned, subject to the amendmentof the Second Schedule so as to remove the power ofsubpoena.
Commonwealth Governments concerned. The Economic PolicyCommittee was in general agreement with the programme which hehad outlined.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The Government of the Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland had agreed to the proposal to remove restrictions ontobacco imports, subject to assurances which had been given to them,including one about the level of preference for Rhodesian tobacco.The Federal Government wanted an announcement to be made well before the tobacco auctions which would be held in March. It wasin fact unlikely that imports of Rhodesian tobacco would suffer fromthe removal of the restrictions.(b) There were considerable political difficulties about includingfish. The fishing industry disliked the concessions recently made to the Scandinavian countries, and were also apprehensiveabout the outcome of the forthcoming conference on the Law of theSea. But the maintenance of restrictions on imports of fish wasindefensible on balance of payments grounds, and if the restrictions were to be removed it would be best for this to be done as soon aspossible.(c) While the United States authorities could be informed thatcanned fruit was among the items which were being considered, itwould be unwise to give any indication at the present time that itwas likely to be included in the second list. The intention to includecanned fruit in a future list should, however, be reported to thePrime Minister before his arrival in the Union of South Africa on27th January.(d) The proposed removal of restrictions did not affect importsfrom Japan. It might be that in due course the United StatesGovernment would press us to adopt increasingly liberal tradepolicies towards Japan; but it should be possible for us to resist this.(e) It was pointed out that the United States policy on shippingwas highly discriminatory. While it would be unwise to try to secure some improvement in return for the removal of our import restrictions, we should lose no opportunity of persuading the UnitedStates to adopt a more liberal policy in this respect.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (60) 3.commercial policy.Anglo-PolishTrade Talks.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 64thConclusions,Minute 3.)9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by minister of Aviation (C. (60) 7) on the sale of aircraft to Poland.theThe Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Aviation, recalled thatthe Cabinet had previously decided that the request for an increase intheir quota of canned ham which the Polish Government had madein the course of the recent trade negotiations could not be granted,but that, as an inducement to buy from us three Viscount aircraft,they should be offered instead an increase in their quota of butter.The negotiations had subsequently come to an end without any new agreement yet having been reached. There was reason to believethat the Poles were not in any case interested in an increase in theirbutter quota. However, because of the value of the projected orderof Viscounts, not only in itself but also because it would be the firstsale of aircraft to the Sino-Soviet bloc and might be expected to leadto further orders, the Minister sought the agreement of the Cabinetto reopen with the Poles the discussion of their canned ham quota.An additional argument in favour of selling the Viscount aircraft to poland was that, until the Polish airline had been equipped with modern aircraft, British European Airways would not be allowed to fly Comet aircraft into Warsaw and might, as a consequence, haveto reduce their services to Lisbon.
10. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (60) 5) proposing that the special annual payment tothe Metropolitan Police Fund in respect of imperial and nationalservices should be increased from the  100,000 fixed in 1909 to 475,000, at an annual cost to the Exchequer of  187,500: and amemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 8) setting out the arguments against this proposed increase.In discussion it was agreed that before this issue was consideredby the Cabinet it would be helpful if it were first discussed furtherby the Home Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Home Secretary would discuss further with the Chancellor of the Exchequer the question of apossible increase in the imperial and national servicesgrant to the Metropolitan Police.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of C. (60) 5 and C. (60) 8at a later meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,19th January, 1960.government expenditure.MetropolitanPolice Fund.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 47thConclusions,Minute 6.)In discussion it was pointed out that the Cabinet had consideredthe Polish proposal for an increase in their quota of canned ham on two occasions and had agreed that, in the interests of our domesticindustry, the request must be refused. This decision had been takenin the full knowledge that it was likely to have an adverse effect onour trade with Poland, including the possible sale of Viscounts. Thepolitical arguments against increasing the Polish quota of cannedham were no less strong now. In the absence of any new circumstances or of any new offer we might be in a position to make to Poland, there seemed no ground for reopening discussions withthem.The Cabinet Reaffirmed their decision not to increase the Polish quota of canned ham.
