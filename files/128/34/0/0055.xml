IJJ SECRET 3C.C. 55 (60)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Power (C. (60) 152) about the prospects for the supplyof house coal for the coming winter.The Minister of Power said that in recent months there had beena sharp rise in the demand for house coal, partly on account of the bad weather and in anticipation of the increases in the winter priceof coal. As a result coal merchants&apos; stocks were now only -35 million tons compared with 1-77 million tons in 1959, and theundistributed stocks of large coal held by the National Coal board had fallen to 1-04 million tons compared with 2-65 million tons ayear ago. The Board estimated that, in addition to the running down of merchants&apos; stocks, they would themselves have to meet a demandfor 24 million tons of house coal. They hoped to provide 22-million tons from current production, though this assumed aconsiderable improvement in the percentage of large coal in their total output. If this hope were not fulfilled, there might be a deficiency of as much as a million tons of house coal during thewinter. With normal weather, it should be possible to meet this deficiency from the Board&apos;s stocks of other coal, although the qualitywould not be altogether acceptable to consumers. In any event itwas important that transport facilities should be adequate tomaintain the level of merchants&apos; stocks. The Board were doing everything possible to encourage production of a somewhat higherpercentage of large coal, and were pressing the British transport commission to make sure that adequate transport would be available.In discussion it was pointed out that various proposals for the better utilisation of small coal were still being examined. There wasneed for further research into this problem, since the proportion ofsmall coal produced would tend to increase with the furtherintroduction of mechanisation. Greater productivity and areduction in costs could not be achieved if the mechanisation policy were to be slowed down.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of C. (60) 152.(2) Invited the Minister of Power, in consultation with the paymaster-General and the Minister of Transport, to review the problem of ensuring adequate supplies of housecoal during the winter, and to submit a further report tothe Cabinet before Christmas.Coal(previous reference:C.C. (60) 21stConclusions,Minute 4)national health service(previous reference:C.C. (60) 54thConclusions,Minute 6)2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposals toincrease the National Health Service contribution and to allowprivate patients to obtain medicines on National Health Serviceterms, originally put before them in memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Home Secretary (C. (60) 148 and 137).They now had before them further memoranda by the Chancellor(C. (60) 153) and the Minister of Pensions (C. (60) 156 and 157).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that since their earlier discussion he had considered a number of variations of his original proposal that early legislation should be introduced to increase theNational Health Service contribution by Is. from the following April.He was satisfied that, in view of the general state of the economy, itwould be justifiable to relieve the Exchequer by the  50 millions ayear which this increase would yield, and his own preferenceremained for his original proposal. He was, however, willing to agreethat this should be effected by separate legislation, rather than in theBill providing for increased National Insurance contributions and benefits, in order to ease the presentation of his own proposal by
making clear the essential distinction between the National insurance and National Health Service elements in the total weekly contribution. Alternatively and again in order to ease its presentation, he would be prepared to defer the increase in the health Service contribution by three months, although the benefit tothe Exchequer in the next financial year would then be proportionatelyreduced. He had also considered the suggestion put forward in the cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion that the increase might be accompaniedby the abolition of the present prescription charge and by the concession of drugs on National Health Service terms for private patients and should be of such an amount as would offset the consequent loss to the Exchequer as well as bring in the  50 millionsderived from an increase of Is. This alternative was, however, opento the objection that it would be difficult to justify abolishing theprescription charge at a time when expenditure on drugs in the health service was a matter of serious concern and when, if the proposalsbeing worked out by the Minister of Health were accepted, theabolition of the charge would be immediately followed by drasticeconomy measures in the Service.Discussion showed that the balance of opinion in the cabinet was that the political disadvantage of immediate action to increasethe Health Service contribution would be severe. Although thiscourse would bring the maximum benefit to the Exchequer and therewas something to be said for concentrating, rather than dispersing,criticism of the increase in the total contribution, it would be difficultto defend increasing the total at the same time as the higher-paid workers were being required, by the introduction of the newgraduated pensions scheme and the recently agreed increase in benefits, to meet a sharp increase in the National Insurance elementand the lower-paid workers would, in order to finance the increasedbenefits, be deprived of the reduction in that element which they hadbeen promised.There was general agreement also that, in spite of its attractionas offering the best, if not the only, context in which the proposed concession to private patients could be made politically acceptable,there were overriding objections to the alternative course involvingabolition of the prescription charge.The choice therefore lay between (i) announcing the Is. increasein the Health Service contribution in the following February, so as totake effect in July, and (ii) taking no early action to increase the contribution, the increase in the cost of the Health Service being leftto be met from general taxation and from such economies as might prove feasible. The advantage of the former course would be boththe earlier relief it would bring to the national economy and the factthat it could be presented to Parliament concurrently with the SupplyEstimates, including those of the Ministry of Health, and withwhatever proposals to contain the cost of the Service were approvedby the Cabinet. If these were effective they might, together with theincrease in the contribution, more than offset the prospective increasein the cost over the next two years, but it must be accepted that thecost would continue to increase thereafter and that, over a period,action on both fronts would be found to be necessary.The Cabinet went on to consider whether, if this course were adopted, it would be politically possible that it should be preceded oraccompanied by the proposed concession to private patients. Whileit was argued that the concession might make it easier to secure acceptance of economies in the Health Service by the medical profession and the Government^ supporters in Parliament, theCabinet had already recognised the extreme difficulty of following upa concession to a small and relatively prosperous section of thecommunity by action which would affect adversely a very muchgreater number of people who were in a less favourable position tomeet any increased burden. Moreover, the Government had already undertaken to review the possibility of abolishing the prescription
charge early in 1962, on the completion of an experimental schemefor the voluntary limitation of the quantities of drugs prescribed bydoctors, and this would be a more favourable context in which toconsider allowing private patients to obtain their drugs on health service terms.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that, whilethe difference of opinion in the Cabinet had not yet been fullyresolved, the general feeling appeared to be in favour of announcinga Is. increase in the Health Service contribution in the followingspring, at or about the same time as the announcement of sucheconomies in the Service as the Cabinet might approve. But before a final decision was reached the Cabinet should have more time forreflection on this issue and on the question whether the proposed concession to private patients could, without undue political embarrassment, be fitted into the pattern of action contemplated.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of C. (60) 153 and 137at a later meeting-Liquor(previous reference:C.C. (59) 41stConclusions,Minute 9)LicensingBill3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (60) 154) on the Licensing Bill.The Home Secretary said that the content of this Bill, which itwas intended to introduce early in the coming Session, had beenapproved by the Home Affairs Committee. Its main effect would beto make it easier for restaurants and residential hotels to obtainlicences for the sale of liquor; to improve the law on permitted hours;and to establish tests which would ensure that respectable clubs whichwere effectively controlled by their members and did not supplyliquor for private profit could secure registration, while clubs which did not satisfy those tests would be subject to the full control of the licensing justices in the same way as public houses. A few pointsremained to be settled on permitted hours in clubs and on the methodof safeguarding well-established clubs which technically wereproprietary clubs.The Cabinet were informed that the question of the Sunday opening of public houses in Wales and Monmouthshire had not yetbeen decided. The Government^ supporters in Wales would be embarrassed by a Government decision reached without any opportunity for the organised expression of Welsh public opinion,but there were serious objections to the suggestion that a nation-widereferendum should be held on this issue. It was not certain that anindependent enquiry on the lines of that recently completed inScotland would produce conclusive results. Consideration wastherefore being given to including in the Licensing Bill provision forsome form of local option, possibly by way of local poll on a county and county borough basis.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the Home Secretary&apos;s proposalsfor a Licensing Bill in the coming Session.SuicideBill4. The Home Secretary said that there was widespread support for the view that suicide and attempted suicide should cease to becriminal offences. This view commanded the support of the legal and medical professions and of the Churches. The Criminal law revision Committee, in a report recently published, recommendedthat, if this change were made, a new offence-complicity in the
suicide or attempted suicide of another person-should be createdwith a maximum penalty of 14 years&apos; imprisonment. These proposals had all been approved by the Home Affairs Committee and theintention was that a Bill to give effect to them should be introduced in the House of Lords early in the coming Session.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the HomeSecretary.East AfricanBuildingSocieties(previous reference:C.C. (60) 52ndConclusions,Minute 2)5. The Colonial Secretary said that, following further consultations which he had had with the Chancellor of theExchequer, it had now been agreed that the Colonial development corporation would participate financially in a scheme for there organisation of certain building societies in Kenya, which would support them in their current difficulties and place them on a sounderbasis for future development. This arrangement was dependent onthe outcome of certain outstanding issues relating to the colonial development Corporation^ future which were being separatelydiscussed, but there was good reason to hope that these would be satisfactorily settled.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Colonial Secretary.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,25th October, 1960.
