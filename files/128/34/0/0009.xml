2. The Prime Minister said he did not propose at this stage tomake a detailed report to the Cabinet on the visit which he had justmade to the four Commonwealth countries in Africa which hadattained, or were nearing, independence. Some of the specificproblems which he had been studying at first hand in Africa would come to the Cabinet for decision in due course. Meanwhile, he wouldcontent himself with giving a few of the impressions which he had formed during his tour.Ghana, he thought, would have few serious problems to face.The politicians might behave irresponsibly from time to time, in thefirst flush of independence; but this was a country inhabited by ahomogeneous population and rich in natural resources and neitherits political nor its economic problems need be serious.Nigeria had a great future before it if, under its Federal structure,its various peoples could work together in a spirit of national unity.It was a large country and could exercise a valuable influence over its smaller neighbours. The new discoveries of oil which had beenmade there might substantially strengthen its economy. Its leaders were ready to accept continuing advice and assistance from theUnited Kingdom, and there was good reason to hope that it would prove a loyal and useful member of the Commonwealth.In South Africa the main political problems arose from thedoctrinaire policy of the Nationalist Government on race relations.Though we could not endorse that policy, we must remember that itwas their responsibility, not Ours. It would be a tragedy if SouthAfrica&apos;s links with the Commonwealth were weakened by reason of differences of opinion on that question. South Africa had a strong and flourishing economy and had a valuable part to play in theCommonwealth.In the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the UnitedKingdom Government had a more direct responsibility for finding a means of constitutional progress in&apos;a multi-racial society. This wasa difficult ask, and it had been made even more difficult by theapprehensions aroused among Europeans in the Federation by the rapid growth of national consciousness throughout Africa. It was now our duty to find a way of constitutional advance which would besufficient to satisfy the Africans without unduly alarming the europeans. In this, the work of the Monckton Commission should prove to be valuable. The immediate need was to study Europeanopinion in these territories and to keep it stable while the processes of constitutional review were being carried out over the next year.There was at present a real risk that the future of Federation wouldbe prejudiced before those processes could be completed.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement.SECRET56650-9 b 2PnrneMinistersAfrican Tour.Cabinet 1.   The Prime Minister said that, while he had been away in africa, the Cabinet had had to deal with a number of difficult andintricate problems. He was grateful to them for the way in whichthese had been handled. He wished, in particular, to express hisdeep appreciation of the skill and leadership which the HomeSecretary had shown in overcoming the difficulties which hadconfronted the Government during his absence.
Soviet Union.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 15thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that the main theme of recentspeeches by Mr. Khrushchev in India had been the advantages ofthe Soviet Governments economic aid to under-developed countries as compared with that given by the West. It was by no meansunsatisfactory from our own point of view that Mr. Khrushchev had invited this.comparison, and we should not shrink from accepting the challenge. It would give us the opportunity to explain what we hadin fact done for the under-developed countries. There were, however,indications that Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s attitude had offended Indiansusceptibilities, and it would be necessary to take care over the presentation of our case.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Cyprus.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 6thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Foreign Secretary said that, since the return of theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies to thiscountry, the Governor of Cyprus had continued his discussions withthe Cypriot representatives on a number of outstanding issues otherthan the extent of the sovereign areas. Several new points had been raised by the Cypriots, and the Governor was preparing a report onthe result of his negotiations. He had suggested that he should return to this country to submit his report. Our present objective wasto reach agreement with the Cypriots on all the outstanding matters before discussing whether any further concession on the sovereignareas might be acceptable. It might be preferable for the Governornot to return at present, since the best means of reaching agreement,apart from the question of the sovereign areas, might be to arrangefor a further visit by a Minister to Cyprus at an early date.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith the course proposed by the Foreign Secretary. There would beno point in reviving discussions in the London Joint Committee. Itwas by no means clear whether Archbishop Makarios was preparedto come to an agreement, except on his own terms, at the presenttime. Nevertheless, he might be brought to face the need for reaching agreement if he realised that the Turkish Cypriots were no longerprepared to support him in his intransigent attitude.In further discussion the following points were raised:(a) There was increasing anxiety in Cyprus about unemployment.It would not, however, be in our interests to relieve this situation bybeginning work on development projects at the present time.(b) One of the outstanding issues was the amount of financialassistance we should provide. The Cypriot authorities expectedmore than the  10 millions which we had so far agreed to make available over a five-year period. While it would be wrong to linkour financial assistance directly with the provision of defence facilities, it had to be recognised that we should have the benefit ofthose facilities for an indefinite period. It would not therefore be unreasonable for us to accept a positive undertaking to review thequestion of financial assistance at the end of five years.(c) The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded the Cabinet thatthe amount of financial assistance required had steadily increased during the negotiations. He had agreed to the offer of  10 millions on the clear understanding that a substantial part of it could be paidduring the current financial year. It was essential to ensure that theamount to be paid in 1960-61 should be kept to the minimum.(d) While we should give no indication at present that we wereprepared to make any further concession about the extent of the sovereign areas, it might be possible, if agreement were to be reached on all other outstanding issues, to accept in a final settlement some reduction of the proposed area of 120 square miles. The Minister ofDefence had already asked the military authorities to consider
industrial disputes.railway wages.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 8thConclusions.Minute 1.)whether any marginal adjustments of the proposed boundaries ofthe sovereign areas could be accepted. It was suggested that a more substantial reduction, perhaps to about 100 square miles, might be acceptable from a military point of view if special facilities, such asthe right to occupy the territory concerned in an emergency, couldbe obtained over the adjoining area. But it had to be recognised thatit would be difficult to reach agreement on a satisfactory definition of special facilities. Moreover, to import any new concept, such asspecial facilities, or condominium, would lead to the danger that allthe negotiations might be reopened.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernor should not return to this country for the time being, but should report on the position reached in his recent negotiations withthe Cypriot representatives. In the light of this report, it would benecessary to decide how to bring the negotiations, apart from thequestion of the extent of the sovereign areas, to a conclusion. Thebest course might be to make it clear to Archbishop Makarios thatwe would not consider any further concession on the sovereign areasuntil agreement had been reached on all other outstanding matters.It might be desirable for a Minister to visit Cyprus to pursuenegotiations on this basis.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary to ask the Governor of cyprus not to return to this country for the time beingbut to submit a report on his recent negotiations withArchbishop Makarios.5. The Minister of Transport said that the report of the guillebaud Committee would be available in the week beginning29th February, and would no doubt lead to early claims for further increases in railway wages, including differential increases. Thecost of the interim increase that had now been agreed and the costof any further increases as a result of the Guillebaud report wouldaggravate the serious financial position of the railways. The british transport Commission would clearly be unable to repay their accumulated deficits and the interest on them, and the Governmentwould be subject to criticism if they continued to make loans fromthe Consolidated Fund which were irrecoverable. He contemplated the introduction of early legislation, which would include, as an interim measure, provision to make future advances by means of subsidy. He had also been considering proposals for there organisation of the Commission, which would include the separation of the Commission^ various activities and changes in thecapital structure of the Commission. It might be desirable to make an early statement to Parliament, to explain that the Governmentwere urgently considering the Commission^ financial position, andthe size and structure of its organisation, in the light of theCommission^ reappraisal of the railway modernisation plan and ofother developments, including the effect of wage increases.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was likely that therailway unions would seek full implementation of the findings of the guillebaud Committee. The Commission had always envisaged thatimplementation of these findings would have to be spread over aconsiderable period, at least two years. It might be necessary tomake it clear that any further general wage increase could not becontemplated for some time, though it might be possible to promisesome increase in respect of differential wage rates, subject to sufficientstudy of the report. In any case the Government would have to beready without undue delay to explain their general attitude to railway
wages in the light of the report. If the findings that were likely tobe reached by the Guillebaud Committee were to be implemented infull, and if the Commission&apos;s current deficit were to be met, it wouldbe necessary to raise an additional  100 millions in taxation.Moreover, if further increases in railway wages were granted, thiswould be bound to encourage pressure for higher wages generally.If these considerations were properly explained, public opinion wouldunderstand that the findings of the Guiliebaud Committee could notsafely be implemented except over a reasonably long period.Discussion showed that the Cabinet recognised that thenegotiations which would have to be undertaken with the railway unions following publication of the report of the guillebaud committee would require very careful handling. Ministers weredoubtful whether the conduct of these negotiations could safely beleft to the Commission. In any case the financial position of therailways would justify a major reorganisation of the Commission.The possibility of placing the Commission under direct ministerial control, at least for a period, should not be ruled out. DirectMinisterial control would, of course, increase the risk of a conflict between the unions and the Government. On the other, hand, sincethe immediate cost of any further wage increases would fall on theExchequer, it would probably not be possible for the Government to stand aside from the negotiations which would follow the publicationof the report of the Guillebaud Committee.Further discussion showed that it Was the view of the Cabinetthat there would be little advantage in making a statement toParliament until some fairly definite indication could be given ofthe policy which the Government would adopt towards theCommission. It might be possible for this to be worked out in thenext few weeks. In that event the statement could make clear theGovernments intentions as regards the finance and organisation ofthe Commission and the implementation of the Guillebaud report.The Prime Minister said that the Economic Policy Committeeshould give further consideration to the problems of the railways ata meeting on the following day at which he would be present, andthat for this purpose the Minister of Transport should circulateproposals for the reorganisation of the Commission.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Transport to circulate amemorandum about the reorganisation of the british transport Commission, for consideration by the economic policy Committee on the following day.Iron and SteelIndustry.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 2ndConclusions,Minute 11.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 24) on the disposal of the assets of the iron and steel industry which still remained in public ownership.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Governmentsremaining holdings consisted of Richard Thomas and BaldwinLimited (R.T.B.), the prior charges still held in companies alreadydenationalised, and a further 10 small companies remaining in public ownership. The Economic Policy Committee had considered thedisposal of these holdings and, while there were certain arguments in favour of retaining ownership of R.T.B., the political advantages of implementing in full the policy of the Iron and Steel Act, 1953,was an overwhelming reason for completing the, process of disposing of the remaining assets in public ownership. The Committee had therefore agreed that the Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation
Kenya. 7.   The Colonial Secretary said that he had on the previous day(Previous        presented formally to the Kenya Constitutional Conference the planReference:      for constitutional development which he had described to theCC. (60) 8th    Cabinet at their last meeting.   The plan provided for a slowerConclusions,    constitutional advance in Kenya than in either Tanganyika or UgandaMinute 2.)      and   contained   no   features   unacceptable   to   Her   Majesty&apos;sGovernment.  It had been accepted, though with reluctance, by the african Elected Members and, provided that agreement could bereached on safeguards for the rights of minorities, the New KenyaGroup had now been persuaded to accept it. The opposition of theUnited Party was unlikely to be effective.  If the Conference were finally to adopt the plan he proposed to present it to Parliament inthe form of a White Paper as soon as possible.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement by the colonial secretary.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th February, I960.Agency should be instructed, after consultation with their advisers,to prepare a scheme for the disposal of R.T.B. and to take advantageof any suitable opportunities for disposing of their other holdings,the whole process to be completed if possible within three years.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith the conclusions of the Economic Policy Committee. While thedisposal of R.T.B. would limit the Governments power directly tocreate additional steel capacity, the Minister of Power would still bein a position to offer incentives to expansion by way of loans fromthe Exchequer. The loss which must be expected on the sale of the prior charges still held by the Government should be largely offset bya substantial profit from the sale of equities, and it might be possibleto devise some means by which part of the additional  70 millionscapital required by R.T.B. would be advanced by the investing publicrather than by the Exchequer.In further discussion it was agreed that in the debate on theSecond Reading of the Iron and Steel (Financial Provisions) Bill theGovernments spokesman should indicate in general terms that they intended to dispose of their remaining holdings in the industry andthat the possibility of disposing of R.T.D. was not excluded.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in C. (60) 24.(2) Invited the Minister of Power, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to consider the terms of anearly announcement of the Governments general policy.
