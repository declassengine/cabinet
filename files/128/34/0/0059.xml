2 e) (congo republic(previous reference:C.C. (60) 57thConclusions,Minute 1)1. The Foreign Secretary said that the situation in the Congocontinued to be tense and there might be further clashes betweenCongolese soldiers under Colonel Mobutu and the United nations forces. President Kasavubu&apos;s nominees had now been recognised as representing the Congo in the General Assembly, and there was somehope that it might be possible for the President to convene a constitutional conference in the near future to consider the relationship of the central government with the provincial administration, including that of Katanga,The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Italy 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Prime Minister and hehad had useful conversations with Italian Ministers in Rome. TheItalian Government appeared to be sympathetic to our desire to achieve a settlement between the European Economic Community andthe European Free Trade Area and, if we could find a way of meetingtheir special agricultural problems, we might be able to count on come degree of Italian assistance in any future negotiations.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.United Nations! 3. The Foreign Secretary said that it was likely that in the nearGeneral future the United Kingdom representative would have to vote in aAssembly debate in the General Assembly on a resolution against colonialism(Previous sponsored by the Afro-Asian countries. In its present form this reference: resolution was wholly unacceptable especially as it called for theC.C. (60) 54th immediate grant of independence to all dependent territories. SomeConclusions, of our friends were suggesting that we should support amendments which would make it less objectionable. But it seemed most unlikelythat the sponsors would accept sufficient amendment to make it possible for us to vote for the resolution and, if so, it would be better to avoid participating in attempts to improve its terms. He proposedto keep in close touch with the Colonial Secretary about the way inwhich the United Kingdom representative should be instructed to dealwith this matter in the General Assembly.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Parliament 4.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Home Secretary said that a petition was shortly to be presented to the House of Commons on behalf of Mr. AnthonyWedgwood Benn, arguing that it was legally possible for him to renounce the peerage to which he had recently succeeded and that under the House of Commons Disqualification Act, 1957, he was entitled to remain a Member of that House.  Since, under Standing
LocalGovernmentGeneral Grant(previous reference:C.C. (60) 58thConclusions,Minute 6)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Scotland(C. (60) 171) on the general grant for the second grant period (1961-63)in Scotland.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the figures agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer showed an increase in theestimated expenditure on services covered by the general grant of4-8 per cent, over the current year in 1961-62 and 8-3 per cent, in1962-63. The general grant would in consequence amount to 57 millions and  59 millions in the two years. Later discussions withthe Scottish local authorities might make it necessary to increase thesefigures, possibly, by as much as  i million, but every effort would bemade to keep any increase to the minimum.The Cabinet Took note of C. (60) 171 and the statement by the Secretaryof State for Scotland.Egypt(previous reference:C.C. (60) 54thConclusions,Minute 3)financial agreement(previous reference:C.C. (59) 41stConclusions,Minute 6)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (C. (60) 169) about a further distribution of compensation from the funds available under the Anglo-Egyptian financial agreement of March 1959.The Lord Privy Seal said that the claims in respect of property which the United Arab Republic had taken over permanently, almost all of which had now been presented to the Foreign CompensationCommission, amount to  66 millions. This figure might turn out tobe substantially less when the claims were assessed by the Commission.Claims for injury or damage to property which had been sequestratedhad only recently begun to be presented; so far, these amounted to lessthan  1 million, and it was unlikely that their total would be more than 30 millions. The funds available for compensation consisted of 27^ millions paid by the United Arab Republic under the Agreementof March 1959 together with net interest on this amount of aboutt\ million, and  1 million in respect of loans already received by the claimants which would be deducted from the payments to be made tothem. Only  1-1 millions out of the compensation paid by the united arab Republic had so far been distributed to claimants, and it was desirable to make a further interim distribution of compensation.Orders, the petition could be made the subject of a debate which mightbe expected to concentrate less on the effect of the present law than onthe desirability of amending it, it would be preferable that the petitionshould be referred at once to the House of Commons Committee of privileges. The Attorney-General would then present the committee with a memorandum in which the arguments in the petition could berefuted and the legal position explained. If this were done, it wouldbe necessary to secure that the Committee did not address themselvesto the question whether Mr. Wedgwood Benn was a peer, and that they. should report that this was a question for the House of Lords. nor should the reference to the Committee leave it open to them toconsider whether or how the present law should be amended.The Cabinet Agreed that steps should be taken to refer to the House ofCommons Committee of Privileges the petition to be presented on behalf of Mr. Anthony Wedgwood Benn.
Channel 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterTunnel of Transport (C. (60) 172) on the Channel Tunnel project.Reference- ^he Minister of Transport said that the report presented by theCC (60)&apos;l0th Channel Tunnel International Study Group showed that theConclusions, promoters expected a great deal of financial support fromMinute 6) &apos; Governments. They were seeking financial assurances and privilegesfrom both the United Kingdom and French Governments which were quite inappropriate to a private venture. Moreover the investmentrequired, which might be some  130 millions over five years, would further increase the growing demands on the resources available for investment in transport facilities. The Economic Policy Committeehad accordingly concluded that the present financial proposals of the study Group could not be accepted.It would be necessary to exchange views with French officials onthe project, in order to learn what we could about their intentionsbefore we entered into further consultations with the Study Group.There was some danger that, while the French might agree with ourview about the financial difficulties, they might try to put the onus ofrejecting the project on the United Kingdom. We should thereforebe careful not to disclose our view that the present financial proposals were unacceptable.   We should simply inform the French that.C. 59 (60)Under the first interim distribution the smaller claims had been met in a considerably higher proportion than the larger claims. It wastherefore now proposed to increase the distribution broadly in favourof the larger claims, so that the overall sum would be more evenlydistributed. The scale proposed would not allow for any additionalpayment in the case of claims under  10,000. It was estimated that adistribution on this basis would mean a total payment from thecompensation fund of not more than  23 millions; and if the claims were decreased by the assessments of the Commission the total wouldbe reduced proportionately. The amount remaining for a final-distribution would in any case be comparatively small.In discussion it was suggested that it might be desirable to increasethe distribution for smaller claims, on the ground that it was in thesecases that hardship was most likely to arise. It was, however, pointedout that if the smaller claims were now to be satisfied in full, this mightimply that all claims would be satisfied in full when a final distributioncame to be made. While it was recognised that some payment fromthe Exchequer might have to be made, to supplement the comparatively small amount of compensation which would remainafter the second interim distribution, it would be undesirable at thisstage to prejudge the amount of such a contribution. Moreover, manyof those who had presented the smaller claims had already beenassisted by ex gratia loans. In many cases this, with the first interimpayment, was equivalent to the full satisfaction of the claims. It wouldrelieve anxiety in these cases if the claimants were informed now thatthe loans would not have to be repaid; but, on balance, it would be undesirable to give this assurance now, since this also might imply thatall claims would eventually be settled in full. Instead, it would be preferable to leave it to the Egyptian (Loans) Advisory Board to dealwith cases of hardship by administrative means.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (60) 169.
Commonwealth 8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeImmigrants Secretary (C. (60) 165) about coloured immigration from the(Previous        Commonwealth.R.cf crcncc * i *C C (60) &apos;46th Tne Home Secretary said that there had recently been a startlingConclusions, increase in the rate of immigration from the West Indies. During the minute 2) &apos; first 10 months of the year 43,500 West Indians had arrived in thiscountry, compared with 16,400 in the whole of 1959 and 29,800 in1956. While there had for some time been no serious incidents, socialtensions continued to exist and were a potential source of seriousdisturbance. He proposed, therefore, that the Cabinet Committeewhich had been appointed to consider the problems caused bycoloured immigration should be reconstituted to keep the situation under review.The Cabinet agreed that the present situation was disquieting andshould be kept under review. The coloured immigrants tended tocongregate in a relatively few areas, with consequent pressure on localhousing and employment. It was no longer possible to expect thatadministrative action in their countries of origin could stem this high rate of immigration. Although it would represent a breach withtradition, it might become necessary to introduce legislation to control immigration from the Commonwealth and to empower the Secretaryof State to deport Commonwealth citizens. While the legislation would need to apply to the Commonwealth as a whole and tothe Republic of Ireland, it would be unnecessary to enforce it againstmore than a few countries. It must, however, be recognised that anysuch legislation, especially if it were administered in a discriminatoryway, would have damaging effects on the Commonwealth.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would appoint aCommittee under the chairmanship of the Lord Chancellor,to consider and keep under review the problems caused bythe uncontrolled entry into the United Kingdom of Britishsubjects from overseas.we would be prepared to discuss various aspects of the Study Group&apos;sreport when the French were ready, and we should try to discoverwhat timetable they had in mind with a view to arranging joint discussions. In order to satisfy public interest, and to prevent undueoptimism about the project, we should try to get the French to agreethat both Governments should say that the Study Group&apos;s proposalsraised a number of difficult problems, concerning both countries,which needed consideration.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinet thatit would be preferable to avoid stressing the fact that the study group&apos;s proposals raised a number of difficult problems. This mightbe taken by the French to be a sufficient indication of our attitude tothe project to allow them to put the onus of rejecting it on the UnitedKingdom.The Cabinet Approved the recommendations in C. (60) 172, with theexception that, in informing the Study Group, the ChannelTunnel Parliamentary Group and the Press, reference shouldnot be made to the fact that the proposals raised difficult problems.
CoventGardenMarket(previous reference:C.C. (60) 58thConclusions,Minute 4)!C.C. 599. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (60) 173) about the future of Covent Garden Market.The Minister of Agriculture said that, following the cabinets discussion on 17th November, further consideration had been givento the feasibility of the proposal that the Covent Garden market should be rebuilt over the railway sidings at King&apos;s Cross and to thepossibility of so amending the Bill now before the House of commons as to empower the new statutory Market Authority to rebuild themarket either on its present site or at King&quot;s Cross. The ministers primarily concerned had reached the conclusion that the right course was to proceed with the Bill in its present form. Being a hybrid Billit could not be amended in such a way as to widen its scope. It would therefore not be possible to enable the Market Authority to choose between the two sites without withdrawing the Bill and reintroducingit in a later Session. The merits of the King&apos;s Cross plan were, in anycase, far from certain and could not be determined without discussions with the wide range of interests concerned, which might take someyears to complete. Meanwhile the Government could not affordfurther delay in dealing with the urgent problems of traffic congestion and fire risk arising from the market in its present site. The plan to reorganise and rebuild it in the Covent Garden area, which had secured a wide measure of agreement, offered the only possibility ofan early solution.The Cabinet-Approved the proposal in C. (60) 173 that the Governmentshould proceed with the Covent Garden Market Bill in itspresent form.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,25th November, 1960.
