expansion plans in the United Kingdom and on their policiesconcerning dividends, management and the purchase of componentsin this country. If the answers to these questions were satisfactoryhe would think it right to grant the application;He had also been asked &apos;: to &apos; discuss the situation withrepresentatives of the trade unions concerned and he proposed tosuggestthat - the General Y Secretary &quot; of the Confederation shipbuilding and Engineering&apos;&apos;Uhions;;should bring a d^ tomeet him.In discussion it was argued that the present minority shareholdersofthe British company were unable in thelast resort to sway the policies of the parent company; Such legal powers as minorityshareholders could invoke to Vannul- a decision by: a; majorityshareholder could only be used in extreme circumstances, and notmerely ;in^policies;- ^Nevertheless, there was little doubt that the United Statescompany would derive advantages from full ownership of the british company. It was probable that, as the fortunes of the motor industryfluctuated^ the United States company would exercise greater controlover the production policies of the Bntishsubsidiary.&quot; At the sametime, if the United.States company had a greater stake in the Britishfirm there might well be a greater incentive to expand production here.Moreover, the United Kingdom&apos;s interest in the encouragement ofinternational investment generally was ^anjargument which carriedgreat weight:If it were decided to permit the:transfer, the public presentati: of the decision would need careful consideration;  Helpful answersfrom Ford&apos;s to the questions put by the Chancellorofthe exchequer would make the decision more widely acceptable.   It would bedesirable to make it clear that the decision was in no sense automaticand that any future cases which might arise would be considered oni their merits.  There should be as little delay as possible in making an announcement once a decision on Fofdls -application had beentaken. There would be advantage if the Chancellor of the exchequer could let! it be known that he intended to?make;a statement inParliament -on 21st; November and to take; part, :if ^necessary, in ajjDebate&apos;later/on-thesame^day^pn-:theassumption -that he had by then:received; answers &apos;from:Ford&apos;s^tp&apos;ihis; questions ^and; had; taken adecision oh their application^The Prime Minister,summing up, said that it was more difficultto take a decision on Ford&apos;s application at. a time;when the motor industry was experiencing a fall in demand;&apos;Tt had to be recognised;that. the United States company, WoukL secure ^certain operationaladvantages if they owned.all the shares1of the ;British;-firm.

It would be useful if it were made known-to parliament that the Chancellor of the Exchequer in tended, if; he were ready, tomake: a&amp;statement on 21st Noyember and that a debate might followlater that daW;The&apos;::Cabinet-Took note with approval of the intention of the Chancellorof the Exchequer, subject to receiving satisfactory assurances from the United States Ford&apos;Mo tor Company, to givepermission for the transfer of shares of the Ford motor company in the United Kingdom to the United States.
-9 KCovent Garden;Market   1  &quot; - &apos;(previous reference :C.C. (59) 52ndConclusions/-Minute 2)4. The Minister of Agriculture said that the Covent Garden bill had been introduced at the beginning of the new Session and that the debate on its Second Reading was due in a fortnight. The Bill would establish a new statutory market authority, whose functions wouldbe to reorganise the market, rebuild it on its present site and provide an annexe, in Finsbury for the storage of empty containers.Meanwhile, an alternative plan had been published by private sources,providing for a new market to be built over the sidings at King&apos;s Crossstation^ This alternative had,&apos; on fhe face r&apos;of&apos; it, considerableattractions but there had not been time to;undertake any detailed examination of its physical and financial practicability, Or to consult the wide range of interests concerned. &apos; It would.. takesomeconsiderable time to examine the King&apos;s Cross.plan and to carry outthe necessary consultations on it, and the best course therefore seemedto be to proceed with the Bill in approximately its present form andto require the new market authority, when established, to investigatethefrelative merits;of;rebuildingthe;market ohits present;site an^;fKing&apos;s Cross. &quot;     -  \1\\. &apos;^ &apos; &apos;&apos;:&apos;&apos;:-/;-; ^ U^^:&apos;;^-.The Cabinet considered that, on the information at present .before them; theKing&apos;sGross plan:should not be ruled out. It seemed-likely to be preferable from the, point of, view&apos;of relieving traffic congestion; it; would offer a constructive&quot;use&quot;-ofThe space over therailway sidings; and it would make ^unnecessary the provision of aseparate market annexe. On the other hand it must be recognised thatno progress had been made in the prolonged efforts made to persuade:;vthe. marketing and other interests concerned to; accept the view thatthe market should be transferred to an area more suitable than covent garden. - There was, indeed, a strong case for establishing the market,/or a series of markets, outside central.London altogether, though there was no present prospect of securing this.&apos; These efforts had beenwholly unsuccessful and it had therefore been decided to proceed with,the plan to; rebuild the market on the Cpvent Garden site and toprovide the Finsbury annexe, which would give at least some relief tothe traffic problems and would meet the urgent: need to reduce theifire risks^ If this plan- were now abaridoned^Jthe^possibility: of any action at all to improve the present,; situation torecede for a long time.\ In further discussion it was pointed out that;the Covent Garden ;Bill expressly empowered the new market authority to promote privatelegislation for the amendment or extension of its powers. This wouldnot,.however, be a satisfactory procedure for so radical a change of-policy as the transfer of the market to King&apos;s Cross/ On the otherhand; if the Bill were to be so amended as to make it possible for theinewauthority to determine the site of the rebuilt market as betweenCovent Garden and King&apos;s Cross;thenecessary consultations and thehybrid character of the Bill mighlllriake it-impossible to secure its;.p.assage&quot;during , the;present Session,   This: would; be embarrassing,^sincethe Government1 had originally indicated; that the Bill would beintroduced in the session of 1959-60,. Surrmiingup the discussion The Prime^Minister said that it wasthe \general $View !of the Cabinet;,that;,the: plan&apos;to&apos; rebuild the covent garden market at King&apos;s Cross should1 not on present informationbe ruled out. -Further urgent consideration should, therefore be givenboth to the feasibility of the alternative plan and to the possibility of^so amending the Covent Garden Bill as to empower the marketauthority to rebuild the market on either of the two sites.The cabinet invited the Home Secretary to,arrange for the Home AffairsCommittee to give further consideration, in the light of their discussion, to the future of the CpyentlGarden market andtheformof the^Bill dealing; with ,iL!:?
&apos; &apos;  SECRETPolice        i        5.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Home(Previous        Secretary (C. (60) 164) on the pay of the police.R.cfcrcncs * * &apos;C.C (59) 61st i      The Home Secretary said that the Royal Commission on theConclusions,&apos;   : PQhce had produced an interim report on pay which would be minute S) ,,   published on 23rd November. The general background to the report was the disturbing level of crime throughout the country and,, dissatisfaction.in the police about their pay. There was a deficiency in the pohce strength of Great Britain of about 13,000 constables,including 6,000 in the Metropolitan force; Moreover, wastage in1960 had been outrunning recruitment. The Commission considered; that there should be an immediate increase in police pay to offset thesetrends. They had therefore set out principles, which should in their view govern the determination of police pay, and, in order to avoid a lengthy dispute on the Police Council for Great Britain about theapplication of these principles, they had recommended a specific scale of pay for constables. , This would give the constable a normal scale of 600^ 910, increasing after long periods of service to a maximum of 970. These increases ranged from about 20 per. cent.&quot; at the beginning to 30 per cent, at the end of the normaTscale, and 40 per cent, after taking into account the long service increments. The cost of such asettlement would be of the order of  20 millions a year, of which half&apos;, &quot;would.fall.to be met by the Exchequer&quot;and half by the local authorities.The cost;&apos;would be higher if recruitment were stimulated, and there./^;Vould.,eyentualry be:&apos;a substantial addition to the cost of policev &quot; &apos; &quot;pensions^ ^ If the implementation of :the Royal Commission^recommendations were delayed by protracted negotiations, or by^,&quot;reference to arbitration, there would be a great discontent in the^PIpolice service.    He considered  that the Government: had no alternative but to give effect to the Commission^ recommendations on the pay scale; This need not necessarily imply acceptance of theprinciples which had governed their thinking. He therefore proposed&apos;: to announce on 23rd November that the Government attached great\ /importance to early action on police pay and had referred the; Commission^ recommendations to the Police Council for Great* Britain with a request that they should consider the report as quickly&apos;        / as possible.  In addition^ he thought it might be necessary for his&apos;    representatives at:&apos;.the next meeting of the Council on 30th november to take aTead in encouraging the adoption of the scale recommended for the constable and to.suggest an interim settlement for the migher ranks bri the basis of present differentials, with &quot;effect from the date of-signature of the report. It would, however^ be desirable if the official side of the Council could agree on their attitude before speaking to&apos; the staff side. ; The representatives of the local authorities weremeeting on 29th November to consider the recommendations.C;- if The Chancellor of theExchequer&apos; said&apos; that.- he., agreed\ that the.   pohce should receive adequate pay, but he was concerned at the; /J-   v percentage increases and some of,the basic principles which had been.... recommended by the Commission.   In particular,- the attempt to&apos; assess The value of the police /to the community might have wide; repercussions in other fields;3and at a time when the need for economy was being stressed, the local authorities should not be given. the impression that the Government&apos; were rushing them intoacceptance.of the police pay: increases.  It would be better if therewere some delay in reaching a decision so that; the views of local&apos; authorities would have time, to develop.In discussion it was suggested that-thelpcal authorities should notbe expected: to make up their minds on thei Royal Commission^recommendations within a week of publication of the report. If theywere unable to reach agreement at ; their informal meeting on29th November, the Government should support the postponement of the meetingof the Police Council. 1 On the other hand, delay would encourage the police representatives&quot; to press for retrospection of the&apos; pay increase and might persuade them to submit their claim to arbitration. ; This could have&quot; more dangerous results for the
^MWBM ^ ;^X:/:/v  -&apos;vvC.C..-58. (60); Government than acceptance of the present recommendations,because an arbitrator might not only accept the&apos;principles advanced by the Commission but give a retrospective date for the increase aswell. &apos; &apos;    &apos; &apos;    v\The Prime Minister, summing up, said that an increase in policepay was necessary to encourage recruitment, but the&apos; government representatives at the meeting of the Police Council for Great britain should not encourage the adoption of the recommended pay scaleuntil the views of the local authorities were, known; After some discussion in the Council on 30th November there might be advantage in adjourning the meeting for, say, a fortnight with the object ofmaking a final offer on the second occasion. The offer should be confined to a new pay scale for constables and appropriate interimadjustments to the pay of the higher ranks, both with effect from thedate of signature of the Royal Commission&apos;s report.; The offer shouldnot imply acceptance of the principles suggested by: the Commission.Toprpceed in this way would keep faith with the local authorities and avoid recourse to, arbitration. The Home Secretary should keep theChancellor of the;Exchequer in touch with; the course of/discussions with the local authorities and in the Police Council. ..

(60) 167)drawing attention to the implications of the growth in public and supply expenditure.    &apos;    , .T/ze Chancellor of the Exchequer: said that the estimates ofexpenditure for the second grant period on the services covered bythe general grant were  818 millions in 1961-62 and  851 millions in1962-r63j;representingincreases of^;3: per cent, and 10-6 per cent,respectively over the current year; The consequent amounts of grant payable would be  454 millions and  472 millions, as compared with 429 millions in the current year/; To these figures there would haveto be added in due course the estimates for Scotland. Moreover, thefigures/were a minimum commitment, and did not allow for a furthersalary-increase for teachers and other pay increases which were in prospect, or for any further improvements in education, health and welfare during 4he next two years. All these - estimates -reflectedpolicies of expansion to which&apos; the,/Government i*had becomecommitted. As a result, it. seemed clear that public expenditure was increasing much faster; than werethe national resources. This wasa cause for most serious concern.The Cabinet-Took note of C. (60) 166 and 167 and of the statement by theChancellor of the Exchequer.
National 7.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the theatre Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 162) about a National Theatre.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the National TheatreAct, 1949, empowered the Treasury to contribute up to  1 milliontowards the cost of building a National Theatre,: for which the/     foundation stone had been laid by The Queen Mother in 1951. since that time it-had become clear that the project would require an exchequer contribution of up to  2 millions, together with an annual-&apos; subsidy Of the order of    million.   There was increasing pressure:;v from the Arts Council and others concerned for a decision about the. &apos;future of this project.  The main arguments in favour of proceedingwith1 it were the consensus of opinion among the wide range of interests in favour of it, the fact that the 400th anniversary ofShakespeare&apos;s birth in 1964 would be an appropriate occasion forlaunching the National Theatre, and its potential attraction to touristsfrom abroad.   On the other hand,; the: cost of the project would necessarily be high, both in relation to the total amount of Exchequer[ assistance for the arts and against the background of the imperativevj;&apos; ^^heed to avoid any additional financialebrnmitments.. Discussion showed that there was general agreement that in thepresent state of the national economyoahd with the unavoidableincrease in Government expenditure&apos; itfwouldybe difficult to justifysubstantial capital expenditure and an annual subsidy on a projectwhich was from many points of view out-of-date.The Government, vhad, however, undertaken in their Election^Manifesto to &quot; do more tosupport&apos; the arts, including the living theatre &apos;Y If the project for a^National Theatre as originally conceived were to be abandoned, somWsatisfactory alternative: must be found. TOne method of fulfilling the pledge would be to devote more Exchequer I money to existing. institutions by increasing the grant to the Arts Council for drama.The essential functions of a National Theatre were to a great extentexercised by the Old Vic and there might be a case, at some time inthe future, for assisting them to acquire more satisfactory premises.It would, however, be in accordance with the general policy of theGovernment to devote a greater proportion of whatever funds wereavailable to the provinces, where there was a growing interest in the&apos;&apos;: - theatre; As a first step, it mights be possibletto develop on an; experimental basis a limited number of provincial dramatic centres,through co-operation between the local authorities and local voluntary organisations.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the original-project: embodied in the national - Theatre Act, 1949, should not be proceeded with at the*n present time.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer :to give further-consideration, in thelight of their discussion, to alternativernethods of Government- assistance to the theatre.&apos;abineV Office,: S.W.1,11 J7th November, ,1960,
