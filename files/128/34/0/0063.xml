british transport commission(previous reference:C.C. (60) 61stConclusions,Minute 4)The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Transport (C. (60) 185) covering a revised draft of the White paper on the reorganisation of the nationalised transport undertakings.The Cabinet considered the revised draft, which had beenprepared in the light of their discussion of the earlier draft. in discussion the following points were made:(a) The White Paper contemplated that the chairmen of the newRegional Railway Boards would be appointed by the Minister ofTransport (paragraph 18), though the regional boards would beresponsible to the central board. Past experience suggested that this might give rise to some conflict of loyalties. As indicated inparagraph 16 (b) either the chairman or the general manager of eachregional board would ordinarily be appointed a member of the central board, according to which of them was in fact the effective workinghead of the regional organisation. This matter could, therefore, be best dealt with by deleting from paragraph 18 the statement that the regional chairmen would be appointed by the Minister and byamending paragraph 33 (which dealt with appointments generally)to indicate that the Minister would appoint the chairmen of the fivemajor boards (the Railways, London Transport, the Docks, the inland waterways and the holding company); that he would appoint theother members of these boards in consultation with their chairmen;and that certain other appointments would be subject to the Minister&apos;approval.(b) Paragraphs 26 and 29 left it uncertain what machinery wouldbe established for co-ordinating rail and &apos;bus services. This couldbe of considerable importance, both practical and political, when  a branch line was closed and it became necessary to make consequentialadjustments in local &apos;bus services. Responsibility for general co-ordination between road and rail services would rest with theMinister, acting on the advice of the Nationalised Transport AdvisoryCouncil; and the Minister should also assume responsibility for ensuring that there was adequate co-ordination at the regional andlocal levels. This would, no doubt, be effected normally by informalconsultation between the chairmen or officers of the organisations concerned, but it might in some circumstances be found convenient to establish some more formal machinery. Paragraph 29 of the draft white Paper should be amplified to make this clear.(c) Various drafting alterations in the text of the White paper were suggested and approved.The Cabinet Approved the draft White Paper on the reorganisation ofthe nationalised transport services annexed to C. (60) 185, asamended in their discussion, and authorised the Ministerof Transport to present it to Parliament before the christmas recess.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,9th December, I960.
