congo republic(previous reference:C.C. (60) 62ndConclusions,Minute 4)1. The Lord Privy Seal said that the Soviet representative inthe Security Council had vetoed the Resolution put forward by theWestern Powers with the object of promoting humane policies inthe Congo. Meanwhile, however, the officers of the conciliationcommission were proceeding to the Congo, in a personal capacity,and he would be seeing them later in the morning. The situation atStanleyville had become more precarious by reason of the coup d&apos;etatin Ethiopia; for the United Nations troops there were Ethiopiansand their discipline might be affected by the course of events in theirown country.Ethiopia 2.   The Lord Privy Seal made a report to the Cabinet on thecoup d&apos;etat in Ethiopia. This seemed to have been planned by officers of the Imperial Guard, who had seized control of the capital.Those elements in the Army which remained loyal to the Emperormight find it difficult to concentrate their forces in time to prevent this position from being consolidated. The Emperor, who wasreturning from his visit to Brazil, might be unable to reach the capital.At present the situation was confused and there was a risk that itmight be exploited by the Eritreans and the Somalis.South-East 3.   The Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet of the latestAsia Treaty developments in Laos.   Prince Souvanna Phouma was now underOrganisation some pressure to return, and there was some risk that two rivalLaos Governments might come into being.   In that event the danger of(Previous intervention would be increased.   To avert this, the Prime minister reference: of India was likely to press the suggestion that the InternationalC.C. (60) 62nd Control Commission should be revived.   This was not favoured by conclusions, jjie United States Government; and it had previously been our ownMmute 5) view that, unless the local Government wished the Commission to operate, it would not be effective.There was at present some divergence of view on these mattersbetween the Governments of the United Kingdom, the United Statesand France. The Foreign Secretary intended to try to resolve these differences in his discussions in Paris with the United States Secretaryof State and the French Foreign Minister.european free TradeAssociationFinland(previous reference:C.C. (60) 62ndConclusions,Minute 6)4. The Cabinet were informed that at the recent ministerial committee of the European Free Trade Association (E.F.T.A.) it hadnot been possible to find an agreed basis on which Finland could be associated with E.F.T.A. The Austrian representative, in particular,had been apprehensive that Finland&apos;s association with theorganisation might have the effect of increasing Soviet pressure onhis country. Discussion of this question had been adjourned.Further attempts to find a solution would have to be made early inthe new year.Parliament 5.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.They were also informed that Parliament would reassemble afterthe Christmas recess on 24th January, 1961. They considered thebusiness to be taken in the House of Commons in the first week afterthe recess.
Coal(previous reference:C.C. (60) 55thConclusions,Minute 1)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Power (C. (60) 188) about coal sales to Ireland.The Minister of Power said that the Prime Minister of NorthernIreland, Lord Broolceborough, had recently made representationsabout the difference in the prices of coal sold by the National coal board in Northern Ireland and in the Irish Republic. This arose from the fact that Northern Ireland was treated as part of the home market, while the Republic was treated as an export market in whichthe Coal Board had to match American and Polish prices. TheBoard had suggested two steps to alleviate this situation. First theywere ready to make a price reduction of 5s. a ton from 1st January,1961, for most of the house coal shipped to Northern Ireland; this could be managed, without loss to the Board, by a rearrangement ofsupplies which enabled transport costs to be cut. Secondly, they proposed, in the course of normal commercial negotiations, to increasethe price of house coal exported to the Republic to the level charged for sales to Northern Ireland. The latter step would be likely tobring to an end the export of British house coal to the Republic,since importers there would have recourse to other oversea suppliers.The loss of exports to the Republic would be acceptable to the coal board, because house coal was in short supply in the United Kingdomand sales at current export prices involved a substantial loss.The President of the Board of Trade said that the cessation of sales of house coal to the Republic of Ireland would represent a lossof exports of more than  2 millions. In view of the current strain onour balance of payments it would be difficult to justify the proposal of the Coal Board to increase their prices in the Republic.In discussion it was pointed out that to increase the price ofBritish house coal for sale to the Republic would not in fact helpNorthern Ireland, since importers there would switch to cheapersupplies from the United States or Europe. Moreover theGovernment of the Republic might feel that discrimination in coal prices against them frustrated the general purposes of our trade agreement with them. The reduction in the price of house coalshipped to Northern Ireland, on the other hand, would do much tomeet Lord Brookeborough&apos;s representations.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, as the Coal Board&apos;scurrent contracts for the sale of coal to the Irish Republic did notexpire until May 1961, the question of increasing export prices neednot be decided for the time being. The right course might well bethen for the Board to negotiate new contracts for the best price theycould obtain.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal that the National Coal Board should reduce their price for most of the house coal shipped to northern Ireland.(2) Agreed to defer consideration of the terms on which theNational Coal Board should negotiate new contracts forthe sale of coal to the Irish Republic.NorthernIrelandUnemployment(previous reference:C.C. (58) 21stConclusions,Minute 2)7. The Home Secretary said that the Northern ireland government were becoming seriously disturbed at the rising level ofunemployment, which had now reached nearly 6 per cent., and he hoped that Ministers would bear this in mind in considering thepossibility of allocating contracts to firms in Northern Ireland. Inparticular it would be helpful if the current negotiations with Messrs.Short Brothers and Harland about a contract for Britannic aircraft could be accelerated and if sympathetic consideration could be givento the allocation of Admiralty contracts to Messrs. Harland andWolff.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Home Secretary.
cc. 64 (60)Commonwealth       8.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the youth Trust     Commonwealth Secretary (C. (60) 187) about the project for a commonwealth Youth Trust.The Minister of State, Commonwealth Relations Office, saidthat a committee under the chairmanship of Field-Marshal Sir GeraldTempler had recommended the creation of a Commonwealth YouthTrust, whose object would be to strengthen the bonds between commonwealth countries through their younger people. The Trustwould foster the activities of existing agencies in this field, and wouldinstitute new activities where necessary. This work might involve an expenditure of some  400,000 a year for the first ten years and half that amount thereafter. In addition, it was to be a main function of the Trust to establish a Commonwealth Youth City in London to house 5,000 students at a capital cost of about  10 millions. It was contemplated that the necessary funds would be raised largely by public subscription in response to a national appeal.These recommendations had now been examined by theMinisters concerned, who had concluded that, in the light of unofficialadvice from industry and the existence of other large appeals, theprospects of success for an appeal for such a Trust were extremelyuncertain and it would not be desirable to launch one for at leastanother eighteen months. Ministers also felt that it would not be justifiable to establish a Trust with financial support provided largely from the Exchequer. Moreover, the project of a CommonwealthYouth City was misconceived and impracticable: apart from thegreat expense, it would not deal with the problem of housing overseastudents elsewhere than in London, and it would tend to segregatethem from the English way of life.Nevertheless, there was urgent need to provide increased living accommodation for oversea students in the United Kingdom, and tomeet this need the Ministers concerned proposed that the Governmentshould undertake a programme for the building of 5,000 new hostelplaces, in various parts of the country, for oversea students over thenext four or five years, together with a number of social and culturalcentres. This programme would cost about  3 millions in capital and  275,000 a year for running expenses, and it was intended thatit should be carried out in conjunction with the organisations alreadyactive in student welfare, with the help of some financial contribution from them and other interested persons. The announcement of aGovernment initiative of this sort would offset criticism which might otherwise be directed at the Governments attitude to therecommendations of Sir Gerald Templer&apos;s committee.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith the plan for 5,000 additional hostel places for oversea students.It would be important to make it clear that these places were not intended only for University students, but would help to meet ageneral need arising from the attendance of oversea students at a wide variety of institutions, such as technical colleges, all over thecountry. While it was desirable that the hostels should contain acertain proportion of British students, it would be advisable, in viewof the size of the problem, that a large majority of the places shouldbe available for students from abroad.It was also pointed out that more study would need to be givento the way in which the plan for new hostel places would be carriedout. The Departments concerned would have to consider in whichdistricts these new places should be provided, and how consultations should be conducted with the many organisations interested in this work. It might therefore be preferable to express the governments intention to embark on this scheme in somewhat more general termsthan was proposed in the Commonwealth secretary&apos;s memorandum.Moreover, it was desirable that the announcement should be framed
in such a way as would provide the best prospect of securing some contribution to the cost from interested organisations or individuals.It was also suggested that the statement should make it clear thatthe Government accepted the desirability of strengthening the bondsbetween Commonwealth countries by fostering the activities of organisations concerned with younger people in the Commonwealth.There might be strong pressure for the report of Sii Gerald Templer&apos;scommittee to be published, and it might be necessary to publish asummary of the recommendations. In that event the Governmentwould be obliged to explain why they did not favour the project fora Commonwealth Youth City.Summing up, the Prime Minister said that, while the cabinet approved in principle the plan to provide additional hostel places foroversea students, further consideration should be given to the terms in which this should be announced and the way in which it shouldbe presented in relation to the Governmenfs attitude to therecommendations of Sir Gerald Templar&apos;s committee. It mightwell be necessary to publish a summary of the committee&apos;srecommendations. It would be desirable to defer making anannouncement to Parliament until after the Christmas recess. Hewould arrange for the draft statement to be revised in the light ofthe Cabinefs discussion.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for thedraft statement in the Appendix to C. (60) 187 to be revised,with a view to further consideration by the Cabinet in due course.KenyaLand Policy(previous reference:C.C. (60) 42ndConclusions,Minute 3)9. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord Chancellor(C. (60) 186), to which was annexed a report by a Committee ofMinisters on the future security of title to land in Kenya and a draftof a statement to be made by the Government.The Lord Chancellor recalled that, in accordance with the cabinet&apos;s request at their meeting on 14th July, a Committee ofMinisters had been appointed under his chairmanship to study theproblem of the future security of title to land in Kenya. TheCabinet had previously agreed that various schemes suggested for compensating property-owners or guaranteeing their title could notbe accepted, and the Committee had therefore considered alternative methods of safeguarding property rights in Kenya and reassuringinvestors and the owners of property.Provisions which would give reasonable protection to propertycould be entrenched in the fundamental law of an independent Kenya:There would, however, be no certainty that a future Kenya government would not ignore or abolish these safeguards, and a formal agreement under which they undertook to observe theconstitution would give rise to special difficulties. economic sanctions against a breach of property rights must be expected tobe more damaging to the United Kingdom than to an independentKenya. The most practical way of proceeding seemed, therefore,to do everything possible to encourage a sense of responsibility inthe African leaders in the territory. The example of Tanganyika,help in securing assistance from international organisations, and theoffer of a conference on the economic development of Kenya might serve as inducements. But certain recent statements by Africanleaders had not been helpful in reassuring property-owners.Meanwhile, it had become necessary to make some further statement, as promised by the Colonial Secretary, before the christmas recess.   A statement on the lines of the draft annexed to the
LordHankey&apos;s 10. The Prime Minister said that Lord Hankey, who had beenMemoirs Secretary of the Cabinet from 1916 to 1938, had written a book ofmemoirs relating to the period of the First. World War. permission to publish this book had been withheld by successive Governmentssince 1944; and he himself, when he had been asked to review thisdecision in 1958, had felt unable to give permission for its publication.Nevertheless, Lord Hankey had arranged for the book to bepublished, and serial extracts from it would shortly appear in aSunday newspaper.There was no doubt that it was improper for a former Secretaryof the Cabinet to publish memoirs based on information which hehad obtained in confidence while holding that position of trust. Onthe other hand, such new disclosures as were made in this bookabout proceedings in Cabinet and relations between Ministers related to a period now far distant in time, and it was possible that the bookwould excite little public interest. He was satisfied that it would be inexpedient to take any further steps to prevent its publication.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the PrimeMinister.Committee&apos;s report, emphasising that constitutional advance must be conditional on a reasonable attitude towards the continued protectionof fundamental rights, including property rights, would serve to reinforce a recent statement of the Kenya Government to the effectthat land belonged to those of all races who held legal titles to it andnot to the Africans as such.In discussion the Cabinet reaffirmed their view that any formof guarantee to the European property-owners in Kenya would be beyond the resources of the United Kingdom Exchequer and might even serve as a direct incitement to expropriation. The draft statement prepared by the Lord Chancellor^ Committee went as faras it was possible to go and might help to restore confidence amonginvestors and property-owners in Kenya. It might, however, with advantage be amplified by the inclusion of a passage indicating thatthe United Kingdom Government were concerned, not only toprotect the rights of property-owners, but with the whole policy ofland settlement and development in Kenya.The Cabinet -(1) Approved the proposals in the report annexed to C. (60) 186.(2) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to make a statement onthe lines of the draft annexed to the report, amplifiedby the addition of a suitable reference to the governments general concern with the whole policy of land settlement and development in Kenya.
