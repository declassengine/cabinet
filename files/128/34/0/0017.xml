Germany.(previous reference :C.C. (60) 15thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Foreign Secretary said that the United StatesGovernment had now decided that it would be inexpedient to pursueat the present time the suggestion that jet aircraft in transit over east germany to Berlin should be free to fly above the conventionalceiling of 10,000 feet.The Soviet Government had also suspended their attempt to compel members of Western Military Missions in East Germanyto use oasses referring to the territory of the &quot; German democratic republic &quot;.Both these decisions were to be welcomed, in view of theforthcoming discussions on Berlin at the Summit Meeting.,   The Cabinet- &apos;Took note of these statements by the Foreign Secretary.Law of theSea.(previous reference :C.C. (60) 12thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Minister of Agriculture said that he had discussed withthe leaders of the United States and Australian delegations the tacticsto be adopted at the forthcoming Conference on the Law of the Sea.On the assumption that a six-mile limit for the territorial sea mustbe preserved, agreement might be reached on one of the followingsolutions:(i) A six-mile territorial sea, plus six miles&apos; fishery jurisdiction,subject to the indefinite retention of other countries&apos; historic fishing rights (Course A).(ii) A six-mile territorial sea, plus the preservation of historicfishing rights in the outer six-mile zone for some period betweenseven and fifteen years (Course B).(hi) A six-mile territorial sea, plus six miles of exclusive fishing rights (Course C).The fishing States of Western Europe were generally in favourof the first course. - The Canadians had been canvassing support forthe third. Both might eventually be prepared to accept the second,for which we and the Americans had been trying to obtain general support. In these circumstances, we and the Americans mightinitially advocate Course A, even though this solution was unlikely to obtain the requisite two-thirds majority. At a later stage,depending on the progress of the Conference and in particular onthe reception given to the Canadian advocacy of Course C, we mightjoin with the Americans in proposing Course B. In earlier discussion the Cabinet had foreseen the possible need to fall back on Course C,but he would endeavour to avoid doing so; and the Americans had assured him that they would accept it only after reference to president eisenhower and in order to prevent a complete breakdown of theConference. If opinion at the Conference developed in favour ofCourse B, he would hope to preserve historic fishing rights in the outer zone for a period of about ten years.Discussion showed that there was general support in the cabinet for the course of action proposed by the Minister of Agriculture.In consultation with the Americans and others, we should seek toavoid the emergence of a majority in favour of Course C, whilepreserving the fundamental interest of retaining a six-mile limit forthe territorial sea.
The Cabinet Agreed that, at the forthcoming Conference on the Law ofthe Sea, the Minister of Agriculture should initially supportthe first of the three alternative solutions which he had put to the Cabinet; and authorised him to determine, in the lightof progress at the Conference, the point at which it wasexpedient to transfer his support to the second of thosesolutions.Cyprus.(PreviousReferenceC.C. (60) 15ConclusionsMinute 2.)in. The Foreign Secretary said that the negotiations which theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies (Mr. Amery)was conducting in Cyprus had been protracted, but it was hopedthat agreement might shortly be reached on the outstanding points of detail which were now under discussion. This would leave for settlement the major questions of (i) the extent of the sovereign areas and the facilities available to us in adjacent areas; (ii) the amount and nature of our financial aid; and possibly (iii) the terms of our declaration on the administration of the areas. Mr. Amery had suggested that he might in due course make further proposals toArchbishop Makarios on the size of the areas and on finance, andthat a conference of the Foreign Ministers and the Cypriot leadersshould be convened thereafter, if necessary, probably in Nicosia.The Foreign Secretary said that he felt it might be preferable,subject to the outcome of the current discussions in Cyprus and tothe settlement of any outstanding constitutional points, to reserveall discussion of the major questions for a conference with the foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey and the Greek-Cypriot leaders.Nicosia might be the best place for such a conference: if that werenot acceptable, Zurich would be preferable to Geneva or London.After consultation with Mr. Amery who, he hoped, would be ableto remain in Cyprus for the conference he would make proposalsaccordingly to the Foreign Ministers of Greece and Turkey.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the Foreign Secretary&apos;sstatement.british transport commission.(previous reference :C.C. (60) 15thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Prime Minister said that the statement of policy towardsthe British Transport Commission which he had made in parliament on 10th March had been well received. To enable the Governmentto retain the initiative the Minister of Transport might summon anearly meeting of the Commission and the unions and inform themthat the Government were willing to provide the financial assistancenecessary to enable the Commission to give effect to the Guillebaudreport on condition that the Commission and the unions would co-operate to the full in implementing the Governments plans forthe reorganisation of the industry. If this course were to be followed,it would be necessary to decide whether the announcement shouldspecify that the wage increases would become effective from the dateof the Guillebaud report. If that date were specified, the unionscould be assured that the time taken up by negotiations on the detailed application of the reports findings would not prejudice theposition of the railwaymen. But the main purpose of specifying thedate would be to avoid conceding in negotiation an earlier date fromwhich wage increases would be paid retrospectively. On the otherhand a comprehensive statement of this sort might be regarded by theunions as a limitation on the normal processes of negotiation. Thealternative would be to leave the question of the date from whichwage increases were to be paid to be dealt with in the negotiations between the Commission and the unions. In that event the Chairman
Economic *5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the survey, Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 47) covering a draft of the first1960. part of the Economic Survey, 1960.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that his main concern was with the balance of payments prospects. The surplus on current account in 1959 was now estimated at  145 millions, and it was not likely that it would exceed  160 millions in 1960. Investment abroad* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRETof the Commission would be instructed that he should not accept a date earlier than the date of the report.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that an offer by theGovernment to give the necessary financial assistance to enable wage increases in accordance with the findings of the guillebaud committee to become effective from the date of the report wouldbe regarded by the public as very generous. The Government mustresist pressure for any additional concession on retrospection, andit would be better that this should not become a matter for negotiation. The implementation of the Guillebaud report would increase the Commission^ prospective deficit in 1960 to some  120millions, less an amount of not more than  5 millions which mightbe obtained from increases in fares and charges, and provision forthis would have to be made by the Exchequer out of revenue.In discussion it was suggested that it would be unwise for theGovernment to specify at this stage the date from which the findings of the report would become effective, unless they were prepared to resist pressure for a greater measure of retrospection to the pointof facing a railway strike. It was on balance unlikely that the unions would take strike action if the only issue were retrospection, whichwas a principle that did not usually apply to industrial wage increases.Whether the Government could resist pressure for retrospectionwould in the end, depend on public opinion, which would also be interested to know how far the conditions attached to theGovernments offer of financial assistance were likely to be observed by the unions. If a further Government statement were made, itshould make it clear that the unions were expected to facilitate thoseadjustments in the labour force that were required to secure the most efficient practicable operation of the reorganised undertaking.In discussion it was pointed out that the Government might beable to retain the initiative in this matter without making a further statement of policy to the Commission and the unions at this stage.For this purpose it might suffice if an early announcement could bemade about the advisory body which was to work out the detailed plans for reorganising the industry. The Chancellor of the exchequer would have to include in his Budget speech some reference to theneed to finance the Commission^ deficit out of revenue. If a dispute with the unions over retrospection was inevitable, it would be an advantage if the Government did not become directly involved inthis during the next few weeks. It might therefore be preferable toallow negotiations to proceed between the Commission and theunions in the normal way, on the basis of the statement which thePrime Minister had already made in Parliament.The Cabinet- Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at their next meeting.
was expected to increase considerably, and the result would be thatthe external monetary position would deteriorate in 1960 by about 200 millions. The seasonal improvement at the present time wasnot as great as would normally be expected, and there was a greaterincrease in imports compared with last year than in exports. Seriousbalance of payments difficulties might well arise later in the year.From the internal economic point of view, there was considerable pressure of activity in most industries. Industrial production had increased by 9 per cent., and total production by 6 per cent.,compared with a year ago, and unemployment had fallen by 18 percent. Consumption had increased by 4 per cent., and wageagreements during the past winter were likely to raise wage rates by nearly 5 per cent. There had been a satisfactory increase in personalsavings, and the cost of living had now been stable for about twentymonths.In view of the pressure on the economy, and particularly havingregard to the balance of payments prospects, it seemed desirable thatsome action should be taken which would moderate, though notviolently check, the present rate of expansion.In a preliminary discussion of the economic situation it was thegeneral view of the Cabinet that the Economic Survey, 1960, shouldbe published at the end of the month. It was agreed that the first paragraph might be omitted, and that paragraph 14 should include a suitable reference to the fact that personal savings exceeded the increases in hire-purchase and personal bank advances. The Ministerof Labour undertook to discuss with the Chancejlor of. theExchequer the reference in paragraph 22 to the change in unit costs.The Cabinet (1) Approved the publication on 30th March of the economic survey, 1960, subject to the amendments agreed in their discussion.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of the economic situation at their next meeting.Egypt.(previous reference :C.C. (59) 55thConclusions,Minute 7.)Suez CanalUsers&apos;Association.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (60) 45) pointing out that the Suez Canal Users&apos;Association was still technically in existence and setting out thearguments for and against proposing that it should now be formallydisbanded.The Foreign Secretary said that, on reflection, he felt that thebalance of advantage lay on the side of taking no action in thismatter.The Cabinet Agreed that the Government should take no initiative witha view to the formal dissolution of the Suez Canal Users&apos;Association.Cabinet Office, S.W.I.15 th March, 1960.
