(60) 37thConclusions,Minute 4)*The Prime Minister said that, in accordance with the Cabinefsconclusions at their meeting on 23rd June, he had informed thePresident of the United States that the United Kingdom Governmentwould be prepared to provide facilities for United States polaris submarines at Loch Linnhe, on condition that we obtained the rightto purchase or manufacture POLARIS submarines and missiles of ourown, without at this stage undertaking that they would form partof the project for medium-range ballistic missiles to be developed inEurope as part of the forces of the North Atlantic Alliance, and on condition that satisfactory arrangements were made for control overthe operations of the submarines using the Scottish facilities. On thelatter point, he had suggested that it might be agreed that the submarines should not fire missiles within a hundred miles of our coastwithout the consent of the United Kingdom Government. president eisenhower had replied that Loch Linnhe would not be satisfactory,and that the conditions suggested presented serious difficulties. Inparticular, he had subsequently said that to extend dual controlbeyond our territorial waters would have undesirable repercussions,and that a bilateral arrangement between the United States and united Kingdom Governments on POLARIS missiles outside the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) would jeopardise the NATO medium-range ballistic missile project.It had therefore become necessary for Ministers to decide whether(i) to decline the United States request for facilities for their polaris submarines in the Clyde or (ii) to offer such facilities, despite the disadvantages entailed in their proximity to a densely populated area,while seeking the best arrangements possible both as regards controlover the operations of their submarines, and as regards an option toobtain POLARIS submarines of our own at a later date. It now seemed clear that we should not in any event wish polaris submarines of our own to be in operation until shortly before 1970.Therefore, the question no longer arose of regarding our polaris submarines, if we decided to obtain them, as part of a NATO medium-range ballistic missile project. But it would undoubtedly be useful tous to secure the agreement of the United States authorities that theywould provide us with plans and technical information aboutPOLARIS submarines so that we could set preparatory work on foot,on the understanding that if we wanted to put our plans into effectwe would have to reach final agreement with the United States at alater date, in the light of the political and military circumstances ofthe time. From the point of justifying the offer of these facilities to theUnited States to public opinion, this was a less important point thanthe need to secure a satisfactory formula about the degree of our control over American submarines using the Scottish facilities. Itwould not be realistic to try to secure the agreement of the UnitedStates authorities that this control should be on the same basis asthat applying to United States air bases in this country, but it shouldbe possible to take advantage of President Eisenhower&apos;s offer to workout such co-ordinated measures as might be necessary, so as to obtain a satisfactory formula about control for public announcement.Discussion showed that there was general agreement that, in viewof the importance of preserving the special relations between the twocountries and in the interests of the defensive strength of the WesternAlliance, it was desirable that facilities in the Clyde area should bemade available for United States POLARIS submarines. It should,however, be made clear that we might find considerable political difficulty in securing public support in this country for these arrangements. It was therefore important that we should have thebest possible formula regarding the extent of United Kingdom control
over the operation of the submarines. We should aim to get american agreement to full and timely consultation with us as necessary and joint decision in an emergency. At the same time, in order to avoidoffending the susceptibilities of the French Government, it shouldbe explained that our control rested on the fact that these UnitedStates submarines operated from facilities in Scottish waters.As regards our access to plans and technical information toenable us to obtain POLARIS submarines at a later date, if we sodecided, our immediate purpose should be to be able to announce that we were continuing and developing the technical contacts between the British and American navies. We might, however, find that the United States authorities were not prepared to allow us anygreater access than we enjoyed at present to technical information about POLARIS submarines. In that event a permanentarrangement for the provision of facilities in the Clyde might be inappropriate, and it might be preferable for the submarine tenderto come on a temporary or experimental basis, for one or two years,during which the longer-term arrangements could be worked out.The Cabinet were informed that it now seemed likely that theUnited States authorities would not wish to send their submarinetender to United Kingdom waters until February 1961. This wouldenable an announcement to be deferred until later in the autumn, andwould afford more time to work out satisfactory arrangements regarding control and access to technical information.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that facilities in the Clyde area should bemade available for United States POLARIS submarines,on the understanding that satisfactory arrangements weremade on the extent of United Kingdom control over their operations, and that an attempt would be made to obtainaccess to plans and technical information which wouldmake it possible for the United Kingdom to obtainPOLARIS submarines.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to inform the President of theUnited States of the arrangements now proposed for facilities for POLARIS submarines in Scottish waters.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,3rd August, 1960.
