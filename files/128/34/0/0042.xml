2. The Foreign Secretary said that the Soviet Government hadpublished a statement in violent terms accusing the Governments ofthe United Kingdom, the United States, Western Germany andFrance of supporting the Belgian Government in armed intervention in the Congo Republic. The Soviet authorities had informedHer Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Moscow about this in advance of publication, as an indication of their wish to maintain contact withthe United Kingdom Government on all matters of mutual concern.It seemed that the Belgian Government had now usedmetropolitan forces to obtain control of the European quarter ofLeopoldville, and they were increasing the strength of their armed forces in the Congo to about 8,000. It was difficult to ascertain what conditions were in the centre of the country, for example atStanleyville where there was a number of British residents. In viewof the risk that the activities of Belgian troops might lead to a deterioration, authority had been given to the Governor of Kenyato take action if necessary, in consultation with the other british authorities concerned, to evacuate British subjects from the Congo.He could, if necessary, use military aircraft and provide militaryprotection for the evacuation. In Katanga, where the situation wasquiet, the Premier, Mr. Tshombe, had declared that the provincewas independent, and had refused to admit representatives of the congo Republican Government. It was not clear how far the Belgianauthorities supported Mr. Tshombe&apos;s action.In the last few hours the Security Council of the United nations had adopted a resolution calling on the Belgian Government towithdraw their military forces from the Congo Republic, andauthorising the provision of United Nations military assistance. TheUnited States and Italy were among the eight members who hadvoted in favour of the resolution, while the United Kingdom, as wellas France and China, had abstained. The Secretary-Generalproposed to give effect to the resolution immediately. TheGovernment of Ghana had already offered military assistance to the congo Republican Government, and had suggested to the united nations authorities that the Governments of the United Kingdomand the United States might be asked to provide air transport for a battalion of Ghana troops, some of whose officers were British.The Cabinet should consider urgently what their attitude shouldbe to the organisation of a United Nations force, and in particular to the suggestion that we should provide air transport. They shouldalso decide whether the United Kingdom Government should contribute to any fund promoted to relieve distress in the congo republic.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the Government of theFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland had strong economic andpolitical interests in the maintenance of stable government in Katanga.While it was not open to them constitutionally to recognise Katangaas an independent State, they might well feel it desirable to supportMr. Tshombe. It was conceivable that they might feel it necessaryto assist in the preservation of law and order in Katanga. If thepurpose of a United Nations force was to re-establish the authorityof the Congo Republican Government in all parts of the Republic,there was some risk of a conflict with Federal forces. It would be particularly undesirable for forces from Ghana to be involved in this.congo republic.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.It was hoped that Parliament would be adjourned for the summer recess on 29th July, and that it would not be necessary to continuethe present session when Parliament reassembled.
In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Security Council resolution did not call on Belgium towithdraw her forces immediately. The Secretary-General seemed to envisage a gradual withdrawal as the United Nations force becameprogressively able to maintain law and order. On this basis therewould not be a serious risk of conflict, except in Katanga where the congo Republican Government might seek to re-assert their authority.(b) It was most important that any military assistance shouldbe part of a United Nations force. If Ghana were to despatch anindependent force, the risk of conflict, including a possible conflict with forces from the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, wouldbe increased.(c) Any United Nations assistance of a military character shouldbe under the command of a United Nations officer and subject to thecontrol of the Secretary-General. The United Nations ought not tomake forces available for purposes or operations controlled by the republican Congo Government. The United Nations force oughtto consist of contingents from a number of smaller countries, notrestricted to African countries; and it would be preferable not toinclude contingents from the larger Powers.(d) The role of the United Nations force should not be to assistthe internal political purposes of the Congo Republican Government,but should be primarily directed to the re-establishment of law andorder.(e) If we were satisfied with the arrangements which theSecretary-General made as regards the United Nations force, therewas no reason why we should not agree to provide air transport for a battalion of Ghana troops, forming part of the United Nations force.However, it might well be that the Secretary-General would prefernot to use facilities provided by the United Kingdom or any other major Power.(/) It was not clear what effect the Security Council resolutionwould have on the negotiations for the provision of defence facilitiesfor Belgian forces in the Congo Republic. It could be pointed outthat it was mainly on this account that the United kingdom representative had not felt able to vote in favour of the security council resolution.In further discussion the Cabinet expressed their approval forthe authority which had been given to the Governor of Kenya toarrange for the evacuation of British subjects from the Congo. Inthis connexion it was suggested that the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations should be warned that a military operation for the sole purpose of the evacuation of British residents might become necessary.The Prime Minister said that it was the view of the Cabinet that,on balance, the safest course would be to support United Nationsassistance to the Congo, provided that its form and purpose met theviews expressed in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion. Our views should be explained to the Secretary-General as follows. The United nations force should be composed of contingents from several countries,including non-African countries, but preferably excluding the largerPowers; the military force offered by Ghana should be comprisedwithin it; the whole force should be under the command of a united nations officer, and subject to the control of the Secretary-General.The purpose of the force should be to re-establish law and order, andit should not be used for the internal political purposes of the CentralCongo Government. Subject to these points, the United kingdom would give full support to United Nations action, and would beready to provide facilities, such as air transport, on the lines already suggested by Ghana, if requested by the Secretary-General.
Kenya(previous reference:C.C. (60) 11thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (C. (60) 110) about future land policy in Kenya.The Colonial Secretary said that on 20th July there was to be a debate in the Kenya Legislative Council to consider thatGovernmenfs proposals for land policy. The policy proposed wasthat, in place of the present system which provided exclusive reservesfor different races and tribes and, in particular, reserved the Highlandsfor European farmers, land use should be governed by economicprinciples and the Highlands opened to good farmers of all races and tribes. The policy was to be carried into effect by schemes forthe resettlement of the landless on land at present unused or under-used, and various schemes of this kind were already being worked out.However, there was deep concern among the European farmers aboutthe future security of the title to their land: they feared that afterKenya achieved independence they would suffer wholesaleexpropriations, would receive unfair compensation for land taken over by the Government, or would have their holdings limited to asub-economic size. Uncertainty about the future was leading to large-scale withdrawals of capital from Kenya and constituted aserious threat to the economy of the territory. The colonial secretary had already made it clear that there could be no questionof compensating European farmers for the effects of the comingconstitutional changes, in the sense that they would be offered a fairprice for any land they chose to offer the Government in advanceof independence, and this, he thought, had been accepted by theEuropean community. But none of the other possible solutions tothe problem of security which had so far been put forward could beregarded as satisfactory and he therefore proposed that a Committeeof Ministers might be appointed to study the problem, with a viewto formulating a statement to be made in the early autumn.Meanwhile it was desirable that some statement should be madeon 20th July, both in the United Kingdom Parliament and in the kenya Legislative Council. In this the United Kingdom Governmentshould reaffirm their support for the proposed land policy and, in.order to demonstrate that they remained in control of developments in Kenya, should indicate their intention to give effect to that policy by Order-in-Council. The statement should emphasise theimportance they attached to security of title to land and should contain an assurance that they were working on detailed proposals to ensure it.C.C. 42 (60)The Prime Minister of Ghana should be informed that we werecommunicating with the Secretary^General about the suggestion thatwe should provide air transport. At the same time our attitude to united Nations assistance should be fully explained to the PrimeMinister of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and it shouldbe emphasised to him that we did not envisage the role of a united nations force extending beyond the preservation of law and order.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for a message to besent to the Secretary-General of the United Nations onthe lines indicated by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to arrange formessages to be sent to the Prime Minister of Ghana andto the Prime Minister of the Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister.
Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet with these proposals. It was clearly both fair and economically necessary that some means should be devised to assure the European farmers in Kenya of future security of title to their land. None of the proposals to this end which had so far beenconsidered appeared acceptable: they would impose a financial burden which would be beyond the resources either of the farmersthemselves or of the United Kingdom Exchequer. It would thereforebe desirable for a small committee of Ministers to study this problem.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to make a statement inParliament in the terms of Annex B of C. (60) 110 and toarrange for a similar statement to be made simultaneously in the Kenya Legislative Council.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for aCommittee of Ministers, under the Chairmanship of theLord Chancellor, to give further study to the problem ofthe future security of title to land in Kenya.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (60) 109) on working conditions in shops, offices andcertain other premises.The Home Secretary said that shops, offices and railwaypremises were the three main classes of premises covered by theCommittee on Shop Hours and Health, Welfare and Safety in Non-Industrial Employment, under the Chairmanship of Sir ErnestGowers, which had not yet been dealt with by legislation. Therewas, on social grounds, a good case for legislation to imposeminimum standards of working conditions in these premises,especially in view of the existing control over conditions in factories.Apart, however, from the merits of the case, the Governments handhad been forced by the recent passage of a Private MemberS bill dealing with offices alone. This Bill was constitutionally andadministratively unsatisfactory, in that it left the whole substance of the legislation to Ministerial regulations, and it had received its second Reading in the House of Commons against the advice of theGovernments spokesman. Unless the Government took some action,the Offices Bill would almost certainly be followed in the next sessionof Parliament by other, equally unsatisfactory, Private Members&apos;Bills dealing with other classes of employment. It was therefore proposed that the Government should themselves introduce in a latersession a comprehensive Bill. This would be under the charge of the% Minister of Labour; it would supersede the Offices Bill and would deal not only with offices but with shops, and railway premises andpossibly with certain other premises. In order to avoid undertakingconsultations, in accordance with the Offices Bill, which would bepointless and misleading in view of the proposed government legislation, an announcement should be made of the governments intention before the summer recess.In discussion considerable doubt was expressed whether the time was opportune for embarking on legislation on this subject.Although there was a good case for reform, it was open to questionwhether, at a time when private investment ought to be concentrated on increasing productivity and the competing demands forGovernment investment could not be satisfied, it was possible tojustify expenditure on the improvement of working conditions whichmight amount to as much as  130 millions. Moreover, it was estimated that, if enforcement of the proposed legislation wereentrusted to the Factory Inspectorate, the administrative cost to theExchequer might amount to    million a year.Non-industrial employment.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 64thConclusions,Minute 2.)Shops, offices and other premises.
CC. 42 (60)On the other hand, the passage of the Offices Bill would in anycase place a very considerable burden on national resources, whichwould no doubt be increased by the similar Bills which must otherwise be expected to follow. If the Government were to introduce theirown legislation, they would be able to exercise closer control over thesituation: by spreading the impact of the new requirements over a relatively long transitional period and by granting individualdeferments or exemptions they could both control the speed at whichnational resources would be diverted to the purposes of the Bill andease the burden on individual employers. The position of the british transport Commission would, in this context, require special consideration.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that thebalance of view in the Cabinet appeared to be in favour of comprehensive Government legislation, primarily on the ground that by this means the Government would secure greater control over theoperation of the law than if they were forced to administer a piecemealseries of unsatisfactory Acts.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal in C. (60) 109 for comprehensivelegislation in the session of 1961-62 to control working conditions in shops, offices, and railway and possiblycertain other premises.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the Ministerof Labour and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment, to give further consideration to thequestion whether the legislation should be enforced bythe Factory Inspectorate or the local authorities.(3) Authorised the Home Secretary to make an early announcement of the Governments intention.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (60) 103), towhich was annexed a copy of the report of the DepartmentalCommittee on Human Artificial Insemination.The Home Secretary said that, while the majority of theCommittee had expressed disapproval of the artificial inseminationof women with material derived from donors other than their husbands, they recommended against legislation to prohibit thepractice and against any attempt to regulate it by law. The reportcontained a number of recommendations for amendment of the law relating to divorce, nullity of marriage and maintenance of children,which went little further than recommendations already made by theRoyal Commission on Marriage and Divorce. The report would notbe embarrassing to the Government and he proposed that it shouldbe published on 21st July.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the report of the Departmental Committee on human Artificial Insemination.(2) Authorised the Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to arrange for its publication on 21st July.(3) Invited the Lord Chancellor to consider the recommendationsof the Committee for amendment of the present law.
aircraft industry.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 27thConclusions,Minute 3.)SupersonicAirliner.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Aviation (C. (60) 111) proposing further study of the mostsuitable type of long-range supersonic airliner.The Minister of Aviation recalled that earlier in the year twofirms had been given contracts to study the most suitable types of long-range supersonic airliner. Each had now submitted proposalsfor two aircraft with speeds of Mach. 2 - 2 and Mach 2 - 7. From thepoint of view of the trans-Atlantic crossing, the faster aircraft wouldappear to have little advantage and, in his view, further study shouldbe concentrated on the Mach 2 - 2. The cost of development of this aircraft might ultimately be not less than  100 millions. At present he proposed only that one aircraft firm and one engine firm shouldbe authorised to continue their design work on a Mach 2-2 aircraftwithin a maximum expenditure, over a period of 12 months, of i million, the greater part of which would have to be met by theGovernment. At a later stage the possibility of developing asupersonic airliner in collaboration either with France or with theUnited States could be explored before a final decision was taken.In discussion the view was expressed that to continue designstudy of this project would make it increasingly difficult to abandonit, and the Government might find themselves committed to immenseexpenditure without having had full opportunity to consider the implications for the national economy. It was, moreover, far from certain that the Mach 2-2 aircraft was the right one on which towork: the Americans were known to be building aircraft of a speed of approximately Mach 3 and it might well be that, by the time aMach 2 - 2 aircraft had come into production, it would already have become obsolete.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that furtherconsideration should be given to the question whether study of thedevelopment of a supersonic airliner ought to proceed and, if so,whether we should concentrate on a Mach 2 - 2 aircraft or should notrather include also aircraft with speeds of Mach 2 - 7 and even Mach 3.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Aviation, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Defence,to give further consideration to the question of continuingdesign studies for supersonic aircraft, including the range of their speeds; and to bring the matter again before theCabinet at an early meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,14th July, 1960.
