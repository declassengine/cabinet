The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Housing (C. (60) 96) on the Governmenfs future housing policy for England and Wales.The Minister of Housing said that it was most desirable that theGovernment should maintain the initiative in housing policy. his first main proposal was to recast present policy on subsidies. Theresult of the existing flat-rate system was that many of the authorities of the large cities used the surplus in their housing accounts, derivedfrom the subsidies still payable on houses built cheaply before thewar, together sometimes with direct contributions from the rates, tomaintain municipal rents at an artificially low level. other authorities notably in the rural and smaller urban areas were obliged to charge rents beyond the means of many potential tenants and were unable to make further progress with their housing programmes without throwing an additional burden on their rates.He therefore proposed that the aggregate amount of Exchequerhousing subsidies, worked out on the present basis, should beredistributed in accordance with the financial position of each authority: those who were following a reasonable rent policy andneeded additional help from the Exchequer would receive it andmight, where appropriate, be able to reduce their rents, while those whose housing accounts were strong would receive reduced subsidies on all future building and would in practice be obliged to raise the rents of their better-off tenants in consequence.The Ministers second main proposal concerned the building ofhouses to let by bodies other than the local authorities. There wasa real need for this as an alternative to municipalisation. discussions with the various interests concerned had shown that little could beexpected from private enterprise, and he therefore proposed that theExchequer should either make or underwrite loans at a relatively low rate of interest to housing trusts or associations who wereprepared to build for letting. Any houses built under such a scheme would count against the public programme and would not add to thetotal investment in housing. At the same time there was a very largenumber of houses owned by small landlords who were unwilling orunable to put and maintain them in proper condition, and onefunction of the housing trusts might be to buy property of this kind,put it into reasonable condition and continue to manage it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he regarded theMinisters proposals on housing subsidies as acceptable in principle and a reasonable basis for detailed discussion. The proposal to lendmoney to housing trusts at less than the market rate of interestinvolved, however, a concealed subsidy and an additionalcommitment on which he must reserve his position.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Home Secretary recalled that in the previous yearrepresentations had been made by the Opposition, advocating carallowances for Members of Parliament in lieu of travel warrants.The Chancellor of the Exchequer had worked out a practical schemebut the Opposition had recently indicated that they no longer felt able to support it, as they considered it could not be made safe fromabuse. In the circumstances the proposal would not be pursued.This could be explained in reply to a Parliamentary Question whichthe Prime Minister was to answer that day.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Home Secretary.
Discussion showed that there was considerable support in theCabinet for the proposals of the Minister of Housing, although doubt was expressed whether, in view of growing demands on the national resources, the payment of housing subsidies at existing levels couldbe justified indefinitely. But the timing of the necessary legislationpresented difficult questions. The Minister of Housing and theChancellor of the Exchequer were about to put forward jointproposals for legislation to effect the complete re-rating of industry as from April 1963. The revaluation of all residential property fromthe same date might result in increases in the rates payable byhouseholders, even taking into account the palliative which there-rating of industry would offer. For technical and administrativereasons the Rating and Valuation Bill must be introduced in the next session if the revaluation were to operate from the date proposed.The effect of the proposed legislation on housing subsidies would bemore immediate than that on rating and valuation, but at the sametime it would be spread over a longer period. If the Housing bill were passed in the session of 1960-61, the consequent gradualincreases in the rent of many municipal tenants would begin to take effect at the end of 1961, would continue throughout 1962 and wouldbe completed by early 1963. If, on the other hand, the Housing bill were deferred until 1961-62, its effect would fall on municipal tenantsconcurrently with increases in the rates they had to pay. There wastherefore a strong case for legislating in 1960-61, although it must berecognised that the provisional programme for that session was already heavily loaded and it might be difficult to accommodate boththe Housing Bill and the Rating and Valuation Bill.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that theproposals for a redistribution of housing subsidies were generally acceptable to the Cabinet, although much work remained to be doneon the details. Some means should also be found, in addition to thefacilities for purchase for owner-occupation provided under theHousing Act of 1959, to check the deterioration of many houses letby small landlords; and an effort should be made to devise some alternative to municipalisation which would be both effective andacceptable to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Further thought was required also on the timing of the legislation on housing subsidies inrelation to that proposed on rating and valuation.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for acommittee of Ministers to give further consideration to theGovernment^ future housing policy, particularly in relationto the system of Exchequer subsidies and the building ofhouses to let; to their policy on rating and valuation; andto the content and timing of any necessary legislation onthese subjects.Legislative 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeProgramme:     Secretary (C. (60) 93) outlining a programme of legislation for1961 and        1960-61 and the two subsequent sessions.Later SessionsThe Home Secretary said that, in addition to preparing a detailed programme of Bills to be introduced in the following session,the Future Legislation Committee had formulated the broad outlinesof a provisional plan for the sessions of 1961-62 and 1962-63. Whilegeneral approval of this forward plan at the present stage would not,of course, preclude subsequent variation, it would assist in the orderlypreparation and handling of the Governments legislative businessthroughout the greater part of the Parliament. The plan, if carried through, would represent a reasonable achievement and was givencohesion by a number of recognisable themes running through it,such as social and moral reform, reform of financial institutions and
CC. 37 (60)commercial practice, improvement of the transport system and improvement of the criminal and civil law and its administration.The plan as presented was not intended to be exhaustive: forexample, the reorganisation of the nationalised industries might berepresented in 1960-61 by a Bill to deal with the railways and in thefollowing session by one on the coal industry. Any furthersuggestions to add interest to the programme would be welcomed.The detailed programme formulated by the Committee for1960-61 almost certainly contained more material than could be handled in the time available, and further reductions might thereforebe necessary when it was reviewed later in the year. Meanwhile,however, Ministers responsible for the Bills included in it should seekat the earliest possible date whatever policy decisions were necessary,in order that preparation of the Bills might proceed without delay.Discussion showed that the proposed pattern of legislation inthe following three sessions was generally acceptable to the Cabinet,although it was open to question whether a Bill on so controversiala subject as Sunday observance would be appropriate as late as1962-63.In discussion of the detailed programme for 1960-61 thefollowing points were made:(a) The Bill conferring independence on Sierra Leone should betransferred to the list of essential Bills (A.1), since a date for independence had now been agreed.(b) It would be necessary to include in the Governments ownprogramme the Bill to give effect to the recommendations of thePeppiatt Committee on a levy on betting on horse-racing, which ithad earlier been suggested might be prepared for introduction by aPrivate Member.(c) It was already possible to suggest some reductions in the lists of programme Bills. That on Reserve Forces was now unlikely to berequired. Legislation to change the financial structure of theNational Health Service was unlikely to be ready and, if an increasein the weekly Health Service contribution became necessary, it mightbe possible to effect this in the Finance Bill. Unless it could be demonstrated that deferment of the Trunk Roads Bill wouldsignificantly delay the acquisition of land for the roads programme,it should be deferred until a later session.(d) There would be advantage in adding the Patents(Amendment) Bill to the programme.(e) It was unfortunate that time could not be found for a Bill on school-leaving dates, on which it was hoped that agreement wouldbe reached with the two sides of industry.(f) It had now become apparent that the Social Workers&apos; Bill,which had been proposed for introduction by a Private Member,would not be suitable for that purpose; and a place should, ifpossible, be found for it in the programme for 1961-62.(g) The Crown Estate Commissioners must be expected to protest at the deferment of their Bill, but there was no hope thattime could be found for it in the next session.(h) The Scottish legislation would so far as possible be dealt withby the Scottish Grand Committee. The Flooding (Scotland) Billshould be included in the programme if time could be found for it;and the Local Authorities (Contributions to Charities) (Scotland)Bill, previously regarded as a possible subject for a Private Member,should now be included in the Governments programme for 1960-61or a later session. It might be possible to combine the Bills on pensions for Sheriffs in Scotland and for Judicial Officers in Englandand Wales.
nuclear weapons(previous reference:C.C. (60) 35thConclusions)POLARIS*4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the suggestionthat facilities should be provided for United States polaris submarines in Scottish waters.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet should first considerwhether the United States request should, in principle, be met. If so,it would then be necessary to consider whether it should be made acondition that the United States Navy should accept facilities atLoch Linnhe and not, as they had originally proposed, in the Clydearea; and whether our agreement should be conditional on ourobtaining the right to purchase or manufacture polaris submarines and missiles of our own. It would also be necessary toconsider the relation of this project to the requirement of theSupreme Allied Commander, Europe (SACEUR) for medium-rangeballistic missiles to be deployed in Europe as part of the forces of theNorth Atlantic Alliance&quot; (the NATO M.R.B.M. project).The Minister of Defence said that, on reflection, he doubted whether it would be possible to represent the facilities which theUnited States Navy required as temporary, particularly if thearrangements were to be presented as a partnership project. It wasalso doubtful whether we should suggest that some of the UnitedStates POLARIS submarine hulls might be constructed in the UnitedKingdom, since the United States authorities would feel that Britishshipyards could not offer the facilities or the security which theycould obtain in their own country.The Minister of Defence also informed the Cabinet that theChiefs of Staff had been kept fully informed of his proposals and werein agreement with them.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that a technicalexamination had now established that Loch Linnhe was suitable forthe provision of the necessary facilities for POLARIS submarines,although it had not the logistic or amenity advantages of the Clydearea. The Atomic Energy Authority were satisfied that Loch Linnhewould be acceptable from the point of view of safety.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was in favour ofthis project, so long as it was understood that at the present stagewe were not seeking more than an option to purchase or manufacturePOLARIS submarines. If in due course it were decided to exercisethat option, it would be greatly preferable that the submarines shouldbe built in this country. He was increasingly doubtful whether wecould afford to finance both the SKYBOLT and the POLARISprojects, and we certainly could not afford to provide both at thesame time. The way in which it was proposed to relate this projectto the NATO M.R.B.M. project was acceptable to him, since it didnot involve any commitment for further expenditure on the latter.If in the future it became necessary to undertake expenditure onaccount of the latter, some compensating saving would have to befound elsewhere.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) It should be made clear to the United States authorities thatthe POLARIS submarine project, even if it were presented as apartnership between the two Governments, would involve great political difficulties. It would be desirable, for presentationalpurposes, to minimise the scale of the facilities to be provided.

4 PBritishTransportCommissionRailwayWages(previous reference:C.C. (60) 22ndConclusions,Minute 5)5. The Minister of Transport said that a satisfactory agreement had now been reached with the railway unions that workers in allthe British Transport Commission (B.T.C.) ports, who had shared inthe 5 per cent, interim increase in wages which had already been awarded on account of the recommendations in the Guillebaudreport, should receive a further increase of 2\ per cent.The main question which remained to be settled was the date from which the further wage increases to B.T.C. employees shouldcommence. The railway unions had rejected the proposal that the operative date should be that on which formal agreement would bereached, namely 1st July, and were pressing for retrospection to 1st January, 1960, on the ground that this was the date on whichthe recommendations in the Guillebaud report were based. At their meeting on the previous day the Wages Policy Committee had considered that the B.T.C. should be authorised to offer 2nd March,which was the date on which the Guillebaud report was published;and that, if the unions were to reject this, the Chairman of the B.T.C.should seek further instructions from Ministers. The Chairman had now represented that, in view of the urgent need for a settlement, heshould be informed what earlier date would be acceptable to theGovernment if the unions were to reject 2nd March. He thought there was some chance, though not a strong one, that the unions would accept 2nd March or at least 29th February, which was thebeginning of the pay week in which the Guillebaud report was published. It was not likely that the railway unions would takeofficial strike action on this issue, but if a settlement were not reachedthere would probably be sporadic unofficial strike action and the would also be helpful if the construction of amenities for Americanservicemen&apos;s dependants could be postponed until a later stage.(b) If the President of the United States accepted thearrangements and conditions which the Prime Minister would propose, the next stage would be to embody the arrangements in ageneral memorandum of understanding. A detailed agreement,covering such matters as safety precautions and technical questions,could be left for negotiation later, as also could the despatch of a technical mission to examine the question of our requirements forPOLARIS submarines.(c) It was suggested that the THOR missiles already established in the United Kingdom could, if necessary, be regarded as a specificcontribution to the NATO M.R.B.M. project.(d) It was suggested that, if we were to make these facilities available to the United States authorities, we should at the same timeexplain that the various forms of our present and future contributionto the nuclear power of the West placed a very heavy burden on our economy; and we might urge the United States authorities to considerthe desirability of improving economic and financial relationsbetween the two countries, with a view to ensuring that the economicburden of our defence did not become insupportable. It was thegeneral view of the Cabinet that it might be more appropriate to take up these economic issues separately, at a later stage.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (60) 98.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to inform the President of theUnited States of the arrangements proposed to provide facilities for POLARIS submarines in Scottish waters,taking into account the points mentioned in their discussion.
unions would not willingly co-operate with the B.T.C. in there organisation of the industry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it had always been understood that, having regard to the interim wage increase whichhad already been made, any further increase in implementation ofthe recommendations in the Guillebaud report would not be made retrospective. The cost of retrospection to 2nd March would be nearly  5 millions, and over  7 millions if the increase were back-dated to January. The Chairman of the B.T.C. should make everyeffort to avoid retrospection earlier than 29th February.It was the general view of the Cabinet that every effort shouldbe made to secure a settlement on the basis of retrospection to29th February. Failing that, in view of the need for an early settlement, the Chairman of the B.T.C. should be authorised to reach the best possible settlement, provided that the date for retrospectionwas not earlier than January 1960.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Transport to inform the Chairmanof the British Transport Commission that he should make every effort to secure a settlement on the basis of retrospection to 29th February, but, failing that, he should reach the best settlement he could secure, provided that thedate for retrospection was not earlier than 1st January, I960.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23rd June, 1960.
