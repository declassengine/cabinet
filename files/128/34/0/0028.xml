(59) 55thConclusions,Minute 3.)Oil Appliances(Standards)Bill.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Home Secretary said that he would shortly receive the reportof Lord Simonds&apos; committee on the power of disciplinary tribunalsto subpoena witnesses. The report would probably show that thesetribunals already had, at common law, a right of subpoena subjectto control by the High Court. In that event it might not be necessaryto amend the provisions of the Professions Supplementary toMedicine Bill. In any event, however, such amendments as mightbe necessary could be introduced when the Bill was in the House ofLords. It was not therefore proposed to impose any further delayon the passage of the Bill through the House of Commons.The Home Secretary said that the Peppiatt committee had foundin favour of a levy on bookmakers, but had not worked out a detailed scheme. It would not therefore be practicable to providefor this by amendment of the Betting and Gaming Bill, which was nowat a late stage in the House of Commons. In discussion it was agreedthat separate legislation should be prepared for this purpose. It was,however, suggested that, as an earnest of the Governments intentions,this separate Bill might be introduced in the House of Commonslater in the summer, even though it could not be passed into law before the end of the session.The Home Secretary said that an interim report had now beenreceived from the Committee on Consumer Protection, which had considered the need for safety regulations relating to oil heaters andother appliances. The statutory provisions required in respect of oil heaters could be enacted in a Private Members&apos; Bill which was now before the House of Commons. Mr. Nabarro, the promoterof that Bill, was ready to accept the amendments regarded by theGovernment as necessary for this purpose. The problem of safety regulations for other appliances required further consideration andwould have to be reserved for later legislation.nuclear tests.(previous reference :C.C. (60) 22ndConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (C. (60) 74) on the detection of underground nuclearexplosions.The Prime Minister said that in the joint declaration issuedduring his recent visit to the United States, President Eisenhowerand he had called on the Soviet Government to join in institutinga co-ordinated research programme for the purpose of improvingexisting methods of detecting small underground nuclear explosions.The concept was that each of the three nuclear Powers shouldseparately conduct this research, but that their programmes shouldbe co-ordinated and their results exchanged. The Americans already had plans for establishing detection stations and conductingunderground explosions in the United States. If we were to makea contribution, the Atomic Energy Authority had advised that thebest course would be for us to extend this network of detectionstations by establishing some of our own in Canada from which wecould observe the American explosions. A research programme ofthe kind envisaged would cost about  3-25 millions over the next three years. Some of the Commonwealth countries might co-operate in it. Thus, Canada might contribute towards the cost of establishing the stations, and Australia and New Zealand might lend staff toman them. Details of the plan would be the subject of further discussions with the Americans and with the Russians and we shouldnot undertake any actual expenditure until the Soviet Governmenthad agreed that arrangements for a co-ordinated programme wereto be made.
The Prime Minister said that these proposals for a british contribution had the support of the Chancellor of the Exchequerand of the Minister for Science. Subject to the Cabinefs approval,he proposed to mention them, and to seek the co-operation of theGovernments of Canada, Australia and New Zealand, in the courseof the forthcoming Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.Discussion showed that there was general support for the PrimeMinisters proposals. The Cabinet agreed that, while no orders should be placed until the United States and Soviet governments had accepted that there should be such a co-ordinated programmeof research, preliminary enquiries could be made about the supplyof equipment from the United States. Further consideration might also be given to the association of other commonwealth governments with this contribution to a co-ordinated research programme.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (60) 74 on the understandingthat expenditure would not be incurred until the threenuclear Powers had reached agreement that there should bea co-ordinated research programme for the purpose of improving the methods of detecting small undergroundnuclear explosions.3. The Minister of Agriculture made a report to the Cabineton the final stages of the International Conference on the Law ofthe Sea.Strenuous efforts had been made to mobilise support for theCanadian and United States proposal for a 6-mile territorial sea plusan outer 6-mile zone in which the coastal States would have exclusive fishing rights, subject to the phasing out of historic fishing rights ofother States. Despite these efforts, however, this proposal had failed by one vote to obtain the necessary two-thirds majority. Noother proposal had any chance of success and the Conference had broken down.The first question was whether we should now seek to obtain further advantage from the fact that 54 Governments had been readyto accept this solution. The United States delegation had suggestedthat these Governments might at once be invited to sign a separateconvention binding themselves to honour an arrangement in theterms of the proposal put forward by Canada and the United states at the Conference. This, if it could be secured, would representa substantial measure of international agreement on this question.It should also serve to prevent some of those States from transferringtheir support to the side of those who favoured a 12-mile territorial sea. There might, however, be dangers in abandoning, short of a comprehensive international agreement on some other limit, our freedom to continue to claim that a 3-mile limit remained valid in international law.The Attorney-General said that he was doubtful whether alimited convention of this kind would be of value to us. It wouldnot help us in resisting the claims of other States who unilaterallyasserted a right to a 12-mile territorial sea. It would mean that weshould have to accept the phasing out of our historic fishing rights.And it would not greatly affect the future attitude of the international court, which was likely to take the view that the voting at the geneva Conference was itself evidence of a substantial internationalacceptance of a 6-mile territorial sea.Law ofthe Sea.(previous reference :C.C. (60) 26thConclusions,Minute 4.)
i Ai ?Imdia Office 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Common-Library, wealth Secretary (C. (60) 73) on the future of the India Office Library.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, while the Law officers had advised that this library had passed into United Kingdomownership, the Governments of India and Pakistan had alwayscontended that in equity it belonged to them. Uncertainty aboutthe future of the library adversely affected our relations with both governments, and advantage might be taken of an approach whichthey had recently made to reach a settlement that would preserveour fundamental interests in the library, namely, that it should remain undivided, and in the United Kingdom, and should continueto be efficiently conducted and to provide the same type of service as at present.C.C. 28 (60)The Cabinet (1) Invited the Ministerial Committee on the Law of the Seato study, as a matter of urgency, whether there would be advantage in seeking to promote a separate convention onthe Law of the Sea between the 54 Governments whichhad voted at Geneva in favour of the proposal putforward by the Canadian and United States delegations;and to report their recommendations to the PrimeMinister.The Minister of Agriculture said that the second immediate question concerned the resumption of fishing by British trawlers inIcelandic waters. The British industry had refrained from fishingin those waters while the Conference was proceeding at Geneva.They now wished to resume fishing, though they had decided to refrain for the time being from fishing within 12 miles of the coast of Iceland, and they had asked if they could rely on assistance fromnaval vessels outside that limit. Trawlers which needed medicalassistance or emergency repairs would wish to have help from theRoyal Navy, as they could no longer put into Icelandic ports.It seemed right that the Government should give this assistance,even at the risk of appearing tacitly to accept a 12-mile limit.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that three naval vesselswould be assigned to this duty, with instructions which made it plain that, while they should not patrol within 12 miles of Iceland, theycould in emergency go to the help of British trawlers which got intodifficulties or were attacked by Icelandic gunboats when fishingbetween 12 and 4 miles off Iceland. This latter part of the instructionswould not be disclosed to the fishing industry, lest it should encouragetrawler captains to fish inside a 12-mile limit.The Cabinet (2) Approved the arrangements which the First Lord of theAdmiralty was proposing to make for naval support ofBritish trawlers fishing in Icelandic waters.The Cabinet also had before them a draft of a statement whichthe Minister of Agriculture was proposing to make in the House ofCommons that afternoon on the outcome of the Geneva Conference.In discussion various amendments to this draft statement were suggested and approved.The Cabinet- (3) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture to make, in theHouse of Commons that afternoon, a statement on the outcome of the Geneva Conference in the terms approved in the course of their discussion.
New permanent accommodation was needed for the library andthere would be less likelihood of claims for compensation from theother two Governments if the question of its future had been settledbefore any question arose of rebuilding on its present site. Thesolution he recommended was that ownership of the library shouldbe transferred to an independent Trust whose governing body would consist of nominees from each of the three countries concerned.If an arrangement of this kind could be made, there was reason to suppose that a suitable site in London might be made availablefree of charge.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the establishment ofan independent Trust might involve even greater expenditure, both for new building and for maintenance. Would it not be preferable that the library should be associated with the British Museum orthe Public Records Office? In any event he must reserve his position on the financial implications of the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;proposal.After further discussion the Prime Minister said that the project of an independent Trust might induce the Governments of Indiaand Pakistan to reach an agreement on the future of the librarywhich would preserve our fundamental interests. The principle ofa Trust could be discussed with the Prime Minister of India and thePresident of Pakistan on the understanding that the details of anysuch scheme would require further consideration. It was possiblethat, on this basis, the two Governments might make some financial contribution towards the cost of the library. Assistance might alsobe obtained from private funds.The Cabinet-Agreed that the principle of transferring ownership of the india Office Library to an independent Trust should bediscussed with the Governments of India and Pakistan onthe understanding that the financial implications of any detailed proposals would be subject to further considerationby the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland.(previous reference :C.C. (60) 14thConclusions,Minute 2.)SouthernRhodesia.5. The Commonwealth Secretary made a report to the Cabineton the discussions which he had been holding with the PrimeMinister of Southern Rhodesia, Sir Edgar Whitehead, about thepowers reserved to the United Kingdom Government under theconstitution of Southern Rhodesia. These discussions had proceededon the basis that the United Kingdom Government would be unableto surrender their reserve powers unless alternative arrangements were made which provided equally effective safeguards for theinterests of the African population. For this purpose Sir EdgarWhitehead was prepared to contemplate the creation of a second chamber, half of whose members would be Africans elected by anelectoral college comprising representatives of the main Africanorganisations in the territory. This was a promising approach to theproblem, but a great deal of further work would have to be done before a detailed scheme was available which could be commendedto Parliament. Meanwhile, Sir Edgar Whitehead, who was returning to Southern Rhodesia on the following day, was anxious to have itsaid at once that it had been agreed in principle that the reserve powers of the United Kingdom Government would be withdrawn;and he had indicated that, unless some public statement on those lines could be made, he would be obliged to ask for an immediatedissolution of the Parliament of Southern Rhodesia. TheCommonwealth Secretary had made it plain to Sir Edgar Whiteheadthat he could not agree to a public statement in the terms suggested.He circulated a draft of a statement which, in his judgment, went asfar as it was possible to go to meet Sir Edgar Whitehead&apos;s wishes.
CC. 28 (60)In discussion it was agreed that the Government could not beparties to a statement indicating that they had agreed in principle to withdraw their reserve powers in respect of Southern Rhodesia.There was as yet no sufficient assurance that alternative arrangements could be devised which would provide equally effective safeguards for the African population. Moreover, if such a statement were madeat the present time, it would exacerbate African feeling in SouthernRhodesia and prejudice the work of the Central African advisory commission under the Chairmanship of Lord Monckton. On theother hand, if there were an election in Southern Rhodesia in thenear future, the issues of independence and secession from theFederation were likely to be raised; and, if the political partiessought to outbid one another on these issues, the work of theMonckton Commission and the forthcoming Federal review wouldbe seriously prejudiced. In these circumstances it was important that, at the end of the current discussions with Sir Edgar Whitehead,some public statement should be made which would give him asmuch satisfaction as possible.After further discussion it was agreed that the operative partof the statement should indicate that, in these talks about the reserve powers of the United Kingdom, it had been agreed that the governingprinciple must be that any alternative machinery devised must be no less effective for the purposes for which the reserve powers had been intended; that Sir Edgar Whitehead had made certain broadproposals for such alternative machinery, which the commonwealth secretary had undertaken to consider in detail; and that, when thetwo Governments had given further study to these, a further meeting would be held in October before the Conference for the review ofthe Federal Constitution.The Cabinet-Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to issue a communique, in the terms approved in their discussion, onhis talks with the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesiaabout the modification of the reserve powers of the UnitedKingdom Government in respect of Southern Rhodesia.commercial policy.Horticulture.(previous references :CC. (59) 62ndConclusions,Minute 10, and cc. (59) 1stConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Minister of Health (whose constituencycontained the greater part of the main tomato-growing area of thecountry) (C. (60) 68 and 72) about an application for an increase inthe tariff on tomatoes.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that in January 1959the Cabinet had decided to reject applications for increases in theduties on tomatoes. The application had since been renewed andthe Tariff Advisory Committee had recommended that certain increases be made. There were, however, strong economic arguments against making any increase and, although a refusal would certainly involve the Government in political difficulties, the majority view ofthe Economic Policy Committee, who had considered the application,was that the balance of argument was still against making any increase.Discussion showed some division of opinion in the Cabinet onthis issue. It was suggested on the one hand that the economic arguments against increasing the tariff were by no means decisive:imports of tomatoes from Holland had increased substantially in
recent years and the area of domestic production had been reduced.The cost of production had risen while prices had continued to fall,so that the net incomes of tomato-growers in this country had beenreduced. On the political side, the Government had undertaken intheir Election Manifesto to &quot; continue to use the tariff as the maininstrument of protection&quot; for the horticultural industry and a renewed refusal to increase the tariff on tomatoes would beunfavourably received by the agricultural and horticultural interestsand their political sponsors, who were already discontented with the government&apos;s policies. If the tariff was to be increased, there wasa case for adopting the duty of 5d. per lb. recommended by the TariffAdvisory Committee from 16th June, not merely to 15th July but tothe end of that month. The problems which arose from the presentapplication showed clearly, however, that further consideration should be given to the possibility of introducing a minimum pricescheme for tomatoes or some other alternative to the tariff; and steps should be taken in addition to set on foot discussions between our own industry and the Dutch, from which some form of managedmarket might be developed.On the other hand, it was argued that to increase an agriculturaltariff would prejudice our political and economic relations with theDutch at a time when we were trying to avert the raising of industrialtariffs against us and when our international trade position wasunusually precarious. At least in some parts of the country, notably the Lea Valley, the tomato industry was still far from efficient (and could never perhaps be made fully economic) and to, increase thetariff would remove the incentive on the industry to make itselfefficient. It would, moreover, result in an increase in the price oftomatoes to the consumer.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that to sacrifice the interests of our own growers seemed at the presenttime unlikely to secure for us advantages in our international trade relations great enough to justify failing to carry out the pledge given at the time of the Election. The balance of advantage seemed,therefore, to lie on the side of accepting the recommendations ofthe Tariff Advisory Committee (subject to the minor modificationproposed in the Cabinefs discussion). The tariff increases shouldbe announced as being subject to review, though preferably not afterany specified period.- Meanwhile, further consideration should begiven to the possibilities of some alternative form of protection for horticulture and to the development of some form of managedmarket.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to accept the recommendations of the Tariff AdvisoryCommittee for increases in the tariff on tomatoes (subjectto continuation of the proposed duty of 5d. a lb. to31st July).(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the President of theBoard of Trade, to give further consideration toalternatives to the tariff as an instrument for the protectionof the tomato industry.(3) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to take steps to inauguratediscussions between the British and Dutch tomatoindustries.The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 64) about imports of pigmeat.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that the quota forPolish bacon had been 48,500 tons in 1959 but, in order to allow fora quota of frozen pork from North America, had been reduced toPigmeat.(previous reference:C.C. (69) 24thConclusions,Minute 6.)
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th April, 1960.20,000 tons for the first half of 1960. There were now three questions for decision:(i) whether for the second half of 1960 the Polish quota shouldbe 24,250 tons (i.e., half the 1959 rate) or 28,500 tons soas to restore the full rate of the previous year;(ii) whether a quota for the whole of 1961 should now be negotiated with Poland;(iii) whether an increased quota comparable to that granted to poland should now be offered also to Canada.In discussion it was argued that for the second half of 1960 andat least the whole of 1961 the Polish bacon quota should be fixed atthe 1959 rate of 48,500 tons a year. This would be greatly to theadvantage of our export trade with Poland, which had been seriously damaged by the cut in the bacon quota imposed at the end of 1959.It would, moreover, improve our political relations with Poland andthe stability and status of the Polish Government itself.Such action would, however, arouse much resentment in ourown bacon industry and was likely to lead to protests from Denmark,even though Danish exports of bacon to this country had substantially increased since the removal of the tariff. Moreover, a relatively small increase in the supplies of bacon available in this country mustbe expected to lead to a disproportionate fall in prices, with a consequent rise in the level of subsidy greater than could be justified by a problematical increase of our exports to Poland.Summing up this part of the discussion the Prime Minister saidthat the Poles might well be more concerned with the length of theperiod for which their bacon quota was fixed than with the actuallevel of the quota. A reasonable compromise might therefore beto offer them the choice between a quota at the full 1959 rate of48,500 tons a year for 12 months beginning on 1st July, 1960, anda quota at a somewhat lower rate say, 46,000 tons a year for aperiod of 18 months from that date.In further discussion it was pointed out that price levels hadnot been attractive enough to lead Canadian exporters to sendfrozen pork to this country. Since, for this reason, the agreed quota of 25,000 tons a year had not been taken up, there seemed no need to increase it, at least for the time being. It might later, however,be necessary to agree to the Canadians&apos; using the quota for otherpigmeat as well as for frozen pork.The Cabinet (4) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in discussing with the Polish Government the bacon quota for theperiod beginning 1st July, 1960, to offer them the choice between a rate of 48,500 tons a year for 12 months or some lower rate for 18 months.(5) Agreed that for the time being the quota for frozen porkfrom North America should not be increased.
