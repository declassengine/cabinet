nuclear weapons.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 7thConclusions,Minute 6.)Blue Streak.1. The Prime Minister said that the Defence Committee had for some time been considering what would be the best vehicle fordelivering the United Kingdom contribution towards the nuclear deterrent when the Bomber Force ceased to be an effective means of delivery. Hitherto it had been assumed that this Force would be supplemented, and eventually replaced, by the static ballistic missileBlue Streak. In view of later technical developments, however, theChiefs of Staff had advised that a static weapon of this kind wouldbe excessively vulnerable and that our contribution to the nuclear deterrent, if it was to continue to be effective, must in future be basedon some mobile means of delivery. The Prime Minister said that,during his recent visit to Washington, he had satisfied himself thatwe should be able in due course to obtain from the United States,on acceptable terms, supplies of one or other of the alternative types of mobile weapon, to be armed with a British warhead. In thesecircumstances the Defence Committee had decided that it would be wrong to proceed with the existing programme for the developmentof Blue Streak as a military weapon. There was a possibility that the blue Streak programme could be adapted for the development of arocket for use in space research; and this possibility would now be explored in detail in consultation with the firms concerned.This decision was of close concern to the Australian Governmentin view of their expenditure on the range at Woomera. The PrimeMinister of Australia had therefore been kept fully informed of the strategic arguments and he concurred in the view that Blue Streakshould not be further developed as a military weapon.It was proposed that this decision should be announced in theHouse of Commons by the Minister of Defence that afternoon.The Cabinet Confirmed the decision that the further development of theballistic missile Blue Streak as a military weapon should be abandoned.Parliament.        2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the week after the Easter recess.EconomicSituation.Balance ofPayments.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 22ndConclusions,Minute 4.)OverseaDevelopment.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 15thConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Cabinet resumed their discussions of a memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 60) about the prospects for the balance of payments during 1960 and the scale of externalexpenditure in the period 1960-63. They also had before them amemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 61)covering a report by officials on oversea development policy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the latest informationtended to confirm the forecast that the external monetary position was likely to deteriorate by about  200 millions in 1960. There was,however, some possibility that the continued increase in the rate ofimports was beginning to moderate. Nevertheless there was asombre prospect that the unfavourable trend in the balance ofpayments might continue for a number of years. On present policiesit was most unlikely that over the next few years our surplus on current account would be enough to enable us to meet our capitalcommitments. In the long run we should have to relate our overseacommitments to the foreign exchange earning capacity of the economy.If the economy were to proceed on its present course, the growth of exports might be restrained by the competing pull of the home market. It would be undesirable to reimpose physical controls on imports, even if it were possible to do so, because of the possibility of
retaliation. It was not practicable to improve our prospects rapidlyby limiting investment and expenditure abroad. We should thereforebe obliged to rely on a combination of encouraging exports andrestraining the excessive growth of home demand by monetarymeasures.There was general agreement with the measures recommended in C. (60) 61 for the co-ordination of our oversea developmentpolicies. In discussion of the economic situation the following points were made:(a) The warning which the Chancellor of the Exchequer had given about the development of excessive pressures onthe economy had already had a valuable effect on the credit policies of the banks. It might in due course benecessary to introduce moderate measures to restrain theincrease in hire-purchase and other credit facilities.(b) A general exhortation to encourage exports would not be useful. It would be better to concentrate encouragement and advice on those firms whose export performancecould be improved. The possibility of devising somefiscal preference for exports might be re-examined,,although on general grounds it would not be in our interest to introduce anything in the nature of export subsidies.(c) It was increasingly difficult to achieve any considerable increase in export earnings because of the growingcompetition from other industrial countries. Our exportprospects would be much improved if our industrialcompetitors would open their markets more freely to the raw materials which our main oversea customers needed to sell if they were to expand their markets for ourmanufactured products.id) It could be argued that, having regard to the vulnerableposition of our balance of payments, we had gone too farin removing quantitative restrictions on imports. On theother hand, the removal of quantitative restrictions herecould be justified in order to prevent the introduction ofretaliatory restrictions on our exports.The Cabinet-Approved the recommendations in paragraph 48 of thereport on oversea development policy attached to C. (60) 61.Law of theSea.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 22ndConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Committee had before them a memorandum by theLord Chancellor (C. (60) 67) on the latest developments at theInternational Conference on the Law of the Sea at Geneva.The Lord Chancellor said that Denmark was now willing tosupport the Canadian and United States proposal for a six-mile territory sea plus an outer six-mile zone in which the coastal states would have exclusive fishing rights, subject to the phasing-out afterten years of historic rights claimed by fishing States (&quot; six plusphased-out six &quot;), provided that we would undertake to enter intoa bilateral agreement for the phasing-out of our fishing rights off thecoast of the Faroes after only five years or such shorter period as might be agreed for the phasing-out of our rights off the coast of iceland.If, however, both this proposal and the proposal for a twelve-mile territory sea failed to secure the necessary majority in the committee stage of the Conference, a proposal for a nine-mile territorial seawould probably be tabled at a late stage. A decision was requiredwhether a nine-mile territorial sea would be preferable to the breakdown of the Conference without agreement.   If the Conference
CC. 26 (60)were to fail completely, a large number of countries might successfullyassert by unilateral action a twelve-mile territorial sea or an exclusive fishing zone of twelve or more miles, or both. From the point ofview of our fishery interests, a nine-mile territorial sea would be preferable to such a situation; indeed the nine-mile limit would suitour fishery interests better than the Canadian and United states proposal.From the strategic point of view, however, a territorial sea of nine miles was hardly less objectionable than one of twelve; but,provided that the right of innocent passage for warships waspreserved, it could be accepted if the only alternative would be thecomplete failure of the Conference. It was therefore recommendedthat the United Kingdom delegation should be instructed, in the last resort and to avoid a breakdown of the Conference, to support aproposal for a nine-mile territorial sea.In discussion some doubt was expressed about the soundness ofthis suggestion. It was far from certain that the United States couldbe persuaded to support the proposal, and it was essential that forthe time being their views on it should not be sought. The practicalresults of a breakdown of the Conference were difficult to predict.If a substantial number of countries did not in fact unilaterally asserta twelve-mile territorial sea, it was possible that the international court would hold that a limit of no more than six miles was validin international law and would refuse to recognise exclusive fishing rights outside the limit of the territorial sea. Moreover, if we hadvoted at the Conference in favour of a territorial sea of nine milesand that proposal had failed to secure the necessary majority, the factthat we had supported it would count against us if we were laterobliged to claim before the International Court that some narrowerlimit should be recognised. On the other hand, from the point ofview of our fishery and shipping interests and possibly also of our strategic interests, any agreement at the Conference was likely to be preferable to the chaotic conditions which must be expected to result from a failure to agree.The Prime Minister said that the relative merits of the coursesthat might be put to the Conference should be further considered onthe following day, when the result of the voting on the canadian and United States proposal would be known and the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries would be available to report on the latest developments at Geneva.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for futuretactics at the International Conference on the Law of theSea to be further considered by the Ministers concerned ata meeting on the following day.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,&apos;13th April, 1960.

CC. 27 (60)Parliament. 1.  The Cabinet discussed the handling of the debate in theHouse of Commons on 27th April on the Censure Motion relatingto the Governments decision to abandon the development of blue streak as a military weapon. It was important that the opposition should not evade their responsibility for seeking to avoid a wide-ranging debate on this question. It should be left to them to move the closure of the debate, if they wished to do so.The Cabinet agreed that it would be preferable that the Houseof Commons should not sit on the day of the wedding of H.R.H. the princess Margaret.ForeignAffairs.Disarmament.(previous reference:CC. (60) 20thConclusions,Minute 6.)Europe.(previous reference:CC. (60) 2ndConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the Conference on general disarment had so far made little progress. He hoped, however,that papers defining the Western position would be tabled shortly.These would put the Western Powers in a better posture for their discussion of this problem at the Summit Meeting. The conference would be adjourned before that Meeting began.The Conference on Nuclear Tests would however continueduring the Summit Meeting. In recent weeks progress had beenslow; but it was still hoped that it would be possible to identify the major outstanding questions which might be settled at the summit Meeting.The Foreign Secretary said that during his recent visit to washington it had been strongly represented -to him that theUnited Kingdom Government had not produced convincing proof that their economic interests would be seriously damaged by theimmediate tariff changes which were contemplated by the countries of the Common Market. The United States authorities had madea careful analysis of the probable effects on their economic interests,and had come to the conclusion that these would not be serious.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was not easy to forecast precisely the net effects which these&apos; changes would have on United Kingdom trade. He hoped, however, to be able toarrange for French and British officials to try to work out an agreed statement on this point.The Prime Minister said that it would be helpful if such an agreed statement could be prepared.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements by the Foreign Secretary.aircraft industry.(previous reference:CC. (60) 20thConclusions,Minute 4.)european co-operation.3. The Minister of Aviation said that during his recent visits to Paris and Bonn he had held promising discussions about thepossibility of co-operation between the aircraft industries of France,Germany and the United Kingdom. Projects for the jointdevelopment of a vertical-take-off military aircraft and of electronicequipment for air defence were to be considered; and other membersof the North Atlantic Alliance might be willing to join in these projects at a later stage. Both the French Prime Minister and theFederal Chancellor had also shown interest in the possibility ofco-operation in a space research programme if we decided to adaptBLUE STREAK as a space-satellite launcher. There was at present no European interest in the joint development of a long-distancesupersonic transport aircraft: this was probably a field . forco-operation with the United States. -The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Aviation.
Civil ^ 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theAviation. Minister of Aviation (C. (60) 7.1) reporting the progress made by(Previous officials in their discussion of the plan for an internationalReference: organisation, to be known as &quot; euro control &quot;, for the control ofC.C. (59) 55th movement of jet aircraft over Western Europe at heights above conclusions, 2q ,000 ftMinute 4.)European Air The Minister of Aviation said that agreement should shortlyTraffic Control, be reached on a Protocol and on a Convention which he hoped tobe able to approve for submission to a conference of the Governmentsconcerned later in the year.Discussion showed that there was general support for theproposals of the Minister of Aviation, subject to agreement being reached on certain amendments of the Convention to meet military requirements and on the understanding that further consideration would be given to the possibility of imposing charges on operatorsat a later stage. The &quot; euro control &quot; project would be a useful link between the Common Market and the countries of the european free Trade Association, and it was possible that Switzerland andthe Scandinavian countries would eventually join the system. Thelegislation required to permit the control of aircraft over the UnitedKingdom by the new agency need not be introduced during thepresent session.The Cabinet Approved the proposals set out in C. (60) 71, subject tothe satisfactory outcome of negotiations on military requirements and on the financial conditions ultimately tobe adopted for &quot; euro control &quot;.House ofCommons.(previous reference :C.C. (60) 19thConclusions,Minute 4.)Members&apos;Fund.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (60) 69) on the powers of investment of the trustees of the House of Commons Members&apos; Fund.The Home Secretary said that the Government had undertaken to introduce legislation in the following session to extend the investment powers of trustees. Meanwhile, the trustees of theMembers&apos; Fund were pressing for earlier legislation which would give them wider powers than those contemplated for trustees generally.While there were obvious objections to this, refusal might revivedemands for pensions for Members of Parliament or for an increasein the Exchequer contribution to the Fund.Discussion showed that the balance of opinion in the cabinet was that the Government should not take the initiative in introducing legislation for the benefit of Members and their dependants inadvance of that designed to improve the position of the beneficiariesof trusts generally. It was also argued that, in the present state ofthe market, it might be prudent for the Trustees to avoid wideningthe range of their investments. An attempt should therefore be madeto persuade them to await the general legislation already announced by the Government.The Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary, in conjunction with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to inform the Trustees ofthe House of Commons Members&apos; Fund that, in the viewof the Government, it would be inexpedient to extend their investment powers in advance of the legislationapplicable to Trustees generally.
7*. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there were indications that bank advances were continuing to rise. He was satisfied that it would be salutary if some modest checks were nowapplied to discourage further economic expansion. He therefore proposed to bring into operation, on a modest scale, the specialdeposits scheme which he had explained to the Cabinet wheninforming them of the content of his Budget statement. This wouldbe accompanied by the re-introduction of a mild degree of controlover hire-purchase transactions.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 70) on the salaries of non-medical university staff.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Wages PolicyCommittee had recently decided that the Government should accepta recommendation of the University Grants Committee that certain increases should be made in the salaries of the non-medical staffs of the universities. They had, however, been unable to reach agreement on the recommendation that these increases should haveeffect from 1st October, 1959, the date from which comparable staffsin technical colleges had received their last salary increases underthe Burnham arrangements. The Chancellors own view was thatit would be difficult to defend refusing some degree of retrospectionto the university staffs.Discussion showed that opinion in the Cabinet was divided onthis issue. It was argued that to refuse the degree of retrospectionrecommended by the University Grants Committee would arousemuch resentment in the universities. The Governmenfs earlier decision to defer the operation of the salary increase granted in 1957had been most unpopular, and a refusal to grant any retrospectionon the present award would be compared unfavourably with recentdecisions to back-date salary increases for doctors in the national health Service to 1st January, 1960, and for the Executive Class ofthe Civil Service to 1st October, 1958.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the award to theuniversity staffs was a straightforward salary increase, which couldbe distinguished from the re-assessment of scales based on surveyswhich related to a past date. The whole principle of retrospectionmust be re-examined when the present series of salary adjustmentshad been completed, and it would be undesirable to introduce itmeanwhile into the universities, where it had not hitherto been applied and might well provoke demands for its extension to school-teachers and other classes covered by the Burnham arrangements.Summing up the discussion The Prime Minister said that on balance it seemed expedient to give some degree of retrospection inthis award. The consequences might, however, be less embarrassingif the retrospection were based neither on any stated principle noron a date explicitly related to that of any other pay award. On this basis a reasonable compromise would be retrospection to 1st January,1960.The Cabinet-Agreed that the recommended salary increases for non-medical staffs of the universities should have effect from 1st January, 1960.
Cabinet Office,26th April, 1960.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would be discussing this plan with the Ministers directly concerned at ameeting on the following day. A public announcement would bemade on 28th April.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of this statement by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.

(59) 55thConclusions,Minute 3.)Oil Appliances(Standards)Bill.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Home Secretary said that he would shortly receive the reportof Lord Simonds&apos; committee on the power of disciplinary tribunalsto subpoena witnesses. The report would probably show that thesetribunals already had, at common law, a right of subpoena subjectto control by the High Court. In that event it might not be necessaryto amend the provisions of the Professions Supplementary toMedicine Bill. In any event, however, such amendments as mightbe necessary could be introduced when the Bill was in the House ofLords. It was not therefore proposed to impose any further delayon the passage of the Bill through the House of Commons.The Home Secretary said that the Peppiatt committee had foundin favour of a levy on bookmakers, but had not worked out a detailed scheme. It would not therefore be practicable to providefor this by amendment of the Betting and Gaming Bill, which was nowat a late stage in the House of Commons. In discussion it was agreedthat separate legislation should be prepared for this purpose. It was,however, suggested that, as an earnest of the Governments intentions,this separate Bill might be introduced in the House of Commonslater in the summer, even though it could not be passed into law before the end of the session.The Home Secretary said that an interim report had now beenreceived from the Committee on Consumer Protection, which had considered the need for safety regulations relating to oil heaters andother appliances. The statutory provisions required in respect of oil heaters could be enacted in a Private Members&apos; Bill which was now before the House of Commons. Mr. Nabarro, the promoterof that Bill, was ready to accept the amendments regarded by theGovernment as necessary for this purpose. The problem of safety regulations for other appliances required further consideration andwould have to be reserved for later legislation.nuclear tests.(previous reference :C.C. (60) 22ndConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (C. (60) 74) on the detection of underground nuclearexplosions.The Prime Minister said that in the joint declaration issuedduring his recent visit to the United States, President Eisenhowerand he had called on the Soviet Government to join in institutinga co-ordinated research programme for the purpose of improvingexisting methods of detecting small underground nuclear explosions.The concept was that each of the three nuclear Powers shouldseparately conduct this research, but that their programmes shouldbe co-ordinated and their results exchanged. The Americans already had plans for establishing detection stations and conductingunderground explosions in the United States. If we were to makea contribution, the Atomic Energy Authority had advised that thebest course would be for us to extend this network of detectionstations by establishing some of our own in Canada from which wecould observe the American explosions. A research programme ofthe kind envisaged would cost about  3-25 millions over the next three years. Some of the Commonwealth countries might co-operate in it. Thus, Canada might contribute towards the cost of establishing the stations, and Australia and New Zealand might lend staff toman them. Details of the plan would be the subject of further discussions with the Americans and with the Russians and we shouldnot undertake any actual expenditure until the Soviet Governmenthad agreed that arrangements for a co-ordinated programme wereto be made.
The Prime Minister said that these proposals for a british contribution had the support of the Chancellor of the Exchequerand of the Minister for Science. Subject to the Cabinefs approval,he proposed to mention them, and to seek the co-operation of theGovernments of Canada, Australia and New Zealand, in the courseof the forthcoming Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.Discussion showed that there was general support for the PrimeMinisters proposals. The Cabinet agreed that, while no orders should be placed until the United States and Soviet governments had accepted that there should be such a co-ordinated programmeof research, preliminary enquiries could be made about the supplyof equipment from the United States. Further consideration might also be given to the association of other commonwealth governments with this contribution to a co-ordinated research programme.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (60) 74 on the understandingthat expenditure would not be incurred until the threenuclear Powers had reached agreement that there should bea co-ordinated research programme for the purpose of improving the methods of detecting small undergroundnuclear explosions.3. The Minister of Agriculture made a report to the Cabineton the final stages of the International Conference on the Law ofthe Sea.Strenuous efforts had been made to mobilise support for theCanadian and United States proposal for a 6-mile territorial sea plusan outer 6-mile zone in which the coastal States would have exclusive fishing rights, subject to the phasing out of historic fishing rights ofother States. Despite these efforts, however, this proposal had failed by one vote to obtain the necessary two-thirds majority. Noother proposal had any chance of success and the Conference had broken down.The first question was whether we should now seek to obtain further advantage from the fact that 54 Governments had been readyto accept this solution. The United States delegation had suggestedthat these Governments might at once be invited to sign a separateconvention binding themselves to honour an arrangement in theterms of the proposal put forward by Canada and the United states at the Conference. This, if it could be secured, would representa substantial measure of international agreement on this question.It should also serve to prevent some of those States from transferringtheir support to the side of those who favoured a 12-mile territorial sea. There might, however, be dangers in abandoning, short of a comprehensive international agreement on some other limit, our freedom to continue to claim that a 3-mile limit remained valid in international law.The Attorney-General said that he was doubtful whether alimited convention of this kind would be of value to us. It wouldnot help us in resisting the claims of other States who unilaterallyasserted a right to a 12-mile territorial sea. It would mean that weshould have to accept the phasing out of our historic fishing rights.And it would not greatly affect the future attitude of the international court, which was likely to take the view that the voting at the geneva Conference was itself evidence of a substantial internationalacceptance of a 6-mile territorial sea.Law ofthe Sea.(previous reference :C.C.

i Ai ?Imdia Office 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Common-Library, wealth Secretary (C. (60) 73) on the future of the India Office Library.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, while the Law officers had advised that this library had passed into United Kingdomownership, the Governments of India and Pakistan had alwayscontended that in equity it belonged to them. Uncertainty aboutthe future of the library adversely affected our relations with both governments, and advantage might be taken of an approach whichthey had recently made to reach a settlement that would preserveour fundamental interests in the library, namely, that it should remain undivided, and in the United Kingdom, and should continueto be efficiently conducted and to provide the same type of service as at present.C.C. 28 (60)The Cabinet (1) Invited the Ministerial Committee on the Law of the Seato study, as a matter of urgency, whether there would be advantage in seeking to promote a separate convention onthe Law of the Sea between the 54 Governments whichhad voted at Geneva in favour of the proposal putforward by the Canadian and United States delegations;and to report their recommendations to the PrimeMinister.The Minister of Agriculture said that the second immediate question concerned the resumption of fishing by British trawlers inIcelandic waters. The British industry had refrained from fishingin those waters while the Conference was proceeding at Geneva.They now wished to resume fishing, though they had decided to refrain for the time being from fishing within 12 miles of the coast of Iceland, and they had asked if they could rely on assistance fromnaval vessels outside that limit. Trawlers which needed medicalassistance or emergency repairs would wish to have help from theRoyal Navy, as they could no longer put into Icelandic ports.It seemed right that the Government should give this assistance,even at the risk of appearing tacitly to accept a 12-mile limit.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that three naval vesselswould be assigned to this duty, with instructions which made it plain that, while they should not patrol within 12 miles of Iceland, theycould in emergency go to the help of British trawlers which got intodifficulties or were attacked by Icelandic gunboats when fishingbetween 12 and 4 miles off Iceland. This latter part of the instructionswould not be disclosed to the fishing industry, lest it should encouragetrawler captains to fish inside a 12-mile limit.The Cabinet (2) Approved the arrangements which the First Lord of theAdmiralty was proposing to make for naval support ofBritish trawlers fishing in Icelandic waters.The Cabinet also had before them a draft of a statement whichthe Minister of Agriculture was proposing to make in the House ofCommons that afternoon on the outcome of the Geneva Conference.In discussion various amendments to this draft statement were suggested and approved.The Cabinet- (3) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture to make, in theHouse of Commons that afternoon, a statement on the outcome of the Geneva Conference in the terms approved in the course of their discussion.
New permanent accommodation was needed for the library andthere would be less likelihood of claims for compensation from theother two Governments if the question of its future had been settledbefore any question arose of rebuilding on its present site. Thesolution he recommended was that ownership of the library shouldbe transferred to an independent Trust whose governing body would consist of nominees from each of the three countries concerned.If an arrangement of this kind could be made, there was reason to suppose that a suitable site in London might be made availablefree of charge.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the establishment ofan independent Trust might involve even greater expenditure, both for new building and for maintenance. Would it not be preferable that the library should be associated with the British Museum orthe Public Records Office? In any event he must reserve his position on the financial implications of the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;proposal.After further discussion the Prime Minister said that the project of an independent Trust might induce the Governments of Indiaand Pakistan to reach an agreement on the future of the librarywhich would preserve our fundamental interests. The principle ofa Trust could be discussed with the Prime Minister of India and thePresident of Pakistan on the understanding that the details of anysuch scheme would require further consideration. It was possiblethat, on this basis, the two Governments might make some financial contribution towards the cost of the library. Assistance might alsobe obtained from private funds.The Cabinet-Agreed that the principle of transferring ownership of the india Office Library to an independent Trust should bediscussed with the Governments of India and Pakistan onthe understanding that the financial implications of any detailed proposals would be subject to further considerationby the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland.(previous reference :C.C. (60) 14thConclusions,Minute 2.)SouthernRhodesia.5. The Commonwealth Secretary made a report to the Cabineton the discussions which he had been holding with the PrimeMinister of Southern Rhodesia, Sir Edgar Whitehead, about thepowers reserved to the United Kingdom Government under theconstitution of Southern Rhodesia. These discussions had proceededon the basis that the United Kingdom Government would be unableto surrender their reserve powers unless alternative arrangements were made which provided equally effective safeguards for theinterests of the African population. For this purpose Sir EdgarWhitehead was prepared to contemplate the creation of a second chamber, half of whose members would be Africans elected by anelectoral college comprising representatives of the main Africanorganisations in the territory. This was a promising approach to theproblem, but a great deal of further work would have to be done before a detailed scheme was available which could be commendedto Parliament. Meanwhile, Sir Edgar Whitehead, who was returning to Southern Rhodesia on the following day, was anxious to have itsaid at once that it had been agreed in principle that the reserve powers of the United Kingdom Government would be withdrawn;and he had indicated that, unless some public statement on those lines could be made, he would be obliged to ask for an immediatedissolution of the Parliament of Southern Rhodesia. TheCommonwealth Secretary had made it plain to Sir Edgar Whiteheadthat he could not agree to a public statement in the terms suggested.He circulated a draft of a statement which, in his judgment, went asfar as it was possible to go to meet Sir Edgar Whitehead&apos;s wishes.
CC. 28 (60)In discussion it was agreed that the Government could not beparties to a statement indicating that they had agreed in principle to withdraw their reserve powers in respect of Southern Rhodesia.There was as yet no sufficient assurance that alternative arrangements could be devised which would provide equally effective safeguards for the African population. Moreover, if such a statement were madeat the present time, it would exacerbate African feeling in SouthernRhodesia and prejudice the work of the Central African advisory commission under the Chairmanship of Lord Monckton. On theother hand, if there were an election in Southern Rhodesia in thenear future, the issues of independence and secession from theFederation were likely to be raised; and, if the political partiessought to outbid one another on these issues, the work of theMonckton Commission and the forthcoming Federal review wouldbe seriously prejudiced. In these circumstances it was important that, at the end of the current discussions with Sir Edgar Whitehead,some public statement should be made which would give him asmuch satisfaction as possible.After further discussion it was agreed that the operative partof the statement should indicate that, in these talks about the reserve powers of the United Kingdom, it had been agreed that the governingprinciple must be that any alternative machinery devised must be no less effective for the purposes for which the reserve powers had been intended; that Sir Edgar Whitehead had made certain broadproposals for such alternative machinery, which the commonwealth secretary had undertaken to consider in detail; and that, when thetwo Governments had given further study to these, a further meeting would be held in October before the Conference for the review ofthe Federal Constitution.The Cabinet-Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to issue a communique, in the terms approved in their discussion, onhis talks with the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesiaabout the modification of the reserve powers of the UnitedKingdom Government in respect of Southern Rhodesia.commercial policy.Horticulture.(previous references :CC. (59) 62ndConclusions,Minute 10, and cc. (59) 1stConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Minister of Health (whose constituencycontained the greater part of the main tomato-growing area of thecountry) (C. (60) 68 and 72) about an application for an increase inthe tariff on tomatoes.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that in January 1959the Cabinet had decided to reject applications for increases in theduties on tomatoes. The application had since been renewed andthe Tariff Advisory Committee had recommended that certain increases be made. There were, however, strong economic arguments against making any increase and, although a refusal would certainly involve the Government in political difficulties, the majority view ofthe Economic Policy Committee, who had considered the application,was that the balance of argument was still against making any increase.Discussion showed some division of opinion in the Cabinet onthis issue. It was suggested on the one hand that the economic arguments against increasing the tariff were by no means decisive:imports of tomatoes from Holland had increased substantially in
recent years and the area of domestic production had been reduced.The cost of production had risen while prices had continued to fall,so that the net incomes of tomato-growers in this country had beenreduced. On the political side, the Government had undertaken intheir Election Manifesto to &quot; continue to use the tariff as the maininstrument of protection&quot; for the horticultural industry and a renewed refusal to increase the tariff on tomatoes would beunfavourably received by the agricultural and horticultural interestsand their political sponsors, who were already discontented with the government&apos;s policies. If the tariff was to be increased, there wasa case for adopting the duty of 5d. per lb. recommended by the TariffAdvisory Committee from 16th June, not merely to 15th July but tothe end of that month. The problems which arose from the presentapplication showed clearly, however, that further consideration should be given to the possibility of introducing a minimum pricescheme for tomatoes or some other alternative to the tariff; and steps should be taken in addition to set on foot discussions between our own industry and the Dutch, from which some form of managedmarket might be developed.On the other hand, it was argued that to increase an agriculturaltariff would prejudice our political and economic relations with theDutch at a time when we were trying to avert the raising of industrialtariffs against us and when our international trade position wasunusually precarious. At least in some parts of the country, notably the Lea Valley, the tomato industry was still far from efficient (and could never perhaps be made fully economic) and to, increase thetariff would remove the incentive on the industry to make itselfefficient. It would, moreover, result in an increase in the price oftomatoes to the consumer.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that to sacrifice the interests of our own growers seemed at the presenttime unlikely to secure for us advantages in our international trade relations great enough to justify failing to carry out the pledge given at the time of the Election. The balance of advantage seemed,therefore, to lie on the side of accepting the recommendations ofthe Tariff Advisory Committee (subject to the minor modificationproposed in the Cabinefs discussion). The tariff increases shouldbe announced as being subject to review, though preferably not afterany specified period.- Meanwhile, further consideration should begiven to the possibilities of some alternative form of protection for horticulture and to the development of some form of managedmarket.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to accept the recommendations of the Tariff AdvisoryCommittee for increases in the tariff on tomatoes (subjectto continuation of the proposed duty of 5d. a lb. to31st July).(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the President of theBoard of Trade, to give further consideration toalternatives to the tariff as an instrument for the protectionof the tomato industry.(3) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to take steps to inauguratediscussions between the British and Dutch tomatoindustries.The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 64) about imports of pigmeat.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that the quota forPolish bacon had been 48,500 tons in 1959 but, in order to allow fora quota of frozen pork from North America, had been reduced toPigmeat.(previous reference:C.C. (69) 24thConclusions,Minute 6.)
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th April, 1960.20,000 tons for the first half of 1960. There were now three questions for decision:(i) whether for the second half of 1960 the Polish quota shouldbe 24,250 tons (i.e., half the 1959 rate) or 28,500 tons soas to restore the full rate of the previous year;(ii) whether a quota for the whole of 1961 should now be negotiated with Poland;(iii) whether an increased quota comparable to that granted to poland should now be offered also to Canada.In discussion it was argued that for the second half of 1960 andat least the whole of 1961 the Polish bacon quota should be fixed atthe 1959 rate of 48,500 tons a year. This would be greatly to theadvantage of our export trade with Poland, which had been seriously damaged by the cut in the bacon quota imposed at the end of 1959.It would, moreover, improve our political relations with Poland andthe stability and status of the Polish Government itself.Such action would, however, arouse much resentment in ourown bacon industry and was likely to lead to protests from Denmark,even though Danish exports of bacon to this country had substantially increased since the removal of the tariff. Moreover, a relatively small increase in the supplies of bacon available in this country mustbe expected to lead to a disproportionate fall in prices, with a consequent rise in the level of subsidy greater than could be justified by a problematical increase of our exports to Poland.Summing up this part of the discussion the Prime Minister saidthat the Poles might well be more concerned with the length of theperiod for which their bacon quota was fixed than with the actuallevel of the quota. A reasonable compromise might therefore beto offer them the choice between a quota at the full 1959 rate of48,500 tons a year for 12 months beginning on 1st July, 1960, anda quota at a somewhat lower rate say, 46,000 tons a year for aperiod of 18 months from that date.In further discussion it was pointed out that price levels hadnot been attractive enough to lead Canadian exporters to sendfrozen pork to this country. Since, for this reason, the agreed quota of 25,000 tons a year had not been taken up, there seemed no need to increase it, at least for the time being. It might later, however,be necessary to agree to the Canadians&apos; using the quota for otherpigmeat as well as for frozen pork.The Cabinet (4) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in discussing with the Polish Government the bacon quota for theperiod beginning 1st July, 1960, to offer them the choice between a rate of 48,500 tons a year for 12 months or some lower rate for 18 months.(5) Agreed that for the time being the quota for frozen porkfrom North America should not be increased.

contents minute no. subject.      Law of the Sea...............2.      Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers, 19603.     Africa     ..................Economic Aid.
1. The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that, since the cabinet&apos;s last meeting, Ministers had considered two possible courses of action which might be taken following the failure to reach agreement at the Geneva Conference on the Law of the Sea. The first was that an attempt should be made to organise support for aconvention, which could be registered with the United Nations, to thesame effect as the Canadian-United States proposal which had comevery near to being accepted by the Conference. This would providefor a six-mile territorial sea plus six miles of exclusive fishing subjectto the phasing-out of historic rights plus some procedure by whichcoastal States especially dependent on fishing could claim preferentialrights outside the 12-mile limit. In the Minister^ view and that ofthe majority of the Committee on the Law of the Sea, such aconvention would be the best method of checking the general movewhich must otherwise be expected towards unilateral declarations ofa 12-mile territorial sea. He therefore proposed that, afterpreliminary discussions with the Prime Ministers of Canada and australia, who were in London, soundings should be taken among other countries which might be prepared to support such a convention.Concurrently, we should also try to negotiate a North atlantic fisheries pact, which would make no reference to the territorial sea and would be in no way incompatible with a general convention onthe lines proposed. Such a pact would be the best way of allaying the growing impatience of our own fishing industry. A North atlantic fisheries pact might, moreover, deter Norway and other countries from seeking to secure exclusive fishing zones by an immediatedeclaration of a 12-mile territorial sea. The Minister therefore proposed that discussions should be initiated without delay with aview to promoting a convention on the lines of the Canadian-UnitedStates proposal at Geneva and also a North Atlantic fisheries pact.The Attorney-General said that a number of the countries whichhad voted for the Canadian-United States proposal at Geneva wouldbe unwilling to sign a convention to the same effect. The voting atGeneva was likely to have a material influence on the international court in favour of a six-mile territorial sea. To the extent thata convention secured less support, that influence would be weakened.Moreover, the risk must not be ignored that an attempt to organise aconvention on the lines proposed would stimulate the formulation ofa rival convention providing for a 12-mile territorial sea; and if thelatter were to secure as much, or even more, support than the formerthe effect would be very damaging to our interests. The Attorney-General therefore suggested that we should confine ourselves to negotiations for one or more regional fishery pacts.In discussion it was pointed out that, while this was a matter of judgment, it had been the majority view of the&apos;Committee on the law of the Sea that the negotiation of regional fishery pacts alone was likely to accelerate rather than retard a general movement towardsunilateral declarations of a 12-mile territorial sea. It was, moreover,only by insisting at Geneva that fishery limits and the territorial seashould be dealt with together that we had been able to muster asmuch opposition as we had against the advocates of a 12-mile territory sea; and to attempt now to deal with fisheries alone wouldplay into their hands and would also forfeit the good-will of canada and the United States and possibly also of Australia, who were thought to favour a general convention on the lines of the Canadian-United States proposal. It should therefore be made clear in any discussion of a North Atlantic fishery pact which was urgent both because of the attitude of our fishing industry and because of the pressure on the Norwegian Government to declare a 12-mile territory sea or fishery limit-that we would favour such a pact onlyon the basis of its being within the framework of a general conventionSECRET57150-11 . B law of theSea.(previous reference :C.C. (60) 28thConclusions,Minute 3.)
dealing with the territorial sea as well as fishery limits. At the sametime we should indicate that our support for such a convention was conditional on its commanding adequate support from other countries for example, on an assurance that it would be signed by not lessthan, say, 40 countries, well distributed over the world and if possibleincluding the areas in which the breadth of the territorial sea wascritical from the point of view of defence.In further discussion it was suggested that in response to the pressure from our fishing industry we should be prepared to announce the withdrawal of Royal Navy ships from Icelandic waters pendingnegotiation of some form of fisheries pact. This concession could beput forward as an earnest of our wish to achieve a settlement and asa return for the Icelandic Governments agreement to waive the penalties incurred under Icelandic law by British trawlers which had since September 1958 fished within the 12-mile limit and to offer, forthe future, succour and repair facilities to British trawlers which found themselves in difficulties.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that the best course would now be to invite the Canadian and United states government to take the initiative in approaching other countries who might be willing to support a convention on the lines of their proposalat Geneva, on the understanding that given adequate support we ourselves were in favour of such a convention. We should explain tothem the urgency of our own fishing problems in the North atlantic and indicate that we ourselves intended to take the initiative, and hoped for their support, in trying to negotiate a North atlantic fisheries pact. The Royal Navy ships at present in Icelandic watersshould not be withdrawn until the latter discussions were under way.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary (a) to invite the Canadian Prime Minister to take theinitiative in seeking support for a general convention on. the lines of the Canadian-UnitedStates proposal at the International Conference onthe Law of the Sea at Geneva;(b) to explain to him that we ourselves intended to try tonegotiate a North Atlantic pact dealing withfisheries alone.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, immediately after and in thelight of the consultation referred to in Conclusion (1), tomake a similar approach to the United States Govern-ment.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the. Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and in the light ofreactions to the approaches to be made in pursuance of conclusions (1) and (2) above, to initiate discussions withthe Icelandic, Norwegian and other Governments on theformation of a North Atlantic fisheries pact.(4) Agreed that, when the discussions mentioned in Con-clusion (3) above had been set on foot, tije Royal Navyships specially assigned to duty in Icelandic waters shouldbe withdrawn.Meeting of 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the progress of the discussionsCommonwealth at the current Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.  On them-me*    ioso political and economic questions which had been discussed there hadMmisters, 1360. keen a substantial measure of agreement. But, as had been expected,difficulties had arisen over the question of racial discrimination inSouth Africa. At the outset of the Meeting it had been agreed that,
Africa. 3.   The Commonwealth Secretary said that in the course ofEconomic Aid. discussion on economic questions at the current Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers the suggestion had been made thatthe older members of the Commonwealth might take the initiative in establishing a&quot; Colombo Plan &quot; for Africa which would enable the african countries to build up their own economies. This concept-would have political advantages and might be comparatively cheap;but, even on a relatively modest basis, he doubted whether theresources required could be made available from within the Common-wealth alone and it might be preferable for any such project to be studied in some wider context. It might, however, be suggested thatthe subject should be remitted for detailed examination by officials ofthe Commonwealth countries concerned.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, while recognising thepresentational advantages of the proposal, said that it would not bepossible for the United Kingdom to increase the  26 millions whichwe were expecting to provide annually as economic aid to african countries. Within the limit of the resources available to the Common-wealth it was unlikely that a significant and successful version of theC.C. 29 (60)while it would be contrary to precedent for the conference itself todiscuss the internal affairs of a member country, informal meetingscould be arranged at which the representative of South Africa couldexplain the policy of the Union Government and hear the views ofother delegations. Two such meetings had in fact been held.Unfortunately, however, the South African representative, Mr. EricLouw, had also held a Press conference at which he had made anuncompromising defence of the racial policy of the UnionGovernment; and this had led the Prime Minister of Malaya to makea counter-statement to the Press which was strongly critical ofMr. Louw. As a result feeling on this subject had been exacerbatedand the private meetings had been suspended.Mr. Louw had intended to give notice, in the following week,that a referendum would shortly be held in the Union on the questionwhether South Africa should adopt a republican form of constitution,and to ask whether the other Commonwealth Governments would agree that South Africa should remain a full member of the Common-wealth if she became a republic. It was desirable on many grounds that the Union should remain within the Commonwealth. But the atmosphere at the present Meeting was now such that, if this question were put, it was unlikely to receive a unanimous favourable answer.It was perhaps conceivable that, if Mr. Louw were ready to accept some public statement about the multi-racial character of theCommonwealth, the other heads of delegations might in return beready to agree that South Africa might remain within theCommonwealth as a republic. It was however most unlikely thatMr. Louw would be able to endorse a resolution on the racial questionof a kind which would be acceptable to other delegations. on balance therefore it might be wiser to seek to dissuade Mr. Louw fromraising at this Meeting the question whether South Africa could expect to remain within the Commonwealth if she adopted a republican form of constitution.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister and the commonwealth secretary would seek to avert discussion, during the currentMeeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers, of the questionof South Africa&apos;s continued membership of the Common-wealth.
Colombo Plan could be adopted for Africa. It would be preferable to encourage the International Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment to extend their activities in African countries. The ideaof Commonwealth assistance in Africa might be studied further by officials, but we should recognise that, while it might be possible for united Kingdom aid to Africa to be identified with a Commonwealthagency, it was unlikely that any substantial additional funds would bemade available by other members of the Commonwealth for thispurpose.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that it mightbe expedient to suggest to the Commonwealth Prime Ministers thatthe possibility of a Colombo Plan for Africa should be studied furtherby officials. We should, however, recognise that no substantial additional funds were likely to be forthcoming on this basis in Africa.We should also consider whether any additional help that the UnitedKingdom could give might take the form of a contribution in terms of personnel rather than of finance.The Cabinet-Authorised the Prime Minister to suggest to the Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers that the proposal toestablish a &quot; Colombo Plan &quot; for Africa should be remittedfor further study by officials of the Commonwealth countries concerned.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,6th May, 1960.

1135CC. 30Cyprus.(previous reference:CC. (60) 25thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Foreign Secretary said that, although a number of othermatters of importance were still outstanding e.g., the amount offinancial assistance and the exact delimitation of the sovereign areas there were indications that the point to which the Greek Cypriotsnow attached most importance was the future of the sovereign areasin the event of our deciding that it was no longer necessary to retainBritish sovereignty over them. The Greek Cypriots wanted some assurance that these areas would never be ceded to Turkey, and thatthere would be no danger of a Turkish veto on their reversion to theRepublic of Cyprus. On the other hand, it was important for us toavoid any commitment about the future of the areas which would givethe Greek Cypriots an incentive to work for the removal of british sovereignty over them. Moreover, we might, in certain circumstances,wish to transfer our bases to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat the possibility of a satisfactory settlement of the whole Cyprusquestion ought not, in the last resort, to be jeopardised by refusing togive the Greek Cypriots some reassurance about the future ofthe sovereign areas. Officials of the Departments concerned were examining what form such a reassurance might take.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Law of theSea.(previous reference:CC. (60) 29thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Foreign Secretary recalled that the Cabinet had agreed at their last meeting that the Canadian and United States Govern-ments should be invited to take the initiative in approaching othercountries which might be willing to support a convention dealing with both the territorial sea and fishery zones, on the lines of the proposal which had failed to secure the necessary majority at the recentInternational Conference on the Law of the Sea. The CanadianPrime Minister had been found unwilling to commit his Governmentto this course without consultation with his Cabinet; and a parallelapproach had therefore been made to the United States Government.Their reaction was not yet known, but it was becoming increasinglyurgent to initiate also discussions designed to lead to an agreementdealing with fisheries alone among the North Atlantic countries.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that, while it would be preferable to await the reactions of theUnited States Government to the approach to which the foreign secretary had referred, we must now take the initiative in callingtogether a preparatory conference with Norway, Iceland and otherNorth Atlantic countries to discuss the formulation of a fisheriesagreement. Unless the Canadian and United States Governmentsproved finally unwilling to support a parallel convention dealing with both the territorial sea and fisheries, we should advance the conception of a North Atlantic fisheries pact as within the context of amore general convention.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries, to propose to the icelandic, Norwegian and other Governments an earlyconference to discuss the conclusion of a North atlantic fisheries pact.
Meeting ofCommon-wealthPrimeMinisters,1960.(previous reference: &apos;C.C. (60) 29thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet were informed of the further progress of theMeeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.The South African representative, Mr. Eric Louw, had asked that a restricted meeting should be held, attended only by Heads of delegations, so that he might refer to the personal criticisms whichthe Prime Minister of Malaya had directed against him in a statement to the Press. At this restricted meeting, which had been held on theprevious day, the other Heads of Delegations had taken theopportunity of expressing their views on the racial policy of the UnionGovernment and its effects on relations between South africa and other members of the Commonwealth. In this way, as a result ofMr. Louw&apos;s own initiative, the Prime Ministers had been able fully to ventilate their feelings about racial discrimination in South Africa.There remained, however, the problem of finding an acceptable meansof dealing with this subject in the communique to be issued at the endof the Meeting. The alternatives were to include in the communiquea brief objective statement of the course which the discussions hadtaken or, if that were not acceptable to Mr. Louw, to issue a separatestatement in which the views of the other delegations would be morefreely expressed. The Cabinet considered that the first of these alternatives was to be preferred.The Cabinet were also informed that it had not been possible to dissuade Mr. Louw from raising at the Meeting the question whetherSouth Africa could remain within the Commonwealth after adopting a republican form of Constitution. On the other hand, it now appeared that other Commonwealth delegations were unlikely, in a discussion on that question, to oppose South Africa&apos;s continued membership. It seemed likely that, if this matter were raised,the other Commonwealth delegations would content themselves withtaking note of the intentions of the Union Government without committing themselves finally to the view that South Africa could continue in the Commonwealth if she became a republic.The Cabinet Took note of this report on the further progress of theMeeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.Common-wealthMinisters.DiplomaticImmunity.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (60) 77) on diplomatic immunity for commonwealth Ministers and their staffs while on official visits to theUnited Kingdom and for the staffs of Commonwealth organisationsestablished in this country.The Minister of State, Commonwealth Relations Office, said that under section 4 of the International Organisations (Immunities and privileges) Act, 1950, the diplomatic immunities enjoyed by foreignenvoys could be conferred on representatives of foreign Powersattending international conferences in the United Kingdom. the attorney-General had advised that Ministers of commonwealth countries attending conferences here did not enjoy diplomaticimmunity and privileges, and it seemed appropriate that legislation should be introduced to put them in a not less favourable position than the representatives of foreign Powers.In addition the Minister of State suggested that consideration should be given to the possibility of according to commonwealth organisaitons established in this country immunities similar to thoseaccorded under the Act of 1950 to international organisations which included foreign Powers.Discussion showed that there was general agreement that legislation should be introduced at an appropriate time to make possible the grant of immunities to Ministers of Commonwealth
90countries and their staffs visiting the United Kingdom on the same lines as were provided by the Act of 1950 in relation to representativesof foreign Powers. Further consideration should, however, be givento the proposal to accord immunities to the commonwealth economic Committee and other Commonwealth organisations whichwere, or were to be, established in this country, especially in relationto liability to United Kingdom income tax. While, therefore, thedecision on Ministers attending conferences could conveniently be announced to the Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers that week, it would be preferable not to mention the second proposal until it had been further examined. With the increasing number ofmissions and organisations to which diplomatic immunities wereaccorded, it might even be necessary to consider whether theGovernment should not assume ultimate responsibility for the civil liabilities which were extinguished.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would inform theMeeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers that theGovernment intended to introduce legislation for thebenefit of Commonwealth Ministers and their staffsattending conferences in this country, on the lines of theInternational Organisations (Immunities and Privileges)Act, 1950.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, to give furtherconsideration to the question of according diplomaticimmunities to Commonwealth organisations established inthe United Kingdom.Pensions.(previous references:C.C. (59) 62ndConclusions,Minute 6 andC.C. (59) 30thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the LordChancellor and the Minister of Pensions (C. (60) 79 and 80) on the timing of the next increase in retirement pensions.The Lord Chancellor said that the Social Services Committee had considered three alternative methods of timing the first move to giveeffect to the Governmenfs Election pledge that they would &quot; ensurethat pensioners continue to share in the good things which a steadilyexpanding economy will bring &quot;.The first method was to introduce legislation before the summer recess to effect an increase in pensions in the coming autumn. TheCommittee were, however, satisfied that there was no satisfactorymeans of financing such an increase: it would be inappropriate toincrease contributions so shortly before the inception of the newgraduated pensions scheme in April 1961 and the Committee had accepted the view of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that an increase should not be financed either directly by the Exchequer or by further reduction of the National Insurance Fund.The second alternative was to legislate in the coming autumn fora pensions increase to take effect in the following April. TheCommittee had been impressed with the view that this course was likely to arouse strong pressure for postponement of the new scheme,since employers would demand more time to consider, in the light ofchanged circumstances, whether or not to contract out of it. If,however, it was reasonable to think that such pressure could be successfully resisted, this second alternative was likely to be the most satisfactory.The third course was to defer legislation until after April 1961,which would mean either introducing a Bill so shortly after that date as to lay the Government open to a charge of bad faith or deferring
the actual operation of the increase in pensions until the early part of1962 over two years after the General Election.The Social Services Committee had concluded that the best course was to reconsider the matter in the autumn, and the LordChancellor proposed that a Bill should be prepared in the meantime.The Government would then be in a position to decide whether tointroduce it in the autumn or to defer it until some time in 1961.The Minister of Pensions said that it was difficult to assess howstrong would be the pressure for postponement of the new scheme ifthe Government were to introduce in the autumn of 1960 legislationchanging the rates of both contributions and benefits. He was satisfied that there would be at least some risk that the Governmentwould be compelled to give way, which would be very damaging tothe Exchequer; and from this point of view it was desirable that any move to increase pensions should be made as long as possible inadvance of the date for the new scheme. Pressure was already building up for a pensions increase in fulfilment of the Governments pledgeand it must be expected that this would be intensified when theGovernment Actuary&apos;s quinquennial report on the National insurance fund and the Ministers review of the adequacy of current benefitswere published. Moreover, the highest pension increase which was at present contemplated was likely to be regarded as modest in comparison with public expectation and this was a strong argument infavour of introducing it sooner rather than later. The national insurance Fund totalling over  1,450 millions was already being rundown by about  50 millions during the current financial year, and inthe Minister&apos;s view it would not be out of the question to finance apensions increase operating from, say, mid-December either byrunning down the Fund by a further  35 millions or by diverting the 30 millions surplus in the Industrial Injuries Fund.The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded the Cabinet that ithad been the established policy of the Government not to increasenational insurance benefits without a corresponding increase in contributions. To depart from this would be wholly incompatible with the Governments current economic policies and, while it seemedgenerally agreed that an autumn increase in pensions could not be financed by an increase in contributions, even that course wouldinvolve an increased charge on the Exchequer of some 10- 15 millions during the remaining part of the financial year. Inthe Chancellors view the earliest date for which the Governmentshould contemplate a pensions increase was April 1961 when it could appropriately be financed by increased contributions; but, if therewere any question that the legislation required to effect an increase from that date might lead to a postponement of the new pensions scheme, he would prefer to postpone it until after the introduction ofthat scheme. He must, moreover, warn the Cabinet that the increasing cost of the National Health Service was likely to make itimpossible to avoid an increase in the health service contribution inthe following spring or even sooner.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat the arguments against effecting any pension increase before april 196.1 were decisive. There had been a material increase in thegeneral standard of living since the last pension increase in January1958, but the Election pledge had contained no specific commitment on either the timing or the amount of a pension increase and there hadbeen no increase in the cost of living such as would justify an earlymove. Pressure for an increase before the following spring would doubtless become embarrassing, but in the last resort it might bepossible to anticipate a general increase in pensions by an increase inthe scale rates of national assistance, the effect of which would be to benefit those whose need was greatest. If legislation for a pensionincrease was to be introduced in the following autumn it would benecessary to make progress with drafting a Bill during the summer
SECRET - 7.C.C. 30 (60)and for this purpose to reach a decision on the form, if not the actualamount, of the increase, e.g., whether there should be differential ratesof pension for the older pensioners.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that legislation to increase retirement pensions shouldnot be introduced before the summer recess.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for the social services Committee to give further consideration to theform which a future pension increase might take.(3) Invited the Minister of Pensions thereafter to arrange for thepreparation of a Bill; and in due course to consult theSocial Services Committee on the timing of any announce-ment on the introduction of the Bill.(4) Invited the Minister of Pensions to consult the Social services committee on the wording of his report on the adequacy of current benefits, following the Government Actuary&apos;squinquennial review of the national insurance scheme.commercial policy.(previous references:C.C. (60) 28thConclusions,Minute 6 andC.C. (60) 16thConclusions,Minute 2.)Japan.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 78) suggesting the course to befollowed in negotiations for a commercial treaty with Japan.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Cabinet had authorised the President of the Board of Trade to resume negotiationswith Japan for a commercial treaty which would remove quantitative restrictions on Japanese exports to the United Kingdom, subject tothe safeguards that we should maintain restrictions on certain sensitiveproducts and retain the right to reimpose restrictions on other products if necessary. Our negotiators were in Tokyo and the talkswere already due to start. The President had suggested that theyshould tell the Japanese that we were ready to consider the terms of atreaty on the understanding that we would maintain restrictions onthe goods listed in Annex A to C. (60) 78. He would leave it to theJapanese to infer that the goods listed in Annex B, which were at present subject to restrictions, would be freed.If it became necessary to go further in order to secure asatisfactory agreement, the President thought we might have toconsider reducing or abolishing over a period the restrictions on someof the goods listed in Annex A. On the other hand, the economic policy Committee thought that canned pilchards, ships and boats, andclocks (all in Annex B) were sensitive items, and the President had undertaken to consider adding these to the list in Annex A if itappeared that the terms we were likely to obtain would not be entirely satisfactory. The President would keep the Cabinet informed aboutthe progress of negotiations and they would be able to consider theproposed agreement as a whole before any commitments were accepted.In discussion it was suggested that, since we were committedinternationally to placing our trade relations with the rest of the free world on a non-discriminatory basis, the Japanese might consider thatthe list in Annex A (which accounted for items making up half oftheir export trade) was too wide and tantamount to continueddiscrimination. On the other hand, they probably attached importance on political grounds to the conclusion of a treaty and theymight, therefore, be willing to pay this price. In the negotiations itwould certainly not be wise to adopt any more forthcoming position,at least until we were clear what restrictions the Japanese proposed toremove on our exports to Japan.   Tactically it might even be

The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.It was pointed out that, in order to meet the Parliamentary time-table, it was very desirable that the legislation consequent on theproposal that Ghana should remain in the Commonwealth afterbecoming a republic on 1st July should be introduced in the UnitedKingdom Parliament without delay. If, as was expected, the Meetingof Commonwealth Prime Ministers were to decide later that day thatGhana should remain in the Commonwealth as a republic, it wouldbe necessary for an announcement of this decision to be made publicimmediately., . preferable to include all sensitive items in our original list and tomake reductions only in return for worthwhile concessions.During the past year the value of Japanese exports to the UnitedKingdom had been  43 millions and that of her imports from usbetween  32- 35 millions. On political grounds it was important tomaintain Japan&apos;s position as part of the free world, and the extensionof trade between the two countries might be a significant factor forthis purpose. The terms of any agreement should, however, offer theprospect of significant economic advantages for the United Kingdom.Particular attention should be paid to safeguarding the position ofindustries manufacturing small items, such as clocks, and furtherconsideration might be given to the retention of import controls on non-transistorised radio and television apparatus and gramophones.We should recognise, however, that the addition to the listin Annex A of the items which the Economic Policy Committee felt to be sensitive might mean that two-thirds of the products exportedby Japan were subject to discrimination.Summing up the Prime Minister said that careful attention shouldbe paid to the way in which the negotiations with the Japanese were opened. There was a danger that if the talks were not going well itwould not be practicable to add to the list of sensitive items at a later stage; in any event, it would be desirable at the outset to concentrateas far as possible on the idea that both parties would provide a general indication of the concessions they would be prepared to consider.This was not a matter which need be hurried, and it might be to our advantage to learn the outcome of the commercial discussions whichthe Japanese were already holding with the Americans and the canadians. These factors should be taken into account in startingnegotiations on the basis suggested by the President of the Board ofTrade. The Cabinet should be kept informed of all significantdevelopments and should be consulted before any binding commit-ments were undertaken.The Cabinet-Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to open negotiations for a commercial treaty with Japan, as proposedin C.

Meeting of heads ofGovernment,1960.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.They also considered alternative forms of a Governmentamendment to a Private Member&apos;s Motion, due to be debated on20th May, calling for an immediate and substantial increase in old age pensions. They agreed that the amendment should draw attention to the improvements effected since 1951 and should express the confidence of the House that the continued sound management of the national economy would enable pensioners to share in thecountry&apos;s increasing prosperity.It was proposed that the House should adjourn for the whitsun recess on 3rd June.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Housing and Local Government (C. (60) 82) about the redevelopment of a site on the north side of Piccadilly Circus.C.C. (59) 60th. The Minister of Housing said that the proposal for theConclusions, redevelopment of this site had attracted much unfavourable attentionMinute 9.) and, with the Cabinefs approval, he had called the case in for decision by himself. After a public enquiry he had concluded thatthe proposal must be rejected, on the ground that the design of theproposed building was not architecturally satisfactory in relation tothe site and to the Circus as a whole. He proposed to discuss withthe London County Council, as planning authority, the possibilitiesof formulating a comprehensive plan to which developers of this andother sites in the Circus would be asked to conform.Discussion showed that there was general support in the cabinet for the Ministefs proposals. The formulation of a comprehensive plan might provide an opportunity to demonstrate in PiccadillyCircus the advantages of segregating pedestrian and vehicular traffic,and this should be discussed with the London County Council.PiccadillyCircus.(previous reference:1. The Cabinet took note of the attitude which Mr. Khrushchevhad taken up at the outset of the Summit Meeting in Paris on theprevious day. In a preliminary statement about reconnaissance flights by United States aircraft over Soviet territory, he had askedfor an expression of regret that these flights had been undertaken,an undertaking that those responsible would be brought to account and an assurance that no further flights of this kind would be made.President Eisenhower had said, in reply, that there would be nofurther flights of this kind while he was President. Mr. Khrushchevhad not, however, been satisfied with this and had said that he wouldnot be willing to proceed with the conference unless his two other points were met. The Prime Minister had been active during theprevious day in seeking means by which the business of the Meetingcould be commenced; but, according to the latest information,Mr. Khrushchev was still threatening to leave Paris unless his initialdemands were met in full. He had suggested that in presentcircumstances it would be better if the Meeting were now postponed until after the Presidential Election in the United States.The Cabinet took note of this situation and invited the HomeSecretary to send to the Prime Minister on their behalf an assurance of their support for his efforts to find a way out of the difficultiescreated by Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s initial statement.
Meanwhile it should be possible to give to the developers of thisparticular site a general indication of the type of development whichwas likely to conform to the comprehensive plan.The Cabinet Approved the proposals put forward in C. (60) 82 on the redevelopment of Piccadilly Circus.commercial policy.relaxation of import restrictions.(Previous.Reference:C.C. (60) 2ndConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (60) 83) on the relaxation of import restrictions.The President of the Board of Trade recalled that, when theyhad last discussed this question on 18th January, the Cabinet hadenvisaged that a further step would be taken in the spring by relaxing the restrictions on imports of milk, dye-stuffs and canned fruit. TheUnited States authorities were already pressing for early action inrespect of canned fruit, and this pressure would probably be intensified during his forthcoming visit to the United States. Therewere in fact no economic grounds on which we could justifycontinuance of these restrictions in respect of canned fruit. On theother hand, there were powerful political arguments in favour offurther delay. Apart from the general argument that such action might appear inconsistent with the steps we had recently taken to restrain internal demand, a number of difficult issues had arisen inour economic relations with the United States. We had reason to bedissatisfied with their attitude over shipping, the wool tariff and our economic relations with Europe. For all these reasons this was not an appropriate moment at which to promise further relaxation of restrictions on dollar imports. He therefore proposed that no suchaction should be taken at the present time and that, if he were pressed on this point during his visit to the United States, he should take theline that, when we were in a position to undertake further relaxations,canned fruit would be among the first of the products with which weshould deal.In discussion the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said thatthis response would be disappointing to the Americans and mighttend to worsen Anglo-American relations on economic questionsgenerally. It was however the general feeling of the Cabinet that itwould be inexpedient at the present time to make any further relaxation of the remaining restrictions against dollar imports.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that there should be no further relaxation of restrictions on dollar imports at the present time.(2) Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to say, during his forthcoming visit to North America, that when wewere in a position to take further action of this kindcanned fruit would be among the first of the products inrespect of which existing restrictions would be relaxed.Commercial 5.   The Commonwealth Secretary said that the price of butterPolicy. had been falling in the United Kingdom and that the New ZealandButter. and Australian authorities had urged that the Polish butter quota,0?previous which in the special circumstances of 1959 had been fixed at 20,000Reference: tons a year, should be substantially reduced in the second half ofC.C.

He considered that our relations with New Zealand and conclusions, Australia might suffer if, in the course of the Polish trade discussionsMinute 3.) now starting in London, a quota larger than 7,000 tons were offered to the Poles for the second half of the current year.  He recognised
CC. 31 (60)the industrial advantages that would flow from the successful conclusion of negotiations with the Poles and the difficulty of restricting imports from the countries of the European Free trade association; but in the long term it was important for our ownexport trade to retain the goodwill of Commonwealth customers and,if prices continued to fall, we could not ease the position for Australiaand New Zealand without placing some restriction on imports from poland.The President of the Board of Trade said that the Poles had justagreed to resume negotiations for a trade agreement on the basis ofan assurance that the cut in their bacon quota would be restored.They had asked for an annual butter quota of 22,000 tons; and theywould have good cause to complain if, after what we had done onbacon, we now reduced this below the current level of 20,000 tons.The chance of increasing our exports of manufactured goods to poland would be seriously prejudiced and, since Polish butter formedabout only 5 per cent, of the total supplies to the United Kingdom,any reduction of the quota could produce only a marginal benefit for New Zealand and Australia. If negotiations with the Poles wereto break down on this issue the Government would be exposed tosevere criticism from industrial producers.In discussion it was suggested that, if the price of butter were to fall throughout the remainder of the year and in 1961, efforts couldbe made to seek the co-operation of the countries of the european free Trade Association in avoiding excessive imports that would be detrimental to producers in New Zealand and Australia. Futurelevels of prices and supplies were difficult to forecast, but there wasa danger that excessive stocks might accumulate over the next12 months. It might therefore be expedient to inform the Poles thatthe special addition of 5,000 tons made in 1959 to the basic annualquota of 15,000 tons could not be continued indefinitely, but thatwe would accept a quota (equivalent to the actual level of deliveries in the last six months) of 17,000 tons for the period of 12 months from July 1960 onwards. On the other hand, though a reduction of only 3,000 tons in our total butter imports of about 450,000 tons ayear would be unlikely to prevent a general fall in the price of butter,any proposal to reduce the Polish quota at this stage would seriouslyimpair the prospect of making a new trade agreement with Poland.The Cabinet, in considering the bacon quota, had recognised theimportance of offering the prospect of a stable import trade for areasonable period, and it could be expected that the Poles would react adversely to any suggestion that the current level of butterimports could not be maintained for the next 12 months.Summing up, the Home Secretary said that, in view of theimportance of the current trade talks with the Poles, the balance ofadvantage appeared to lie in adopting a quota of 20,000 tons for imports of Polish butter for the 12 months to the end of June 1961.This should be done in a manner which did not pre-judge decisions about the future level of supplies and it should be made clear to thePolish negotiators that no commitment could be accepted for thelevel of butter imports after July 1961.The Cabinet-Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrange forthe Polish authorities conducting negotiations for a trade agreement with the United Kingdom to be informed thatthe quota for imports of Polish butter would be fixed at20,000 tons for the period from July 1960 to June 1961, butthat the level of imports thereafter would be determined inthe light of the general supply situation.
6. The Cabinet were informed that good progress had beenmade in the discussions on the question of Finland&apos;s association withthe European Free Trade Association. The Finns were anxious tofind a form of association, short of membership; they had asked forno concessions on agriculture; and all but one of the difficultieswhich had arisen in the negotiations were likely to be resolved before or at the forthcoming meeting of the Association in Lisbon. Theone major difficulty arose from Finland&apos;s most-favoured-nationobligations to the Soviet Union. Finland could not in practicerange herself with the Association unless she were able to discriminate against the Soviet Union. It was not yet known whether she wouldbe willing, or able, to reach an understanding with the Soviet union which would enable her to do this.In discussion the question was raised whether the interests of paper manufacturers in the United Kingdom would be prejudicedif Finland ranged herself with the Association. The President of theBoard of Trade said that, while there might be some small net increase in imports into this country, the main effect would be toreduce the volume of imports from other Scandinavian countries.The Cabinet-Agreed that, if Finland were able to give satisfactoryundertakings about her most-favoured-nation obligations tothe Soviet Union, the United Kingdom representatives atthe Lisbon meeting of the European Free Trade Associationshould support Finland&apos;s association with the organisation;and authorised them to initial an agreement for thatpurpose.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary on relations with Kuwait (C. (60) 81).The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that under the exclusive Agreement of 1899 the United Kingdom Government was responsible for the external affairs of Kuwait and had jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners there. The Agreement was stillin existence, but it no longer reflected the actual position or theinternational status which Kuwait was now assuming. While weshould not take the initiative in seeking a modification of the Agree-ment, it was desirable that, if the Ruler himself raised the matter, ourlocal representatives should be able to say that the United KingdomGovernment would be ready to consider revising the Agreement.There was at present no indication that the Ruler wished to makeany such proposal and consideration of the form of a new agreement could be deferred until the circumstances prevailing at the time were known.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that we should refrain from taking the initiative in suggestingany modification of the 1899 Agreement. It was also felt to be unnecessary to authorise our representatives in the area to say atonce, if the Ruler raised the matter, that the United Kingdom wouldbe ready to modify the Agreement. The initial reply could be restricted to an expression of sympathetic interest and an undertaking to refer his request to London. The manner in which any negotiations were conducted and the form of a new Agreement wouldbe a matter for decision by the Cabinet at the time.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to arrangefor the United Kingdom authorities in the Persian Gulf tobe instructed that, in response to any request from the Rulerof Kuwait for the modification of the Agreement of 1899,they should undertake to refer the request to the UnitedKingdom Government for consideration.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,\17th May, 1960.Decimal 8.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCoinage.        Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 76) on the possible introductionof a decimal coinage.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a committeeappointed by the British Association had recently recommended theadoption of a decimal system of coinage, for which there was said tobe fairly widespread support in trading and professional circles. TheGovernment would be expected to give an early indication of theirattitude to this report. It might be desirable also to indicate the government&apos;s view on the question whether a decimal coinage, if adopted, should be based on a unit of 10 shillings or of a pound.While the former would be more convenient, its probable effect onthe status and stability of our currency was such that a unit ofone pound was to be preferred.In discussion it was generally agreed that, while theGovernment should not at present imply general approval for thedecimal system by welcoming the committee&apos;s report, they could appropriately announce that they would welcome public discussionof it. The announcement should, in addition, point out the difficultyof the choice between 10 shillings and a pound as the unit on whicha decimal system should be based.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to submit to thePrime Minister a draft statement on the lines agreed in their discussion on the possible introduction of a system ofdecimal coinage.

The Home Secretary said that the report of the committee under Lord Simonds on the powers of subpoena of disciplinarytribunals had been published on the previous day. The reportrecommended that disciplinary tribunals established by statute forthe various professions should be empowered to secure the issue ofwrits of subpoena for the production, subject to all proper exceptions,of evidence obtained by police officers in the course of their duty.These recommendations were to be considered later that day by theHome Affairs Committee. If they were accepted, this would involve further amendment in the House of Lords of the ProfessionsSupplementary to Medicine Bill, which had previously been amended to deprive the tribunals established under it of the statutory powerof subpoena.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Home Secretary.Meeting of heads ofGovernment,1960.(previous reference:CC. (60) 31stConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the statement which he proposed to make to Parliament that day about the summit meeting. This described briefly the discussions and events whichhad taken place in Paris, which were fully set out in a White Paper tobe laid before Parliament, and it explained that it was too early todecide whether the Soviet Government had deliberately decided to pursue a more aggressive policy. In this situation it was necessaryfor the West to continue to work for satisfactory settlements ofinternational problems by negotiation, but at the same time to beready to meet new threats with firmness. The purpose of thestatement was to try to keep a balance between unjustified optimismand extreme cynicism as regards the prospects for any futurenegotiations with the Soviet Government.It had to be admitted that the reconnaissance flights by UnitedStates aircraft over Soviet territory, and the United states government public endorsement of this policy, had createddifficulties for the Soviet Government. It was at present impossibleto say to what extent Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s attitude in Paris had been due to internal criticism, particularly on account of the implications of the American flights for Soviet defence policy. It seemed likely that Mr. Khrushchev had not taken a final decision until the eve ofthe meeting, but it then became clear that he was determined to avoidgenuine negotiations. He must have known that the conditions whichhe had put forward could not be accepted by President Eisenhower.In a sense this had been fortunate, since President Eisenhower wouldhave been put in a difficult position if Mr. Khrushchev had askedonly for a vague expression of regret.It could be argued that, in the difficult atmosphere which had developed in Paris, it would not in any case have been possible tomake satisfactory progress in any negotiations, and that the Westmight have been led in consequence into taking up an unnecessarilyrigid position about the Berlin question. In fact, if the SovietGovernment still entertained the possibility of negotiations at some future date, they might not bring the Berlin issue to a head; in that event we should in practice have secured some period of delay over this issue, which was what we wanted. On the other hand, we hadto face the possibility that the Soviet Government might sign anearly peace treaty with East Germany, and that there might beinterference with the Allies&apos; rights in West Berlin.One good result of the meetings in Paris was that there had beena further improvement in relations between the Governments of theUnited Kingdom and France. Also, the three Western governments were becoming considerably more realistic in their attitude towardsthe Berlin problem, and this had been achieved without the United
Kingdom&apos;s coming under suspicion of weakness on this issue.Furthermore, the need to consolidate the Western Alliance might provide a better opportunity for a satisfactory settlement of theproblem of our economic relations with Europe. Arrangements wereto be made for closer consultation between the Governments of theUnited Kingdom, the United States and France; and this might lead the French Government to be more favourable towards an accommodation between the European Economic Community andthe European Free Trade Association. In certain respects, therefore,the outcome might be helpful. Nevertheless, the failure of the summit meeting was a serious setback to the Governmenfs policyand was bound to be a shock to public opinion.The Foreign Secretary said that it was due to the Prime Ministerspersonal efforts that the meetings in Paris had ended without damage to the Western Alliance. It had been necessary, from the point ofview of public opinion, for President Eisenhower to give an assurance that there would be no further reconnaissance nights by United states aircraft over Soviet territory, and this had been achieved by thePrime Ministers persuasion. It had also been necessary to resist theintention of the United States and French Governments to bring the meetings to an end prematurely.The plan which Mr. Khrushchev had pursued in Paris had enabled him to leave it open either to revert to the settlement ofinternational problems by negotiation, or to pursue a more aggressivepolicy in the future, as he thought fit. In these circumstances weshould not take any action to intensify the cold war atmosphere andwe should be ready to take any opportunity of resuming or continuinggenuine negotiations. Although, from his discussions withMr. Gromyko, it looked as though the Soviet Government no longerhoped for any progress in the disarmament meetings, there were stillreasonably good prospects for the conference at Geneva on nuclear tests. The meeting on the previous day of the Permanent Councilof the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation had taken place in a spiritof consolidation. In this connexion it was satisfactory that it had now been established that any decisions which the three western governments might take in response to a threat against their rights in West Berlin would be the subject of full consultation with theother members of the North Atlantic Alliance.Discussion showed that it was the unanimous view of the Cabinetthat the immediate aim should be to seek to keep a balance betweenpessimism at the failure of the Summit meeting and optimism aboutthe possibility of resuming negotiations.In further discussion it was pointed out that we had not yet beenable to work out a satisfactory plan for an economic accommodationbetween the European Economic Community and the European free trade Association. The present circumstances, however, might makeit possible to consider solutions which would not otherwise have beenacceptable to the United States. It was also suggested that it mightbe preferable to establish closer economic relations with Europe onthe basis of specific projects, such as co-operation in civil aviation orin atomic energy. The Foreign Secretary said that the French ForeignMinister had expressed the view that both the Community and theAssociation might agree to make mutual tariff concessions affectingsensitive items, and in this way might move towards some kind ofindustrial common market covering both groups.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of these statements by the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,20th May, I960.

2. The Foreign Secretary said that the Soviet representative atthe Geneva Conference on Nuclear Tests had indicated that it wouldbe several days before he could make any further statement, and it seemed likely that the Soviet Government were reviewing theirpolicy in the light of the failure of the Summit meeting. There was,however, reason to believe that the United States Government,despite opposition from powerful sections of American opinion,would continue to work for an agreement at this Conference; and itwas to be hoped that further progress towards this would be made.The prospects of the Disarmament Conference were, however,more doubtful. No progress was being made at present; and therewas some danger that, if the Conference continued, substantialdifferences of opinion between the Western Powers would be revealed.If these differences could be resolved, it would probably be preferableon balance to allow the Conference to remain in being, even though no real progress would be made. But if the views of the UnitedStates and French Governments on disarmament could not be reconciled, it might be necessary to ascertain privately from theSoviet Government whether they would agree that the conference should be adjourned.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Disarmament(previous reference:C.C. (60) 27thConclusions,Minute 2.)Indonesia.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 17thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignOffice (C. (60) 85) about the supply of ships and aircraft to Indonesia.The Foreign Secretary recalled that the Defence Committee had previously agreed that negotiations might take place for the sale to indonesia of small patrol vessels and unarmed Shackleton aircraft,but that as regards the supply of destroyers it would be necessary first to obtain the views of the Australian Government. The position hadbeen explained to the Prime Minister of Australia, who was content to leave the decision to the judgment of the United KingdomGovernment. But recent developments suggested that it might be preferable to defer action for the time being. The Indonesian government had reacted strongly to the decision of the dutch government to send an aircraft carrier and other reinforcements to new Guinea, and it seemed unwise at this time to introduce additionalarmaments to the area. Moreover, the Dutch Government had made certain enquiries about purchasing Shackleton aircraft for themselves;and they might abandon this intention if we were now to supplysimilar aircraft to Indonesia.It was, however, desirable to take some other action to improve relations with the Indonesian Government. At present we did littlecommercial trade with Indonesia, largely because we were notprepared to extend export credits for longer than three years. If theperiod of credit could be extended to five years, valuable commercialcontracts could be obtained.57280-^1Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Parliament would adjourn for the Whitsun recess on 3rd june and would reassemble on 20th June.
In discussion it was explained that the Dutch enquiry for thepurchase of Shackleton aircraft was extremely tentative, and could hardly be regarded as a sufficient reason for refraining from sellingsimilar aircraft to Indonesia. Since these aircraft were unarmedand could not easily be used for aggressive purposes, it was not reallynecessary to hold up negotiations for the sale of them to Indonesia.However, it would be essential, in the interests of maintaining good relations with the Dutch Government, whose attitude to our economic problems in Europe had been helpful, to allow sufficient time to explain to them our reasons for proceeding with the sale ofthese aircraft. It was generally agreed that, in the circumstances described by the Foreign Secretary, it would be advisable to postpone the supply of destroyers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in view of Indonesia^large commercial debt, an extension of the present export creditcover of three years would not be justified on economic grounds.He suggested that this question should be examined by the economic policy Committee.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, subject to Conclusion (2), negotiations could take place for the sale of eight unarmed Shackletonaircraft to Indonesia, but that a decision to supplydestroyers should be postponed.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the dutch government of the decision recorded in Conclusion (1).(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theEconomic Policy Committee to consider the question ofcommercial credits for Indonesia.industrial relations.(previous reference:C.C. (57). 52ndConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour (C. (60) 84) proposing discussions with employersand trade unions on problems in the field of industrial relations.The Minister of Labour recalled the pledge given by theGovernment at the time of the General Election that they would&quot; invite the representatives of employers and trade unions to considerafresh with them the human and industrial problems that the next five years would bring &quot;. Now that the last round of wage claimswas almost finished the time was opportune for a move to fulfil this undertaking. Constructive discussion was needed on a number ofindustrial problems such as the absorption of the increasing numberof young people into industry and the methods of training them, theneed for greater mobility of labour and problems of staff managementconsequent on technological developments. While some of these were within the scope of existing consultative bodies, including theNational Productivity Advisory Council for Industry (N.P.A.C.I.) andthe National Joint Advisory Council (N.J.A.C.) these bodies had not always proved effective. A new approach was now required, andthis might most suitably be inaugurated by a meeting of both sides of industry under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister, whichmight result in the formation of a steering committee to plan a seriesof studies by separate groups.Discussion showed that, while there was general agreement thatthe time was ripe for a fresh approach to these problems, there weredifferences of opinion in the Cabinet on the best method of approach.The proposed talks could not be expected to assist the Governmentto find answers to the fundamental economic issues of the day, suchas the problem of maintaining full employment without running intoinflation and balance of payments difficulties. Moreover, unless theywere to go further than discussion of the need for increased
5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (60) 86) about the position of SouthAfrican refugees in the High Commission Territories.The Commonwealth Secretary said that a number of refugees from South Africa, including some known Communists, were atpresent staying in the High Commission Territories. He had authorised the High Commissioner to issue temporary permits to reside in the Territories and none of the refugees had yet hadoccasion to apply for maintenance from official sources. Some ofthem, however, wished to leave the Territories and this would usuallyproductivity and wage restraint, which had been the constant themeof consultations with industry in the past, they were unlikely toproduce worth-while results and might even prove politicallydamaging. There were, however, more limited and concrete problems on which discussion with both sides of industry could be of real value e.g., in addition to those mentioned by the Minister of Labour,the level of profits and their relation to wages and the possibility of ensuring that account was taken of the general economic situationin wage negotiation and arbitration. There were also wider problems arising, for example, from the development of the European free trade Association and the European Common Market and theirrelation to one another on which it would be valuable to secure thesupport of both sides of industry for the Governments policies.But, unless the Government could be assured in advance that bothsides were willing to work seriously and constructively on thesepractical issues, there was a risk that any general meeting preside over by the Prime Minister might lead to anti-climax. It might therefore be better to begin with less formal discussions on a smaller scale, but even these were unlikely to be productive unless theGovernment had already formulated their own views before thediscussions began.Apart from the general economic problems with which indusrty was faced, there would be advantage if some progress could be madeon the problems of the individual worker, e.g., his position in relationto his trade union and the possibilities of a system of contracts ofservice. Technically, it might be preferable to raise these at a later stage, when the Government had gained the confidence of both sides of industry, and this would also give the Government more time to formulate their own plans.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that it wasagreed that the time was ripe for a fresh Government initiative tosecure more effective consultation in industrial relations. before a decision was taken on the best method of achieving this, further thought should be given to the various considerations advanced inthe Cabinet&apos;s discussion. A possible alternative would be for himto preside over a joint meeting of the National Productivity AdvisoryCouncil for Industry and the National Joint Advisory Council, witha view to the appointment of a joint committee to advise how best to put in hand studies of the practical problems with which theGovernment and industry were faced.The Cabinet1 Invited the Minister of Labour to give further thought, inthe light of their discussion, to the proposals put forward in C. (60) 84; and to submit for the Prime Ministersconsideration proposals for a practical plan of action togive effect to them.
involve transit through the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.For this purpose the Government of the Federation would not require that the refugees should hold passports and were willing toaccept travel documents issued by the High Commissioner on behalfof the United Kingdom Government (though not documents issuedby the Government of Ghana, to which some of the refugees wishedto travel). The issue of travel documents on a large scale would almost certainly provoke the Government of the Union to retaliateagainst the Territories or to seek to recover the refugees under theFugitive Offenders Act, 1881. Under this Act, as applied by anOrder-in-Council of 1913, the Union Government could issue a warrant for the arrest of a fugitive for any offence (including apolitical offence) punishable by law in the Union and a magistratein the High Commission Territories could not refuse to return thefugitive unless, in all the circumstances of the case, that would seemunjust or oppressive. On the other hand, public opinion in thiscountry would be hostile to a total refusal to issue any traveldocuments to these people, and there was some reason to thinkthat the Government of the Union would not object strongly to theissue of a limited number over a period of time. Meanwhile, private arrangements had been made by a citizen of Ghana to transporta number of the refugees by charter plane direct to the belgian congo, without landing in the Federation: this was likely to be unwelcome to the Government of the Union and an attempt shouldbe made to persuade the Prime Minister of Ghana to prevent itsrecurrence.Discussion showed that there was general support for theCommonwealth Secretary&apos;s proposals. We should try to dissuadethe Government of the Union from proceeding against any of the refugees under the Fugitive Offenders Act; but, if this proved impossible, a considerable delay in the operation of the Act couldbe secured by arranging for appeals to the Privy Council.Meanwhile, an amendment to the Order-in-Council of 1913 shouldbe prepared, so as to exclude political offences from the scope ofthe relevant part of the Act; but the amendment should not be made,nor the Governmenfs intention announced, unless the Union actuallyinvoked the Act.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in C.

involve transit through the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.For this purpose the Government of the Federation would not require that the refugees should hold passports and were willing toaccept travel documents issued by the High Commissioner on behalfof the United Kingdom Government (though not documents issuedby the Government of Ghana, to which some of the refugees wishedto travel). The issue of travel documents on a large scale would almost certainly provoke the Government of the Union to retaliateagainst the Territories or to seek to recover the refugees under theFugitive Offenders Act, 1881. Under this Act, as applied by anOrder-in-Council of 1913, the Union Government could issue a warrant for the arrest of a fugitive for any offence (including apolitical offence) punishable by law in the Union and a magistratein the High Commission Territories could not refuse to return thefugitive unless, in all the circumstances of the case, that would seemunjust or oppressive.

Law of theSea.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 30thConclusions,Minute 2.)IcelandicFisheryDispute.Germany.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 17thConclusions.Minute 1.)Armaments.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 15thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Minister of Aviation said that German experts who had come to the United Kingdom to examine the possibilities ofco-operation in certain aircraft developments had said that they were under instructions to delay these negotiations on account of theattitude which the United Kingdom authorities were believed to havetaken towards the German application for an amendment of the brussels Treaty which would allow Germany to build destroyers and manufacture influence mines. He had spoken to the german minister of Defence, who had told him that he had received information from Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers in Europe,that it was solely because of British opposition that the Germanrequest had not been approved. He had urged the German Ministerof Defence to instruct his experts to proceed with the negotiationsfor a joint aircraft development project.The Prime Minister said that he was much disturbed at themisrepresentation of our attitude to German rearmament. The fact was that we were acting in close consultation with the French and theother Western European Union Powers in this matter. It would benecessary to investigate the source of this misrepresentation, and tomake it clear to the German Government that our attitude to their request was shared by the French and other Governments. TheGerman request would no doubt have been the subject of discussion by the Foreign Secretary with the French Foreign Minister in washington. A report should be prepared urgently, so that he coulddiscuss the situation with the Foreign Secretary as soon as possible after his return to this country on the following morning.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to arrangefor a report to be prepared, for consideration by the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary on the following morning, on the misrepresentation of the British attitude tothe manufacture of armaments in Germany.1. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that it was now evident that we should be unable by diplomatic methods to persuade the Government of Iceland to join in negotiations for thesettlement of the fisheries dispute. It was, however, important that,in order to restrain the growing impatience of the fishing industry,some contact between the two countries on this question should bemaintained. It therefore seemed advisable to try to arrange for representatives of the fishing industries in the two countries to enterinto discussions of the whole problem. The Government of Icelandwere unlikely to be willing to reach any settlement unless somepressure could be brought to bear on them by their fishing industry.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that the british fishing industry would probably be prepared to join in discussions with the Icelandic industry. It would be particularly useful if tradeunion representatives could play a part, and there were indications that they would be ready to do so.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries andthe Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to try to promotediscussions between representatives of the British andIcelandic fishing industries on the questions outstandingbetween them.
SouthAfrica.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 33rdConclusions,Minute 5.)Proposedboycott byBritishGuiana.atomic energy.CivilProgramme.(previous references:C.C. (59) 64thConclusions,Minute 5 andC.C. (59) 37thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (C. (60) 89) about a proposal by the ExecutiveCouncil of British Guiana to impose a ban on trade with SouthAfrica.The Colonial Secretary said that, despite pressure from theGovernor, Ministers in British Guiana intended to support an opposition motion for a ban on trade with South Africa. It wouldbe open to the Governor to reject the motion, under powers whichwere still in force but were to be relinquished before August 1961.But if the Governor exercised this power, there was a risk that ministers might resign and compel him to resume direct rule. Apolitical crisis on this account in British Guiana might increase therisk that other Colonial territories would take similar action againsttrade with South Africa. Jamaica and Antigua had already imposedsuch a ban, and other West Indian territories were considering similar action. These actions were in breach of the obligations of the UnitedKingdom Government under the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade. On the other hand, if the Governor of British Guianarejected the advice of his Ministers on this question, at a time when itwas known that the power to prevent this action would shortly cometo an end, a deplorable impression would be created not only in that territory but in this and many other countries also. He therefore recommended that in the last resort the Governor of British Guianashould not use his power to reject the recommendation for a ban on trade with South Africa.In discussion it was pointed out that the South african government had protested against the action previously taken byJamaica, and against the fact that the United Kingdom Governmenthad not intervened to prevent the boycott. The Union government might feel obliged to retaliate, especially if a ban by British Guianawere to be followed by similar action by other Colonial territories.Retaliation might easily take the form of economic pressure againstBasutoland, which we should be powerless to relieve.On the other hand it had to be recognised that Colonial territoriesmight be more likely to press for action against trade with SouthAfrica if British Guiana&apos;s attempt to do so were frustrated by theuse of the Governors formal powers. It would be particularlyembarrassing if coercion in British Guiana were to stimulate theGovernment of Nigeria into giving effect to the resolution alreadypassed by the Federal Parliament in favour of a boycott.If, as was virtually certain, the South African Government wereto protest against the boycott which British Guiana Ministersintended to impose, we should have to justify our attitude by referenceto the particular circumstances of that territory, and especially to thefact that the power to prevent a boycott was one which it had alreadybeen decided should be relinquished in the near future. For thispurpose it would be desirable to explain the situation in advance tothe United Kingdom High Commissioner in South Africa.The Cabinet Approved the recommendations in C. (60) 89.4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C. (60) 88) covering a memorandum by the Minister of power, which had been endorsed by the Economic Policy Committee,about the civil nuclear power programme.The Minister of Power said that the original ten-year programmeannounced in 1955 for the development of civil nuclear power hadbeen accelerated in 1957, with the object of providing 5,000-6,000megawatts in commission by the end of 1966. There had since beenchanges in the fuel position, and it was now estimated thatconventional fuel supplies would be adequate for ten to fifteen years,even if no nuclear power stations were ordered in the next few years.The capital costs of nuclear generation had been higher than had
been expected, but the cost of generating nuclear power was nowfalling faster than the cost of generating electricity from conventionalfuels. A nuclear power programme on the 1957 scale was therefore no longer necessary, but it was essential to find out as soon aspossible how to build a fully competitive nuclear power station andto provide for an industry which would in due course be capable of expanding at the necessary rate. It was proposed to spread the nuclear power programme over a longer period, by proceeding at thepresent rate of ordering which was roughly one station a year. Thiswould provide 3,800 megawatts by the end of 1966, and 5,000megawatts in 1968. It would fully maintain the rate of technological development, and would be sufficient to keep three industrialconsortia employed. It would also be sufficient to allow the atomic energy Authority to fulfil their commitment to supply plutonium tothe United States, and in addition there would probably be sufficientmaterial for essential civil research and development needs. Theoutput of plutonium from Calder Hall and Chapelcross would continue to be available for military needs.This re-phasing of the programme would reduce the electricity generating Board&apos;s capital requirements from the Exchequer byabout  90 millions over the next seven years; after allowing for a consequential worsening of the Atomic Energy Authority&apos;s finances of about  20 millions, the net relief to the Exchequer would be about 70 millions. He proposed to announce the re-phasing of theprogramme by means of a statement to Parliament immediately afterthe Whitsun recess.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement that itwould be economic to re-phase the civil nuclear power programme as proposed.The Minister of Aviation said that, although the output ofplutonium from the two military establishments would continue tobe available, our military needs were at present being met partly fromsupplies from civil stations. Under the re-phased programme, thesupplies from civil stations would be needed primarily to meet our commitment to the United States. Our weapons production would therefore be affected. How far this would be significant would depend on a further assessment of our weapons requirements.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, before the re-phasedprogramme could be finally approved, it would be necessary for its effect on our weapons production programme to be considered furtherby the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence. In discussion it was pointed out that, if the programme were to be re-phased, itwould be desirable to inform the United States authorities in advance that this would not affect the supply of plutonium to them. It wasalso suggested that it might be preferable to announce the re-phasing of the programme by means of a White Paper, rather than by astatement to Parliament; the Minister of Power undertook to give further consideration to this point.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence to make an assessment, forconsideration by the Prime Minister, of the effect on the weapons production programme of the re-phasing of thecivil nuclear power programme proposed in C. (60) 88.(2) Subject to the Prime Ministers being satisfied, afterconsultation with the Minister of Defence, that the weapons production programme would not be prejudicedthereby, approved the re-phasing of the civil nuclear power programme.(3) Invited the Minister of Power to consider whether anannouncement should be made by means of a white paper or of a statement to Parliament.
Somali 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignRepublic. Secretary (C. (60) 91) about the admission to membership of the(Previous Commonwealth of the new Somali Republic which was to come intoReferences:      being on 1st July, when Somaliland and Somalia united.CC. (57) 15th , . . ,       r. Jja.....Conclusions, The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the minute 5 and    arguments against admission of the new Somali Republic to theCC. (60) 25th   Commonwealth were very strong.   It would not for many years be conclusions,    a financially viable State but would be dependent on aid, not onlyMinute 2.)       from ourselves but also from the United States and Italy.    Itsadmission to the Commonwealth would, moreover, antagonise the ethiopians, the French and the Italians, the last of whom had made it clear that in that event they would discontinue their financial aid.While there was no evidence of any definite desire on the part of the somalis to join the Commonwealth, it would be embarrassing tohave to refuse a formal request if one should be made; and it wastherefore proposed that the Consul-General at Mogadishu and theGovernor of Hargeisa should be instructed to adopt a discouragingattitude if any informal approach were made to them.In discussion it was suggested that, while admission of the newSomali Republic to the Commonwealth might do something to counter Communist infiltration, the reactions of the ethiopian government, who were already deeply suspicious of our intentions,would be so hostile that they in turn would be likely to become moresubject to Russian influence. In view of the attitude of France andItaly, the balance of advantage therefore lay on the side ofdiscouraging any advances which the Somalis might make, and our intention to do so should be made clear in strict confidence to theother Governments concerned.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (60) 91.Education.(previous reference:CC. (60) 27thConclusions,Minute 6.)Grants toStudents.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Education(C. (60) 92) about the report of the Committee on Grants to Students,under the Chairmanship of Sir Colin Anderson.The Minister of Education said that the report of the AndersonCommittee was to be published that day. The two principalrecommendations were that the means test which at presentdetermined the amount, if any, of awards to students should be abolished; and that, in order to secure uniformity, all candidates whoattained a certain educational standard and were accepted by a university or for a comparable course should receive an award from public funds. These two recommendations would be widelyacceptable to public opinion, although a minority of academic opinion and certain sections of the Press were likely to be opposed to them.These and other issues raised by the report were complicated andwere of considerable political importance to the Government; and itwould not in any event be possible to reach decisions on them untilconsultations had been held with the various interests concerned.Meanwhile, he sought the authority of the Cabinet to his making, inreply to Parliamentary Questions that day, a holding statement on thelines of the draft annexed to his memorandum.In discussion it was recognised that the recommendations of theAnderson Committee had large social implications. They would almost certainly increase the present pressure on university places.The Education Policy Committee, which had already given some preliminary consideration to the Committee&apos;s report, should therefore continue their work on it, but in the meantime there would be noobjection to a Government statement on the lines proposed.
Parliament.Control ofExpenditure.7. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the week beginning 20th June.The Home Secretary said that, as part of the general review whichwas being conducted into the control of Government expenditure,it was proposed, with the agreement of the Chairman of the SelectCommittee on Estimates, that the membership of that Committeeshould be enlarged and that occasions should be provided for theHouse of Commons to debate the Committee&apos;s reports and those ofthe Public Accounts Committee. These proposals would be discussed with the Opposition.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the HomeSecretary.House ofCommons.Members&apos;Pensions.8. The Home Secretary said that he had discussed with theOpposition the possibility of introducing a superannuation schemeto give Members of Parliament pensions as of right. It had beenagreed that the cost of such a scheme put it, at least for the time being,out of the question. It had, however, been suggested that, if theExchequer were to contribute an additional  5-  10,000 a year to theHouse of Commons Members&apos; Fund, it should be possible for the trustees of the Fund to provide, on the basis of a means test, pensions of up to  1,000 for Members who had served not less than twenty-oneyears and were in financial hardship. The Home Secretary proposedthat the Trustees should be invited to discuss a possible scheme onthese lines with Treasury officials and to submit their conclusions tohim.In discussion it was recognised that the figures which had beenput forward would need to be further examined in the light of adviceshortly to be received from the Government Actuary. Subject tothis, the proposed scheme appeared to be acceptable in principle.It was suggested that there might be a case for extending thescheme to Members of the House of Lords who had served also in theHouse of Commons. In reply it was pointed out that, sincemembership of the Upper House terminated only with life, it mightnot be easy to determine the point of time at which a pension should become payable.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a pensions scheme for Members of parliament should be further examined on the lines proposed by theFlome Secretary.C.C. 34 (60)The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Education to make a statement on the report of the Committee on Grants to Students onthe lines of the draft annexed to C. (60) 92.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the EducationPolicy Committee to give further consideration to therecommendations of the Committee and to bring their conclusions before the Cabinet in due course.
House ofCommonsMembers&apos; Fund(previous reference:C.C. (60) 27thConclusions,Minute 5.)The Home Secretary recalled that, at their meeting on 26th April,the Cabinet had decided that the Government should not introduce legislation to extend the investment powers of the Trustees of theMembers&apos; Fund in advance of the Bill proposed for the session of1960-61 on trustee investments generally. The Trustees of the Fundhad, however, continued to press for an extension of their investmentpowers; their latest proposal was for a Private Member&apos;s Bill in thepresent session to empower them to invest up to 50 per cent, of theFund in equities. There seemed very much less objection to this.As Private Members&apos; time was now almost exhausted, it would benecessary to give the Bill Government facilities.The Cabinet (2) Authorised the Home Secretary to arrange for the drafting of a Private Member&apos;s Bill, for introduction in the present session, to empower the Trustees of the House ofCommons Members&apos; Fund to invest up to 50 per cent, ofthe Fund in equities.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,2nd June, 1960.

nuclear weapons(previous reference:CC. (60) 26thConclusions,Minute 1)SKYBOLTThe Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister of Defence(C. (60) 97) on the SKYBOLT missile.The Minister of Defence said that, following the agreement inprinciple which the Prime Minister had reached with president eisenhower in March, he had during his recent visit to Washingtonconcluded a memorandum of understanding with the United states secretary of Defence about SKYBOLT to give effect to our intentionto order this weapon if it were successfully developed in a formsuitable for the Mark 2 V-Bombers of Bomber Command. He nowsought approval for the negotiation of a more detailed technical andfinancial agreement with the United States authorities.There could as yet be no absolute certainty that SKYBOLT,which was hot due to be tested as a complete weapon for about ayear, would be successful and it must be recognised that the americans would not develop it for our use alone. However, theUnited States authorities were confident that it would be effective and they attached importance to it both for their own Air Force and asa means of prolonging the effectiveness of our V-Bombers, whichthey recognised were an important part of the strategic nuclear deterrent. By acquiring 144 missiles, with spares and associatedequipment, we should be able in the later 1960s to maintain with theVulcan Mark 2 bombers a deterrent force equivalent to thatpreviously planned for BLUE STREAK. The Victor Mark 2bombers would not be adapted for SKYBOLT, but could be acomplementary component of the deterrent with a developed version of the British powered-bomb BLUE STEEL, if necessary. It wouldbe in our interests to respond without delay to the American desireto expedite the joint development of SKYBOLT, in order to ensurethat it would be fully compatible with our requirements.On present estimates, the cost of our requirement would be between  76 millions and  115 millions (depending on the unit costof the missile), with a dollar content of up to  108 millions. Weshould have to ensure that the price would be based on the cost ofproduction, without any contribution from us to the underlyingdevelopment costs. We should only be committed to purchase if theprice were on this basis and if the weapon was successful.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he felt therewas a danger that the bomber force itself might have become undulyvulnerable by the time SKYBOLT was available, he recognised that,if the weapon were successful, the proposals of the Minister ofDefence might be the cheapest means of maintaining an effective contribution to the Western deterrent. It was not possible to foreseeat this stage the burden that the dollar costs would ultimately involve,but if this proved excessive our policy might have to be reconsideredat a later stage.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement with thecourse recommended by the Minister of Defence. They were informed that there was a promising prospect that the Vulcan Mark 2aircraft would give longer service than originally planned; and thatno need was foreseen at the present time to order additionalreplacement aircraft of this or another type, such as the VC-10, thatwould add to the cost of the programme.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (60) 97.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, to arrange for instructions to be sentto Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington for theconclusion of a technical and financial agreement withthe United States Government on SKYBOLT.
*The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence (C. (60) 98) on POLARIS.The Minister of Defence recalled that the United StatesGovernment had welcomed the assurance which had been given bythe Prime Minister in the course of his meeting with president eisenhower in March that the United Kingdom Government wouldbe agreeable in principle to making the necessary arrangements fora United States tender and a dock for POLARIS submarines to be stationed in Scottish waters. This project had been pursued in therecent discussions which he had held in Washington with Mr. Gates,the United States Secretary of Defence, who had asked that a formal agreement should be reached in time to enable the United states navy to send a dry dock to Scottish waters early in July and a submarine tender before the end of the year.POLARIS submarines would be virtually invulnerable, and theUnited States authorities regarded them as a very important part ofthe diversified deterrent force which they planned to build up. the operational characteristics of these submarines, which would cruisesubmerged for two or three months, would pose complexcommunications and other problems, and careful organisation wouldbe required to ensure the efficiency and reliability of their crews.The United States Government would welcome our close association with the United States Navy in this development and they hopedthat the United Kingdom Government would feel able to participate,if only on a limited scale, in their POLARIS submarine plans. Theuse of facilities in Scottish waters would enhance the effectiveness of the POLARIS force by about 30 per cent. It had been suggestedthat if we could not meet this request the United States authorities might seek facilities at Bremerhaven, but it was doubtful whetherthey would in fact regard this as a satisfactory alternative.He had explained to Mr. Gates that the project raised important political and defence considerations. In order to justify it to publicopinion in this country it would have to be presented as a joint project.This could be achieved if the United States Government were to give us an option to purchase or build our own POLARIS submarines.These, if we decided at a later date to exercise the option, wouldshare the facilities which the American submarines needed in Scottishwaters. It would also be necessary to make it clear that thePOLARIS submarines which we might obtain in this way would be under the ultimate control of the United Kingdom Government. Inthis connexion it would be necessary to consider carefully the relation of any United Kingdom POLARIS missiles to the Medium RangeBallistic Missile scheme under which the Americans envisaged thatPOLARIS would be deployed in Europe as part of the forces of theNorth Atlantic Alliance&quot; (the NATO M.R.B.M. project).Discussion showed that the Cabinet recognised the importancein principle of missile submarines to the Western retaliatorydeterrent. As the closest partner of the United States in the WesternAlliance, it would be desirable that the United Kingdom should be associated with this form of the diversified deterrent, which was wellsuited to our maritime traditions. It would be desirable that the americans should accept a basis of partnership for the facilities they wished to obtain in Scotland and to agree that we had the right toobtain a force of this sort of our own. We might indicate to theUnited States Government that it would be in their own interest, aswell as ours, for the measures which we hoped to agree with themto be of a nature least likely to provoke hostile criticism in the UnitedKingdom. With this object in mind it would be important to avoiddescribing the facilities as an American base in Scotland. It mightbe found that the facilities we were providing need not, at least
initially, be represented as permanent. If it were practicable, afurther possibility which would enhance the attractiveness of the project would be for the United States Government to pay for theconstruction of some of their own POLARIS submarine hulls in theUnited Kingdom.The Cabinet next considered the question of control ofPOLARIS submarines operating from Scottish waters. It wassuggested that, while the United States Government might agree thatwe should have a veto on the firing of any missiles from submarines in our territorial waters (and possibly within some greater distance from the United Kingdom coast line), they could hardly be expectedto agree that we should share in the control of all firings from theirsubmarines operating from Scottish waters. In practice a satisfactory arrangement might be reached if the POLARIS &quot;submarines were placed under the command of the Supreme Allied CommanderAtlantic (SACLANT) in his capacity as an American officer, and ifofficers of the Royal Navy could be associated with the staffsresponsible for the POLARIS project at SACLANTs Headquarters.This concept would, however, be different from that which theUnited States had proposed for the NATO M.R.B.M. project, underwhich command would be exercised by the Supreme allied commander, Europe (SACEUR) and the United States would retain control of the POLARIS warheads assigned to the North atlantic alliance forces. It was not yet certain that the M.R.B.M. projectwould be accepted by NATO; it was open to objection, bothpolitically and militarily, since it would for the first time placeweapons of a strategic deterrent character under the command ofSACEUR and might lead to their deployment in Western Germany.In further discussion it was agreed that an option for the UnitedKingdom to acquire POLARIS submarines would not involve any commitment for their purchase or for their construction in thiscountry. The total capital cost of three submarines for the UnitedKingdom might be of the order of about  150 millions over aboutnine years. It was suggested that our financial resources would notbe sufficient to permit the United Kingdom to embark on a POLARISas well as a SKYBOLT programme.The Cabinet then considered where the facilities required by theUnited States Navy could most suitably be found in Scotland.Gareloch was favoured by the United States authorities because ofthe accommodation and amenities available in the district and itsproximity to Prestwick airport. But it was generally felt that publicopinion would be critical of any proposal to provide facilities in thedensely populated area of the Clyde and that a more isolated place would also be preferable on security grounds. Subject to furthertechnical examination a suitable alternative might be found at LochLinnhe, near Fort William.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that it wouldbe of advantage to the West as a whole and to our partnership withthe United States if satisfactory arrangements could be made for theUnited States Navy to have facilities for the operation of polaris submarines from Scottish waters. It should be possible to justifythe POLARIS project to public opinion if it could be presented asa joint venture and if, through the option to acquire our ownPOLARIS submarines, we were seen to have the right of joiningfully with the Americans in the operation of a submarine deterrentforce if we so desired. In view of the importance of the issues involved, the Cabinet should consider the matter further on23rd June. It was desirable that an urgent technical study shouldbe made with a view to determining the suitability of Loch Linnheand its acceptability, on safety grounds, to the Atomic energy authority.

Cyprus.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 30thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Foreign Secretary said that agreement had now beenreached with the Greek and Turkish Governments on the terms ofan exchange of letters between the United Kingdom Governmentand the Cypriot leaders on the question of the cession of the Britishsovereign areas in Cyprus in the event of its becoming unnecessary toretain them under British sovereignty. The Greek Governmentwould commend the agreed formula to Archbishop Makarios and,if he accepted it, there might be an early settlement of all outstanding questions. If he rejected it and sought to prolong the negotiations,it would be necessary to convene a conference of the three governments. Unless a comprehensive settlement were reachedquickly, it would not be possible to complete the United Kingdomlegislative processes necessary for the establishment of the republic of Cyprus before Parliament rose for the summer recess.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Europe.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 27thConclusions,Minute 2.)Euratom.2. The Foreign Secretary said that, as a result of a resolution of the Assembly of the Western European Union, explanatory discussions were to be held in London with the Ambassadors of thecountries concerned on the possibility of the United Kingdom&apos;s joiningEuratom. The discussions would be concerned with the questionwhether the Western European Union was the appropriate body toconsider the membership of Euratom, and would seek to identify theproblems involved and the difficulties in the way of our joining. Itwas likely that it would take some time to complete these preliminary discussions.In discussion it was agreed that, in order to avoid any appearance of reluctance on our part, we should try to secure that in the proposed discussions the difficulties were brought out by representatives ofother countries. One particular difficulty was our position in relationto the military agreement on the exchange of atomic information withthe United States and the probability that our joining Euratomwould be unwelcome to the Atomic Energy Commission in washington. It was important to make it clear to our partners in theEuropean Free Trade Association, and to the Press in this country,that these preliminary discussions about the possibility of joiningEuratom did not imply any present intention of applying for membership of the European Common Market.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.EconomicSituation.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 27thConclusions,Minute 7.)*3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that earlier in theyear it had been forecast that the trading surplus in the current year would amount to about  160 millions but that the extent of ouroversea commitments would be likely to lead to a deterioration in the external monetary position of about  200 millions. Since thenimports had increased as expected, but the level of exports had beencomparatively disappointing. Although the exchange rate had so far been maintained, the possibility could not be excluded that there might be a loss of confidence in sterling later in the year. the unfavourable trend in the balance of payments seemed likely to57470-1b 2
continue, and on present policies the trading surplus we might expectover the next few years would fall considerably short of what wasnecessary to meet our external commitments.Internally, there was increasing pressure on labour resources, inexcess of the normal seasonal trend. The cost of living hadfortunately remained steady, though a small increase over the nextfew months was likely. The total of bank advances was stillincreasing, though at a somewhat slower rate. There was a growth in all forms of private investment, and the level of public investmentwas likely to be about  100 millions higher than in the previous year.It was too early to be sure what effect the recent restrictions onhire purchase would have, but it seemed clear that a main factor inthe unsatisfactory growth of exports was the strong competition ofhome demand. The combination of an excessive pressure of home demand, the continued decrease in unemployment, the unsatisfactorytrend of exports and the prospect of greater pressure for higher wagesmade it desirable to consider further remedial action. It was notpossible to improve our prospects by immediate action to limit our external commitments, though the need to adjust investment andexpenditure abroad to our foreign exchange earning capacity mighthave to be faced. It would be necessary to rely on stimulating exports,and on measures to moderate yet further the rate of economic expansion.It would not be appropriate, so soon after the earlier action, toimpose further restrictions on hire purchase, but it would be possibleto increase the incidence of the special deposits scheme to check bankadvances. Bank Rate action was also available. It would also be helpful if an early announcement were made to the effect that public investment expenditure in the coming year would be restricted to thesame level as in the current year.In conclusion the Chancellor said that, although it must remainhis responsibility to decide the nature and timing of any monetaryaction of this sort, he would welcome the views of the Cabinet on thegeneral situation.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It was suggested that special action should be taken to stimulate exports, such as an increase in export loans and guaranteesor even some form of fiscal incentive. In reply it was pointed outthat the existing measures for providing export credits werereasonably flexible, and that our real need was to increase exports forwhich we received prompt payment. Moreover, measures in thenature of export subsidies would be contrary to our general commercial interests. The real trouble was that many firms were still not sufficiently export-minded: unlike their European competitors,they tended to concentrate too much on the easier home market.(b) It was suggested that further restrictions would not in factassist exports, which in many cases depended on a large production for home demand. On the other hand, there was evidence to showthat the increase in the home market had not induced manufacturers to reduce their costs or to devote a sufficient proportion of production for exports.(c) It was pointed out that if further restrictions were notdiscriminatory in character they might aggravate the employment situation in the less prosperous areas. In reply it was argued thatthe additional pressure on resources resulting from industrialdevelopment in the less prosperous areas was by no means confined to those areas. If an overall increase in demand were to be avoided,industrial investment in these areas would have to be balanced by areduction in activity elsewhere.(d) For internal purposes, it might well be desirable to restrict the credit base by increasing the incidence of the special depositsscheme.   Bank advances should now be responsive to this action,
Iron and SteelIndustry.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 9thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 94) about the de-nationalisation of the steel industry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that the Government^remaining holdings in the steel industry were the assets ofRichard Thomas and Baldwins (R.T.B.), the prior charges in anumber of companies already de-nationalised, and a few smallcompanies which, though not easy to sell, were gradually beingdisposed of by the Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency.Following the Cabinefs last discussion of this subject, the Agencyhad prepared a plan for the disposal of the remaining holdings, underwhich it was contemplated that the equity of R.T.B. should be the first to be sold. Since then, however, it had emerged that, in addition tothe loan of  70 millions to be made by the Minister of Power and 40 millions of long-term capital to be provided by the Agency, theprogress of R.T.B.&apos;s expansion programme would require a further 75-80 millions of short-term capital during the period up to the endof 1962. In these circumstances the early sale of the R.T.B. equitywould be open to serious objections, both financial and political.Moreover, there was reason to think that it could be sold on more advantageous terms when the company&apos;s expansion programme had got under way. The Chancellor of the Exchequer therefore proposed,in agreement with the Paymaster-General and the Minister of Power,that the first move should be to sell the prior charges, both in R.T.B.and the companies already de-nationalised, and that  50 millions ofC.C. 36 (60)since in general the proportion of advances to deposits had now-returned to the traditional pre-war pattern. In this connexion it waspointed out that no means had as yet been evolved of controllingcredit available from institutions other than banks. Moreover, anincrease in special deposits would not affect the velocity of the creditcirculation, though Bank Rate action might have some effect for thispurpose.(e) It was argued that Bank Rate action had little effect,psychological or otherwise, on the rate of borrowing and that its main purpose was to fortify external confidence in sterling.(/) It was suggested that the banks should he encouraged to discriminate between applications for credit to a greater extent thanthey did at present. There was no reason why they should not givepreference to applications for credit for productive investment,especially to help exports.The Prime Minister said that either internal inflation or a balanceof payments crisis would be most damaging to the Government andto the nation. Corrective action should be taken in time, if there wasa real need for it. Internally there was undoubtedly pressure on resources. But some felt that the remedial action which had alreadybeen taken had not yet had time to take full effect. Nevertheless, afurther restriction of credit could be achieved by a modest increasein the incidence of the special deposits scheme. At the same time thepossibility of encouraging the banks to discriminate in favour of credit applications for productive purposes should be examined.Bank Rate action should be related primarily to the external situation.It had to be remembered that early action of this sort might make it more difficult to rely again on Bank Rate if this proved necessary toprotect sterling later in the autumn.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take account ofthe views expressed in their discussion.
the additional  75-80 millions required by R.T.B. should also beobtained from the public by the issue of new debentures. The date at which the equity could most advantageously be sold could then bedetermined later. Although the sale of the prior charges wouldinvolve the Exchequer in considerable loss, postponement of theirsale was likely to aggravate that difficulty.Discussion showed that there was general support in the cabinet for this proposal. It would go some way to satisfy government supporters who were pressing for progress in the de-nationalisation of the industry and would not necessarily mean that R.T.B. wouldnot have been de-nationalised by the end of the present Parliament.If, however, a proportion of the securities to be issued by R.T.B.were debentures convertible into ordinary shares after, say, 10 yearsrather than straightforward debentures, they might prove more attractive to investors and this arrangement would at the same timeserve as a demonstration that the Government were determinedfinally to de-nationalise the industry.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Paymaster -General and the Minister of Power,to consider the possibility of arranging for a proportionof the proposed new debentures in Richard Thomas and baldwins to be convertible as suggested in the cabinets discussion.(2) Subject to the consideration referred to in conclusion (1),approved the proposals in C.

ParliamentExpenses ofMembers(previous reference:C.C. (58) 39thConclusions,Minute 2)Housing(previous reference:C.C. (58) 79thConclusions,Minute 6)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Housing (C. (60) 96) on the Governmenfs future housing policy for England and Wales.The Minister of Housing said that it was most desirable that theGovernment should maintain the initiative in housing policy. his first main proposal was to recast present policy on subsidies. Theresult of the existing flat-rate system was that many of the authorities of the large cities used the surplus in their housing accounts, derivedfrom the subsidies still payable on houses built cheaply before thewar, together sometimes with direct contributions from the rates, tomaintain municipal rents at an artificially low level. other authorities notably in the rural and smaller urban areas were obliged to charge rents beyond the means of many potential tenants and were unable to make further progress with their housing programmes without throwing an additional burden on their rates.He therefore proposed that the aggregate amount of Exchequerhousing subsidies, worked out on the present basis, should beredistributed in accordance with the financial position of each authority: those who were following a reasonable rent policy andneeded additional help from the Exchequer would receive it andmight, where appropriate, be able to reduce their rents, while those whose housing accounts were strong would receive reduced subsidies on all future building and would in practice be obliged to raise the rents of their better-off tenants in consequence.The Ministers second main proposal concerned the building ofhouses to let by bodies other than the local authorities. There wasa real need for this as an alternative to municipalisation. discussions with the various interests concerned had shown that little could beexpected from private enterprise, and he therefore proposed that theExchequer should either make or underwrite loans at a relatively low rate of interest to housing trusts or associations who wereprepared to build for letting. Any houses built under such a scheme would count against the public programme and would not add to thetotal investment in housing. At the same time there was a very largenumber of houses owned by small landlords who were unwilling orunable to put and maintain them in proper condition, and onefunction of the housing trusts might be to buy property of this kind,put it into reasonable condition and continue to manage it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he regarded theMinisters proposals on housing subsidies as acceptable in principle and a reasonable basis for detailed discussion. The proposal to lendmoney to housing trusts at less than the market rate of interestinvolved, however, a concealed subsidy and an additionalcommitment on which he must reserve his position.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Home Secretary recalled that in the previous yearrepresentations had been made by the Opposition, advocating carallowances for Members of Parliament in lieu of travel warrants.The Chancellor of the Exchequer had worked out a practical schemebut the Opposition had recently indicated that they no longer felt able to support it, as they considered it could not be made safe fromabuse. In the circumstances the proposal would not be pursued.This could be explained in reply to a Parliamentary Question whichthe Prime Minister was to answer that day.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Home Secretary.
Discussion showed that there was considerable support in theCabinet for the proposals of the Minister of Housing, although doubt was expressed whether, in view of growing demands on the national resources, the payment of housing subsidies at existing levels couldbe justified indefinitely. But the timing of the necessary legislationpresented difficult questions. The Minister of Housing and theChancellor of the Exchequer were about to put forward jointproposals for legislation to effect the complete re-rating of industry as from April 1963. The revaluation of all residential property fromthe same date might result in increases in the rates payable byhouseholders, even taking into account the palliative which there-rating of industry would offer. For technical and administrativereasons the Rating and Valuation Bill must be introduced in the next session if the revaluation were to operate from the date proposed.The effect of the proposed legislation on housing subsidies would bemore immediate than that on rating and valuation, but at the sametime it would be spread over a longer period. If the Housing bill were passed in the session of 1960-61, the consequent gradualincreases in the rent of many municipal tenants would begin to take effect at the end of 1961, would continue throughout 1962 and wouldbe completed by early 1963. If, on the other hand, the Housing bill were deferred until 1961-62, its effect would fall on municipal tenantsconcurrently with increases in the rates they had to pay. There wastherefore a strong case for legislating in 1960-61, although it must berecognised that the provisional programme for that session was already heavily loaded and it might be difficult to accommodate boththe Housing Bill and the Rating and Valuation Bill.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that theproposals for a redistribution of housing subsidies were generally acceptable to the Cabinet, although much work remained to be doneon the details. Some means should also be found, in addition to thefacilities for purchase for owner-occupation provided under theHousing Act of 1959, to check the deterioration of many houses letby small landlords; and an effort should be made to devise some alternative to municipalisation which would be both effective andacceptable to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Further thought was required also on the timing of the legislation on housing subsidies inrelation to that proposed on rating and valuation.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for acommittee of Ministers to give further consideration to theGovernment^ future housing policy, particularly in relationto the system of Exchequer subsidies and the building ofhouses to let; to their policy on rating and valuation; andto the content and timing of any necessary legislation onthese subjects.Legislative 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeProgramme:     Secretary (C. (60) 93) outlining a programme of legislation for1961 and        1960-61 and the two subsequent sessions.Later SessionsThe Home Secretary said that, in addition to preparing a detailed programme of Bills to be introduced in the following session,the Future Legislation Committee had formulated the broad outlinesof a provisional plan for the sessions of 1961-62 and 1962-63. Whilegeneral approval of this forward plan at the present stage would not,of course, preclude subsequent variation, it would assist in the orderlypreparation and handling of the Governments legislative businessthroughout the greater part of the Parliament. The plan, if carried through, would represent a reasonable achievement and was givencohesion by a number of recognisable themes running through it,such as social and moral reform, reform of financial institutions and
CC. 37 (60)commercial practice, improvement of the transport system and improvement of the criminal and civil law and its administration.The plan as presented was not intended to be exhaustive: forexample, the reorganisation of the nationalised industries might berepresented in 1960-61 by a Bill to deal with the railways and in thefollowing session by one on the coal industry. Any furthersuggestions to add interest to the programme would be welcomed.The detailed programme formulated by the Committee for1960-61 almost certainly contained more material than could be handled in the time available, and further reductions might thereforebe necessary when it was reviewed later in the year. Meanwhile,however, Ministers responsible for the Bills included in it should seekat the earliest possible date whatever policy decisions were necessary,in order that preparation of the Bills might proceed without delay.Discussion showed that the proposed pattern of legislation inthe following three sessions was generally acceptable to the Cabinet,although it was open to question whether a Bill on so controversiala subject as Sunday observance would be appropriate as late as1962-63.In discussion of the detailed programme for 1960-61 thefollowing points were made:(a) The Bill conferring independence on Sierra Leone should betransferred to the list of essential Bills (A.1), since a date for independence had now been agreed.(b) It would be necessary to include in the Governments ownprogramme the Bill to give effect to the recommendations of thePeppiatt Committee on a levy on betting on horse-racing, which ithad earlier been suggested might be prepared for introduction by aPrivate Member.(c) It was already possible to suggest some reductions in the lists of programme Bills. That on Reserve Forces was now unlikely to berequired. Legislation to change the financial structure of theNational Health Service was unlikely to be ready and, if an increasein the weekly Health Service contribution became necessary, it mightbe possible to effect this in the Finance Bill. Unless it could be demonstrated that deferment of the Trunk Roads Bill wouldsignificantly delay the acquisition of land for the roads programme,it should be deferred until a later session.(d) There would be advantage in adding the Patents(Amendment) Bill to the programme.(e) It was unfortunate that time could not be found for a Bill on school-leaving dates, on which it was hoped that agreement wouldbe reached with the two sides of industry.(f) It had now become apparent that the Social Workers&apos; Bill,which had been proposed for introduction by a Private Member,would not be suitable for that purpose; and a place should, ifpossible, be found for it in the programme for 1961-62.(g) The Crown Estate Commissioners must be expected to protest at the deferment of their Bill, but there was no hope thattime could be found for it in the next session.(h) The Scottish legislation would so far as possible be dealt withby the Scottish Grand Committee. The Flooding (Scotland) Billshould be included in the programme if time could be found for it;and the Local Authorities (Contributions to Charities) (Scotland)Bill, previously regarded as a possible subject for a Private Member,should now be included in the Governments programme for 1960-61or a later session. It might be possible to combine the Bills on pensions for Sheriffs in Scotland and for Judicial Officers in Englandand Wales.
nuclear weapons(previous reference:C.C. (60) 35thConclusions)POLARIS*4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the suggestionthat facilities should be provided for United States polaris submarines in Scottish waters.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet should first considerwhether the United States request should, in principle, be met. If so,it would then be necessary to consider whether it should be made acondition that the United States Navy should accept facilities atLoch Linnhe and not, as they had originally proposed, in the Clydearea; and whether our agreement should be conditional on ourobtaining the right to purchase or manufacture polaris submarines and missiles of our own. It would also be necessary toconsider the relation of this project to the requirement of theSupreme Allied Commander, Europe (SACEUR) for medium-rangeballistic missiles to be deployed in Europe as part of the forces of theNorth Atlantic Alliance&quot; (the NATO M.R.B.M. project).The Minister of Defence said that, on reflection, he doubted whether it would be possible to represent the facilities which theUnited States Navy required as temporary, particularly if thearrangements were to be presented as a partnership project. It wasalso doubtful whether we should suggest that some of the UnitedStates POLARIS submarine hulls might be constructed in the UnitedKingdom, since the United States authorities would feel that Britishshipyards could not offer the facilities or the security which theycould obtain in their own country.The Minister of Defence also informed the Cabinet that theChiefs of Staff had been kept fully informed of his proposals and werein agreement with them.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that a technicalexamination had now established that Loch Linnhe was suitable forthe provision of the necessary facilities for POLARIS submarines,although it had not the logistic or amenity advantages of the Clydearea. The Atomic Energy Authority were satisfied that Loch Linnhewould be acceptable from the point of view of safety.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was in favour ofthis project, so long as it was understood that at the present stagewe were not seeking more than an option to purchase or manufacturePOLARIS submarines. If in due course it were decided to exercisethat option, it would be greatly preferable that the submarines shouldbe built in this country. He was increasingly doubtful whether wecould afford to finance both the SKYBOLT and the POLARISprojects, and we certainly could not afford to provide both at thesame time. The way in which it was proposed to relate this projectto the NATO M.R.B.M. project was acceptable to him, since it didnot involve any commitment for further expenditure on the latter.If in the future it became necessary to undertake expenditure onaccount of the latter, some compensating saving would have to befound elsewhere.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) It should be made clear to the United States authorities thatthe POLARIS submarine project, even if it were presented as apartnership between the two Governments, would involve great political difficulties. It would be desirable, for presentationalpurposes, to minimise the scale of the facilities to be provided.

4 PBritishTransportCommissionRailwayWages(previous reference:C.C. (60) 22ndConclusions,Minute 5)5. The Minister of Transport said that a satisfactory agreement had now been reached with the railway unions that workers in allthe British Transport Commission (B.T.C.) ports, who had shared inthe 5 per cent, interim increase in wages which had already been awarded on account of the recommendations in the Guillebaudreport, should receive a further increase of 2\ per cent.The main question which remained to be settled was the date from which the further wage increases to B.T.C. employees shouldcommence. The railway unions had rejected the proposal that the operative date should be that on which formal agreement would bereached, namely 1st July, and were pressing for retrospection to 1st January, 1960, on the ground that this was the date on whichthe recommendations in the Guillebaud report were based. At their meeting on the previous day the Wages Policy Committee had considered that the B.T.C. should be authorised to offer 2nd March,which was the date on which the Guillebaud report was published;and that, if the unions were to reject this, the Chairman of the B.T.C.should seek further instructions from Ministers. The Chairman had now represented that, in view of the urgent need for a settlement, heshould be informed what earlier date would be acceptable to theGovernment if the unions were to reject 2nd March. He thought there was some chance, though not a strong one, that the unions would accept 2nd March or at least 29th February, which was thebeginning of the pay week in which the Guillebaud report was published. It was not likely that the railway unions would takeofficial strike action on this issue, but if a settlement were not reachedthere would probably be sporadic unofficial strike action and the would also be helpful if the construction of amenities for Americanservicemen&apos;s dependants could be postponed until a later stage.(b) If the President of the United States accepted thearrangements and conditions which the Prime Minister would propose, the next stage would be to embody the arrangements in ageneral memorandum of understanding. A detailed agreement,covering such matters as safety precautions and technical questions,could be left for negotiation later, as also could the despatch of a technical mission to examine the question of our requirements forPOLARIS submarines.(c) It was suggested that the THOR missiles already established in the United Kingdom could, if necessary, be regarded as a specificcontribution to the NATO M.R.B.M. project.(d) It was suggested that, if we were to make these facilities available to the United States authorities, we should at the same timeexplain that the various forms of our present and future contributionto the nuclear power of the West placed a very heavy burden on our economy; and we might urge the United States authorities to considerthe desirability of improving economic and financial relationsbetween the two countries, with a view to ensuring that the economicburden of our defence did not become insupportable. It was thegeneral view of the Cabinet that it might be more appropriate to take up these economic issues separately, at a later stage.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (60) 98.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to inform the President of theUnited States of the arrangements proposed to provide facilities for POLARIS submarines in Scottish waters,taking into account the points mentioned in their discussion.
unions would not willingly co-operate with the B.T.C. in there organisation of the industry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it had always been understood that, having regard to the interim wage increase whichhad already been made, any further increase in implementation ofthe recommendations in the Guillebaud report would not be made retrospective. The cost of retrospection to 2nd March would be nearly  5 millions, and over  7 millions if the increase were back-dated to January. The Chairman of the B.T.C. should make everyeffort to avoid retrospection earlier than 29th February.It was the general view of the Cabinet that every effort shouldbe made to secure a settlement on the basis of retrospection to29th February. Failing that, in view of the need for an early settlement, the Chairman of the B.T.C. should be authorised to reach the best possible settlement, provided that the date for retrospectionwas not earlier than January 1960.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Transport to inform the Chairmanof the British Transport Commission that he should make every effort to secure a settlement on the basis of retrospection to 29th February, but, failing that, he should reach the best settlement he could secure, provided that thedate for retrospection was not earlier than 1st January, I960.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23rd June, 1960.

2. The Cabinet had a brief discussion on the situation resultingfrom the withdrawal of the Soviet delegation from the geneva conference on Disarmament.It was desirable that the Western Powers should take some stepto recover the initiative. Their representatives at Geneva had at first been inclined to favour an immediate meeting of the disarmament commission of the United Nations. This had seemed preferable tothe alternative of waiting for the matter to be taken up at the next meeting of the General Assembly. It was true that it might provokeproposals for the appointment of some new body to consider thedisarmament problem, and this might precipitate discussion of China&apos;sparticipation in the consideration of this problem. On the otherhand it now seemed unlikely that any substantial progress would bemade through the medium of the Ten-Power Committee. meanwhile the position of the United Kingdom Government, had been held bythe Prime Minister^ message to Mr. Khrushchev urging the SovietGovernment to reconsider their decision to withdraw from these discussions.The Cabinet Took note of this situation and of the points made in thediscussion.3. The Cabinet were informed that, if the necessary legislation was to be enacted before the summer recess, the negotiations in cyprus must be brought to a final settlement within the next few days.The only major issue now outstanding was the amount of financial aid to Cyprus. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for theColonies had already offered  10 millions, spread over five years, byway of general aid to the new Republic, plus a grant of  1 million forthe Turkish Cypriots; and he had been authorised to offer a furtherpayment of    million for Nicosia airfield. Archbishop Makarioswas demanding  16 millions for general aid plus a total of  3-44millions comprising the grant to the Turkish Cypriots, the payments for Nicosia airfield, the rehousing of, such of the inhabitants ofAkrotiri as wished to leave the village and the construction of aby-pass road. In order to achieve a settlement, the parliamentary under-Secretary of State now sought authority to offer a general grant of  13 millions (including, if possible,  ^ million for Nicosiaairport and  1J millions for the Turkish Cypriots) plus specificpayments amounting to  -84 million a total of  13-84 millions or,if the grants for the Turkish Cypriots and Nicosia airfield could notbe included within the general grant,  15- 84 millions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had alwaysregarded the retention of military bases in Cyprus as more of a strategic liability than an asset; and he was sorry that we had gotourselves into a position in which we were exposed to the pressureswhich Archbishop Makarios was now applying. He recognised thatat this stage a settlement must be reached. But the figures now underdiscussion were alarming; and he felt obliged to express his disquietat the tendency for countries attaining independence to expectcontinuing financial support from the United Kingdom.The Colonial Secretary said that the grants now envisaged forCyprus were out of scale with the level of assistance which we shouldbe likely to give to other dependent territories which were more. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
deserving of assistance. They could not fail to embarrass him indealing with pending applications from Kenya, Singapore and mauritius.In discussion it was generally agreed that this opportunity of achieving a settlement in Cyprus must not be missed. We could not accept either of the alternatives-to continue to govern the Island,with the risk of renewed violence on a large scale, or to withdraw from it altogether. The problem of Cyprus was more international thanColonial: the objective of our policy in Cyprus over the last few years had been to avoid war in the Eastern Mediterranean. Thisdistinguished Cyprus from other Colonial territories nearingindependence. Even so, it was important that the price which wepaid for a settlement should be no higher than was absolutely necessary.In discussion of the tactics to be followed in the negotiations, anumber of alternatives were considered. It was finally agreed thatthe Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State should be authorised tooffer  12 millions spread over five years by way of general aid andthat he should try to secure agreement that this figure should includethe grant of  1^ millions to the Turkish Cypriots and the paymentof    million for Nicosia airfield. He might offer in addition specificpayments amounting to  -84 million. If he could not achieve asettlement at this figure, he could improve his offer up to a limit of 14-84 millions, but he should not go beyond that figure without seeking further instructions.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the. Colonial Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, todraw up instructions for the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State for the Colonies on the conduct of further negotiations on the amount of financial aid to Cyprus onthe lines approved in their discussion.Broadcasting.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 75thConclusions,Minute 2.)EuropeanTelevision.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C. (60) 99) covering the draft of an international agreement on the protection of television broadcasts in Europe.The Foreign Secretary said that this was a regional agreementprepared under the auspices of the Council of Europe. It would give to the various television companies in Europe the same protection in this country as was enjoyed by the British broadcasting corporation and the Independent Television Authority; and it wouldgrant reciprocal protection to British television broadcasts in european countries. The draft incorporated a number of amendments proposed by the United Kingdom. The Departmentsconcerned and the two British broadcasting authorities considered itsuitable for application in the United Kingdom. If the agreement were signed and ratified on behalf of the United Kingdom, it couldbe brought into force in this country by an Order-in-Council underthe Copyright Act, 1956.The Cabinet-Agreed that the United Kingdom, Government should adhere to this European Agreement for the protection of television broadcasts, and invited the Foreign Secretary toarrange for the agreement to be signed on behalf of theUnited Kingdom Government.
