The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies hadcontrived to avoid a breakdown of his discussions with the Greek and turkish Cypriot representatives, and a certain amount of progress had been made in the negotiations about the size of the sovereignareas. The Turkish Foreign Minister had privately suggested thatthe Turkish Cypriot representative should now put forward a furthercompromise on this point, but this would undoubtedly be premature.The discussions would in any case have to be adjourned on 13th April,to allow Archbishop Makarios to attend to his ecclesiastical duties,but it was proposed that they should be resumed on 20th April.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of State forForeign Affairs.2. The Minister of State for Colonial Affairs said that theresolution calling for immediate steps to bring about independence and union with Somalia on 1st July, 1960, had been passed in theBritish Somaliland Legislative Council, and their meeting had been adjourned until 27th April. A statement on behalf of the Governorin response to this resolution had not yet been made, and theGovernor had repeated his advice that, in order to avoid disturbances,it would be necessary for him to say that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould not oppose independence on 1st July.While it was desirable to avoid a situation in which law andorder could only be preserved with the assistance of British troops,it would not be right to agree now to independence on 1 st July. Wecould not hand over our responsibilities for the government of the protectorate without knowing what arrangements would besubstituted. Moreover, we had to consider the effect on our relationswith the Ethiopian Government of appearing to agree to theindependence of British Somaliland for the purposes of union withSomalia before the latter country had attained independence. Inthese circumstances, the Governor had been informed that the best course would be to encourage representatives from British Somalilandto seek discussions with the Colonial Secretary in London. the elected Ministers had now fallen in with this suggestion, and anannouncement would be made to Parliament that day to the effectthat discussions about the independence of British Somaliland wouldbe held by the Colonial Secretary at the end of April or the beginningof May.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of State for colonial Affairs.3. The Minister of State for Colonial Affairs said that anall-Party delegation from Sierra Leone was to visit this country for constitutional discussions starting on 20th April. The colonial policy Committee recommended that, provided that the discussions were satisfactory as regards defence and financial arrangements, weshould be prepared to agree that Sierra Leone should become fullyindependent towards the end of 1961. It was likely that the sierra leone representatives would welcome the conclusion of a defence agreement containing reciprocal provision for assistance. Our mainstrategic interest was in the anchorage facilities at Freetown, but web 2
also needed certain staging and over-flying rights. As regardsfinance, Sierra Leone would hardly be economically viable unless itwere possible to increase revenue from the diamond industry, by securing more control over smuggling. We might therefore beexpected to provide assistance amounting to about  li millions ayear for perhaps two years after independence. The exact scale ofassistance could not be accurately assessed until nearer the proposeddate of independence, but it would be desirable to indicate in theconstitutional discussions that, in addition to the residual balances of approved Colonial Development and Welfare schemes, other aidby way of Commonwealth assistance loans and technical assistance would be considered.In discussion the following points were made:  -(a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he assumed thatit would not be necessary to subsidise the Sierra LeoneRegiment, and that we should not be asked to make any financial payment in return for defence facilities. Apartfrom the residual balances of Colonial Development and welfare schemes, we should not suggest that assistance might be forthcoming otherwise than as technical assistance or Commonwealth assistance loans.(b) While we might hope to secure our defence requirementswithout financial payment if we concluded a reciprocaldefence agreement, we should consider whether it wouldbe wise to accept a commitment to defend Sierra Leone.We did not in general accept commitments of this kindin Commonwealth countries which became independent,though we envisaged a reciprocal defence agreement withNigeria.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Defence, to circulate, for information, amemorandum describing the defence facilities we requiredin Sierra Leone, and proposing what statements on defence and finance should be made to the Sierra Leonerepresentatives in the forthcoming discussions.road programme.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 18thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretaryof State for Scotland and the Minister of Transport (C. (60) 59and 58) about the road programme.The Minister of Transport said that the density of vehicles permile of road was higher in the United Kingdom than in any other country in the world. The number of vehicles was increasing more rapidly than the road system; and traffic congestion, which was estimated to have cost  250 millions in the previous year, wouldwithin a few years have reached a critical point unless the road system could be extended more rapidly than was envisaged in thepresent programme. He therefore proposed that  1,500 millions should be spent on roads in England and Wales in the next 10 yearsand that within this total the programme for the next five years shouldamount to at least  550 millions and preferably  635 millions ascompared with the  300 millions at present contemplated. The costof this five-year plan could be met from additional revenue from newvehicles which would come into commission during the period,without any additional cost to the Exchequer. The Economic PolicyCommittee had decided that the major policy issues raised by hislong-term proposals the best use of the country&apos;s resources, the inflationary nature of the expenditure proposed and the relationship
of investment in roads to investment in the railways should beconsidered by a group of officials. This work was in progress.Meanwhile, the Minister suggested that, in order to avoid prejudicing the programme for 1961-62 and subsequent years, expenditure in thecurrent year should be increased from  65 millions to  75 millions or,if that could be achieved,  78 millions.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that this problem was at least equally acute in Scotland, where major improvements were needed, not only in the main trunk network serving the industrial areas, but also in the feeder routes and in the roads serving the highlands, which were extensively used by tourists. For Scotlandhe proposed a 10-year programme costing  165 millions, including 68-3 millions in the first five years and he also suggested that expenditure in the current year should be increased from  10-millions to  11 - 3 millions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that expenditureon the road system had steadily increased over recent years and thatthe Estimates for the current year were already 23 per cent, higherthan in the previous year. He would have the greatest difficulty in agreeing to any further increase in expenditure during the current year when, in addition to an unprecedented increase in the SupplyEstimates, decisions already taken would commit the Governmentto further expenditure of some  70- 80 millions not included in theEstimates. He hoped by the end of the following month to havefigures available for a review of capital and current expenditure fromwhich it would be possible to judge whether any additional expenditure on the road system could be justified in 1961-62 and thefollowing years.Discussion showed it to be the general view of the Cabinet that,before any substantial increase in expenditure on roads was agreed,there should be a further analysis of the needs and the proposals tomeet them. First, the most critical traffic congestion was to be foundin the urban areas and it would be necessary to ensure that too higha proportion of the money available was not devoted to theimprovement of communications between, rather than within and around, those areas. Secondly, the Local Employment Act, 1958,was being used to deploy industrial development so as to give as muchrelief as possible to the areas of high unemployment; and the road programme must be directly related to this redeployment if industrialcosts, and therefore competitiveness, were not to be adversely affected.More generally, our balance of payments position made it hardly possible to support both the present increase in private motoring andthe extension of the road system to keep pace with it. From thepoint of view of the national economy, the road programme should therefore be related to the needs of industry rather than to those ofprivate motoring; and expenditure on the roads should not for any length of time be allowed to become disproportionate to government expenditure as a whole or to increases in the gross national product.On the other hand it was argued that an improved road system could be expected to yield dividends through the reduction both ofthe industrial losses consequent on congestion and of the accidentrate. An accelerated programme might be possible if it were, likehousing and school building, financed from loans rather than fromrevenue and consideration should be given to the possibility ofincreasing revenue by an increase in the fees for road fund licences and by some extension of the toll system, which at present applied only to bridges and tunnels.Summing up the discussion, The Prime Minister said that itwould hardly be possible to contemplate any expenditure on roadsduring the current year over and above that already approved. Further
consideration should be given to the long-term programme in relationto the redeployment of industry; and the Cabinet should resume their discussion when they had before them a report by officials on the relation of the road programme to the economy as a whole and figuresfor projected Government expenditure in 1961-62 and subsequent years. Meanwhile, it would be useful to consider also whetherprogress in those years could be accelerated by undertaking duringthe present year the preliminary work on planning the lines of newroads and negotiations for the purchase of the land required forthem.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Transport to give further consideration to the proposedroad programmes in relation to the redeployment ofindustry and to the needs of industry generally.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Scotland, to consider the possibilityof extending the present toll system.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider thepossibility of (a) financing the road programmes from loans; and(b) increasing the fees for road fund licences.(4) Agreed to resume at a subsequent meeting their discussion ofthe road programmes for England and Wales and forScotland.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,11th April, 1960.
