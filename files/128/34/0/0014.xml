Post Office.Future Status.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 42ndConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster-General (C. (60) 34) covering a draft of a White paper on the future status of the Post Office.The Postmaster-General recalled that, in July 1959, the cabinet had approved in principle a plan for changes in the status of thePost Office, the essence of which was that instead of being subject to treasury control through Estimates the Post Office would have itsown statutory trading account. The Treasury would, however,continue to exercise control over capital investment, foreign exchangearid the pay and conditions of service of staff. The draft White Paperannexed to C. (60) 34 outlined the changes proposed. It had beenapproved by the Home Affairs Committee. In earlier discussions ithad been suggested that a uniform procedure for fixing all Post Officetariffs by or under regulations subject to negative resolution ofParliament might be taken as a precedent for closer parliamentary control over charges made by nationalised industries. The HomeAffairs Committee had, however, agreed that, as Parliament was tobe asked to surrender the traditional procedure of voting money forthe Post Office and as some of the tariffs had hitherto been subjectto no form of control, it was reasonable to give Parliament the rightto object to all tariff changes.Discussion showed that there was general support in the cabinet for the proposals outlined in the White Paper. It was desirable thatthe legislation required should be introduced in the early part of thefollowing session, and the White Paper should therefore be publishedbefore the Easter recess. Although care had been taken to avoid any suggestion that the Post Office was comparable with the nationalised industries, the White Paper was likely to stimulateinterest in the Governments intentions in regard to them. Since,however, the Government would shortly be ready with their proposalsfor the future of the British Transport Commission, the publicationof the White Paper on the Post Office need not be delayed on that account.In further discussion various suggestions were made and approved for changes in the wording of the White Paper.The Cabinet Approved the draft White Paper annexed to C. (60) 34,subject to the drafting amendments noted in their discussion,and authorised the Postmaster-General to arrange for it tobe presented to Parliament shortly before the Easter recess.*2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (60) 36) reporting the outcome of his recent discussions with the Governments of the Federation and ofSouthern Rhodesia on constitutional advance in Nyasaland and in southern Rhodesia and on the release of Dr. Banda.The Prime Minister expressed the Cabinets appreciation of theskill which the Commonwealth Secretary had shown in bringing these discussions to a satisfactory conclusion.The Commonwealth Secretary said that as a result of had discussions he was convinced that if the Cabinet had adhered to theoriginal proposal to release Dr. Banda early in March there wouldhave been a real danger to security in Nyasaland and a real risk thatmoderate Africans in Nyasaland would have been prevented byintimidation from giving evidence to the Monckton Commission.The Governments of the Federation and Southern Rhodesia had,however, been persuaded to agree to Dr. Banda&apos;s release on 1st April* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET57010-5 b 2Federationof RhodesiaandNyasaland.(previous reference:C.C.(60) 13thConclusions,Minute 1.)
 three weeks later than the date originally contemplated but a fewdays before the Commission were due to leave Nyasaland and duringthe period of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s projected visit. This agreement had been reached on the understanding that the strictest secrecywould be observed about the proposed date of release. In themeantime all possible precautions should be taken against the renewal of disturbances in Nyasaland.The Prime Ministers of the Federation and of Southern rhodesia would be willing to accept some measure of constitutional andvance for Nyasaland; but they would expect that we should surrender the reserved powers in Southern Rhodesia, subject to effective localsafeguards for the rights of the African population. This problem would be discussed with Sir Edgar Whitehead when he came toLondon in April.The Colonial Secretary accepted the need for secrecy about theproposed date of Dr. Banda&apos;s release but said that the review ofdetainees in Nyasaland which the Governor was due to undertakeon 3rd March would inevitably provoke much speculation. TheGovernor might not be able to defer making some announcement about Dr. Banda for more than a week after that date, but it should bepossible to avoid implying either that Dr. Banda would be detained fora further six months or that his release was imminent. The colonial secretary said that he would consult the Commonwealth Secretaryabout the terms of such an announcement, which he would then put to the Prime Minister of the Federation. He also proposed to announce on the following day that his visit to Nyasaland, would begin on 23rd March. He would, when questioned, continue to saythat Dr. Banda&apos;s release was a matter for the Governor of Nyasaland and that, if the release had taken place before he himself leftNyasaland, he would be willing to discuss constitutional advancewith Dr. Banda.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of C. (60) 36.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to deal with the release of dr. Banda on the lines which he had proposed.Farm price review,1960-61.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 6thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 37) about the position reached in the current farm price review.The Minister of Agriculture said that the farmers&apos; representatives had rejected the Governments initial proposal for a reduction of 15 millions in the total value of the agricultural guarantees and had asked instead for an increase of  10 millions. They argued strongly that their net income, adjusted to the basis of normal yields, had declined, whereas incomes in the rest of the community wereincreasing. In order to retain the confidence of the industry in thesecircumstances, it was important to leave them with a reasonable partof the benefit, estimated at  25 millions, which would accrue from theirincreasing efficiency. For this purpose anything less than  3 millions would be regarded as derisory. It followed that, taking account ofthe fact that the additional costs of the industry were now assessedat  13 millions, the current review should result in a reduction in thetotal value of the guarantees of not more than  9 millions. It wouldnot be possible to secure an agreed settlement on this basis.As regards pigs, he considered that there should be an increaseof 3d. per score in the guaranteed price in addition to the alteration in the guarantee arrangements, which by itself was equivalent to anincrease of about 6d. per score. It was particularly necessary to reassure pig producers, in view of the apprehensions resulting fromthe recent tariff concession on imported bacon. The breeding herdhad fallen, while the Danish herd was at a record high level, and home
production of bacon had decreased while imports of Danish baconhad increased considerably.The Secretary of Slate for Scotland said that among Scottishfarmers there was a striking lack of confidence in the future. Theneed for a substantial increase in the price for pigs was of particular importance to Scottish farmers since the greater part of their pig production was for bacon.The Home Secretary said that the Government of NorthernIreland fully supported the proposals of the Agriculture Ministers. Itwas highly desirable that some incentive should be provided for theindustry by allowing them to retain at least  3 millions of the benefitof their increasing efficiency.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was anxious tosecure a reduction of at least  10 millions in the total value of the guarantees. This would still leave the industry with  2 millionsbenefit from increasing efficiency. A reduction of  10 millions might still not be enough to secure our production objectives, and might encourage uneconomic production. This was particularly likely withpigs, for there were already indications that the breeding herd wasbeginning to increase again. Moreover, an increase in the guaranteed price for pigs, in addition to the alteration in the guarantee arrangements, would be resented by the Danes and might jeopardisetheir ratification of the European Free Trade Association convention.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat an increase of 3d. per score in the guaranteed price for pigs, inaddition to the alteration in the guarantee arrangements, could bejustified to Danish interests, in view of the evidence that imports of danish bacon were 27 per cent, higher than a year ago while home production was 14 per cent, lower. Moreover, it might be possibleto reassure the Danes by explaining that any reduction in baconimports would not fall primarily on them. At the same time it hadto be remembered that there would be competition in future fromCanadian bacon, and that it was desirable, in the interests of our export trade, to avoid cutting imports of Polish bacon as far aspossible.After further discussion the Cabinet came to the conclusion that,bearing in mind the need to maintain the confidence of the industryto the extent necessary to secure the objectives of the Government infuture price reviews, the result of the current review should leave theindustry with  3 millions benefit from their increasing efficiency. Inorder to limit expenditure on the egg subsidy, it would be advisable to secure a reduction of l\d. per dozen in hen eggs. An increase of3d. per score for pigs should be conceded, in addition to the alteration in the guarantee arrangements which was equivalent to an increase ofabout 6d. per score. It would be possible to make further adjustments in the proposed price changes for cereals, but this could be decided by the Agriculture Ministers in consultation with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the reduction in the total value of the guaranteesshould be such as to leave the farming industry with a newincrease of  3 millions from increasing efficiency, thatan increase of 3d. per score in the price for pigs shouldbe conceded in addition to the alteration in the guarantee arrangements, and that there should be a reduction ofl-^d. a dozen in the price of hen eggs.(2) Invited the Agriculture Ministers, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to settle the details of theprice changes in the current review in accordance with conclusion (1) above.Cabinet Office, S.W..1,1st March, I960.
