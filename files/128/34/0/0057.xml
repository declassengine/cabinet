SECRET *. 3C.C. 57 (60)Congo ^ 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that, unless some early progressRepublic was made towards stabilising the situation in the Congo, the(Previous Communist countries might succeed in re-establishing their influenceReference : there. The best hope of making such progress lay in establishing theC.C. (60) 54th authority of President Kasavubu; but the United NationsConclusions, representatives in the Congo had so far been unwilling to supportMinute 2) him for fear that this might lead a number of African countries towithdraw their support for the United Nations intervention.President Kasavubu, as Head of State, would attend the furtherdebate on the Congo which was about to begin in the general assembly. There was thought to. be a reasonable chance that amajority of the Assembly would vote in favour of accepting hisnominees as the lawful representatives of the Congo Republic in theUnited Nations. This would enhance his prestige and might pave theway towards a favourable settlement. This course would, however,be opposed by a number of African and Asian countries, includingNigeria and Ghana. This group favoured sending some sort ofUnited Nations commission to the Congo, although it was not clear whether this would be for the purpose of ascertaining the facts or for conciliation. The United States Government took the view that theforthcoming debate might be the last opportunity to reverse therecent trend of events in the Congo, and they were in favour offorcing in the Assembly a decision favourable to President Kasavubu.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that, in spite of the disadvantages of following a course whichwas likely to be opposed by many African and Asian countries, itwould on balance be desirable that the United kingdom representative should vote for the recognition of PresidentKasavubu&apos;s nominees as the lawful representatives of the congo republic in the United Nations, if there were a reasonable chance that a resolution for this purpose would be carried. This could bejustified on the grounds that President Kasavubu was generally regarded as the lawful Head of State and that it was essential toestablish some authority in the Congo Republic without delay. Itwould not preclude the despatch of a fact-finding or conciliationcommission. We might therefore seek to combine these two courses in such a way as to avoid undue criticism from African countries,including Nigeria and Ghana.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to send instructions to theUnited Kingdom representative at the United Nations onthe lines indicated in their discussion.West Indies 2.   The Colonial Secretary said that the first stage of theDefence negotiations between the Governments of the United Kingdom, theWest Indies and the United States to review the 1941 Leased BasesAgreement had been successfully concluded. The United StatesGovernment had stated that of the bases in the West Indies held underthe 1941 Agreement they had a future interest only in their naval base at Chaguaramas in Trinidad and a station in St. Lucia, and that theywere prepared to negotiate a separate bilateral agreement with theWest Indies Government in respect of these. It was satisfactory thatthe United States Government had accepted the principle, to whichthe West Indies Government attached particular importance, that any future agreement should be the subject of free negotiation betweenequal partners. There was every expectation that the West IndiesGovernment would be prepared to reach agreements with the United
Kingdom and the United States for their respective defence requirements which would be honoured after the West Indies had gained their independence.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the colonial secretary.Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference :C.C. (60) 47thConclusions,Minute 3)3. The Prime Minister said that public controversy was continuing, both in London and in Salisbury, on the question whetherthe Monckton Commission had gone beyond their terms of reference in dealing with the question of secession in their report. Thestatement which he had made on this point during the Debate on the address had not satisfied the Prime Minister of the Federation, whowas likely to challenge it in a speech which he would be makinglater in the week in the Federal Parliament in Salisbury. Sir roy welensky believed that the course followed by the monckton commission in this respect was inconsistent with the assurances whichhe had received from the Prime Minister before the Commissionbegan its work, and it was being alleged that he had been misled by those assurances. The Prime Minister said that in thesecircumstances he had told Sir Roy Welensky that he would, ifnecessary, be willing to publish the text of those assurances; and hehad arranged for a draft White Paper to be prepared for that purpose.He had however thought it right to warn him that it would be aserious matter to break the long tradition by which such exchangesbetween Commonwealth Prime Ministers were treated as private and confidential; and in view of that warning Sir Roy Welensky had now indicated that he no longer wished for this correspondence to bemade public. The Prime Minister said that he had no doubt that thiswas the right conclusion, even though it involved some risk of continuing political embarrassment.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the PrimeMinister.Parliament 4.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.Flood 5.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that pressure wasDamage developing for the establishment of a permanent national distress(Previous fund for the relief of the victims of floods.  While the proposal had reference: certain attractions, his own view was that it would be preferable force.C. (53) 24th the Government to continue to support local funds as necessary.  it conclusions, would be difficult to determine a workable criterion for claims on a minute 7) national fund, and such a fund might be expected to attract lessA National generous individual contributions and even to undermine the principleFund of insurance against damage by floods and similar occurrences.The Minister of Housing and Local Government supported thisview. The immediate needs of the victims of the recent floods werebeing met, either in cash or in kind, by the National Assistance Boardand by the local funds which had already been established. It was at a later stage, however, that the heavy demands for assistance were likely to come forward and he had recently undertaken in a statement in Parliament that, wherever it became clear that local funds wouldnot suffice to meet the needs, the Government would be prepared to
CC. 57 (60)supplement them. He had also undertaken that, if the localauthorities found themselves unable to make good the damage to public services without an unreasonable burden on the rates, theGovernment would consider sympathetically requests for special assistance. Claims on the Exchequer would constitute a call on the 3 millions which the Government had promised by way of relief afterthe East Coast floods of 1953, but which had in fact remained unused.An undertaking had been given in 1956 that, bearing this sum inmind, the Government would the more readily ask Parliament to vote an appropriate contribution towards the relief of sufferers in subsequent disasters.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet with the view put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of Housing. Pressure for the establishment of anational fund should be resisted for the time being, but it should notbe ruled out altogether. The Land Drainage Bill, which was to be debated in the House of Commons in the following week and which increased both the resources of river boards and their powers to carryout flood prevention works, could be presented as an essential firstmove against the recurrence of severe flooding. If, however, the riverboards showed themselves unable or unwilling to do what wasnecessary, further action by the Government would not be precluded.The Cabinet :Agreed that, for the time being and subject to furtherconsideration in the light of developments, Ministers shouldcontinue to resist the pressures for the establishment of anational fund for the relief of distress occasioned by floods.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour (C. (60) 160) about the end of call-up for NationalService.The Minister of Labour said that it had already been announcedConclusions, that no more men would be called up for National Service after the minute 2) end of the present year. The rate of intake had, however beenaccelerated, so that the last men would be called up on17th November. He recommended that this should be announcedimmediately afterwards to Parliament and he proposed that astatement should be made in the terms of the draft annexed to his memorandum which, in addition, expressed a tribute to the 5 million men who had been called up and to the committees and tribunalswhich had assisted in the operation of the scheme. arrangements had been made to secure that National Servicemen who tried to escape their obligations by enlisting as regulars and immediatelybuying their release would be called up again.In discussion it was suggested that, while some announcementmight be necessary, it should be designed to attract the least possiblepublicity. It would be undesirable either to provoke discontent among the last men to be called up or to focus attention on the reduced figure of 165,000 which the Government had recently-announced as the objective of recruitment to the Army. Nor shouldanything be said which might be taken to imply that compulsory national Service might not have to be re-introduced if voluntary recruitment failed to achieve that objective. It would, therefore, be preferable that the announcement should be made as a written answer to a Parliamentary Question, referring to the already known factthat there would be no further call-up under the present scheme afterthe end of the year and stating simply that, as a matter. ofNationalService(previous reference :
administrative convenience, arrangements had been made to complete the scheme on 17th November. While it would be appropriate toinclude some expression of gratitude for the work of those who hadhelped to operate the scheme, no more emphasis than was necessaryshould be placed on its operation in the past.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Labour, in consultation with theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Chief Whip,to prepare an announcement about the end of the present scheme of compulsory National Service on the lines agreed in their discussion, to be made in a written answer to a parliamentary Question on 18th November.LiquorLicensingBill(previous reference :C.C. (60) 55thConclusions,Minute 3)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland (C. (60) 161) about the sale of alcoholon Sundays.The Home Secretary said that he had accepted the proposal ofthe Minister for Welsh Affairs that there should be local option on the sunday opening of licensed premises in Wales and Monmouthshire,expressed through polls on a county and county borough basis. a clause to effect this would be included in the Licensing Bill v/hich was shortly to be introduced in the House of Commons.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, while he did not wish to oppose local polls on Sunday opening in Wales, he must draw the attention of the Cabinet to the probability that they wouldstimulate demands for a similar arrangement in Scotland. Acommittee under the chairmanship of Lord Guest had recentlyrecommended legislation to provide for Sunday opening in scotland on the same lines as in England and, although there were alreadylocal polls in Scotland (on a parish basis) on the question whether ornot any premises in the area should be licensed, he would wish to resist strongly any demand that Sunday opening in Scotland shouldbe made a matter of local option.The Cabinet Took note of C. (60) 161.The 8.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCommonwealth Cabinet (C. (60) 122) covering a report prepared by a group of officialsFuture from six Commonwealth countries on the constitutional developmentConstitutional   of the Commonwealth with particular reference to the future of theDevelopment    smaller dependent territories.   This report had been prepared inpursuance of a decision taken at the Meeting of commonwealth prime  Ministers  in  May   1960,   and  it   had  been  submittedsimultaneously to all Commonwealth Governments.The Cabinet also had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (60) 159) summarising the mainconclusions of this report and recommending that they should beaccepted by the United Kingdom Government.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith the conclusions reached in the report. The following particular points were raised:  (a) The Colonial Secretary said that it now seemed likely thatMauritius might attain independence, and become a candidate for commonwealth membership, within the course of the next 10 years.
He suggested that Mauritius should be added to the list of countrieswhich might possibly become candidates for commonwealth membership before 1970.(b) The Colonial Secretary said that, now that this report hadbeen considered by the Cabinet, he would be glad to have authority tosend copies of it, for personal information, to the Governors of thosedependent territories which might be affected by it.(c) The Prime Minister doubted whether it would be advisable to inform other Commonwealth Governments at this stage, as recommended in paragraph 5 (b) of C. (60) 159, that the UnitedKingdom Government accepted the conclusions of the report. Itwould suffice if the report were placed on the agenda for the next meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that Mauritius should be included among the territories which might attain independence, and becomecandidates for Commonwealth membership, before 1970.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, approved the conclusionsof the report of Commonwealth officials annexed toC. (60) 122.(3) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to communicate thisreport, for personal and confidential information, toGovernors of dependent territories which might beaffected by its recommendations.(4) Took note that the report would be placed on the agenda forthe next Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th November, I960.
