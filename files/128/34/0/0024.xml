The Foreign Secretary said that the Ruler of Abu Dhabi was anxious that the United Kingdom jurisdiction in his territory shouldbe reduced, as was being done in Kuwait. The Ruler attached great importance to this, but it was desirable that the process shouldnot be hurried. He would keep the Cabinet informed of any further developments.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Cyprus.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 21stConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, Mr. Amery, would have a formalmeeting within the next two days with the representatives of theGreek and Turkish Cypriot communities, to consider further the compromise proposed by the Turkish Cypriot leader, Dr. Kutchuk,that the British sovereign areas should amount to 100 square miles.Mr. Amery might also have an informal meeting with Archbishop Makarios with a view to making it clear that, unless he acceptedDr. Kutchuk&apos;s proposal, we would break off the discussions and seeksome other settlement of the Cyprus problem in consultation with theGreek and Turkish Governments. If the Archbishop continued to insist that the sovereign areas should not exceed 80 square miles,there seemed no alternative but for Mr. Amery to bring thenegotiations to an end and return to this country. In that event itwould be desirable to announce that the Government had beenprepared to give Dr. Kutchuk&apos;s proposal favourable consideration ifthe Archbishop had been ready to do likewise.If the discussions in Cyprus came to an end in this way, it was likely that there would be a debate in Parliament before the easter recess. This should be conducted in such a way as to avoid givingArchbishop Makarios any impression that he might obtain further concessions about the extent of the sovereign areas even if he continued to insist on the figure of 80 square miles.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It would be necessary to consider exactly what took place atthe further meetings in Cyprus before settling the terms ofthe announcement which would be necessary if thediscussions broke down. It would be convenient if inthese circumstances an announcement were made on 8th April.: (b) If the present negotiations broke down, the natural coursewould be to reconvene the meeting of Foreign Ministers.This need not be done immediately, provided that theGreek and Turkish Governments maintained their presentfavourable attitude.(c) If Archbishop Makarios instigated a campaign of passive resistance there would inevitably be disturbances in cyprus, but it should be possible for the Governor tomaintain efficient administration.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for the Colonies that the terms ofthe announcement which would be necessary if thediscussions in Cyprus were broken off would be settled in thelight of the results of the further meetings with the greek and Turkish Cypriot representatives.

The Commonwealth Secretary proposed that a statementAfrica. should be made in Parliament that day on the position of the United(Previous        Kingdom citizens who had recently been arrested in South Africa in reference :      connexion with the disturbances there.   It appeared that they wereC.C.

Although this announcement might stimulate questions about the position of the African leaders who had taken refuge inBechuanaland, it was unlikely that for the time being these questions would be pressed.In discussion the Cabinet were reminded that the return of the refugees to South Africa could lawfully be demanded. There was no right of political asylum in the Protectorates, and it was by no means certain that the local courts would accept the argument that thereturn of the refugees should be refused on the ground that theywould be personally imperilled. If, therefore, any indication were received that the South African Government contemplateddemanding their return, the best course might be to transfer themto this country, although the fact that they did not hold South Africanpassports might cause difficulty on the journey. If a demand for their return were actually made, it would be possible to delay matters by arranging for an appeal from the local courts or by some othertechnical procedure.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to arrange for astatement to be made in Parliament on the position of theUnited Kingdom citizens arrested in connexion with the disturbances in South Africa.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the HomeSecretary, to consider how a demand for the return of the african leaders who had taken refuge in Bechuanalandcould best be resisted.british somali land.(previous reference:CM. (56) 39thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof State for Colonial Affairs (C. (60) 65) about the future of the somali land Protectorate.The Minister of State for Colonial Affairs recalled that early in1959 the Colonial Secretary had announced that if, when Somaliaattained independence, the Legislative Council of British Somalilandresolved to effect some form of union with that country, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be willing to arrange for negotiations to takeplace. It had at that time been thought that the Italian trusteeshipof Somalia would not be brought to an end until December 1960, andthat thereafter the discussions necessary to effect union with the protectorate could not be completed until towards the end of 1962.Now, however, Somalia was to become independent on 1st July, 1960,and public opinion in the Protectorate had turned strongly in favourof achieving both independence and union with Somalia on that date.A resolution calling for immediate steps to that end was to be movedthat day in the British Somaliland Legislative Council. The Governorhad reported that anything in the nature of an official declaration thatthis time-table was impracticable would provoke disturbances in the protectorate which the local police and security forces could not be relied on to handle.  The Minister of State therefore proposed that
commercial policy.Pigmeat.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 58thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 64) about the import of pigmeat.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that in November1959, the Cabinet had authorised a quota of 25,000 tons of frozenpork from North America and had decided that, in consequence, the quota for Polish bacon should be fixed at 20,000 tons for the first halfof 1960 with no undertaking about the level of quotas thereafter. this the Governors representative should be authorised to make, in thecourse of the debate in the Legislative Council, a more forthcomingstatement which would be tantamount to agreeing that unofficialdiscussions between the Protectorate and Somalia might begin at once.In discussion serious misgivings were voiced about this proposal.Such a statement would prejudice our relations with the ethiopian government, since we had given them to understand that we would do nothing to promote union before Somalia attained independence.It would also prejudice the relations between Ethiopia and the successor State, to the serious detriment of the latter. The situation would become even worse if the discussions on union were to leadto a joint declaration in favour of the creation of a Greater Somaliaembracing, not only Somalia and the Protectorate, but also theSomali minorities in Ethiopia and Kenya. Moreover, there were many complex problems to be solved before the Protectorate couldattain either independence or union with Somalia, and precipitate action could lead to administrative and financial chaos. To accelerateconstitutional advance in British Somaliland under pressure of thekind which had developed would also have unfortunate consequencesin other dependent territories in Africa.On the other hand, it was clearly desirable to avoid a situationin which law and order could only be preserved by the transfer ofBritish troops to the area. It might be possible to reassure the ethiopian Government by a statement in the United kingdom parliament disclaiming any intention on the part of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to encourage or support any claim for incorporation ina wider Somali union of any territory other than Somalia and the protectorate.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that it wasthe general feeling of the Cabinet that some concession must be madeto the demand in British Somaliland for independence and union withSomalia on 1st July. A statement on behalf of the Governor should therefore be made in the Legislative Council on the following day,to the effect that Her Majesty&apos;s Government recognised that theresolution of the Council was a clear expression of the wish of thepeople; that there were many practical problems to be settled beforethe Protectorate could become independent and the Governor was willing to initiate discussions about these at once; that union withSomalia would similarly give rise to practical problems; that these were primarily a matter for the people of the Protectorate themselves and if they wished to initiate preliminary, unofficial discussions with political leaders in Somalia, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would not prevent that. Thereafter it would be necessary to decide in the lightof developments whether it would in fact be practicable to grant independence to the Somaliland Protectorate on 1st July.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs, inconsultation with the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs,to prepare, and submit for the Prime Minister^ approval, thedraft of a statement to be made in the Legislative Councilof British Somaliland on the lines agreed in the cabinet discussion.
compared with a Polish bacon quota of 48,500 tons for 1959, and thereduction had caused much political resentment and serious harm to our export trade. The Poles had refused to negotiate a new trade agreement, they had asked for a revision of the debt settlement, andthey had held up orders for United Kingdom capital goods to a valueof over  12 millions. In the event the quota for frozen pork from north America had not been taken up because Canadian supplies were unsuitable for the United Kingdom market. There Wastherefore a strong case for restoring the cut in the Polish quota, either in whole or in part, and for settling the quota which we should offer to them for 1961. On the other hand, the confidence of our pigfarmers was seriously disturbed by the agreement to reduce the tariff on Danish bacon and the prospect of increased imports of pigmeatgenerally. Farmers were also far from satisfied with the outcome ofthe recent Price Review. Moreover, the restoration of the Polishquota, combined with heavy supplies from other foreign producers,might depress prices to such an extent that the cost of exchequer support under the deficiency payments scheme for pigs might increasevery substantially. In these circumstances the majority of theEconomic Policy Committee thought that the Polish bacon quotashould be left at, 20,000 tons for the first half of 1960 and should beincreased to 24,250 tons for the second half and that, in the interestsof our exports of capital goods, we should also offer a quota of 48,500tons for 1961. The quota for North American frozen pork should bemaintained, and any representations from the Canadians for anadditional quota for pigmeat should be considered on their merits.The Joint Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, saidthat the Minister of Agriculture would be unwilling at present toaccept a specific level for the Polish bacon quota for 1961. It was likely that total bacon supplies would increase considerably later inthe year, partly because of increasing imports from Denmark andpartly because there would be a revival in home supplies. Moreover,the quota for Canadian frozen pork might still be taken up. farmers were also concerned about the possibility that the bacon tariffconcession granted to Denmark might have to be extended to finland.The Foreign Secretary said that he had only accepted a reductionin the Polish quota on the understanding that this was unavoidable ifimports of frozen pork had to be accepted from Canada. Since these supplies were not now expected, it should be possible to restore thePolish quota for 1960 to the full 48,500 tons. This was very desirableboth in order to develop friendly relations with Poland and for the sake of our exports of capital goods.The Commonwealth Secretary said that if the Polish bacon quotawere to be increased it would not be justifiable to refuse a quota forpigmeat to Canada. At the least we should allow Canada to use the quota for frozen pork for other pigmeat supplies.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general inclined tothink that, in view of the present apprehensions of the pig and baconindustries, the quota for Polish bacon should be left at 20,000 tons for the first half of 1960 and should be increased to 24,250 tons forthe second half. However, in the interests of our exports ofcapital goods, it might be desirable to settle with the Poles what theirquota should be for 1961 and subsequent years. This would require futher consideration by the Cabinet at their next meeting.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of (C. (60) 64) at their next meeting.
