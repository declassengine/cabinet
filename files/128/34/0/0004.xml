industrial disputes.Railway Wages.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 3rdConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The Minister of Transport said that disagreement persistedbetween the National Union of Railwaymen (N.U.R.) on the onehand and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and firemen (A.S.L.E.F.) and the Transport Salaried Staffs Association(T.S.S.A.) on the other about an interim increase of pay pending thereport of the committee under Professor Guillebaud. A.S.L.E.F. andT.S.S.A. were at present opposed to any interim increase although there was reason to think that at least the former might change their view if a definite offer were made. The N.U.R., who were regarded by the British Transport Commission (B.T.C.) as being in breach bothof the agreement not to strike before their case had been consideredby the arbitration tribunal and of the agreement not to enter into anyprior commitment on the Guillebaud report, had issued strike noticesfor 15th February. Meanwhile the Government were still disengagedfrom the dispute and the immediate issue for decision was whetherthey should remain so. It could be suggested to the Chairman of theB.T.C. that he might either report the facts officially to the Ministerof Transport or formally notify the Minister of Labour of theexistence of a dispute. Another possible course would be to invitethe Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.) to inform the Government what action they proposed to take to try to settle the disagreement betweenthe unions.The Minister of Labour said that technically the B.T.C. were notyet required to refer the dispute to him, since ,the normal negotiatingprocesses had not yet been exhausted. The N.U.R. had, however,refused to submit their case to the arbitration tribunal and there was nothing to prevent him from intervening in the dispute at any timeand at very short notice. Nevertheless, his own view was that itwould be preferable to await developments.Discussion showed that the Cabinet agreed that the time had notyet come for the Government to intervene in the dispute. It wouldbe preferable to avoid making a statement to Parliament on that day.Meanwhile, the public would expect the T.U.C. to consider how thedispute between the unions might be resolved. However, since theGovernment were concerned both with the amount of any interimpayment and with the possibilities of conciliation, it was not likely thatthey could avoid becoming involved in the dispute for much longer.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Government should not for the time beingintervene in the railway wages dispute.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion on the following day.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,2nd February, 1960.Parliament. 1.   xne Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
