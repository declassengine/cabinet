Law of theSea.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 30thConclusions,Minute 2.)IcelandicFisheryDispute.Germany.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 17thConclusions.Minute 1.)Armaments.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 15thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Minister of Aviation said that German experts who had come to the United Kingdom to examine the possibilities ofco-operation in certain aircraft developments had said that they were under instructions to delay these negotiations on account of theattitude which the United Kingdom authorities were believed to havetaken towards the German application for an amendment of the brussels Treaty which would allow Germany to build destroyers and manufacture influence mines. He had spoken to the german minister of Defence, who had told him that he had received information from Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers in Europe,that it was solely because of British opposition that the Germanrequest had not been approved. He had urged the German Ministerof Defence to instruct his experts to proceed with the negotiationsfor a joint aircraft development project.The Prime Minister said that he was much disturbed at themisrepresentation of our attitude to German rearmament. The fact was that we were acting in close consultation with the French and theother Western European Union Powers in this matter. It would benecessary to investigate the source of this misrepresentation, and tomake it clear to the German Government that our attitude to their request was shared by the French and other Governments. TheGerman request would no doubt have been the subject of discussion by the Foreign Secretary with the French Foreign Minister in washington. A report should be prepared urgently, so that he coulddiscuss the situation with the Foreign Secretary as soon as possible after his return to this country on the following morning.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to arrangefor a report to be prepared, for consideration by the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary on the following morning, on the misrepresentation of the British attitude tothe manufacture of armaments in Germany.1. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that it was now evident that we should be unable by diplomatic methods to persuade the Government of Iceland to join in negotiations for thesettlement of the fisheries dispute. It was, however, important that,in order to restrain the growing impatience of the fishing industry,some contact between the two countries on this question should bemaintained. It therefore seemed advisable to try to arrange for representatives of the fishing industries in the two countries to enterinto discussions of the whole problem. The Government of Icelandwere unlikely to be willing to reach any settlement unless somepressure could be brought to bear on them by their fishing industry.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that the british fishing industry would probably be prepared to join in discussions with the Icelandic industry. It would be particularly useful if tradeunion representatives could play a part, and there were indications that they would be ready to do so.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries andthe Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to try to promotediscussions between representatives of the British andIcelandic fishing industries on the questions outstandingbetween them.
SouthAfrica.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 33rdConclusions,Minute 5.)Proposedboycott byBritishGuiana.atomic energy.CivilProgramme.(previous references:C.C. (59) 64thConclusions,Minute 5 andC.C. (59) 37thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (C. (60) 89) about a proposal by the ExecutiveCouncil of British Guiana to impose a ban on trade with SouthAfrica.The Colonial Secretary said that, despite pressure from theGovernor, Ministers in British Guiana intended to support an opposition motion for a ban on trade with South Africa. It wouldbe open to the Governor to reject the motion, under powers whichwere still in force but were to be relinquished before August 1961.But if the Governor exercised this power, there was a risk that ministers might resign and compel him to resume direct rule. Apolitical crisis on this account in British Guiana might increase therisk that other Colonial territories would take similar action againsttrade with South Africa. Jamaica and Antigua had already imposedsuch a ban, and other West Indian territories were considering similar action. These actions were in breach of the obligations of the UnitedKingdom Government under the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade. On the other hand, if the Governor of British Guianarejected the advice of his Ministers on this question, at a time when itwas known that the power to prevent this action would shortly cometo an end, a deplorable impression would be created not only in that territory but in this and many other countries also. He therefore recommended that in the last resort the Governor of British Guianashould not use his power to reject the recommendation for a ban on trade with South Africa.In discussion it was pointed out that the South african government had protested against the action previously taken byJamaica, and against the fact that the United Kingdom Governmenthad not intervened to prevent the boycott. The Union government might feel obliged to retaliate, especially if a ban by British Guianawere to be followed by similar action by other Colonial territories.Retaliation might easily take the form of economic pressure againstBasutoland, which we should be powerless to relieve.On the other hand it had to be recognised that Colonial territoriesmight be more likely to press for action against trade with SouthAfrica if British Guiana&apos;s attempt to do so were frustrated by theuse of the Governors formal powers. It would be particularlyembarrassing if coercion in British Guiana were to stimulate theGovernment of Nigeria into giving effect to the resolution alreadypassed by the Federal Parliament in favour of a boycott.If, as was virtually certain, the South African Government wereto protest against the boycott which British Guiana Ministersintended to impose, we should have to justify our attitude by referenceto the particular circumstances of that territory, and especially to thefact that the power to prevent a boycott was one which it had alreadybeen decided should be relinquished in the near future. For thispurpose it would be desirable to explain the situation in advance tothe United Kingdom High Commissioner in South Africa.The Cabinet Approved the recommendations in C. (60) 89.4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C. (60) 88) covering a memorandum by the Minister of power, which had been endorsed by the Economic Policy Committee,about the civil nuclear power programme.The Minister of Power said that the original ten-year programmeannounced in 1955 for the development of civil nuclear power hadbeen accelerated in 1957, with the object of providing 5,000-6,000megawatts in commission by the end of 1966. There had since beenchanges in the fuel position, and it was now estimated thatconventional fuel supplies would be adequate for ten to fifteen years,even if no nuclear power stations were ordered in the next few years.The capital costs of nuclear generation had been higher than had
been expected, but the cost of generating nuclear power was nowfalling faster than the cost of generating electricity from conventionalfuels. A nuclear power programme on the 1957 scale was therefore no longer necessary, but it was essential to find out as soon aspossible how to build a fully competitive nuclear power station andto provide for an industry which would in due course be capable of expanding at the necessary rate. It was proposed to spread the nuclear power programme over a longer period, by proceeding at thepresent rate of ordering which was roughly one station a year. Thiswould provide 3,800 megawatts by the end of 1966, and 5,000megawatts in 1968. It would fully maintain the rate of technological development, and would be sufficient to keep three industrialconsortia employed. It would also be sufficient to allow the atomic energy Authority to fulfil their commitment to supply plutonium tothe United States, and in addition there would probably be sufficientmaterial for essential civil research and development needs. Theoutput of plutonium from Calder Hall and Chapelcross would continue to be available for military needs.This re-phasing of the programme would reduce the electricity generating Board&apos;s capital requirements from the Exchequer byabout  90 millions over the next seven years; after allowing for a consequential worsening of the Atomic Energy Authority&apos;s finances of about  20 millions, the net relief to the Exchequer would be about 70 millions. He proposed to announce the re-phasing of theprogramme by means of a statement to Parliament immediately afterthe Whitsun recess.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement that itwould be economic to re-phase the civil nuclear power programme as proposed.The Minister of Aviation said that, although the output ofplutonium from the two military establishments would continue tobe available, our military needs were at present being met partly fromsupplies from civil stations. Under the re-phased programme, thesupplies from civil stations would be needed primarily to meet our commitment to the United States. Our weapons production would therefore be affected. How far this would be significant would depend on a further assessment of our weapons requirements.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, before the re-phasedprogramme could be finally approved, it would be necessary for its effect on our weapons production programme to be considered furtherby the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence. In discussion it was pointed out that, if the programme were to be re-phased, itwould be desirable to inform the United States authorities in advance that this would not affect the supply of plutonium to them. It wasalso suggested that it might be preferable to announce the re-phasing of the programme by means of a White Paper, rather than by astatement to Parliament; the Minister of Power undertook to give further consideration to this point.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence to make an assessment, forconsideration by the Prime Minister, of the effect on the weapons production programme of the re-phasing of thecivil nuclear power programme proposed in C. (60) 88.(2) Subject to the Prime Ministers being satisfied, afterconsultation with the Minister of Defence, that the weapons production programme would not be prejudicedthereby, approved the re-phasing of the civil nuclear power programme.(3) Invited the Minister of Power to consider whether anannouncement should be made by means of a white paper or of a statement to Parliament.
Somali 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignRepublic. Secretary (C. (60) 91) about the admission to membership of the(Previous Commonwealth of the new Somali Republic which was to come intoReferences:      being on 1st July, when Somaliland and Somalia united.CC. (57) 15th , . . ,       r. Jja.....Conclusions, The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the minute 5 and    arguments against admission of the new Somali Republic to theCC. (60) 25th   Commonwealth were very strong.   It would not for many years be conclusions,    a financially viable State but would be dependent on aid, not onlyMinute 2.)       from ourselves but also from the United States and Italy.    Itsadmission to the Commonwealth would, moreover, antagonise the ethiopians, the French and the Italians, the last of whom had made it clear that in that event they would discontinue their financial aid.While there was no evidence of any definite desire on the part of the somalis to join the Commonwealth, it would be embarrassing tohave to refuse a formal request if one should be made; and it wastherefore proposed that the Consul-General at Mogadishu and theGovernor of Hargeisa should be instructed to adopt a discouragingattitude if any informal approach were made to them.In discussion it was suggested that, while admission of the newSomali Republic to the Commonwealth might do something to counter Communist infiltration, the reactions of the ethiopian government, who were already deeply suspicious of our intentions,would be so hostile that they in turn would be likely to become moresubject to Russian influence. In view of the attitude of France andItaly, the balance of advantage therefore lay on the side ofdiscouraging any advances which the Somalis might make, and our intention to do so should be made clear in strict confidence to theother Governments concerned.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (60) 91.Education.(previous reference:CC. (60) 27thConclusions,Minute 6.)Grants toStudents.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Education(C. (60) 92) about the report of the Committee on Grants to Students,under the Chairmanship of Sir Colin Anderson.The Minister of Education said that the report of the AndersonCommittee was to be published that day. The two principalrecommendations were that the means test which at presentdetermined the amount, if any, of awards to students should be abolished; and that, in order to secure uniformity, all candidates whoattained a certain educational standard and were accepted by a university or for a comparable course should receive an award from public funds. These two recommendations would be widelyacceptable to public opinion, although a minority of academic opinion and certain sections of the Press were likely to be opposed to them.These and other issues raised by the report were complicated andwere of considerable political importance to the Government; and itwould not in any event be possible to reach decisions on them untilconsultations had been held with the various interests concerned.Meanwhile, he sought the authority of the Cabinet to his making, inreply to Parliamentary Questions that day, a holding statement on thelines of the draft annexed to his memorandum.In discussion it was recognised that the recommendations of theAnderson Committee had large social implications. They would almost certainly increase the present pressure on university places.The Education Policy Committee, which had already given some preliminary consideration to the Committee&apos;s report, should therefore continue their work on it, but in the meantime there would be noobjection to a Government statement on the lines proposed.
Parliament.Control ofExpenditure.7. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the week beginning 20th June.The Home Secretary said that, as part of the general review whichwas being conducted into the control of Government expenditure,it was proposed, with the agreement of the Chairman of the SelectCommittee on Estimates, that the membership of that Committeeshould be enlarged and that occasions should be provided for theHouse of Commons to debate the Committee&apos;s reports and those ofthe Public Accounts Committee. These proposals would be discussed with the Opposition.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the HomeSecretary.House ofCommons.Members&apos;Pensions.8. The Home Secretary said that he had discussed with theOpposition the possibility of introducing a superannuation schemeto give Members of Parliament pensions as of right. It had beenagreed that the cost of such a scheme put it, at least for the time being,out of the question. It had, however, been suggested that, if theExchequer were to contribute an additional  5-  10,000 a year to theHouse of Commons Members&apos; Fund, it should be possible for the trustees of the Fund to provide, on the basis of a means test, pensions of up to  1,000 for Members who had served not less than twenty-oneyears and were in financial hardship. The Home Secretary proposedthat the Trustees should be invited to discuss a possible scheme onthese lines with Treasury officials and to submit their conclusions tohim.In discussion it was recognised that the figures which had beenput forward would need to be further examined in the light of adviceshortly to be received from the Government Actuary. Subject tothis, the proposed scheme appeared to be acceptable in principle.It was suggested that there might be a case for extending thescheme to Members of the House of Lords who had served also in theHouse of Commons. In reply it was pointed out that, sincemembership of the Upper House terminated only with life, it mightnot be easy to determine the point of time at which a pension should become payable.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a pensions scheme for Members of parliament should be further examined on the lines proposed by theFlome Secretary.C.C. 34 (60)The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Education to make a statement on the report of the Committee on Grants to Students onthe lines of the draft annexed to C. (60) 92.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the EducationPolicy Committee to give further consideration to therecommendations of the Committee and to bring their conclusions before the Cabinet in due course.
House ofCommonsMembers&apos; Fund(previous reference:C.C. (60) 27thConclusions,Minute 5.)The Home Secretary recalled that, at their meeting on 26th April,the Cabinet had decided that the Government should not introduce legislation to extend the investment powers of the Trustees of theMembers&apos; Fund in advance of the Bill proposed for the session of1960-61 on trustee investments generally. The Trustees of the Fundhad, however, continued to press for an extension of their investmentpowers; their latest proposal was for a Private Member&apos;s Bill in thepresent session to empower them to invest up to 50 per cent, of theFund in equities. There seemed very much less objection to this.As Private Members&apos; time was now almost exhausted, it would benecessary to give the Bill Government facilities.The Cabinet (2) Authorised the Home Secretary to arrange for the drafting of a Private Member&apos;s Bill, for introduction in the present session, to empower the Trustees of the House ofCommons Members&apos; Fund to invest up to 50 per cent, ofthe Fund in equities.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,2nd June, 1960.
