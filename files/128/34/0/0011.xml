Federationof rhodesia and Nyasaland.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 10thConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Cabinet were informed of the progress of the talks between the Commonwealth Secretary and the Federal Governmentin Salisbury.The Prime Minister said that the talks had made it clear that the adverse reaction of the Federal Government to the plan for therelease of detainees and for constitutional development in Nyasalandwas based primarily on objections to releasing Dr. Banda for thepurpose of negotiating with him. The Federal Government felt thatto treat with Dr. Banda would be regarded as a surrender to the extremist representatives of African nationalism. They took the viewthat Dr. Banda would be irreconcilably opposed to the concept of federation. The Federal Government had not yet accepted ourbelief that the only hope for maintaining the Federation lay inproceeding with constitutional developments in the northern territories without unreasonable delay.In these circumstances the Commonwealth Secretary badconsidered an alternative plan which might go some way to meet theapprehensions of the Federal Government. He thought that, if therewere a substantial interval between the release of Dr. Banda and the arrival in Nyasaland of the Central African Advisory commission under the Chairmanship of Lord Monckton, the security risk wouldbe reduced. He therefore suggested that the programme for theMonckton Commission should be rearranged, so that they would first visit Southern Rhodesia and would not arrive in Nyasaland until about the end of the first week in April. This would provide an interval of about a month, after the visit of the Colonial Secretaryto Nyasaland and the release of Dr. Banda, in which the resultingsituation could be observed. The Commonwealth Secretary proposedto put this alternative programme to the Federal Cabinet later that day. The Prime Minister, after consultation with the colonial secretary, had agreed that this should be done. The commonwealth secretary would then make a further report about the progress ofhis talks.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the PrimeMinister.Kenya.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 9thConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The Colonial Secretary said that, following the acceptance by all parties to the Kenya Constitutional Conference, other thanthe United Party, of the proposals he had put forward for constitutional development, discussions had proceeded aboutconstitutional safeguards. It had not been possible to reach agreement between the groups, and he had therefore made a statement to the Conference about the way in which the United KingdomGovernment proposed to deal with this problem. This had covered the need to provide in the proposed constitution for the judicialprotection of human rights, including property rights. He had announced that the Kenya Government would undertake animmediate review of schemes to encourage agricultural development,and he had undertaken that the United Kingdom Government would ensure that  5 millions would be available by way of loan for landdevelopment. He had also announced that the United KingdomGovernment had decided to assume financial responsibility for thecost of the East African Land Forces from 1st July, 1960.The groups at the Conference had not been asked to approvethese further proposals, but all except the United Party had said thatthey had taken note of them and that they now accepted that theconstitutional proposals in respect of the executive and the legislatureshould be implemented as the next stage in Kenya&apos;s constitutional
advance. The African Constituency Elected Members had also agreed to consider accepting some portfolios in the present Councilof Ministers..The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement by the colonial secretary.Law of theSea.(previous reference :C.C. (60) 5thConclusions,Minute. 2.)3. The Minister of Agriculture said that he had now beeninformed by representatives of the fishing industry that, in theinterests of reaching a satisfactory settlement on the forthcoming conference on the Law of the Sea, the industry would be preparedto refrain from fishing in the vicinity of Iceland while the conference was in progress. This would apply, not only to the waters within12 miles of the coast of Iceland, but to a wider area; and this wouldbe a preferable arrangement since it would not appear to acknowledge the existence of a 12-mile limit. There was some risk that this offer by the fishing industry might be publicly disclosed. He therefore proposed, after consultation with the Foreign Secretary, thatM. Lange and, M. Spaak, the Chairman and the Secretary-Generalof the North Atlantic Council, who had been using their good officesto try to find some modus vivendi between the United Kingdom andIceland regarding the fisheries dispute, should be informed forthwithof the offer. They should be asked to transmit it to the Icelandicauthorities, in the hope that they might be prepared to co-operate in avoiding unfortunate incidents. The Icelandic authorities might,for example, be prepared to give shelter to our trawlers when necessary, and to provide hospital treatment for their crews. Theymight also be prepared to refrain from taking proceedings in respectof alleged past offences against their fishing regulations by ourtrawlers, at any rate until the result of the forthcoming conference was known. The industry&apos;s offer would lead to a reduction in theirlandings of fish, and in order to avoid incidents which might arise ifIcelandic trawlers were to try to take advantage of the opportunity which they would have to increase their landings in the UnitedKingdom, the Icelandic authorities might also be asked to persuadetheir industry to be reasonable in this respect.When M. Lange and M. Spaak had been informed, he proposedto arrange for the industry&apos;s offer to be made public. He would makeit clear that the offer was welcomed by the Government, who hopedthat the Icelandic Government would find it possible to make somefriendly gesture in return.The Cabinet Approved the course of action proposed by the Ministerof Agriculture.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,22nd February, I960.
