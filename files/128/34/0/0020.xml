South Africa.(previous reference :C.C. (55) 19thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Prime Minister said that the Opposition had tabled a motion, for discussion in the House of Commons on an early day,in the following terms:&quot; That this House deplores the shooting of demonstratorsin the Union of South Africa resulting in the killing and woundingof large numbers of people, and expresses its deep sympathy withthe families of the dead and the injured &quot;.The terms of this motion were carefully chosen, and it was understood that the Speaker was unlikely to rule it out of order.The Government must be careful to observe the convention that oneindependent member of the Commonwealth should not seek to.intervene in the internal affairs of another; and it was on this accountimportant that they should avoid lending public support to the viewthat the recent disturbances in South Africa were the inevitable resultof the racial policies of the Union Government. On the other hand,it must be recognised that public opinion in this country had beendeeply moved by these events and would expect from the government an expression of regret and of sympathy for those who had suffered.In these circumstances it would be inexpedient for the Governmentto seek to prevent any discussion of this matter in Parliament though it would be preferable if debates could be deferred until thefollowing week, when the disturbances might be seen in betterperspective. Government supporters would find it difficult to vote against the motion tabled by the Opposition. They would find it easier to vote in favour of an amendment which, while containingappropriate expressions of regret, reaffirmed the principle that oneindependent member of the Commonwealth should not pass judgment on the internal policies of another.After discussion it was agreed that an amendment to theOpposition motion should be tabled in the following terms:&quot; That this House, while recognising that it has no responsibility or jurisdiction over the independent countries ofthe Commonwealth, at the same time wishes to record its deepsympathy with all the people of South Africa at the recent tragicevents which have taken place at Vereeniging and Langa &quot;.The Cabinet Invited the Chief Whip to arrange for a notice to be given of an amendment to the Opposition motion in the termsagreed in the Cabinefs discussion.national health service.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 15thConclusions,Minute 3.)RoyalCommission onDoctors&apos; and dentists&apos;Remuneration.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 54) about the recommendationsof the Royal Commission on the remuneration of doctors and dentists in the National Health Service.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the main recommendations of the Royal Commission were that there shouldbe increases of pay for all doctors and for hospital dentists amountingto about 13 per cent, above current rates; that, in addition, thereshould be retrospective payments to doctors and hospital dentistsamounting in total to  20 millions; that there should be no immediate increase in pay of general dental practitioners; and that a standingreview body should be appointed to advise the Government ondoctors&apos; and dentists&apos; pay.   The cost of giving effect to the parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
recommendations in full would be  41% millions in 1960-61 and thereafter  11% millions a year. So far as concerned the general practitioners, the distribution between individual doctors of theaggregate increase in pay recommended by the Commission wouldbe a matter for detailed negotiations with the profession. Theretrospective payments recommended might cause some embarrasment in relation to negotiations on the pay of railwaymen,but the Royal Commission^ report contained a number ofsatisfactory features and the Wages Policy Committee had endorsed the proposal of the Health Ministers that negotiations should be opened as soon as possible with the medical and dental professionson the basis of acceptance of the recommendations as a whole,subject only to further consideration of the charges for board andlodging payable by doctors and dentists resident in hospital and tothe review body&apos;s being provided with the necessary statistical information through sample enquiries rather than through the tax-returns made to the Inland Revenue.Discussion showed that there was general support for theproposal that the report of the Royal Commission should be accepted as a whole. The recommendation for retrospective payments derivedinevitably from the terms of reference of the Commission and couldbe defended on the ground that, unlike the railwaymen, the doctorshad received only interim increases of pay since 1952 (general practitioners) and 1954 (hospital staffs). There was some danger that the proposed review body and the Standing Advisory Committeeon the Pay of the Higher Civil Service (the Coleraine Committee)might be played off against one another, but this might to someextent be obviated by arranging for the two bodies to have a commonsecretariat and, possibly, a common chairman.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (60) 54.The Cabinet also had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Health (C. (60) 55)about the size of general practitioners&apos; lists of patients.The Minister of Health said that the increase in general practitioners&apos; pay which would result from acceptance of the RoyalCommission^ recommendations would provide the opportunity toreduce from 3,500 to 3,250 the maximum number of patients that asingle-handed practitioner was allowed to have on his list. this reduction, which would affect about 1,900 general practitioners, whowere at present responsible for some 6% million patients, wouldresult in a significant improvement in the quality of the service andwould at the same time demonstrate to the public that a settlement on the basis of the Royal Commission^ report would benefit patientsas well as doctors. It was, however, likely to lead to an increase(over and above the increase that would occur in any event) in thenumber of doctors entering general practice; and, as the aggregateamount of general practitioners&apos; pay was governed by the number of doctors and not by the number of patients, this would lead to anincrease in the cost of the service by an amount estimated asultimately  1 million a year. But, unless the change were made inthe context of a general increase in doctors&apos; pay, it must lead eitherto actual financial loss by the doctors whose lists were reduced orto demands that loss should be made good by the Exchequer. he therefore proposed that a reduction in the maximum list should beincluded among the matters to be discussed with the medical profession when the detailed distribution of the additional moneyto be made available as a result of the Royal Commission^ report was being negotiated.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recognised that the principle by which the aggregate amount of general practitioners&apos; pay wasGeneralPractitioners&apos;Lists of patients.
4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Aviation and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 56 and 57)about the manufacture of Dart engines in India.The Minister of Aviation said that Rolls Royce, Ltd., had recently concluded an agreement whereby the Indian Governmentwere to manufacture Dart engines in India. Rolls Royce would bepaid about  1 million over 15 years, and of this the United KingdomGovernment were entitled to receive a levy over that period ofabout  280,000, in accordance with the arrangements made inconnexion with Government assistance for the development of the engine. During the negotiations with Rolls Royce, the IndianMinister of Defence, Mr. Krishna Menon, had asked that, in viewof India&apos;s heavy expenditure on defence equipment from the UnitedKingdom, the levy should not be enforced. The Minister of supply had undertaken to consider this request sympathetically, and theIndian Government had then concluded the contract. Mr. Menonwas now pressing the Government to forgo payment of the levy.In view of the importance of maintaining good relations, with aview to future sales of British aircraft to India, it would be expedient to reduce the levy by 75 per cent., which would benefit the indian government by about  200,000.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed that it was important to avoid prejudicing the prospects of future sales of aircraft to India. But it was at least as important to avoid prejudicing the principle of the levy on export sales. Although there wereprecedents for abating or forgoing levies on sales of aircraft, this had previously been done for the purpose of enabling manufacturers to conclude contracts which they would not otherwise have secured.In the present case a contract had already been made; and, if we now gave way, there would be great pressure on us to forego the levy on any future sales. Moreover, the position in regard to levies on many other oversea sales would be undermined. The Governmenthad undertaken to give considerable financial support to the aircraft industry, and an essential part of that arrangement was that part ofthis expenditure should be recovered by levies on export sales.After some further discussion, the Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Aviation, in consultation with the Paymaster-General,to consider whether means could be found of making some concession to the Indian Government in this matter without prejudicing the future prospects of collecting levies on exportsales of aircraft.C.C. 20 (60)governed by the number of doctors had been endorsed by the RoyalCommission, but said that he would like further time to consider theproposal that the maximum list should now be reduced.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister of Health, to give further consideration tothe proposal in C. (60) 55 that the maximum size ofgeneral practitioners&apos; lists of patients should bereduced.
british transport commission.(previous reference :C.C. (60) 18thConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Prime Minister said that Sir Ivan Stedeford had agreedto preside over the advisory body which was to work out detailed plans, in accordance with the broad principles laid down by theGovernment, for the reorganisation of the British transport commission and its undertakings. Suitable terms of reference should be settled by the Minister of Transport, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Paymaster-General. Anannouncement about the planning body would be made in due course, when the other members had been selected.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Prime Minister.GenevaConferenceon nuclear tests,(previous reference :C.C. (60) 19thConclusions,Minute 2.)*6. The Prime Minister said that, since the Cabinefs discussion on 22nd March, there had been indications that the United StatesGovernment might be reluctant to accept the latest proposals putforward by the Soviet Government at the Geneva Conference on nuclear Tests. He had found this disturbing, for he believed that we might be within reach of concluding a satisfactory agreement.Moreover, if the Americans rejected these Russian proposals, we andthe Americans might find ourselves publicly divided for it was widely known that we had urged the Americans to include a moratorium in their plan. In these circumstances, in telephoneconversations which he had had with President Eisenhower, he had indicated that he would be ready to go to Washington to discuss theposition. The President had now invited him to visit Washingtonfor discussions on 28th and 29th March.The Prime Minister said that he had weighed the risk that his arrival in Washington might stiffen the attitude of those in theUnited States Administration who were opposed to the conclusionof an agreement. The issues at stake were, however, of such importance to the future of the world that he had come to theconclusion that he ought to try to resolve, by personal discussionwith the President, such differences as remained between the twoGovernments.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the Prime Minister^ proposalto visit Washington for personal discussions with president eisenhower on the state of the negotiations at the geneva conference on Nuclear Tests.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.24th March, 1960.
