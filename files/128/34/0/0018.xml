british transport commission.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 17thConclusions,Minute 4.)C.C. 18 (60)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (C. (60) 53) setting out the three possible courses of action inrelation to the report of the Guillebaud Committee, viz.,(i) a statement by the Government promising the implementation of the Guillebaud report, on the expectation that the unions would co-operate, as from the date of the report;(ii) a statement in similar terms but making no specific referenceto a date;(hi) allowing the next round of negotiations to proceed in the firstinstance between the British Transport Commission, acting underMinisterial direction, and the railway unions.The general view of the Cabinet was that there was little to be said in favour of the second course. It lacked both the presentationaladvantage of a clear initiative by the Government to settle the wagesquestion quickly, and the constitutional advantage of allowing asettlement to be reached through the normal negotiating machinery.In favour of the first course it was argued that this would be thebest way of demonstrating that the Government intended to retain control over the situation. It would be accepted by public opinion asa bold but reasonable approach to the problem. If it were possibleto gain public support in this way at an early stage, this would be ofgreat value both in averting the danger of a strike and in carrying through the Governments proposals for reorganisation. On theother hand, the unions were likely to regard it as a provocative act anda denial of their rights of negotiation. It would involve theGovernment in taking a public position on a wages negotiation, fromwhich it would be difficult for them to retreat. While theGovernment might count on having public opinion behind them in resisting a strike threat on the issue of retrospection, this support would be less certain if it appeared that the Government had provokedthe threat.In favour of the third course it was pointed out that this was theprocedure which the Transport Commission would normally followand they expected that the unions would agree to it. Negotiations onthe implementation of the report would last some weeks and, whenthe final settlement came, retrospection to the date of the report would look more attractive than it did at present. This method of proceeding would also avoid provoking the unions and would secure a better atmosphere for the reorganisation that was needed. On theother hand, there was the risk that, by leaving the problem to negotiations between the Commission and the unions, theGovernment would in the end be in a weaker position to resistconcessions on retrospection and on other matters. There was alsothe danger that this might create the impression that the Governmentwere not prepared to underwrite the full implementation of the report and public sympathy might be lost. This was not a negotiation of theusual kind: it was essentially a question of the extent to which theGovernment were prepared to find the money for the settlement.In discussion the following points were made:(a) There was some doubt whether the unions would ask forretrospection to be settled early in the negotiations. It seemed likely that they would press for early payment of the flat-rate increases recommended, in advance of any settlement of differentials. TheChairman of the Commission would be having a further talk with theunions on the following day, after which the position might be clearer.(b) The Guillebaud Committee had made it clear that they regarded their regrading proposals as an integral part of the wagessettlement. It was of great importance that the Transport commission should ensure that the flat-rate increases and the proposals forregrading were dealt with together.
Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that the best course seemed to be to give the Transport Commission writteninstructions on the conduct of the negotiations with the unions.These should say that the Government wished the discussions to bekept within the normal negotiating machinery, but would point outthe importance they attached to securing acceptance of the report asa whole and would suggest that the date for any wage increase shouldbe left until a later stage in the negotiations. It would suggest that inan opening statement to the unions the Chairman of the commission should refer to the statement made in the House of commons on 10th March and to the obligations which should be accepted bythe Commission, the railway workers and the public in regard to there organisation of the industry, that he should go on to refer to theGovernments acceptance of the objective underlying the Guillebaudreport, and should say that it was now for the Commission and theunions to discuss the recommendations of the report in detail, andthat in the light of the Governments statement it should be possible toreach a satisfactory agreement on the basis of the report.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Paymaster-General, theMinister of Labour and the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster, to prepare written instructions for theChairman of the Transport Commission on the conduct ofthe negotiations with the railway unions on therecommendations of the Guillebaud report.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Paymaster-General andthe Minister of Labour, to settle as quickly as possible the composition of a group of advisers on the reorganisation of the British Transport Commission and its undertakings.EconomicSituation.(previous references:CC. (60) 17thConclusions,Minute 5, and cc. (59) 50thConclusions,Minute 2.)*2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there were anumber of indications in the economy which suggested that early action should be taken to moderate slightly the current rate ofeconomic expansion. First, the prospects for the balance of payments in 1960 were unfavourable. It was particularly disquieting that therate of increase in imports was still in excess of the rate of increase in exports. Second, there were indications that the current round of negotiations on wages and hours of work would on the average resultin an increase in wage rates which might endanger price stability.Third, there were increasing signs of labour shortage. Finally, the continuing expansion in credit, particularly in personal bank loans and hire purchase, might result in too large an increase in consumerexpenditure in the coming year. There was certainly no call to reverse the gradual expansion of the economy, but the present rate of increase might lead to a dangerous situation in the second half of1960. If we failed to take some restraining measures now, more drastic action would be necessary later.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreement that any necessary action should be taken in good time to avert any risk of a balance of payments crisis in the latter part of 1960. A full report on the balance of payments prospects would shortly beavailable. It was provisionally estimated that the surplus on current account would not exceed about  160 millions in I960 and that, witha net long-term capital outflow estimated at  365 millions, there wouldbe a deterioration in the monetary position of a little over 200 millions. It was not possible to predict how far this would be reflected in the movement of the reserves.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
It was pointed out that a large part of the deterioration was dueto the increase, of nearly  100 millions, in the net capital outflowwhich would result from a substantial increase in economic assistance,from a net increase in oil investment overseas of  40 millions, andfrom a net increase in other private investment overseas of 30 millions. It was also pointed out that the assumption that therate of stockpiling in 1960 would be higher than in 1959 might provewrong.As regards the internal position, the view was expressed that therate of economic expansion was not so high as to be dangerous, andthat any overload on economic resources was limited to a few areas and a few industries, notably the building industry. The rate ofunemployment varied greatly between districts, and there were certainfactors, such as the ending of National Service and the increase in thenumber of school-leavers, which would substantially increase thelabour force over the next year or two. It was also pointed out thatthe average increase in wage rates from the round of negotiations with was now almost complete, calculated on a weighted percentagebasis and taking account of reductions in hours worked, was about -2 per cent., and that the settlements had covered a period of morethan eighteen months. Moreover there had been a very substantial increase in production during that period. It was also pointed outthat there had been a substantial net increase in personal savings overthe last year, even when account had been taken of the increases in personal bank advances and in hire-purchase.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, while some early action might be prudent, particularly in view of possible balance ofpayments difficulties later in the year, it would be important to avoidtaking measures which would undermine confidence in productive investment. The rate of increase in productivity in the UnitedKingdom was still lower than that in many other countries, and afurther increase should not be discouraged. It seemed that the most appropriate measures would be such as would directly discourageconsumption. It was suggested that the increase in imports was due partly to the removal during recent months of most of the remainingquantitative restrictions, including those on dollar imports, and thatour policy in this respect might be reviewed.Among the immediate difficulties was the need to meet substantial increases in the cost of the social services, such as health and education, and the likely increase, on account of wages, in the deficit of the British Transport Commission. It was the general view of theCabinet that public opinion would understand that these increases would have to be met out of taxation or by increased contributions.Action to this end, taken on the merits in each case, would be more acceptable than the imposition of general restraints on economic activity at a time when our economy was generally thought to be ina prosperous condition. On the other hand, the public ought to bebrought to understand that the particular economic circumstances ofthis country made it inevitable that small adjustments shouldfrequently be made by means of general financial controls.It was generally agreed that the presentation of any measures that might be necessary would need most careful consideration. Itwould be highly undesirable to give the impression, at this stage in the life of Parliament, that the Government wished to administer a generalcheck to the economy. Such early measures as might be necessarycould be presented as a cautious and prudent provision against the increasing costs of certain services. On the other hand, if in view ofthe balance of payments prospects some general restrictive actionbecame necessary, there were a number of measures, of varyingeffectiveness, which might have to be used. The reimposition of restrictions on hire-purchase would act directly on consumption, butit would be desirable for this form of action to be combined with
measures to restrict bank lending. In this connexion it was pointedout that the special deposit system had not yet been tried, and its value would depend largely on the co-operation of the clearing banks.Summing up, The Prime Minister said that it was important toavoid giving the impression that the economy was under a strain or that serious balance of payments difficulties might develop later inthe year. A loss of confidence could do much more harm than the deterioration in the monetary position which was expected todevelop during the year. In view of the substantial increase in the costs of certain services, there was a good case for early action tomake a prudent provision which would be directly related to this expenditure. General measures to check the present rate of economic activity should, in his opinion, be considered as a separate problem,especially as it was possible to introduce measures of that kind at anyappropriate time.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take note ofthe points made in their discussion.Minute 2.)Education. 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Home(Previous Secretary (C. (60) 49) reporting the results of the examination which reference: the Education Policy Committee had made -of the report of theC.C. (59) 62nd Central Advisory Council for Education (the Crowther Report). TheConcll,s:ons. Committee had reached -the conclusion that it would be impracticable for the Government to undertake at this stage to implement themain recommendations of the Crowther Report, viz., that the school-leaving age should be raised to 16 by a specified date within the nexteight years; and that, within four or five years thereafter, countycolleges should be established for the provision of compulsorypart-time education up to the -age of 18. .The committee recommended, however, that the -Government should intensify their efforts to reduce the size -of school classes; and that, for this purpose,they should undertake to provide 8,000 additional places in teacher training colleges at a capital cost of  12-5 millions over four yearsstarting in 1962 and a recurrent annual expenditure of  4-5 millions from 1965. They -recommended that announcements to this effect should be made in the debates -on the Crowther Report which wereto be held in both Houses of Parliament in the following week.The Cabinet also had before them a memorandum (C. (60) 52)by the Chancellor of the Exchequer drawing attention to the risingcost of the existing educational programme and suggesting that, inview of the many -other competing claims for increased public expenditure, no further commitment for the training of additionalteachers should be accepted at the present time.In support of the recommendation made by the EducationPolicy Committee the foil-owing points were made:(a) The principles of compulsory full-time education up to 16and -compulsory part-time education up to 18 were embodied in theEducation Act, 1944. The Government had put education in the forefront of their Election programme and, in the face -of therecommendations in the Crowther Report, it would be -difficult forthem to admit that they had no practical plans for putting those principles into effect. If, however, they could promise a substantialexpansion in the supply of teachers, they could at least hold out a prospect of reducing the size of school classes -and of reaching, beforethe end of the present Parliament, a situation in which a decision might be taken about the raising of the school-leaving age.(b) The demand for teachers was bound to grow over the next decade. A rising birth rate would increase the school population in this country.   Apart from that, it must be assumed that there
would be an increasing demand for teachers overseas. At theCommonwealth Conference on Education the United KingdomGovernment had undertaken a commitment to provide by 1963 atotal of 400 teachers in Commonwealth countries overseas. provision must be made to enable them to honour that undertaking.(c) Many women teachers left the profession on marriage, buta proportion of these would be willing to re-enter it at a later stageif facilities for refresher courses were available in the training colleges.(d) In paragraph 6 of C. (60) 52 it was suggested that the truecost of this proposal should be determined, not by the cost of theadditional training facilities alone, but by reference to the ultimatecost in terms of pay and pensions of the additional teachers trained.As against this it was argued that if these additional numbers of teachers were required in the second half of the seventies, theywould have to be provided in any event; whereas, if it were foreseenthat fewer numbers would suffice, the training facilities could bereduced.(e) No expenditure on additional training facilities wouldactually be incurred until the financial year 1962-63.On the other side the following considerations were put forward:(/) It now appeared that, even under existing policy, public expenditure on education (excluding universities) would rise from 816 millions in 1959 to  1,472 millions in 1974 an increase of80 per cent. It had been suggested that the present proposal wouldinvolve an addition of less than 2 per cent; but it was for serious consideration whether it would be justifiable to add anything to thecost of a programme which was already expanding so rapidly.(g) It was estimated that, under the existing programme,education expenditure by local authorities would be doubled overthe next 15 years. This expenditure already represented about 7s. Od.in the pound on local rates. Rateable value could not expand as rapidly as taxable capacity; and it was already doubtful whetherlocal authorities would be able to bear the rising cost of the existing programme.(h) There were many other claims on public expenditure, someof which were listed in paragraph 4 of C. (60) 52. It was evident thatthey could not all be met, and priorities would have to be established.There seemed to be a real risk that this mounting expenditure on education would preclude other desirable developments, in the social services and in other fields.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that in thelight of the Cabinets discussion it would be inexpedient for ministers to undertake, in the forthcoming debates on the Crowther Report,any firm commitment to carry through, in the years 1962-65, a building programme designed to provide additional places in teacher training colleges. Ministers speaking in these debates should takethe opportunity of bringing out the scope of the Governmentsexisting policy for education and the demands which it would make on the national income over the next decade. This should have theeffect of bringing into perspective the recommendations of theCrowther Report. Reference could however be made to theimportance of reducing the size of school classes and, for this andother reasons, increasing the supply of teachers; and it could be stated that it was the Governments aim to provide an additional8,000 places in training colleges at the earliest practicable date.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, in the forthcoming debates in Parliament onthe Crowther Report, Ministers should avoid entering
into any firm commitment to provide, by any specifiedfuture date, a further 8,000 places in teacher training colleges.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, agreed that ministers should re-affirm in these debates the Governmenfsdetermination to reduce the size of school classes and theirrecognition of the importance, for this and other reasons,of increasing the supply of teachers.Parliament 4.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the course of the following week.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.17th March, 1960.
