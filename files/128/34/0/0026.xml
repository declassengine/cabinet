nuclear weapons.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 7thConclusions,Minute 6.)Blue Streak.1. The Prime Minister said that the Defence Committee had for some time been considering what would be the best vehicle fordelivering the United Kingdom contribution towards the nuclear deterrent when the Bomber Force ceased to be an effective means of delivery. Hitherto it had been assumed that this Force would be supplemented, and eventually replaced, by the static ballistic missileBlue Streak. In view of later technical developments, however, theChiefs of Staff had advised that a static weapon of this kind wouldbe excessively vulnerable and that our contribution to the nuclear deterrent, if it was to continue to be effective, must in future be basedon some mobile means of delivery. The Prime Minister said that,during his recent visit to Washington, he had satisfied himself thatwe should be able in due course to obtain from the United States,on acceptable terms, supplies of one or other of the alternative types of mobile weapon, to be armed with a British warhead. In thesecircumstances the Defence Committee had decided that it would be wrong to proceed with the existing programme for the developmentof Blue Streak as a military weapon. There was a possibility that the blue Streak programme could be adapted for the development of arocket for use in space research; and this possibility would now be explored in detail in consultation with the firms concerned.This decision was of close concern to the Australian Governmentin view of their expenditure on the range at Woomera. The PrimeMinister of Australia had therefore been kept fully informed of the strategic arguments and he concurred in the view that Blue Streakshould not be further developed as a military weapon.It was proposed that this decision should be announced in theHouse of Commons by the Minister of Defence that afternoon.The Cabinet Confirmed the decision that the further development of theballistic missile Blue Streak as a military weapon should be abandoned.Parliament.        2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the week after the Easter recess.EconomicSituation.Balance ofPayments.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 22ndConclusions,Minute 4.)OverseaDevelopment.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 15thConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Cabinet resumed their discussions of a memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 60) about the prospects for the balance of payments during 1960 and the scale of externalexpenditure in the period 1960-63. They also had before them amemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 61)covering a report by officials on oversea development policy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the latest informationtended to confirm the forecast that the external monetary position was likely to deteriorate by about  200 millions in 1960. There was,however, some possibility that the continued increase in the rate ofimports was beginning to moderate. Nevertheless there was asombre prospect that the unfavourable trend in the balance ofpayments might continue for a number of years. On present policiesit was most unlikely that over the next few years our surplus on current account would be enough to enable us to meet our capitalcommitments. In the long run we should have to relate our overseacommitments to the foreign exchange earning capacity of the economy.If the economy were to proceed on its present course, the growth of exports might be restrained by the competing pull of the home market. It would be undesirable to reimpose physical controls on imports, even if it were possible to do so, because of the possibility of
retaliation. It was not practicable to improve our prospects rapidlyby limiting investment and expenditure abroad. We should thereforebe obliged to rely on a combination of encouraging exports andrestraining the excessive growth of home demand by monetarymeasures.There was general agreement with the measures recommended in C. (60) 61 for the co-ordination of our oversea developmentpolicies. In discussion of the economic situation the following points were made:(a) The warning which the Chancellor of the Exchequer had given about the development of excessive pressures onthe economy had already had a valuable effect on the credit policies of the banks. It might in due course benecessary to introduce moderate measures to restrain theincrease in hire-purchase and other credit facilities.(b) A general exhortation to encourage exports would not be useful. It would be better to concentrate encouragement and advice on those firms whose export performancecould be improved. The possibility of devising somefiscal preference for exports might be re-examined,,although on general grounds it would not be in our interest to introduce anything in the nature of export subsidies.(c) It was increasingly difficult to achieve any considerable increase in export earnings because of the growingcompetition from other industrial countries. Our exportprospects would be much improved if our industrialcompetitors would open their markets more freely to the raw materials which our main oversea customers needed to sell if they were to expand their markets for ourmanufactured products.id) It could be argued that, having regard to the vulnerableposition of our balance of payments, we had gone too farin removing quantitative restrictions on imports. On theother hand, the removal of quantitative restrictions herecould be justified in order to prevent the introduction ofretaliatory restrictions on our exports.The Cabinet-Approved the recommendations in paragraph 48 of thereport on oversea development policy attached to C. (60) 61.Law of theSea.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 22ndConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Committee had before them a memorandum by theLord Chancellor (C. (60) 67) on the latest developments at theInternational Conference on the Law of the Sea at Geneva.The Lord Chancellor said that Denmark was now willing tosupport the Canadian and United States proposal for a six-mile territory sea plus an outer six-mile zone in which the coastal states would have exclusive fishing rights, subject to the phasing-out afterten years of historic rights claimed by fishing States (&quot; six plusphased-out six &quot;), provided that we would undertake to enter intoa bilateral agreement for the phasing-out of our fishing rights off thecoast of the Faroes after only five years or such shorter period as might be agreed for the phasing-out of our rights off the coast of iceland.If, however, both this proposal and the proposal for a twelve-mile territory sea failed to secure the necessary majority in the committee stage of the Conference, a proposal for a nine-mile territorial seawould probably be tabled at a late stage. A decision was requiredwhether a nine-mile territorial sea would be preferable to the breakdown of the Conference without agreement.   If the Conference
CC. 26 (60)were to fail completely, a large number of countries might successfullyassert by unilateral action a twelve-mile territorial sea or an exclusive fishing zone of twelve or more miles, or both. From the point ofview of our fishery interests, a nine-mile territorial sea would be preferable to such a situation; indeed the nine-mile limit would suitour fishery interests better than the Canadian and United states proposal.From the strategic point of view, however, a territorial sea of nine miles was hardly less objectionable than one of twelve; but,provided that the right of innocent passage for warships waspreserved, it could be accepted if the only alternative would be thecomplete failure of the Conference. It was therefore recommendedthat the United Kingdom delegation should be instructed, in the last resort and to avoid a breakdown of the Conference, to support aproposal for a nine-mile territorial sea.In discussion some doubt was expressed about the soundness ofthis suggestion. It was far from certain that the United States couldbe persuaded to support the proposal, and it was essential that forthe time being their views on it should not be sought. The practicalresults of a breakdown of the Conference were difficult to predict.If a substantial number of countries did not in fact unilaterally asserta twelve-mile territorial sea, it was possible that the international court would hold that a limit of no more than six miles was validin international law and would refuse to recognise exclusive fishing rights outside the limit of the territorial sea. Moreover, if we hadvoted at the Conference in favour of a territorial sea of nine milesand that proposal had failed to secure the necessary majority, the factthat we had supported it would count against us if we were laterobliged to claim before the International Court that some narrowerlimit should be recognised. On the other hand, from the point ofview of our fishery and shipping interests and possibly also of our strategic interests, any agreement at the Conference was likely to be preferable to the chaotic conditions which must be expected to result from a failure to agree.The Prime Minister said that the relative merits of the coursesthat might be put to the Conference should be further considered onthe following day, when the result of the voting on the canadian and United States proposal would be known and the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries would be available to report on the latest developments at Geneva.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for futuretactics at the International Conference on the Law of theSea to be further considered by the Ministers concerned ata meeting on the following day.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,&apos;13th April, 1960.
