OverseaCivilService.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 44thConclusions,Minute 7.)1. The Prime Minister recalled that at their meeting on21st July the Cabinet had invited the Colonial Secretary to consider,in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theCommonwealth Secretary, what reduction could be made in thescope of the scheme proposed in C. (60) 116 for relieving colonial governments of the &quot; expatriate &quot; element in the emoluments ofmembers of the Oversea Civil Service. At the meeting which hadbeen held for this purpose the Treasury had been represented by theFinancial Secretary, in the absence of the Chancellor of theExchequer on official duty abroad, and the Chancellor^ position had therefore been reserved. Subject to this it had been agreed that if(i) Colonial Governments were left to pay half the cost of passages ofexpatriate officers, and (ii) allowance were made for the consequentialsavings of prospective future expenditure on the Colonial Office Vote,and (iii) account were taken of the fact that the ultimate cost ofpensions and compensation would be offset by an eventual decreasein the cost of other parts of the plan, the initial cost of the scheme could be presented as  14 millions, instead of  24 millions. TheCommonwealth Secretary and Colonial Secretary were strongly infavour of proceeding with the scheme on this basis.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as the offsettingeconomies had not yet been identified, he was naturally reluctant to take them into account. Moreover, even if the budgetary cost ofthe scheme could be said to amount initially to no more than 14 millions, he would still be concerned at the strain it would impose on the balance of payments of the United Kingdom. It was notpossible to estimate with precision what proportion of this additionalmoney would in fact be spent outside the United Kingdom. In a sense, however, these were points of minor difficulty. His mainconcern was with the mounting cost of public expenditure as a whole and, within that, the rise in expenditure overseas. On several recentoccasions he had felt obliged to draw the attention of his colleagues to the great danger which this represented to Government policy asa whole. He considered it his duty, as Chancellor, to warn the Cabinetthat no fresh commitment involving expenditure should be undertaken at the present time unless it could be matched by a firm assurance that the cost could be offset by savings in other directions. He feltvery strongly that the time was not far distant when the Governmentwould have to consider seriously some major reduction in theiroversea commitments. He doubted, for example, whether thecountry would be able for long to carry the existing burden of military expenditure both in Germany and in South-East Asia.The Colonial Secretary said that, although this was not susceptibleof precise statistical calculation, he was confident that the great bulkof the &quot; expatriate &quot; allowances would be spent in this country andthat the scheme would not impose a significant strain on the balanceof payments of the United Kingdom. On the main question, while he respected the Chancellor^ anxieties, he was convinced that without some scheme of this kind it would be impossible to maintain an efficient administration in the dependent territories for which we were still responsible. All recent experience confirmed the view that, unlesssomething of this kind were done, an increasing number of expatriateofficers would feel compelled to look for alternative careers elsewhere.In that event the administrative structure in territories emergingtowards independence would be undermined.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that in present circumstances high priority must be given tothe maintenance of an efficient system of administration in Coloniesadvancing towards independence. In recent experience in Africa andin Asia there was ample evidence that, without this, the structure of society in emergent countries could easily collapse. This could imply,
not merely a failure of our Colonial policy, but serious damage toour investment in those countries which would impose a much more serious strain on our balance of payments. Action on the lines now recommended would also help to re-establish confidence among theEuropean residents in East Africa. For these reasons there was general agreement that the course recommended by the Common-wealth Secretary and the Colonial Secretary was one which oughtto be taken, even though it carried with it an obligation to seekoffsetting savings in other parts of the Colonial Office Vote or inother sections of our oversea expenditure as a whole.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he did not dissent from the view that high priority should be given to the measures necessary to preserve efficient administration in oversea territoriesdependent on the United Kingdom. He had however thought it rightto warn the Cabinet that, in view of the balance of payments prospects,additional expenditure for this desirable purpose ought not to beallowed to increase the net total of our oversea expenditure.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals outlined in C. (60) 116, subject tothe modification that Colonial Governments shouldcontinue to bear one-half of the cost of passages ofexpatriate officers in the Oversea Service.(2) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to announce, in general terms, before Parliament rose for the summer recess, thatthe Government proposed to transfer to the UnitedKingdom Exchequer the &quot; expatriate &quot; element in the pay and allowances of members of the Oversea Civil Service.(3) Invited the Colonial Secretary to consider how far the costof this new policy could be offset by savings in other partsof the Colonial Office Vote.Common-wealthImmigrants.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 11thConclusions,Minute 8.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (60) 128) calling attention to the continued immigration into the United Kingdom of coloured people from other commonwealth countries.The Home Secretary said that this memorandum was in thenature of a further progress report. He did not recommend anyfurther public action at the present time. It would however be useful if the Cabinet Committee which had previously examined this problem could be reconstituted in the autumn to keep it under review.He also hoped that the Colonial Secretary would continue to pressGovernments in the West Indies, especially in Jamaica, to do all theycould to discourage emigration from those countries.The Cabinet Took note of C. (60) 128 and of the statement made by theHome Secretary.industrial relations.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 33rdConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Minister of Labour said that, following the cabinet&apos;s earlier consideration of the possibility of discussions with employersand trades unions about problems of industrial relations, he had heldinformal consultations with representatives of the British Employers&apos;Confederation and the Trades Union Congress. He had received an assurance that representatives of both bodies would be prepared toconsider jointly how discussions on a number of problems affecting
industrial relations could best be carried forward. He had thereforearranged for a meeting to take place on the following day of the joint consultative Committee, which would be attended by a small numberof representatives from the Confederation, the Trades Union congress and the nationalised industries. He would report to the PrimeMinister on the progress of these discussions.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the Ministerof Labour.housing policy.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 37thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (60) 117) submitting the recommendations of theHousing Policy Committee for legislation on rating and on housing subsidies.The Home Secretary said that in England and Wales the nextrevaluation for rates would take place in 1963. The housing policy Committee had agreed that from that date, when all houses and fiats would be revalued and commercial properties would lose the 20 per cent, relief from rates which they now enjoyed, the present50 per cent, derating of industry and freight transport should also be abolished. For technical reasons it would be necessary that thelegislation required should be introduced early in the session of1960-61; but the Bill was not expected to be seriously controversial,since the total rate burden borne by industry would not be increased.The revaluation of houses and fiats would, however, mean asubstantial increase in the rates payable by householders, and theCommittee had agreed that some temporary measure of relief shouldbe afforded. It would not be possible to determine the proper extentof this until the revaluation was well advanced, and it was therefore proposed that power should be taken in the next session&apos;s Bill tointroduce a measure of derating for householders by Ministerialorder.The Committee had also considered the proposals put forward by the Minister of Housing for legislation to reshape the existing system of housing subsidies so as to ensure that the subsidies payablewere adjusted to the financial position of each local authority andthat artificially low council rents were forced up into line with privaterents. These proposals had already been generally accepted by theCabinet, and the Committee were satisfied that legislation on theselines should be introduced. Further consideration should, however,be given to the details of the new scheme and, in particular, to thelevel of the new subsidies and their effect on the future level of theExchequer commitment to housing.The Committee had found political attractions in the Minister^proposal that the Housing Bill should also empower the Governmentto make or underwrite loans to housing associations to enable themto build houses for letting and to buy, modernise and manage houses which neglectful landlords were allowing to deteriorate. Thefinancial implications of this proposal should, however, be further considered before a recommendation could be put before the Cabinet.The Committee had carefully considered the timing of theproposed legislation on rating and housing subsidies and proposedthat it should be so arranged that the impact of the different changesdid not fall on householders simultaneously. The final results of thedecontrol provisions of the Rent Act, 1957, would provoke in thewinter of 1960-61 pressures which the Government would have to resist. In 1963 householders would be faced with an increase in rates,which could be mitigated as the Committee proposed but not altogether avoided.   The increase in local authority rents, which
would be one effect of the new system of housing subsidies, should therefore have its greatest impact in the year intervening between these other two periods of difficulty that is, in 1962 and for thispurpose the Housing Bill must be introduced some time in the coming session. The Committee were, however, satisfied that, although theBill would be unpopular with council tenants whose rents were increased, the principle to which it gave effect would be widelywelcomed by the Governments supporters and that on balance its introduction would be politically advantageous.The Secretary of State for Scotland, while agreeing generally withthese proposals, said that the timing of the parallel legislation forScotland raised intractable difficulties. The next revaluation inScotland was due in 1961, so that it would be impossible to abolishindustrial derating as early as 1963. He was, however, seeking meansof effecting this earlier than the date of the following revaluation in1966. For similar reasons it would not be possible to provide forthe derating of residential properties in Scotland at the same time asin England and Wales, though some simultaneous statement couldbe made of the Governments intentions in respect of Scotland. Thesame general plan for reshaping housing subsidies could apply to scotland as to England and Wales, though some of the details,including the rate of subsidy, would need to be different and thelegislation should be deferred until the session of 1961-62.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed with theCommittee&apos;s proposals on rating and, in general, with the new systemof housing subsidies. Exchequer expenditure on subsidies would,however, continue under the present system to rise at the rate of 3 to  4 millions a year, and he hoped that it might be possible todetermine the new subsidies at a level which would effect somesubstantial reduction in this rate of increase. He sympathised withthe motives behind the proposal that the Exchequer should assisthousing associations to build houses to let, but he must point out thatit would involve a new form of concealed subsidy and an additionalcommitment which he could not at present see his way to accept.He was, however, willing to agree that officials of the Departmentsconcerned should work out a detailed scheme, on the understandingthat no announcement would be made before the question of includingit in the Bill had again been considered by Ministers.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (60) 117 for legislation onrating and on housing subsidies in England and Wales, tobe introduced in the session of 1960-61.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the housing policy Committee to give further consideration to the timing and content of parallel legislation for Scotland; tothe details of the proposed new system of housing subsidies and, in particular, to its effect on the futureExchequer commitment to housing; and to the proposal in C. (60) 117 for Exchequer loans to enable housing associations to build houses for letting.Coinage5.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the reforms.        Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 119) proposing simplificationand improvement of the present bronze coinage.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the farthing had nowoutlived its usefulness and there was reason to believe that itsabolition would be generally welcomed. This would be a simplestep and could be taken at the end of 1960, after three months&apos; notice.The opportunity might then be taken to sound public opinion on the
6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C. (60) 121) on the latest developments in the fisheriesdispute with Iceland.The Lord Chancellor said that, following the failure of theSecond Geneva Conference in April, prolonged efforts had been made,without success, to persuade the Government of Iceland to negotiatesome form of agreement. The voluntary ban on fishing within the12-mile limit, which our own industry had adopted during and afterthe Conference, was due to expire on 12th August. This self-imposedban might be extended if direct discussions between the fishingindustries of the United Kingdom and Iceland could be arranged.The Committee on the Law of the Sea were satisfied that this was now the most hopeful course to follow. The object of the talkswould be to obtain a modus vivendi under which our trawlers wouldbe allowed for a period of years to fish without interference in certainprescribed areas within the 12-mile limit. The majority of theCommittee felt that the talks would have a greater prospect of successif at the same time it were made known to the Government of Icelandthrough diplomatic channels that they must not assume that our industry would be prepared to extend the voluntary ban after12th August and that, if talks between the industries had not begunor had broken down by then, the United Kingdom Governmentwould have to reconsider the whole position, including the possibilityof resuming naval protection within the 12-mile limit. The majorityof the Committee considered also that, if no progress had been madeby 12th August, the Government should announce their intention to resume naval protection.The Foreign Secretary said that an announcement of our intention to resume naval protection would provoke strong reactionsfrom the Government of Iceland and might even result in itsoverthrow. Possible consequences were a hostile resolution in theUnited Nations, the withdrawal of Iceland from the North atlantic alliance and possibly some Soviet intervention in Icelandic waters.Nor could we then count on the continued support of our allies amongthe fishing nations. A safer course would be for the United Kingdomintroduction, as a matter of convenience, of smaller pennies andhalfpennies. This proposal was, however, complicated by thepossibility that the coinage might at some time be decimalised andwould moreover, affect a wide variety of coin-operated machines.The Chancellor said that he had also considered the possibilityof introducing a smaller crown piece, but he was not satisfied that the trial silver pieces which had been struck would, after a period of use,be sufficiently distinguishable from florins.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that the farthing should be abolished at the end of 1960. Itwas, however, the general view of the Cabinet that, in the absence ofany popular demand, there were insufficient grounds for canvassingpublic opinion on a possible change in the size of pennies andhalfpennies.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to announce that the farthing would be discontinued from the end of1960.(2) Agreed that no further consideration need be given at present to the possibility of a change in the size of pennies andhalfpennies.
industry themselves to threaten that if agreement were not reached a ban would be imposed on landings of fish in this country fromIcelandic vessels (even though the value of these landings was now only about  J million).Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that all reasonable steps must be taken to secure that negotiations between the two industries were set on foot. A mission from the United Kingdom industry should go at once to Iceland and make clear to their counterparts that they must not assume that the voluntary ban on fishing within the 12-mile limit would continueafter 12th August and that if negotiations had not begun or had broken down by that date Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be pressed to resume naval protection within the limit. While no formaldemarche should be made to the Government of Iceland, an indication should be given by Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Reykjavikthat the Government would be pressed to consider taking this step,though they would wish to avoid it. The mission from the UnitedKingdom industry should be asked to keep any discussions going aslong as possible (which would have the additional advantage ofproviding time for the conclusion of the proposed fisheries agreementwith Norway) and a decision to resume naval protection within the12-mile limit should not be taken unless and until the discussions were known finally to have failed.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to arrange for a mission from the United Kingdom fishing industry to Iceland tofollow the line approved in their discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct Her Majesty&apos;ambassador in Reykjavik accordingly.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,26th July, 1960.
