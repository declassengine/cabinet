SECRET 3C.C. 16 (60)Parliament. \    The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (60) 42) on commercial relationswith Japan.The President of the Board of Trade said that at present, byinvoking Article XXXV of the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade, we imposed discriminatory quantitative restrictions on importsof most Japanese manufactures. To maintain this discriminationindefinitely might well lead to a deterioration in political relationsnot only with Japan but with others of our allies, such as the UnitedStates, who attached great importance to keeping the Japanese on the side of the West. It might moreover lead to commercial retaliation by japan. When the Japanese Prime Minister had raised this questionduring his visit to this country last year, he had been told that it was politically impossible for the United Kingdom to cease invokingArticle XXXV unless adequate safeguards were devised to protectour industry from disruptive competition. The Japanese nowrecognised that it would be necessary for us to retain restrictions incertain cases, and they might be prepared to agree that we shouldhave an overriding right to reimpose restrictions if this were necessaryto prevent serious damage. It would be necessary to consider carefully for which industries continued protection would benecessary. We should need to examine whether there were sensitiveindustries in the Colonies whose interest in our market ought to be protected against Japanese competition, and also whether to restrict imports from Japan in those cases where we still restricted importsfrom Commonwealth countries.From the commercial point of view, the effect of the removalof the existing discrimination, subject to safeguards, would in thelong term be fairly evenly balanced. In view of the political considerations, he recommended that negotiations for a commercial treaty with Japan should be resumed, with the object of removingdiscriminatory quantitative restrictions except so far as safeguardswere necessary to protect United Kingdom industries from disruptivecompetition. If a satisfactory treaty could be concluded, and if wecould ensure that the safeguards for our industries were overriding,we should consider ceasing to invoke Article XXXV. Thenegotiations would take a considerable time, and the Cabinet wouldbe informed of their progress before any commitments were accepted.In discussion, doubt was expressed about the capacity of our industries to meet additional competition from low-cost foreignproducers as well as from the developing manufacturing industries inthe Commonwealth and Colonial territories. There were certain industries, such as cotton textiles, which would probably needprotection from Japanese competition for an indefinite period. Inrespect of others, we might adopt the &quot; peril point &quot; procedure so asto enable quantitative restrictions to be imposed automatically whenimports reached a pre-determined level.On the other hand, it was desirable to avoid the imposition ofretaliatory restrictions on our exports to Japanese markets.Moreover, the removal of discrimination against Japan might providea basis for approaching the United States about a reduction in theirrestrictions on imports from Commonwealth countries. It was theview of the Cabinet that on these grounds, and especially in view ofthe international political considerations, it was desirable to beginnegotiations with Japan to see if a commercial treaty with satisfactoryCommercialPolicy.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 2ndConclusions,Minute 9)Relations with japan.
safeguards could be agreed. How far we could accept additionalcompetition from Japanese imports might well depend to some extent on internal economic developments during the year.The Prime Minister said that it was preferable that the discussions should be held in Japan and that they should not begin until the latter part of April. The Japanese could be informed forthwith of our intention, but a public announcement should not be made until the easter Parliamentary recess.The Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendation in C. (60) 42.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrange foran examination to be made of the effect of the proposedcommercial treaty with Japan on United Kingdomindustries, and for a study to be made of the likely growth of industrial competition from the Commonwealth and colonial territories.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the paymaster-General (C. (60) 39) on the financial organisation of the nationalised industries.The Paymaster-General said that the Committee of ministers on the Nationalised Industries had given further thought to theproblem of increasing the financial responsibility of the boards of the nationalised industries. They took the view that greater financial responsibility on the part of the boards could best be achieved bygetting them to accept a clear interpretation of their economic andfinancial obligations, on the basis of precise financial targets. In the short term the financial target would need to be related to whatwas practicable in each industry, having regard to its presentcircumstances. The next step should be to initiate personal discussions about the Government^ general proposals with the Chairmen ofcertain of the boards, and for this purpose an aide-memoire, whichwas attached to the memorandum, had been prepared. Thisprescribed the standard which the nationalised undertakings should endeavour to achieve; and it contemplated that failure to do so would oblige the board to consult the Government, and in some cases to seek approval for detailed plans to put the position right. Althoughthe aide-memoire said nothing about price policy, this question would inevitably be raised by the Chairmen, who would be unwilling toaccept financial targets if they were subject to secret directions by ministers on prices. It would be sufficient for present purposes ifthe Chairmen were asked to give their views about this problem.It was not contemplated that any approach on these lines shouldbe made at present to the Chairman of the British transport commission, in view of the special circumstances of that industry,nor would it be appropriate as yet to initiate discussions with theAir Corporations. It was also the view of the Ministers concerned that any discussion about the reorganisation, as distinct from thefinancial responsibilities, of the National Coal Board should be deferred for the time being.In discussion it was suggested that there had hitherto beeninadequate control over the capital investment plans of the boards of nationalised industries. Regular supervision of the boards in thisrespect would, however, be impracticable, since the Departmentsconcerned would not have the necessary technical resources.Nevertheless, the requirement which was now proposed in the aide-memoire, that a nationalised undertaking which failed to balanceits accounts should submit all major investment proposals forapproval, would ensure a greater degree of governmental control.nationalised industries.(previous references:C.C.

C.C. 16 (60)The Cabinet-Approved the recommendation in C. (60) 39.Wages and prices.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 43rdConclusions.Minute 7.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 40) about the future of theCouncil on Prices, Productivity and Incomes.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Council, whichhad been without a Chairman and therefore in suspense for some considerable time, had been successful in inculcating a greaterawareness among industrialists and others of the interdependenceof prices, profits and wages, and in arousing generally a greaterconsciousness of the risks of inflation. Recent soundings had indicated that for this reason industry would favour the continued existence of the Council and it was possible that Lord Heyworthmight be willing to undertake the chairmanship, although he wouldbe unable to devote time to this work before the autumn. The TradeUnion Congress (T.U.C.), on the other hand, had maintained theirattitude of hostile detachment from the Council. It would not be easy to devise further new and relevant lines of study which theCouncil might undertake without duplicating those covered by itsearlier reports. The best course might therefore be to wind theCouncil up.Discussion showed that it was the view of the Cabinet that there might well be opportunities for the Council to do further useful workin the future. To wind it up now might give the impression that theGovernment were no longer concerned with the importance of wage restraint; and this would be particularly unfortunate, having regardto the recent reports of the Guillebaud Committee on railway men&apos;spay and the Royal Commission on the remuneration of doctors and dentists. But if the Council were to be effective for the future it was desirable that some degree of co-operation from the T.U.C. shouldbe secured. If this proved impossible, there was much to be said forappointing as an additional member of the Council someone whowas or had been associated with the work of the unions.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Council on Prices, Productivity and incomes should be retained in being.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to try to secure theagreement of Lord Heyworth to serve as Chairman.(3) Invited the Minister of Labour to consider further whetherthe co-operation of the Trades Union Congress in thework of the Council could be secured; and, for thatpurpose, to consider in consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer the appointment of an additionalmember to the Council.wages policy.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 15thConclusions,Minute 4.)Buses.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 50th,Conclusions,Minute 9.)5. The Minister of Transport said that the last wage increase for workers in the bus industry had been in June 1958. In November1959, a claim for an increase of  1 a week had been made: this hadbeen rejected by the London Transport Executive (L.T.E.) and theother employers, but the L.T.E. had offered instead a bonus scheme.This was designed to increase efficiency and was said to beself-financing, but it involved an increase of 10s. Od. a week for ahigh proportion of the staff. The offer of a bonus scheme had not so far been accepted. The employers in the municipal section ofthe industry were expected that day to make an offer of 7s. 4d. a week the equivalent of a 4-3,- per cent, increase on present wages togetherwith a reduction of hours to 42 per week.   Meanwhile, the L.T.E.
were seeking authority, whatever the outcome of the municipalemployers&apos; offer, themselves to offer an increase of 7s. 4d. a weekand to increase this if necessary to 10s. Od. a week, the equivalent of 5 per cent.Discussion showed general agreement that a straightforwardincrease of up to 10s. Od. a week would by itself be tolerable, but thatthe Government should not agree that an offer of that amount shouldbe made by the L.T.E. in addition to the bonus scheme which theyhad already offered. The bonus scheme had not been accepted bythe unions and could therefore be withdrawn, although the L.T.E.,who wished to adopt it for managerial reasons, were likely to provereluctant to withdraw it. The L.T.E. should be pressed towithdraw their earlier offer on the understanding that a remodelledbonus scheme, which did not incorporate an increase of 10s. Od. aweek for the high proportion of the staff contemplated by the schemealready offered, would be put forward after the current wage claimhad been settled. After withdrawing their offer of the bonus scheme the L.T.E. should not offer an increase of more than 10s. Od. a weekand should, if this were not accepted, propose that the claim shouldbe referred to arbitration.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Transport to convey to the london transport Executive the decision reached in their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,10th March, I960,
