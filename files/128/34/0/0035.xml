nuclear weapons(previous reference:CC. (60) 26thConclusions,Minute 1)SKYBOLTThe Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister of Defence(C. (60) 97) on the SKYBOLT missile.The Minister of Defence said that, following the agreement inprinciple which the Prime Minister had reached with president eisenhower in March, he had during his recent visit to Washingtonconcluded a memorandum of understanding with the United states secretary of Defence about SKYBOLT to give effect to our intentionto order this weapon if it were successfully developed in a formsuitable for the Mark 2 V-Bombers of Bomber Command. He nowsought approval for the negotiation of a more detailed technical andfinancial agreement with the United States authorities.There could as yet be no absolute certainty that SKYBOLT,which was hot due to be tested as a complete weapon for about ayear, would be successful and it must be recognised that the americans would not develop it for our use alone. However, theUnited States authorities were confident that it would be effective and they attached importance to it both for their own Air Force and asa means of prolonging the effectiveness of our V-Bombers, whichthey recognised were an important part of the strategic nuclear deterrent. By acquiring 144 missiles, with spares and associatedequipment, we should be able in the later 1960s to maintain with theVulcan Mark 2 bombers a deterrent force equivalent to thatpreviously planned for BLUE STREAK. The Victor Mark 2bombers would not be adapted for SKYBOLT, but could be acomplementary component of the deterrent with a developed version of the British powered-bomb BLUE STEEL, if necessary. It wouldbe in our interests to respond without delay to the American desireto expedite the joint development of SKYBOLT, in order to ensurethat it would be fully compatible with our requirements.On present estimates, the cost of our requirement would be between  76 millions and  115 millions (depending on the unit costof the missile), with a dollar content of up to  108 millions. Weshould have to ensure that the price would be based on the cost ofproduction, without any contribution from us to the underlyingdevelopment costs. We should only be committed to purchase if theprice were on this basis and if the weapon was successful.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he felt therewas a danger that the bomber force itself might have become undulyvulnerable by the time SKYBOLT was available, he recognised that,if the weapon were successful, the proposals of the Minister ofDefence might be the cheapest means of maintaining an effective contribution to the Western deterrent. It was not possible to foreseeat this stage the burden that the dollar costs would ultimately involve,but if this proved excessive our policy might have to be reconsideredat a later stage.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement with thecourse recommended by the Minister of Defence. They were informed that there was a promising prospect that the Vulcan Mark 2aircraft would give longer service than originally planned; and thatno need was foreseen at the present time to order additionalreplacement aircraft of this or another type, such as the VC-10, thatwould add to the cost of the programme.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (60) 97.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, to arrange for instructions to be sentto Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington for theconclusion of a technical and financial agreement withthe United States Government on SKYBOLT.
*The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence (C. (60) 98) on POLARIS.The Minister of Defence recalled that the United StatesGovernment had welcomed the assurance which had been given bythe Prime Minister in the course of his meeting with president eisenhower in March that the United Kingdom Government wouldbe agreeable in principle to making the necessary arrangements fora United States tender and a dock for POLARIS submarines to be stationed in Scottish waters. This project had been pursued in therecent discussions which he had held in Washington with Mr. Gates,the United States Secretary of Defence, who had asked that a formal agreement should be reached in time to enable the United states navy to send a dry dock to Scottish waters early in July and a submarine tender before the end of the year.POLARIS submarines would be virtually invulnerable, and theUnited States authorities regarded them as a very important part ofthe diversified deterrent force which they planned to build up. the operational characteristics of these submarines, which would cruisesubmerged for two or three months, would pose complexcommunications and other problems, and careful organisation wouldbe required to ensure the efficiency and reliability of their crews.The United States Government would welcome our close association with the United States Navy in this development and they hopedthat the United Kingdom Government would feel able to participate,if only on a limited scale, in their POLARIS submarine plans. Theuse of facilities in Scottish waters would enhance the effectiveness of the POLARIS force by about 30 per cent. It had been suggestedthat if we could not meet this request the United States authorities might seek facilities at Bremerhaven, but it was doubtful whetherthey would in fact regard this as a satisfactory alternative.He had explained to Mr. Gates that the project raised important political and defence considerations. In order to justify it to publicopinion in this country it would have to be presented as a joint project.This could be achieved if the United States Government were to give us an option to purchase or build our own POLARIS submarines.These, if we decided at a later date to exercise the option, wouldshare the facilities which the American submarines needed in Scottishwaters. It would also be necessary to make it clear that thePOLARIS submarines which we might obtain in this way would be under the ultimate control of the United Kingdom Government. Inthis connexion it would be necessary to consider carefully the relation of any United Kingdom POLARIS missiles to the Medium RangeBallistic Missile scheme under which the Americans envisaged thatPOLARIS would be deployed in Europe as part of the forces of theNorth Atlantic Alliance&quot; (the NATO M.R.B.M. project).Discussion showed that the Cabinet recognised the importancein principle of missile submarines to the Western retaliatorydeterrent. As the closest partner of the United States in the WesternAlliance, it would be desirable that the United Kingdom should be associated with this form of the diversified deterrent, which was wellsuited to our maritime traditions. It would be desirable that the americans should accept a basis of partnership for the facilities they wished to obtain in Scotland and to agree that we had the right toobtain a force of this sort of our own. We might indicate to theUnited States Government that it would be in their own interest, aswell as ours, for the measures which we hoped to agree with themto be of a nature least likely to provoke hostile criticism in the UnitedKingdom. With this object in mind it would be important to avoiddescribing the facilities as an American base in Scotland. It mightbe found that the facilities we were providing need not, at least
initially, be represented as permanent. If it were practicable, afurther possibility which would enhance the attractiveness of the project would be for the United States Government to pay for theconstruction of some of their own POLARIS submarine hulls in theUnited Kingdom.The Cabinet next considered the question of control ofPOLARIS submarines operating from Scottish waters. It wassuggested that, while the United States Government might agree thatwe should have a veto on the firing of any missiles from submarines in our territorial waters (and possibly within some greater distance from the United Kingdom coast line), they could hardly be expectedto agree that we should share in the control of all firings from theirsubmarines operating from Scottish waters. In practice a satisfactory arrangement might be reached if the POLARIS &quot;submarines were placed under the command of the Supreme Allied CommanderAtlantic (SACLANT) in his capacity as an American officer, and ifofficers of the Royal Navy could be associated with the staffsresponsible for the POLARIS project at SACLANTs Headquarters.This concept would, however, be different from that which theUnited States had proposed for the NATO M.R.B.M. project, underwhich command would be exercised by the Supreme allied commander, Europe (SACEUR) and the United States would retain control of the POLARIS warheads assigned to the North atlantic alliance forces. It was not yet certain that the M.R.B.M. projectwould be accepted by NATO; it was open to objection, bothpolitically and militarily, since it would for the first time placeweapons of a strategic deterrent character under the command ofSACEUR and might lead to their deployment in Western Germany.In further discussion it was agreed that an option for the UnitedKingdom to acquire POLARIS submarines would not involve any commitment for their purchase or for their construction in thiscountry. The total capital cost of three submarines for the UnitedKingdom might be of the order of about  150 millions over aboutnine years. It was suggested that our financial resources would notbe sufficient to permit the United Kingdom to embark on a POLARISas well as a SKYBOLT programme.The Cabinet then considered where the facilities required by theUnited States Navy could most suitably be found in Scotland.Gareloch was favoured by the United States authorities because ofthe accommodation and amenities available in the district and itsproximity to Prestwick airport. But it was generally felt that publicopinion would be critical of any proposal to provide facilities in thedensely populated area of the Clyde and that a more isolated place would also be preferable on security grounds. Subject to furthertechnical examination a suitable alternative might be found at LochLinnhe, near Fort William.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that it wouldbe of advantage to the West as a whole and to our partnership withthe United States if satisfactory arrangements could be made for theUnited States Navy to have facilities for the operation of polaris submarines from Scottish waters. It should be possible to justifythe POLARIS project to public opinion if it could be presented asa joint venture and if, through the option to acquire our ownPOLARIS submarines, we were seen to have the right of joiningfully with the Americans in the operation of a submarine deterrentforce if we so desired. In view of the importance of the issues involved, the Cabinet should consider the matter further on23rd June. It was desirable that an urgent technical study shouldbe made with a view to determining the suitability of Loch Linnheand its acceptability, on safety grounds, to the Atomic energy authority.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st June, 1960.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theother Ministers concerned, to submit to the PrimeMinister for consideration at the Cabinet&apos;s meeting on23rd June, the draft of a message to President Eisenhoweron the question of facilities in Scotland for United StatesPOLARIS submarines.(4) Invited the Frst Lord of the Admiralty, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Scotland, to prepare forconsideration by the Cabinet on 23rd June a report onthe suitability of Loch Linnhe for the facilities requiredfor this purpose by the United States Navy.
