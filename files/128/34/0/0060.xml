ContentsEconomic Situation
EconomicSituation(previous reference:CC. (60) 45thConclusions,Minute 6)cc. 60 (60)The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (60) 168) on the economic situation, and memoranda by the President of the Board of Trade on exports(C. (60) 175) and on the incidence of hire purchase controls (C. (60)174).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the most disturbingaspect of the current economic situation was the state of international trade and payments. The recession in the United States and Canada,together with the drop in the prices of primary products, offered apoor prospect for our exports and for the future of world trade. Theposition was aggravated by the imbalance of payments between germany, and to a lesser extent other European countries, and theUnited States and the United Kingdom. The failure of the GermanGovernment to remedy this situation made it likely that the new administration in the United States would be under great pressure to adopt restrictive policies. He therefore proposed to emphasise tothe United States authorities that their adoption of restrictive policieswould make it even more difficult for us to meet our international commitments. It. might be necessary for us, in conjunction with theUnited States, to make it clear that we could not tolerate Germanpolicies which had the effect of forcing deflation on other western countries: there might be an opportunity to do this in the course ofthe meeting of the North Atlantic Council in December.At home, production had been checked without, however, any appreciable slackening in the demand for labour. We should soon be faced with some rise in the index of retail prices, partly for seasonalreasons, and with demands for higher wages which might produce an average increase in wage rates of about 6 per cent. The increasinglevel of Government expenditure entailed additional calls on our resources and increased our economic difficulties, including those ofour balance of payments. It was urgently necessary to bringGovernment expenditure, both at home and overseas, under closercontrol, but this would take some time. If Government expenditure were not curbed, it would be necessary to maintain taxation at a level which would tend to discourage economic initiative and enterprise.Fortunately, confidence in sterling remained strong, and the levelof reserves had not yet reflected the serious position of the balanceof payments. Moreover, there was reason to hope that the level ofimports would gradually decrease and that, with high industrial investment and a satisfactory stock position, goods would be availablefor export when the international situation improved.In these circumstances it seemed premature to adjust the existingrestraints on demand. It would be undesirable to make anyrelaxations which could be taken to imply that the danger of inflationhad lessened. The problem was to find some incentive to increasedeconomic activity which would not provoke excessive wage demandsor involve a heavy bill for additional imports. It was difficult to see what more the Government could do to encourage exports, except toencourage the provision of finance, particularly of medium-termcredit for heavy capital equipment.The President of the Board of Trade said that, while importscontinued at a high level, largely on account of additional stockingof industrial materials, export prospects were bound to be poor forsome time, in view of the decline in economic activity in north america and the low earnings of primary producers. Even whenthe recession in the United States was overcome, an improvementwould not be felt in this country until considerably later. TheGovernment were already helping the export effort in many ways,but there was a strong case for providing an additional stimulus by
encouraging the provision of finance on the longer credit termsappropriate to the export of heavy capital goods. On this he was already in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.While it would be premature to make any general relaxation ofthe existing restrictions on credit, he was concerned about thedisproportionate effects which the current controls on hire purchasewere having on a few industries, notably the motor industry. Inorder to prevent a further serious deterioration in this industry he recommonded that the existing restrictions should be relaxed by extending the period of repayment from two years to three. Thiswould not have an adverse effect on the balance of payments since theresources of the motor industry were not at present fully employed and there were large stocks. He proposed at the same time tointroduce measures to tighten up the hire purchase regulations against certain forms of evasion.In the discussion which ensued the main points raised were asfollows:  (a) Wages. Concern was expressed about the prospect of asubstantial average increase in wage rates which, with the likelihood of a rise in the retail prices index, would revive the inflationary spiral.It was of great importance to discourage wage increases in excess ofthe rate of increase in production, even if this entailed some risk ofindustrial disturbance. At the same time it must be recognised thatthe Governments power to influence the outcome of wage negotiations was limited, especially in view of the frequent recourse to arbitration procedures. Nevertheless, excessive wage increases would be such a heavy burden on the economy as to make it desirable for the Government to encourage employers to resist unjustifieddemands. For example, the engineering employers might be encouraged to adhere to their intention not to accept a demand for wage increases in excess of 5 per cent. More could also be done tobring home to labour the disastrous effect which unjustified wage increases would have on the costs and prospects of exports. Inthis connection it was suggested that the possibility of a more comprehensive approach to wage problems should be re-examined,and that this should not exclude consideration of legislation to enforcewage agreements.(b) Production. While our difficulties were aggravated by theinternational situation, the fundamental weakness of the UnitedKingdom economy was an inadequate rate of growth. If the rate of increase in our production, in relation to the increase in wages, were less than in other countries, our competitive position in world marketswould continue to decline. The lack of dynamism in the economyreflected the current tendency of the citizen to concentrate on theimmediate improvement of his material standard of living. Therehad also been some reduction in the rate of growth of the UnitedState&apos;s economy for similar reasons. But many of our competitorshad a sense of national or ideological purpose which resulted in amuch more dynamic economy.(c) Government Expenditure. It was agreed that high taxationtended to discourage the expansion of economic activity and of exports. But it was recognised that this disincentive could not beremoved unless Government expenditure were brought under control.Much of the Governments expenditure, at home and overseas, was for essential national purposes, and most people nowadays expectedample services to be provided by the State even though this entaileda high level of taxation. It was argued, on the other hand, that people would be more likely to appreciate the heavy cost of those services if they were required to make some direct contribution tothem. It would also be valuable if means could be found of bringinghome to people the economic cost of excessive consumption.   There
was general agreement that an attempt should be made to examinethe future trends in domestic expenditure in relation to national resources.The current imbalance in international payments made itparticularly necessary to reduce the total volume of government expenditure overseas. Within that total it was desirable that additional resources should be made available for oversea information services. The Cabinet were informed that a number of decisions hadalready been taken by the Defence Committee which should resultin some savings in defence expenditure overseas. In view of theunco-operative attitude of the German Government it would be appropriate to consider again the problem of support costs inGermany, and to re-examine the proposal to obtain counterpart funds from the German Government which might be used for overseadevelopment.(d) Imports. There was general agreement that, in case it became necessary to take drastic action to safeguard the balanceof payments, a study should be made forthwith of the various means by which imports could be restricted. In this connection it waspointed out that it would be possible to reduce the import bill by encouraging increased agricultural output at home. A modestincrease in the production of beef, pigs and grains, by inhibitingimports, might save  30-40 millions in foreign exchange. But theincrease in production and the consequent effect on prices would entail an addition to the agricultural subsidies of perhaps  20-30millions. It was suggested that it was desirable to examine whether,by varying the existing incentives, it might be possible to encouragean increased home output of certain products for which at present we relied excessively on imports, without any substantial addition tothe Exchequer subsidy.(e) Hire Purchase. It was argued that it would be illogical to relax the financial restrictions applicable to industry generally beforethe hire purchase controls which had affected the car industry withdisproportionate severity had been adjusted, The car manufacturers&apos;claim that their exports depended on a strong home demand wasbroadly justified. On the other hand an easement of the hire purchaserestrictions in the manner proposed in C. (60) 174 might be criticised,both at home and overseas, as showing that the Government werenot prepared to allow their policy of economic restraint to take full effect. Moreover, frequent small adjustments of the hire purchasecontrols might irritate and confuse industry; it might be preferable to contemplate a more substantial relaxation at a later stage.(/) Exports. There was general agreement on the need toencourage the provision of additional medium-term credit in orderto facilitate the export of heavy capital equipment. It was also agreed that a further examination should be made of the methods by which the Government could assist exporters, even though these might be open to certain objections on international and fiscalgrounds. It might, for example, be found that the difficulties in theway of providing assistance to firms for the specific purpose ofbuilding up an export organisation were not insuperable.Summing up the discussion, The Prime Minister said that the task which faced the Government was to maintain confidence and a sense of proportion in the face of considerable economic difficulties at homeand abroad. It would be necessary to keep in close touch with theUnited States authorities on the need to press the GermanGovernment, for instance at the meeting of the North atlantic council in December, to adopt responsible financial policies, and also on the long-term problem of world monetary resources. meanwhile the possibility of securing savings in our oversea expenditure should
be pursued, and the problem of support costs in Germany should bere-examined. As regards expenditure at home, it would be helpful if the Chancellor of the Exchequer would study, in consultation witha number of other Ministers, future trends in government expenditure in relation to national resources. In case urgent actionto relieve the balance of payments situation became necessary, theTreasury should initiate a study of the various means by which itwould be possible to reduce imports. The Farm Price review committee should examine the possibility of encouraging, withouta substantial increase in the Exchequer subsidy, an increased homeoutput of agricultural products currently imported from overseas.The question of relaxing the hire purchase controls should bediscussed further by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and thePresident of the Board of Trade. They should also give furtherconsideration to means whereby additional medium-term credit for exports could be provided. A more detailed examination should bemade of the various methods by which Government assistance couldbe provided for exports. This should include a radical review ofthe role of the Export Credits Guarantee Department, with a viewto reducing the excessive cost of credit insurance arising from the concentration of the Departments activities on bad risks.The discussion had revealed considerable misgivings about theefficiency and resilience of the economy. There was no doubt thatour economic prospects could be prejudiced by excessive wagedemands. It would therefore be advisable for employers to be encouraged to resist unjustifiable demands for higher wages; and theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Paymaster-General should consider how to pursue this in respect of the current wage negotiations in the engineering and shipbuilding industries.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Defence toconsider what further action might be taken in respect ofthe problem of German support costs.(2) Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to submit a reportto the Prime Minister on the progress made in carryingout the decisions taken by the Defence Committee on thepossibility of reductions in Government expenditure overseas.(3) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would study,in consultation with other Ministers, future trends in domestic Government expenditure in relation to national resources.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for a study to be made of the various means by which it wouldbe possible to reduce imports, if it became necessary todo so.(5) Invited the Farm Price Review Committee to examine thepossibility of encouraging, without a substantial increasein the Exchequer subsidy, an increased home output ofagricultural products currently imported from overseas.(6) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President ofthe Board of Trade to consider further the desirability ofmaking some relaxation in hire purchase controls, and the timing of such a relaxation in relation to any more generalmeasures.(7) Agreed that further consideration should be given to thepossibilities of providing further stimulus for exports including the provision of additional medium-term credit,
CC. 60 (60)the role of the Export Credits Guarantee Department andother forms of Government assistance; and took note that the Prime Minister would consider how these studiescould best be carried out.(8) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Paymaster-General and the Minister of Labour to consider whatrepresentations should be made to the engineering and shipbuilding employers in connection with the currentwage negotiations in those industries.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,30th November, I960.
