SECRET3C.C. 49 (60)Law of theSeaIcelandicFisheries(previous reference:C.C. (60) 47thConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Minister of Agriculture said that the Foreign secretary and he had met representatives of the fishing industry that afternoon.The trawler owners&apos; representatives were prepared to extend for afurther two months their voluntary ban on fishing within 12 miles of Iceland, which would otherwise expire on 12th August, and therepresentatives of the skippers and crews would use their best endeavours to secure the acceptance of the extension. This agreement had been secured on the understanding that if no progress had beenmade by the end of two months the Government, subject to overridingconsiderations which might arise if there were major changes in theinternational situation, would resume naval protection for British trawlers fishing in havens in the six-to-twelve-mile zone. Therepresentatives of the industry would hold meetings in the fishing ports on 9th and 10th August to explain the position. They had assumed that during the extension the instructions to the Royal Navy wouldbe the same as at present, i.e., that naval vessels assigned to duty offIceland should warn any British trawlers which went inside the12-mile limit but should intervene inside the 12-mile limit if necessaryto prevent an arrest on the high seas or to save life.The Foreign Secretary said that the Icelandic Government hadnot yet replied to his message of 4th August which stated the termson which we were prepared to negotiate and asked if they would agree to start talks. The representatives of the industry proposedto announce their hope that immediate discussions would take place with a view to an early settlement of the dispute and to say that,failing a successful conclusion of such discussions within a reasonable period, they intended to exercise their legal right to fish on the high seas within 12 miles of Iceland and fully expected Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to protect their vessels in exercising that right. this might help to convince the Icelandic Government of the need fortalks, but it would be preferable to avoid an official confirmation ofthe understanding about the resumption of naval protection after two months, since this might adversely affect the prospects for negotiations with Iceland. If the Icelandic Government refused tonegotiate our next step should be to demonstrate to internationalopinion the reasonableness of our position, by disclosing the termson which we had been prepared to negotiate and by offering other means of settlement such as mediation through the North atlantic treaty Organisation or arbitration by Canada.Discussion showed general agreement that the representativesof the fishing industry should be given an assurance that theGovernment would resume naval protection at the end of two monthsif no form of negotiation had been started by then and subject to anyoverriding considerations which might arise from a major change inthe international situation.In further discussion the following main points were raised:(a) It would be desirable to complete the fishing agreement with Norway before the end of the extension, but the resumption of discussions depended on the Norwegians and had been delayed bytheir holiday season.(b) After the representatives of the fishing industry had explained the situation at the fishing ports there were likely to be publicreferences to the understanding about the resumption of naval protection after two months, and a form of words should be preparedfor use in answering Press enquiries on this point.(c) If Iceland refused to negotiate, one means of settlementmight be a reference to the International Court. But a carefulassessment would be needed before deciding whether to propose torefer the dispute to the Court since there might be a danger that theCourt would favour a 12-mile territorial sea.
congo republic(previous reference:C.C. (60) 45thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the meeting of the security council of the United Nations which had been arranged to considerthe situation arising from the refusal of the provincial governmentof Katanga to admit United Nations forces had been postponed until later that day. There was some hope of securing an acceptableresolution which would confirm that the role of the United nations forces in the Congo Republic extended to Katanga, but that their role was to preserve law and order and that they were not to be usedto intervene in internal constitutional problems. However, it had now been reported that the United States Government would support a resolution which would in addition call for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Belgian forces from all parts of the congo Republic including Katanga.In order to avoid the danger that other African States mightintervene unilaterally, perhaps with the aid of air transport providedby the Soviet Union, it was most important that the United nations should retain control of the situation. For this purpose, some indication that Belgian forces would withdraw from Katanga was essential. But it would be preferable to avoid precipitate action,and to arrange that their withdrawal should be made in consultationwith the United Nations authorities. Instructions in this sense hadbeen sent to the United Kingdom representative on the security council.In discussion it was pointed out that the British officers atpresent serving in the armed forces of Ghana would be put in amost difficult position if the Government of Ghana pursued their intention to provide forces, not under United Nations control, toassist the Government of the Congo Republic. If that situation aroseit would be necessary speedily to make it clear to the Government of ghana, and to the British officers concerned, that the United KingdomGovernment could not agree to their continuing in service except under the control of the United Nations.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.(1) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to inform therepresentatives of the fishing industry that theGovernment would resume naval protection at the endof two months if no form of negotiations had been started by then and subject to any overriding considerations which might arise from a major change in the international situation.(2) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to continue, for theperiod of the extension, the present instructions to naval vessels assigned to duty off Iceland.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Foreign Secretary, to prepare a form of words for use in answering enquiries about the assurance to the fishing industry.
