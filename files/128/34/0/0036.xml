Cyprus.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 30thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Foreign Secretary said that agreement had now beenreached with the Greek and Turkish Governments on the terms ofan exchange of letters between the United Kingdom Governmentand the Cypriot leaders on the question of the cession of the Britishsovereign areas in Cyprus in the event of its becoming unnecessary toretain them under British sovereignty. The Greek Governmentwould commend the agreed formula to Archbishop Makarios and,if he accepted it, there might be an early settlement of all outstanding questions. If he rejected it and sought to prolong the negotiations,it would be necessary to convene a conference of the three governments. Unless a comprehensive settlement were reachedquickly, it would not be possible to complete the United Kingdomlegislative processes necessary for the establishment of the republic of Cyprus before Parliament rose for the summer recess.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Europe.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 27thConclusions,Minute 2.)Euratom.2. The Foreign Secretary said that, as a result of a resolution of the Assembly of the Western European Union, explanatory discussions were to be held in London with the Ambassadors of thecountries concerned on the possibility of the United Kingdom&apos;s joiningEuratom. The discussions would be concerned with the questionwhether the Western European Union was the appropriate body toconsider the membership of Euratom, and would seek to identify theproblems involved and the difficulties in the way of our joining. Itwas likely that it would take some time to complete these preliminary discussions.In discussion it was agreed that, in order to avoid any appearance of reluctance on our part, we should try to secure that in the proposed discussions the difficulties were brought out by representatives ofother countries. One particular difficulty was our position in relationto the military agreement on the exchange of atomic information withthe United States and the probability that our joining Euratomwould be unwelcome to the Atomic Energy Commission in washington. It was important to make it clear to our partners in theEuropean Free Trade Association, and to the Press in this country,that these preliminary discussions about the possibility of joiningEuratom did not imply any present intention of applying for membership of the European Common Market.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.EconomicSituation.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 27thConclusions,Minute 7.)*3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that earlier in theyear it had been forecast that the trading surplus in the current year would amount to about  160 millions but that the extent of ouroversea commitments would be likely to lead to a deterioration in the external monetary position of about  200 millions. Since thenimports had increased as expected, but the level of exports had beencomparatively disappointing. Although the exchange rate had so far been maintained, the possibility could not be excluded that there might be a loss of confidence in sterling later in the year. the unfavourable trend in the balance of payments seemed likely to57470-1b 2
continue, and on present policies the trading surplus we might expectover the next few years would fall considerably short of what wasnecessary to meet our external commitments.Internally, there was increasing pressure on labour resources, inexcess of the normal seasonal trend. The cost of living hadfortunately remained steady, though a small increase over the nextfew months was likely. The total of bank advances was stillincreasing, though at a somewhat slower rate. There was a growth in all forms of private investment, and the level of public investmentwas likely to be about  100 millions higher than in the previous year.It was too early to be sure what effect the recent restrictions onhire purchase would have, but it seemed clear that a main factor inthe unsatisfactory growth of exports was the strong competition ofhome demand. The combination of an excessive pressure of home demand, the continued decrease in unemployment, the unsatisfactorytrend of exports and the prospect of greater pressure for higher wagesmade it desirable to consider further remedial action. It was notpossible to improve our prospects by immediate action to limit our external commitments, though the need to adjust investment andexpenditure abroad to our foreign exchange earning capacity mighthave to be faced. It would be necessary to rely on stimulating exports,and on measures to moderate yet further the rate of economic expansion.It would not be appropriate, so soon after the earlier action, toimpose further restrictions on hire purchase, but it would be possibleto increase the incidence of the special deposits scheme to check bankadvances. Bank Rate action was also available. It would also be helpful if an early announcement were made to the effect that public investment expenditure in the coming year would be restricted to thesame level as in the current year.In conclusion the Chancellor said that, although it must remainhis responsibility to decide the nature and timing of any monetaryaction of this sort, he would welcome the views of the Cabinet on thegeneral situation.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It was suggested that special action should be taken to stimulate exports, such as an increase in export loans and guaranteesor even some form of fiscal incentive. In reply it was pointed outthat the existing measures for providing export credits werereasonably flexible, and that our real need was to increase exports forwhich we received prompt payment. Moreover, measures in thenature of export subsidies would be contrary to our general commercial interests. The real trouble was that many firms were still not sufficiently export-minded: unlike their European competitors,they tended to concentrate too much on the easier home market.(b) It was suggested that further restrictions would not in factassist exports, which in many cases depended on a large production for home demand. On the other hand, there was evidence to showthat the increase in the home market had not induced manufacturers to reduce their costs or to devote a sufficient proportion of production for exports.(c) It was pointed out that if further restrictions were notdiscriminatory in character they might aggravate the employment situation in the less prosperous areas. In reply it was argued thatthe additional pressure on resources resulting from industrialdevelopment in the less prosperous areas was by no means confined to those areas. If an overall increase in demand were to be avoided,industrial investment in these areas would have to be balanced by areduction in activity elsewhere.(d) For internal purposes, it might well be desirable to restrict the credit base by increasing the incidence of the special depositsscheme.   Bank advances should now be responsive to this action,
Iron and SteelIndustry.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 9thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 94) about the de-nationalisation of the steel industry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that the Government^remaining holdings in the steel industry were the assets ofRichard Thomas and Baldwins (R.T.B.), the prior charges in anumber of companies already de-nationalised, and a few smallcompanies which, though not easy to sell, were gradually beingdisposed of by the Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency.Following the Cabinefs last discussion of this subject, the Agencyhad prepared a plan for the disposal of the remaining holdings, underwhich it was contemplated that the equity of R.T.B. should be the first to be sold. Since then, however, it had emerged that, in addition tothe loan of  70 millions to be made by the Minister of Power and 40 millions of long-term capital to be provided by the Agency, theprogress of R.T.B.&apos;s expansion programme would require a further 75-80 millions of short-term capital during the period up to the endof 1962. In these circumstances the early sale of the R.T.B. equitywould be open to serious objections, both financial and political.Moreover, there was reason to think that it could be sold on more advantageous terms when the company&apos;s expansion programme had got under way. The Chancellor of the Exchequer therefore proposed,in agreement with the Paymaster-General and the Minister of Power,that the first move should be to sell the prior charges, both in R.T.B.and the companies already de-nationalised, and that  50 millions ofC.C. 36 (60)since in general the proportion of advances to deposits had now-returned to the traditional pre-war pattern. In this connexion it waspointed out that no means had as yet been evolved of controllingcredit available from institutions other than banks. Moreover, anincrease in special deposits would not affect the velocity of the creditcirculation, though Bank Rate action might have some effect for thispurpose.(e) It was argued that Bank Rate action had little effect,psychological or otherwise, on the rate of borrowing and that its main purpose was to fortify external confidence in sterling.(/) It was suggested that the banks should he encouraged to discriminate between applications for credit to a greater extent thanthey did at present. There was no reason why they should not givepreference to applications for credit for productive investment,especially to help exports.The Prime Minister said that either internal inflation or a balanceof payments crisis would be most damaging to the Government andto the nation. Corrective action should be taken in time, if there wasa real need for it. Internally there was undoubtedly pressure on resources. But some felt that the remedial action which had alreadybeen taken had not yet had time to take full effect. Nevertheless, afurther restriction of credit could be achieved by a modest increasein the incidence of the special deposits scheme. At the same time thepossibility of encouraging the banks to discriminate in favour of credit applications for productive purposes should be examined.Bank Rate action should be related primarily to the external situation.It had to be remembered that early action of this sort might make it more difficult to rely again on Bank Rate if this proved necessary toprotect sterling later in the autumn.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take account ofthe views expressed in their discussion.
the additional  75-80 millions required by R.T.B. should also beobtained from the public by the issue of new debentures. The date at which the equity could most advantageously be sold could then bedetermined later. Although the sale of the prior charges wouldinvolve the Exchequer in considerable loss, postponement of theirsale was likely to aggravate that difficulty.Discussion showed that there was general support in the cabinet for this proposal. It would go some way to satisfy government supporters who were pressing for progress in the de-nationalisation of the industry and would not necessarily mean that R.T.B. wouldnot have been de-nationalised by the end of the present Parliament.If, however, a proportion of the securities to be issued by R.T.B.were debentures convertible into ordinary shares after, say, 10 yearsrather than straightforward debentures, they might prove more attractive to investors and this arrangement would at the same timeserve as a demonstration that the Government were determinedfinally to de-nationalise the industry.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Paymaster -General and the Minister of Power,to consider the possibility of arranging for a proportionof the proposed new debentures in Richard Thomas and baldwins to be convertible as suggested in the cabinets discussion.(2) Subject to the consideration referred to in conclusion (1),approved the proposals in C. (60) 94.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,.,   21st June, 1960.
