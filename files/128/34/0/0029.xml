contents minute no. subject.      Law of the Sea...............2.      Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers, 19603.     Africa     ..................Economic Aid.
1. The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that, since the cabinet&apos;s last meeting, Ministers had considered two possible courses of action which might be taken following the failure to reach agreement at the Geneva Conference on the Law of the Sea. The first was that an attempt should be made to organise support for aconvention, which could be registered with the United Nations, to thesame effect as the Canadian-United States proposal which had comevery near to being accepted by the Conference. This would providefor a six-mile territorial sea plus six miles of exclusive fishing subjectto the phasing-out of historic rights plus some procedure by whichcoastal States especially dependent on fishing could claim preferentialrights outside the 12-mile limit. In the Minister^ view and that ofthe majority of the Committee on the Law of the Sea, such aconvention would be the best method of checking the general movewhich must otherwise be expected towards unilateral declarations ofa 12-mile territorial sea. He therefore proposed that, afterpreliminary discussions with the Prime Ministers of Canada and australia, who were in London, soundings should be taken among other countries which might be prepared to support such a convention.Concurrently, we should also try to negotiate a North atlantic fisheries pact, which would make no reference to the territorial sea and would be in no way incompatible with a general convention onthe lines proposed. Such a pact would be the best way of allaying the growing impatience of our own fishing industry. A North atlantic fisheries pact might, moreover, deter Norway and other countries from seeking to secure exclusive fishing zones by an immediatedeclaration of a 12-mile territorial sea. The Minister therefore proposed that discussions should be initiated without delay with aview to promoting a convention on the lines of the Canadian-UnitedStates proposal at Geneva and also a North Atlantic fisheries pact.The Attorney-General said that a number of the countries whichhad voted for the Canadian-United States proposal at Geneva wouldbe unwilling to sign a convention to the same effect. The voting atGeneva was likely to have a material influence on the international court in favour of a six-mile territorial sea. To the extent thata convention secured less support, that influence would be weakened.Moreover, the risk must not be ignored that an attempt to organise aconvention on the lines proposed would stimulate the formulation ofa rival convention providing for a 12-mile territorial sea; and if thelatter were to secure as much, or even more, support than the formerthe effect would be very damaging to our interests. The Attorney-General therefore suggested that we should confine ourselves to negotiations for one or more regional fishery pacts.In discussion it was pointed out that, while this was a matter of judgment, it had been the majority view of the&apos;Committee on the law of the Sea that the negotiation of regional fishery pacts alone was likely to accelerate rather than retard a general movement towardsunilateral declarations of a 12-mile territorial sea. It was, moreover,only by insisting at Geneva that fishery limits and the territorial seashould be dealt with together that we had been able to muster asmuch opposition as we had against the advocates of a 12-mile territory sea; and to attempt now to deal with fisheries alone wouldplay into their hands and would also forfeit the good-will of canada and the United States and possibly also of Australia, who were thought to favour a general convention on the lines of the Canadian-United States proposal. It should therefore be made clear in any discussion of a North Atlantic fishery pact which was urgent both because of the attitude of our fishing industry and because of the pressure on the Norwegian Government to declare a 12-mile territory sea or fishery limit-that we would favour such a pact onlyon the basis of its being within the framework of a general conventionSECRET57150-11 .

dealing with the territorial sea as well as fishery limits. At the sametime we should indicate that our support for such a convention was conditional on its commanding adequate support from other countries for example, on an assurance that it would be signed by not lessthan, say, 40 countries, well distributed over the world and if possibleincluding the areas in which the breadth of the territorial sea wascritical from the point of view of defence.In further discussion it was suggested that in response to the pressure from our fishing industry we should be prepared to announce the withdrawal of Royal Navy ships from Icelandic waters pendingnegotiation of some form of fisheries pact. This concession could beput forward as an earnest of our wish to achieve a settlement and asa return for the Icelandic Governments agreement to waive the penalties incurred under Icelandic law by British trawlers which had since September 1958 fished within the 12-mile limit and to offer, forthe future, succour and repair facilities to British trawlers which found themselves in difficulties.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that the best course would now be to invite the Canadian and United states government to take the initiative in approaching other countries who might be willing to support a convention on the lines of their proposalat Geneva, on the understanding that given adequate support we ourselves were in favour of such a convention. We should explain tothem the urgency of our own fishing problems in the North atlantic and indicate that we ourselves intended to take the initiative, and hoped for their support, in trying to negotiate a North atlantic fisheries pact. The Royal Navy ships at present in Icelandic watersshould not be withdrawn until the latter discussions were under way.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary (a) to invite the Canadian Prime Minister to take theinitiative in seeking support for a general convention on. the lines of the Canadian-UnitedStates proposal at the International Conference onthe Law of the Sea at Geneva;(b) to explain to him that we ourselves intended to try tonegotiate a North Atlantic pact dealing withfisheries alone.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, immediately after and in thelight of the consultation referred to in Conclusion (1), tomake a similar approach to the United States Govern-ment.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the. Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and in the light ofreactions to the approaches to be made in pursuance of conclusions (1) and (2) above, to initiate discussions withthe Icelandic, Norwegian and other Governments on theformation of a North Atlantic fisheries pact.(4) Agreed that, when the discussions mentioned in Con-clusion (3) above had been set on foot, tije Royal Navyships specially assigned to duty in Icelandic waters shouldbe withdrawn.Meeting of 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the progress of the discussionsCommonwealth at the current Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.  On them-me*    ioso political and economic questions which had been discussed there hadMmisters, 1360. keen a substantial measure of agreement. But, as had been expected,difficulties had arisen over the question of racial discrimination inSouth Africa. At the outset of the Meeting it had been agreed that,
Africa. 3.   The Commonwealth Secretary said that in the course ofEconomic Aid. discussion on economic questions at the current Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers the suggestion had been made thatthe older members of the Commonwealth might take the initiative in establishing a&quot; Colombo Plan &quot; for Africa which would enable the african countries to build up their own economies. This concept-would have political advantages and might be comparatively cheap;but, even on a relatively modest basis, he doubted whether theresources required could be made available from within the Common-wealth alone and it might be preferable for any such project to be studied in some wider context. It might, however, be suggested thatthe subject should be remitted for detailed examination by officials ofthe Commonwealth countries concerned.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, while recognising thepresentational advantages of the proposal, said that it would not bepossible for the United Kingdom to increase the  26 millions whichwe were expecting to provide annually as economic aid to african countries. Within the limit of the resources available to the Common-wealth it was unlikely that a significant and successful version of theC.C. 29 (60)while it would be contrary to precedent for the conference itself todiscuss the internal affairs of a member country, informal meetingscould be arranged at which the representative of South Africa couldexplain the policy of the Union Government and hear the views ofother delegations. Two such meetings had in fact been held.Unfortunately, however, the South African representative, Mr. EricLouw, had also held a Press conference at which he had made anuncompromising defence of the racial policy of the UnionGovernment; and this had led the Prime Minister of Malaya to makea counter-statement to the Press which was strongly critical ofMr. Louw. As a result feeling on this subject had been exacerbatedand the private meetings had been suspended.Mr. Louw had intended to give notice, in the following week,that a referendum would shortly be held in the Union on the questionwhether South Africa should adopt a republican form of constitution,and to ask whether the other Commonwealth Governments would agree that South Africa should remain a full member of the Common-wealth if she became a republic. It was desirable on many grounds that the Union should remain within the Commonwealth. But the atmosphere at the present Meeting was now such that, if this question were put, it was unlikely to receive a unanimous favourable answer.It was perhaps conceivable that, if Mr. Louw were ready to accept some public statement about the multi-racial character of theCommonwealth, the other heads of delegations might in return beready to agree that South Africa might remain within theCommonwealth as a republic. It was however most unlikely thatMr. Louw would be able to endorse a resolution on the racial questionof a kind which would be acceptable to other delegations. on balance therefore it might be wiser to seek to dissuade Mr. Louw fromraising at this Meeting the question whether South Africa could expect to remain within the Commonwealth if she adopted a republican form of constitution.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister and the commonwealth secretary would seek to avert discussion, during the currentMeeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers, of the questionof South Africa&apos;s continued membership of the Common-wealth.
Colombo Plan could be adopted for Africa. It would be preferable to encourage the International Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment to extend their activities in African countries. The ideaof Commonwealth assistance in Africa might be studied further by officials, but we should recognise that, while it might be possible for united Kingdom aid to Africa to be identified with a Commonwealthagency, it was unlikely that any substantial additional funds would bemade available by other members of the Commonwealth for thispurpose.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that it mightbe expedient to suggest to the Commonwealth Prime Ministers thatthe possibility of a Colombo Plan for Africa should be studied furtherby officials. We should, however, recognise that no substantial additional funds were likely to be forthcoming on this basis in Africa.We should also consider whether any additional help that the UnitedKingdom could give might take the form of a contribution in terms of personnel rather than of finance.The Cabinet-Authorised the Prime Minister to suggest to the Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers that the proposal toestablish a &quot; Colombo Plan &quot; for Africa should be remittedfor further study by officials of the Commonwealth countries concerned.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,6th May, 1960.
