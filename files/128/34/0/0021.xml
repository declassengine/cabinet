Law of theSea.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 17thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the progress of theInternational Conference on the Law of the Sea was rather morefavourable than might have been expected. There were signs thatthe Canadian delegation were beginning to recognise that their proposal of a six-mile territorial sea plus a further six-mile zone inwhich the coastal state would have exclusive fishing rights without qualification had little chance of acceptance, and they might thereforebe willing to support a solution which would preserve some nights forthe fishing states in the outer zone. It might yet, however, provedifficult to secure the acquiescence of the Afro-Asian bloc in this solution.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to keep the ministerial committee on the Law of the Sea informed of developmentsat this International Conference.SouthAfrica.(previous reference :CC. (60) 20thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that the Security Council of theUnited Nations would meet on the following day in response to a request by the Afro-Asian group of member countries that the council should discuss the situation arising from the recent disturbances inSouth Africa. The Council would first have to decide whether this item should be inscribed on their agenda. Although Article 2 (7) ofthe United Nations Charter precluded interference in matters withinthe domestic jurisdiction of members, there was no doubt that the afro-Asian request would gain sufficient support to secure inscription.It was greatly to be hoped that a vote on the procedural issue couldbe avoided, since if we were to vote for inscription we should offendSouth Africa, while to oppose inscription would have serious effects onCyprus. 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that the negotiations in Cyprus(Previous       were now approaching a point at which it would be necessary to reachReference:      final decisions on the size of the sovereign areas and the amount ofC.C. (60) 19th financial aid from the United Kingdom Government to the Republic.Conclusions,    Archbishop Makarios had so far maintained his refusal to discuss a minute 2.)      figure of more than 80 square miles for the sovereign areas.  He was,in addition, now seeking an assurance that nuclear weapons wouldnot be located in these areas. There would be no commitment in thenegotiations to financial aid of an amount greater than that already offered, without further reference to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.It would be undesirable to recall the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, who was conducting thenegotiations in Cyprus, for further instructions, since this would lead the Cypriots to believe that we would make further concessions. Ifhe was unable to make any further progress with the Cypriots on thebasis approved by the Cabinet, it might be necessary to adjourn thenegotiations by common consent. In any case it was likely that further discussions would shortly be necessary between theGovernments of the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey. Ameeting of the Foreign Ministers of all the member countries of theNorth Atlantic Alliance, due to be held in Istanbul in May, might provide a convenient occasion. Alternatively, it might possibly be preferable to arrange a special meeting of the three Prime Ministers.The Cabinet -Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.
our relations with African countries, especially Ghana and Nigeria.If the agenda were accepted without a vote, it would nevertheless bedesirable to support as far as possible the principle of Article 2 (7).For this purpose, the United Kingdom delegate should make it clearthat he would approach the subsequent discussion of the item withthis principle very much in mind.The Cabinet were informed that the Prime Minister was inagreement with this course of action, and that he proposed to send a message to the Prime Minister of South Africa, Dr. Verwoerd,explaining the reasons for these tactics. The message would point outthat our purpose was to concentrate our efforts on moderating the subsequent debate, and that similar tactics had served us well on previous occasions, for example in the debate in the (General assembly on Cyprus.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith the course proposed by the Foreign Secretary. It would be important that the United Kingdom delegate should emphasise theprinciple of Article 2 (7), even though this might make it seem lesslogical for him to refrain from voting against inscription. In thisconnection, it would be inadvisable to refer to the internationalcontext of the subject; but it would be helpful if our delegate were tomake some early reference to the tragic nature of the recent incidents in South Africa, as an indication of our view that a discussion of thematter could be justified on humanitarian grounds.In further discussion it was suggested that the Prime Ministersmessage to Dr. Verwoerd should not suggest that the discussion inthe Security Council should be concentrated on the recent incidentsat Vereeniging and Langa, since this would clearly be regarded bySouth Africa as contrary to Article 2 (7) of the Charter.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, despite the explanationwhich the Prime Minister proposed to send, the South african government might well refuse to take part in the debate in the security council, and they might indeed leave the United Nations. It was unlikely that they would on this account leave the Commonwealth.The continued adherence of South Africa to the sterling area was amatter of great importance.The Cabinet then considered what instructions might be sent tothe United Kingdom delegate for the subsequent debate in theSecurity Council.The Foreign Secretary said that it was not known what resolutionmight be proposed by the Afro-Asian countries. If the resolution werein very moderate terms, expressing regret at the incidents, it might bepossible for our delegate to vote for it, or at least to abstain. If itdemanded action against South Africa, for example by economic ordiplomatic sanctions, we could not avoid voting against it. But sincethe United States Government had undertaken to work for a moderateresolution, there was a reasonable hope that a severe resolution couldbe defeated. It was quite likely that there would be a resolutionproposing an investigation in South Africa by some United Nationsauthority. It might be difficult for us to vote against this, since thatwould have the effect of a veto. It was hardly possible for us to putforward a moderate counter-resolution. The general line which ourdelegate should take in the subsequent debate should be that we wanted to avoid inflaming the situation or isolating the South african government, since that would not be in the interests of any of theinhabitants of South Africa.In discussion it was pointed out that an independent investigationunder the auspices of the United Nations would probably be unacceptable to the South African Government. It would also set amost undesirable precedent for disturbances in Colonial territories.Moreover, positive interference in the domestic jurisdiction of member countries was not in the true interests of the United Nations.
Coal.(previous reference:C.C. (59) 32ndConclusions,Minute 7.)LicensedMines.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Power (C. (60) 62) about small mines operating under licence from the National Coal Board.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Power, said that two-thirds of the licences granted to small mines by the National coal board would expire during the present week. Hitherto these smallmines had undertaken none of the obligations, such as coal stocking,carried by the Board&apos;s own pits. The Board felt that they would bejustified in imposing some reduction in the level of production as acondition of renewal of the licences. The Federation of Small Minesregarded the reductions proposed by the Board as too severe. TheHome Affairs Committee had decided that the Minister should notaccede to the Board&apos;s request that he should press the Federation toaccept some compromise. However, negotiations between the Boardand the Federation were being resumed that day and there was nowsome hope of an agreed settlement. If agreement were not reached, itmight be necessary to consider giving a direction to the Board on the levels of production in the small mines. Meanwhile the Board were willing to extend the existing licences.In addition to reducing production from the small mines theBoard proposed also substantial increases in the royalties payable on coal extracted from them. But, although this proposal was beingstrongly criticised in South Wales, where a large number of the smallmines were situated, the point had not been raised with Che Ministerof Power by the Federation.In discussion it was agreed that the conditions on which the licences of the small mines were to be renewed should, at least for thetime being, be left for negotiation between the Board and theFederation. It was open to question whether Section 3 of the CoalNationalisation Act, 1946, empowered the Minister to direct the Boardnot to impose on the small mines a greater proportional reduction in production than that accepted for their own pits; but there was reasonto think that such a direction would be welcomed by the Board andit was unlikely to be challenged by anyone else.C.C. 21 (60)It was the general view of the Cabinet that, failing a resolution inmoderate terms, our best course would be to try to persuade membersof the Security Council that positive action by the United Nationsought not to be considered until the facts of the recent incidents inSouth Africa had been properly established, as they would be whenthe results of the judicial enquiries now in progress were known. Ifthere were to be an independent investigation by the United Nationsauthorities, it would be preferable for this to be authorised at a later stage and undertaken by the Secretary-General.The Home Secretary said that, as it was uncertain how theproceedings in the Security Council would develop, it might benecessary for Ministers to consider this problem again on the following day. Meanwhile the Foreign Secretary would take into account thepoints made in the Cabinefs discussion and would arrange for instructions to be sent to the United Kingdom delegate at the united nations; and the Commonwealth Secretary would arrange for thePrime Ministefs message to be despatched to Dr. Verwoerd.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for instructionsto be sent to the United Kingdom delegate at theUnited Nations.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to arrange for thePrime Ministefs message to be despatched to thePrime Minister of South Africa.
(1) Agreed that the conditions for the renewal of licences to small mines should, for the time being, be left to be negotiated between the National Coal Board and theFederation of Small Mines.(2) Invited the Minister of Power, in consultation with the attorney-General, to refer the matter to the PrimeMinister if it were considered desirable to give any direction to the Board on this issue.british guiana.(previous reference:CC. (60) 15thConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof State for Colonial Affairs (C. (60) 63) about the conference currentlyin progress on the constitution of British Guiana.The Minister of State for Colonial Affairs said that agreement hadbeen reached at the conference that recommendations should be madeto the Cabinet which, subject to certain conditions, would result inthe grant of full internal self-government to the colony in August 1961.These conditions were that suitable arrangements should be made tosafeguard the rights of public servants, and that the Colonial secretary was agreeable that responsibilities for the police and internal securitycould properly be transferred to elected Ministers in the newconstitution. The British Guiana delegation had, however, now putforward three further requests: that the Premier should at once beempowered to preside in Executive Council instead of the Governor;that he should for the future be entitled &quot; Prime Minister &quot; rather than&quot;Premier&quot;; and that the British Guiana Act, 1928, should be amended so as to remove the power to legislate by Order in Council.The Colonial Secretary had agreed that the Governor should construeliberally the present constitutional requirement that he preside inCouncil &quot; so far as practicable &quot; and should from time to time absenthimself, and had given an assurance that the power to suspend theconstitution under the Act of 1928 would be exercised only for thepurpose of constitution-making or in grave emergency. Apart fromthese concessions he was satisfied that the three further requests of theBritish Guiana delegation should not be granted. Refusal of thethree requests might lead to the breakdown of the conference andpossibly to the resignation of Dr. Jagan and the formation of a new administration, but outbreaks of violence in British Guiana were not expected.The Cabinet -(1) Approved the proposals in C. (60) 63.(2) Authorised the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs to,inform the conference on the Constitution of british guiana that their recommendations, other than thethree proposals discussed in that memorandum,would be accepted by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th March, 1960.
