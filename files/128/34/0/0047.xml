Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe three remaining days of the present session when parliament reassembled on 25th October after the summer recess.Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland.NyasalandConference.(previous references :C.C. (60) 28thConclusions,Minute 5, andC.C. (60) 14thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Colonial Secretary said that the NyasalandConstitutional Conference had so far been occupied with thediscussion of general principles. Wide divergences of view betweenthe parties to the Conference had already emerged and this wouldgive the United Kingdom Government the opportunity, on thefollowing day, to present their own proposals for constitutional advance. These would be broadly consistent with the views whichthe Monckton Commission were likely to express, and it was not thought that the Prime Minister of the Federation would find themunacceptable. The proposals would go some way to meet thedemands of Dr. Banda, for example, in respect of African majorityrepresentation on the Legislative Council. The most difficult point would be the extent of the franchise.From the point of view of the security situation in Nyasaland,the critical period was likely to occur in the following week, whenMinisterial decisions might be urgently required.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Colonial Secretary.Shipping.4.   The Minister of Transport said that, in consultation withCunard Liners, the Paymaster-General and the Economic Secretary, Treasury, he(Previous       had now formulated and put to the Cunard Company revised termsReference:      of Government assistance for the replacement of the Queen Mary.C.C. (60) 39th The Company had agreed that there should be no waiver of interestConclusions,    on the Government loan during the construction period, but that minute 4.)      this interest should be capitalised and added to the principal. Theyhad also agreed that the Government should not undertake any responsibility for the insurance of the ship, and that there shouldbe no abatement of interest if the Company&apos;s earnings fell below3 per cent. These conditions placed a substantial additional burden on the Company&apos;s resources, and in order to secure their agreement to them it had been necessary to concede that profits should not beapplied to the acceleration of repayment of the Governmenfs loanuntil the gross yield on the Company&apos;s equity exceeded 1\ per cent,(instead of 7 per cent, as originally proposed).  In addition, it hadbeen decided that in view of the strong objections to offering a largeGovernment loan at the artificially low rate of interest of A\ per cent.,it would be preferable for Government assistance to be partly in theform of an outright grant, with the remainder as a loan at the normalExchequer rate of lending for comparable periods, now 6 per cent.The proportion of grant and loan would be arranged to be financiallyequivalent to the total amount of assistance authorised by the Cabinet.Finally, in order to give the Company an incentive to minimise thecost of construction, the expenditure would be borne by the CompanyCabinet. 1.   The Prime Minister said that, at this first meeting of thereconstituted Cabinet, he would like to place on record his regret,which he knew would be shared by all his colleagues, at the resignation of Mr. Heathcoat Amory. He also expressed the cabinet&apos;s pleasure at the return of Mr. Thorneycroft, in the officeof Minister of Aviation; and he extended a welcome to Mr. Soameson joining the Cabinet as Minister of Agriculture.
and the Government in the proportion of two-fifths to three-fifths,subject to a maximum Government contribution equivalent to 18 millions. The Company were prepared to agree to assistance on these terms.It was the general view of the Cabinet that these revised terms were a considerable improvement, both from the point of view ofthe Exchequer and for presentational purposes. Although it wouldnot be easy to explain why part of the Government assistance wasin the form of a grant, it would have been more difficult to justify a large Exchequer loan at an artificially low rate of interest.The Prime Minister said that the Company could be informed on the following day that the Government had agreed in principle to provide assistance for the replacement of the Queen Mary onthe revised basis. It would, however, be preferable to defer a public announcement to this effect for a week or two, in order to allow the details of the financial arrangement to be finally settled.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Transport to inform the cunard company that the Government had decided in principle to provide assistance for the replacement of the Queen Maryon the revised basis outlined in the discussion.Law of. 5.   The Cabinet were informed that the British Trawlersthe Sea. Federation had rejected the advice of their leaders that they shouldIcelandic        send a delegation to Iceland to negotiate an agreement with the fisheries.       Icelandic industry which would allow our trawlers to fish for a period(Previous        of years in prescribed areas within the 12-mile limit. While, however,Reference:      they were unwilling to take the initiative, they might still beC.C. (60) 46th persuaded to accept an invitation from Iceland to enter into suchConclusions,    discussions.   The Icelandic representative at the North AtlanticMinute 6.)      Council, Mr. Andersen, would shortly be in London and intendedto hold informal discussions with the Departments concerned andwith representatives of the fishing industry. This opportunity mightbe taken to see whether an invitation to the industry to visit Icelandcould be arranged. It would, however, be necessary to decide before12th August (when the ban on fishing within the 12-mile limit,voluntarily adopted by the United Kingdom industry, would expire)what action should be taken if inter-industry discussions had notbegun or had broken down before that date.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that further efforts should be made to set negotiations on foot, either between the two industries or between the Governments.The most hopeful course would be to arrange through Mr. Andersenfor an invitation to our industry, but if he was unwilling or unableto secure this, a Minister might undertake a mission to Iceland witha view to inducing the Icelandic Government to negotiate.In further discussion the Cabinet considered a number of alternative courses which might be taken if neither of these attemptswas successful:(a) We might announce our intention to resume naval protection for British trawlers fishing in havens in the 6 to 12-milezone for a limited period&apos; say, five or even three years. At thesecond International Conference on the Law of the Sea in theprevious April our support for the Canadian-American proposal fora phasing-out of historic fishing rights in the 6 to 12-mile zonehad won us some moral ascendancy over Iceland; and the resumptionof naval protection on the terms suggested would accord with that proposal, which had come very near to being accepted by theConference. On the other hand, unilateral application of theprinciple without proper diplomatic preparation might well sacrificethe support of our allies among the fishing States and lead to
CC. 47 (60)IcelancTs withdrawal from the North Atlantic Alliance and otherserious international complications.(by At the other extreme, we could inform our industry that wewould not resume protection and that British trawlers would infuture fish within the 12-mile limit at their own risk. This coursewould, however, give rise to serious incidents which would make afisheries agreement with Norway almost impossible and might lead the Danish Government to denounce the Faroes agreement. TheGovernment would, moreover, be strongly criticised for failing toprotect British trawlers.(c) It would be in the interest of the United Kingdom industryto gain time by a voluntary extension of the self-imposed ban onfishing within the 12-mile limit. It might then be possible for theGovernment to complete an agreement with Norway and for theUnited States Government to secure the support they were seekingfor an international convention based on the Canadian-american proposal at the Geneva Conference. The industry were, however,unlikely to agree to extend the ban unless they were givencompensation by the Government; and, even if the trawler-ownersagreed, the skippers themselves would be unlikely to refrain fromfishing within the limit. This course would, therefore, involve thesame danger of incidents and would, in addition, be tantamount toabandoning our rights in international law.(d) A possible alternative would be to refer the dispute for investigation and conciliation by the North Atlantic Council.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that theimmediate need was to make it clear to Mr. Andersen when he wasin London that we took a serious view of the present situation and probable developments and might find ourselves obliged to defendour legal rights. We were, however, still anxious to enter intofriendly negotiations in some form. Mr. Andersen should thereforebe pressed to secure an invitation to the United Kingdom fishing industry to visit Iceland and might be told of our intention, if this were unsuccessful, to send a Minister to renew contact with the icelandic Government. The possibility of a further reference to theNorth Atlantic Council might also be mentioned to him. Meanwhile,it would be useful if a memorandum could be prepared assessing therelative disadvantages of the alternative courses discussed by theCabinet if neither of these two approaches met with success.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries, to arrange that the proposed discussions with Mr. Andersen should be conducted onthe lines indicated by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform Her Majesty&apos;ambassador in Reykjavik of the Cabinefs decision andthe course of the discussion with Mr. Andersen.(3) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for the Committeeon the Law of the Sea (i) to give further consideration, in the light of thediscussions with Mr. Andersen, to the best meansof making progress towards a settlement of the fisheries dispute with Iceland; and to report assoon as possible to the Prime Minister;(ii) to prepare a memorandum assessing the relativedisadvantages of the alternative courses of actionwhich might be adopted if no progress couldbe made.
Cyprus. 6.   The Cabinet were informed that the leaders of the Greek(Previous        and Turkish communities in Cyprus had now indicated their agreedReference:      desire that the Republic of Cyprus should become a member of theC.C. (60) 39th Commonwealth.    They had asked that the United KingdomConclusions.    Government should ascertain informally whether the other membersMinute 2.)      Qf ^Q Commonwealth were likely to look favourably on anapplication from Cyprus for Commonwealth membership.   It was known that some of the member Governments might questionwhether Cyprus could properly be considered to be fully independent,in view of her special relations with Greece and Turkey; and itwould be desirable on that account that the new Republic should first apply for membership of the United Nations, so that its international status would have been determined by an independent body before its application for Commonwealth membership wasformally considered.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that it would be preferable that Cyprus should apply for membership of the United Nations before submitting a formalapplication for membership of the Commonwealth. There was alsogeneral agreement in the Cabinet that, once Cyprus had become amember of the United Nations, the member countries of theCommonwealth would find it difficult to oppose her application for commonwealth membership. So far as the United KingdomGovernment was concerned, a decision by an independent cyprus to remain within the Commonwealth would be a final vindicationof the Governments recent policy in respect of Cyprus. For thisreason it was likely that a majority of Government, supporters inParliament would favour the admission of Cyprus to commonwealth membership though there would be some who would seedisadvantage in this course, and there was some risk of an opendivision of opinion among Government supporters on this issue.The Cabinet (.1) Invited the Colonial Secretary to suggest to the Cypriotleaders that, after independence, they should first apply for membership of the United Nations before submittingany formal application for Commonwealth membership;but authorised him to add that, in the meantime, theUnited Kingdom Government would make informalenquiries to ascertain what attitude other member governments of the Commonwealth were likely to taketowards an application by Cyprus for commonwealth membership.(2) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to take informal soundings among other Commonwealth governments as contemplated in Conclusion (1) above.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,28th July, I960.
