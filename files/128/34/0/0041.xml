Europe.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 36thConclusions,Minute 2.)SECRET   . 3C.C. 41 (60)The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C. (60) 107) covering a report by officials on the future ofthe European Economic Community (E.E.C.) and the broad politicaland economic considerations which should determine whether or notthe United Kingdom should seek to join the Community.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that the PrimeMinister had previously said that the Government would eventuallyhave to choose between (i) initiating a dramatic change of directionin our domestic, commercial and international policies and (ii)maintaining our traditional policy of remaining aloof from Europepolitically, while doing all we could to mitigate the economic dangers of a divided Europe. The report now before the Cabinet clarifiedthe issues which would arise in making that choice. A decision tojoin the Community would be essentially a political act witheconomic consequences, rather than an economic act with political consequences. The arguments for joining the Community were strong. If we remained outside it, our political influence in europe and in the rest of the world was likely to decline. By joining it weshould not only avoid tariff discrimination by its members against our exports, but should also be able to participate in a large and rapidly expanding market. However, the arguments against UnitedKingdom membership were also very strong. We should besurrendering independent control of our commercial policies to a european bloc, when our trading interests were world-wide. Weshould have to abandon our special economic Relationship with theCommonwealth, including free entry for Commonwealth goods andthe preferential system, and should instead be obliged to discriminateactively against the Commonwealth. We should have to devise for agriculture and horticulture new policies under which the burden of support for the farmers would be largely transferred from theExchequer to the consumer, thus increasing the cost of living.Finally, we should sacrifice our loyalties and obligations to themembers of the European Free Trade Association (E.F.T.A.), someof which would find it impossible to join the e.c.. as full members.There were four possible courses for the United Kingdom. Thefirst would be to seek full membership of the Community on theterms of the Treaty of Rome. This was wholly unacceptable, if only because it involved discriminating against the fundamental trading interests of the Commonwealth and in favour of Europe. Secondly,we could seek to negotiate membership of the Community on specialterms. Though we should have to accept in general the common tariff of the Community, we could seek to preserve some free entry for Commonwealth foodstuffs. But, if we were to pursue thiscourse, we should have to accept the fact that our preferentialposition in the Commonwealth (which affected 20 per cent, of our total exports and was considered by industry to be still of substantialvalue) would be progressively eroded. Thirdly, we might seek some form of association with the Community falling short of full membership. This course might be easier for the other members ofE.F.T.A. but it would not enable us to exert as much influence in theCommunity as if we were members of it. Finally, we could stayoutside the E.E.C. and consolidate the E.F.T.A. In the end we mighthave to accept this last course, but we had never visualised it as morethan a second-best to a wider European system.The Chancellor said that his personal conclusion was that weshould be ready to join the Community if we could do so withoutsubstantially impairing our relations with the Commonwealth. we might seek to persuade the other Commonwealth countries to relinquish some of their special advantages in the United kingdom market in order to enable us either to accept membership of theCommunity on special terms or to enter into some form of association
with it. But we should not press that persuasion to the point whereit threatened the Commonwealth relationship. In spite of the pressures for an early decision it would be wrong to be rushed intohasty action. We should try to carry our partners in the E.F.T.A.with us. We should also consult the principal members of theCommonwealth: the forthcoming meeting of commonwealth finance Ministers would provide a suitable opportunity for testingtheir reactions. We should also try to find out what attitude theFrench were likely to take towards any proposal for membership on special terms or association. Finally, if it were ultimately decidedto move in this direction, careful action would need to be taken toprepare public opinion in this country for such a move.The President of the Board of Trade said that the Communitywas based fundamentally on the principle of common policies,determined in common and carried out by a common institution. Weshould find it difficult to renounce our national control of policy,especially in respect of agricultural and commercial policies and our special relationship with the Commonwealth. On the other hand,the development of the Community was a serious economic threat to the United Kingdom, as regards both our trade to Europe andour competitive position in the world. As our economic influencedeclined in comparison with that of the Community, we should find that the United States and other countries would increasingly attachmore weight to the views and interests of the Community.In any negotiation with the Community we should have to seek an agreement which preserved the fundamental trading interests ofthe Commonwealth. It would, however, be disastrous to enter into negotiations until there was a political will in the countries of theCommunity to reach an accommodation with us. France and theUnited States held the key at the moment. Although the french were not now so much concerned at the prospect of industrialcompetition from the United Kingdom, they feared that our membership of the Community would threaten their leadership. Thepresent United States Administration favoured the development ofthe Community, regardless of the difficulties which this would cause for the United Kingdom.The Government should not allow themselves to be pushed intohasty decisions by the campaign in some parts of the Press. Therewas need of an authoritative statement in which the Governmentwould make it clear that this was not a suitable moment for negotiations with the Community and, while expressing readiness towork towards a single trading system in Europe, would emphasise the fundamental objections to United Kingdom membership of theCommunity.The Commonwealth Secretary said that from the point of viewof our future political influence in the Atlantic Community there were strong arguments for joining the E.E.C. We might hope eventually to achieve leadership of it and we could use our influence in it tokeep West Germany independent of the Soviet bloc. On the otherhand our wider interests and influence throughout the worlddepended to a considerable extent on our links with theCommonwealth; and if, by joining the E.E.C., we did fatal damage to these we should lose our power.to exert our influence on a worldscale. An association short of membership would not secure for usenough influence in the Community to make the price worth paying.We should therefore consider full membership, but seek specialterms to meet our fundamental interests and those of theCommonwealth. We should associate the other commonwealth countries with our negotiations at all stages. As a first step, weshould take advantage of the presence of Commonwealth finance ministers in this country in September to see how far they would beprepared to give up their special position in the United Kingdom inthe interests of a wider European settlement.
CC. 41 (60)Discussion showed that the Cabinet fully agreed that the UnitedKingdom could not accept membership of the Community on theterms of the Treaty of Rome. There was also general agreement that, while it was not possible at this stage to distinguish completelybetween membership on special terms and some looser form of association, the latter course would be likely to entail most of the disadvantages of joining the Community while denying us the main political and economic advantages of membership.On the question whether the United Kingdom should seekmembership of the Community on special terms, rather than remainoutside it, it was argued that there was no ground for alarm that membership would commit us to close political integration. As amember, the United Kingdom would be able to influence the political development of the Community and strengthen the forces in it which already preferred a loose confederal arrangement. Although thetime was not yet ripe for negotiations with the Community, we should prepare the ground for later negotiations by discussion with the other commonwealth countries and by strengthening the E.F.T.A.On the other hand, it was argued that the considerations whichwere decisive against full membership of the Community on theterms of the Treaty of Rome weighed almost as heavily againstseeking membership on special terms. Even if a solution to theproblem of free entry for food could be found, any such settlement would be bound to inflict damage on the Commonwealth and upsetUnited Kingdom agricultural policies. Moreover, it was far fromclear that a satisfactory settlement could be reached. There wouldbe the greatest difficulty in reconciling the interests of theCommonwealth, United Kingdom farmers, the E.E.C. and other foreign countries including the United States. The Minister ofAgriculture pointed out that the negotiations concerning wheat alone would present formidable difficulties, and would entail a system of import levies, the reorganisation of our trade agreements with theUnited States and Commonwealth producers, the establishment of a united Kingdom cereals marketing board and the control ofproduction by United Kingdom farmers. There was little possibilityof producing a settlement which would at the same time be fair tothe other Commonwealth countries and acceptable to farmers in theUnited Kingdom.In further discussion it was suggested that the advantages of joining the Community and the dangers of staying outside had beenexaggerated. Many other parts of the world besides Europe wereexpanding rapidly; and as a country with world-wide tradingconnexions we were in a good position to exploit these wideropportunities. To become a member of the E.EC could bepositively harmful to our position in the world, since some of thepolitical and economic policies of the E.E.C. countries did not inspirerespect. France and Belgium had colonial difficulties, Germany wasfollowing an ungenerous credit policy, and the E.E.C. countriesgenerally were seeking to expand their production of primarycommodities at the expense of the less-developed countries. In trying to negotiate a settlement with the Community we might run graverisks of impairing the unity of the Commonwealth and undermining the confidence of its other members in the United Kingdom, with serious financial and economic consequences to ourselves.On the other hand, over a period of years our relationship withthe Commonwealth would in any case change, as would other factors in this problem, including the agricultural difficulties. It would therefore be necessary to adapt our policies to new situations. Itwould be desirable in any case to bring about a greater awareness ofthe problem and of the choice which would eventually have to be
made, by consultation with the Commonwealth, by discussions withthe agricultural and horticultural industries, and by informing publicopinion generally.The Foreign Secretary agreed that the future development of theCommunity might not necessarily entail any close politicalintegration. It could not be ascertained for some time whether theCommunity would accept the United Kingdom as a partner on terms which would enable us to satisfy our existing obligations, particularlytowards the Commonwealth and E.F.T.A. It would certainly be unwise to try to secure satisfactory terms in protracted bilateral negotiations with France. Our aims should therefore be tostrengthen EFT.A., to work for the reduction of tariff discriminationthrough the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to seek thefull co-operation of the Commonwealth countries in finding the best solution of the whole problem, and to improve political relationswith European countries, especially France, so as to create afavourable climate of opinion for an eventual accommodationbetween E.E.C. and E.F.T.A.The Prime Minister said that it was important that the cabinet as a whole should be kept closely in touch with the development ofpolicy on this question. The forthcoming debate in the House ofCommons, probably on 25th July, would provide a useful opportunityfor a further authoritative statement of the Governmenfs attitude.This statement should explain that there were insuperable difficultiesin the way of our accepting membership of the Community under theexisting provisions of the Treaty of Rome, especially in relation toour responsibilities to the Commonwealth; but that we fully acceptedthe establishment of the Community and, with our partners inE.F.T.A., would continue to seek for a mutually satisfactory arrangement between the E.E.C. and the E.F.T.A. The President ofthe Board of Trade should prepare a draft statement on these lines,in consultation with the other Ministers mainly concerned, and should circulate it for consideration by the Cabinet.The Cabinet-Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the other Ministers concerned, to draft a statement ofthe Governmenfs attitude to the problem of political andeconomic relations with Europe, and to circulate it forconsideration by the Cabinet.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th July, 1960.
