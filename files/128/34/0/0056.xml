national health service(previous reference:C.C. (60) 55thConclusions,Minute 2)*The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposals toincrease the National Health Service contribution and to allow private patients to obtain medicines on National Health Service terms, whichhad been put before them in memoranda by the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Home Secretary (C. (60) 148 and 137).The Prime Minister said that the Governmenfs intentions to put the financial structure of the national insurance scheme on a sounderfooting and to increase national insurance contributions and benefits might be prejudiced if the National Health service contribution were increased by Is. at the same time as the national insurance changes came into operation. If the increase in the health service stamp were postponed until July this would have the additionaladvantage that the necessary legislation could be presentedconcurrently with the publication of the Civil Estimates in thefollowing February.Discussion showed that, while there was some support for theview that the increase in the cost of the National Health Serviceought to be met from general taxation, the balance of opinion in theCabinet favoured an increase in the contribution, which publicopinion had come over the years to accept in principle.It was suggested that this measure might meet with less criticism if the increase of 3s. in the national assistance scale rate for a single person, which the Cabinet had agreed might accompany the increasein retirement pensions, were raised to 3s. 6d. This would cost theExchequer an additional  li millions a year; but it might, on theother hand, make it possible to defer for a time any subsequentincrease in national assistance. The Chancellor of the exchequer undertook to give urgent consideration to this suggestion, and toinform the Minister of Pensions before his meeting with the Chairmanof the National Assistance Board later that day.On the timing of the increase in the Health Service contribution,it was suggested that the decision should be announced after, ratherthan shortly before, the coming into operation of the new graduated pensions scheme in the following April, since that would avoidexacerbating the reactions of employers to the inconvenience of introducing the new rates of contribution required by the new scheme.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the increase in the health service contribution would be more easily justified if it were presented in the context of the substantial increase in Government expenditure which would be revealed by the Estimates for the following financialyear. The balance of advantage appeared to lie on the side of introducing the legislation required at the same time as the estimates were published. The increase in the Health Service contribution would then take effect in the following July.In further discussion it was agreed that there would be insuperable difficulty in introducing the proposed concession to private patients either in advance of, or concurrently with, theincrease in the Health Service contribution or such economies in theService as might later be agreed. The concession should not thereforebe made in the coming Session of Parliament. Moreover, no publicindication should be given that the Government were prepared togrant it at some future date, though there would be no objectionto indicating privately to Government supporters who were pressing for it that the Government accepted it in principle (since they hadalready accepted it in principle some nine years before). Thisdecision should be defended on the ground of the present state ofthe national economy and the increasing cost of the National health service.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th October, I960.(1) Agreed that the National Health Service contribution shouldbe increased by Is. from the beginning of July, 1961, andthat the necessary legislation should be introduced atthe time the Estimates for the financial year 1961-62 were published.(2) Agreed that a concession to enable private patients to obtainmedicines on National Health Service terms should notbe made for the time being.(3) Invited the Minister of Health, in consultation with theHome Secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theChief Whip, to prepare a statement about the decisionnoted in conclusion (2), on the lines agreed in their discussion.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give urgent consideration to the proposal that the scale rate ofnational assistance for single persons should be increasedby 3s. 6d., if that were recommended by the national assistance Board.
