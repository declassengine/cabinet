The Foreign Secretary said that it now seemed unlikely thatthe Egyptian Government would agree to the appointment of aBritish Ambassador in Cairo unless we, for our part, accepted theappointment of an Egyptian Consul in at least one of our dependent territories in East Africa.The Colonial Secretary said that such an appointment would bea potential source of embarrassment in any of those territories.Difficulties were perhaps less likely to arise in Tanganyika; and hehad asked the Chief Minister, Mr. Nyerere, whether he would be willing to take this risk, in the interest of securing a restoration of normal diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Egypt.He was awaiting Mr. Nyerere&apos;s reply.The Foreign Secretary drew attention to a resolution, passed onthe previous day by the Assembly of the Western European Union,recommending that negotiations should be opened between the member Governments of the Union with a view to the accession ofthe United Kingdom to the European Economic Community and toother economic organisations of the Treaty of Rome Powers. Thefirst Press reports, which had not reproduced the full text of theresolution, might cause some alarm to Government supporters inthis country and also to other members of the European Free trade association. The resolution had in fact referred to the possibility ofour acceding to the Treaty of Rome on terms acceptable to us. Ithad also included specific reference to the need to take account ofour obligations to the other members of the European Free trade association and of the Commonwealth. The sponsors of theresolution had intended it to be helpful, and it was to be hoped thatit would have this effect.NationalisedIndustriesSalaries ofMembers of boards(previous reference:C.C. (60) 16thConclusions,Minute 3)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the paymaster-General (C. (60) 170) about the salaries of chairmen and members of the boards of nationalised industries.The Paymaster-General said that the present salary system forthese boards divided them into broad categories of importance and provided, within each of those categories, a uniform salary structure.The present salary structure was out of line with that of the largeindustrial undertakings and did not allow the responsible Ministersany discretion to discriminate between individuals in accordance withtheir responsibilities or their personal capacities. The Committeeon Nationalised Industries were satisfied that this system made it more difficult to obtain the services of the best men available to reorganise and run these industries, in particular the railways. they therefore proposed that Ministers should be free in appropriateindividual cases to offer salaries substantially higher than those atpresent payable. Since, however, the introduction of variationsbetween boards on a personal basis would embarrass relationsbetween Ministers and the boards and between the boards themselves,they proposed that the individual salaries of chairmen and members should not, as at present, be published and that only the totalremuneration paid to each board should be disclosed. Thisarrangement might give rise to some political difficulty and theCommittee therefore recommended that, before a final decision wasreached, steps should be taken to ascertain whether it would be acceptable to Government supporters in Parliament.Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
In discussion it was agreed that the salaries of the chairmen and members of the boards of the nationalised industries must be highenough to attract men of the right calibre and that it was not essentialto preserve the principle of parity between boards of comparableimportance. On the question of publication, however, the balanceof opinion in the Cabinet was that an attempt to conceal the salariespaid to individual members was neither justifiable in principle norfeasible in practice. While, therefore, there was no need to makeany general announcement that the present system was to be changed,the responsible Ministers should move gradually to a position inwhich, when making new full-time appointments to these boardsthey would be free to offer, subject to the agreement of the Treasury,such salaries as were necessary to secure the services of the men bestqualified for the posts. The salaries paid should be made public by whatever means was most appropriate on each occasion. It would be appropriate that a start towards this new procedure should be madewith the top appointments in the new structure for the management of the nationalised transport system.The Cabinet Agreed that the salaries of chairmen and members of boards of the nationalised industries should be determined and made public on the basis agreed in their discussion.british transport commission(previous references:C.C. (60) 37thConclusions,Minute 5 andC.C. (60) 20thConclusions,Minute 5)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Transport (C. (60) 176) covering a draft White Paper onthe reorganisation of the British Transport Commission.The Minister of Transport said that the draft White Paperembodied the conclusions which the Ministers concerned had reachedfor the financial and organisational reform of the British transport commission, in the light of the reports which had been received fromthe Special Advisory Group under the chairmanship of Sir IvanStedeford. Under the proposed new structure each of the mainactivities of the Commission (the railways, London Transport, the docks and the canals) would be entrusted to a separate statutoryboard. The British Railways Board would assume the responsibilityfor running the railways as an effective national system, and would exercise overall financial control and direction, including the negotiation of wage rates, while the present area boards would bereplaced by regional boards which would be autonomous in all matters of regional concern and would keep separate regional tradingaccounts. The other undertakings of the Commission would be operated as companies, but would be grouped under a new holding company which would own their assets. To assist in the co-ordinationof the activities of these boards, it was proposed to create a new council to advise the Minister in the exercise of his responsibilities for the nationalised transport undertakings.As regards finance, the White Paper contained proposals to writeoff the accumulated deficits of the Commission, to separate from thetotal capital liabilities a sum cf about  400 millions representingpension funds and savings deposits, to divide the remaining capitalliability among the separate activities, giving the railways a liability of  1,200 millions, and to remove from the railways for the time beingthe liability for interest on  800 millions of this amount. In order togive the railways commercial freedom, it was proposed to remove allcontrol over freight charges and over passenger fares except in theLondon Transport area.If these proposals were to be debated in the House of commons before the Christmas recess, it would be necessary to publish theWhite Paper by 14th December.   The Cabinet might, however,
consider that, in view of the importance of presenting theGovernments proposals in the best possible way, it might be preferable to delay publication for a further week and to defer the debate until after the Christmas recess.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the White Paper neednot be published in time to allow a debate before Christmas. A finaldecision on the date of publication could not be taken until the white paper had been revised, but the aim should be to publish it a few days before Parliament rose for the Christmas recess.In discussion the following were among the main points raised:(a) The Government intended to resist any suggestion that thereports of Sir Ivan Stedeford&apos;s Special Advisory Group should bepublished. It would be easier to carry out this intention if it wereemphasised that responsibility for policy in respect of nationalisedtransport lay with the Government, and not with any other body,and that the proposals which were now being put forward were in fulfilment of the Governments responsibility.(b) Careful consideration should be given to the description of the relation between the British Railways Board and the regional railwayboards. It was desirable to avoid the impression that the central body would be extremely powerful, and it might be preferable tosay that the regional boards would be given full responsibility for all matters except those which must be dealt with by the central board.In this connexion it would be important to emphasise the role of therepresentatives of the regional boards on the central body. this body might be described as consisting of one member from each ofthe regional boards, together with additional members for particularsubjects, such as finance and engineering.(c) Some description ought to be given of the composition ofthe boards responsible for London Transport, the docks and the canals. It would be necessary to consider whether these should include representatives of user interests, and members with experience in labour matters, such as trades union representatives. On balance,it seemed preferable to include representatives of organised labour in the executive boards rather than in any superior advisory body.id) As regards co-ordination it was essential to preserve thepower of the Minister of Transport to decide matters of policy, butat the same time to avoid appearing to make him directly responsiblefor day-to-day administration or for such matters as wages and fares.Since the existing Commission would disappear, it would on balancebe desirable to confer on the Advisory Council the function of advising the Minister in the exercise of his co-ordinating functions,but to make it clear that this body would not have executive or. supervisory powers. In order to make it plain that the council hadno responsibility for roads and in order to avoid embarrassment inother directions, such as the fuel and power industries, it would bedesirable to call it the Nationalised Transport Advisory Council. Toavoid the risk that it might exceed its functions it would be preferable for the Minister of Transport to be its nominal chairman, and this could safely de done as long as the statutory boards were clearlyresponsible for matters such as wages and fares. It would be unnecessary to describe in the White Paper precisely how the council would operate, and the possibility should be left open for a vice-chairman to relieve the Minister of much of its routine business.(e) It was suggested that the need to streamline the organisationand operation of the railways was not sufficiently stressed. The realneed was to secure substantial economies in manpower, and this could be done if the unions could be persuaded to give their full co-operation. At the same time, it would be unwise to stress the needfor economies in manpower until the unions had accepted the
Governments proposals. The White Paper might include a final paragraph explaining that the Government had approached the whole problem from a practical rather than a doctrinaire point of view,that their financial and organisational proposals provided the bestopportunity for the railways to become an efficient and viableindustry, and that they deserved the full co-operation of all parties inthe industry.In further discussion various drafting amendments to the white paper were approved.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Transport to arrange for the draft white Paper attached to C. (60) 176 to be revised inaccordance with the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for the revised draft of the White Paper to be considered by ministers, with a view to its publication shortly before the christmas recess.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (C. (60) 180)submitted by the Home Secretary in his capacity as Chairman of theEducation Policy Committee on the parental means test in relationto grants to students.The Cabinet were reminded that the Government were committed to a radical revision of the existing means test. TheEducation Policy Committee had prepared a plan embodying a revised scale of parental contributions, as an alternative to therecommendation of the majority of the Committee on Grants toStudents (the Anderson Committee) that the means test should be abolished and that at the same time the income tax allowances inrespect of students should be withdrawn. The minority of theAnderson Committee had recommended retention both of the taxallowance and of the means test (on a substantially more generousbasis), and the scale of contributions now proposed was only slightly less generous than this minority recommendation. The plan of whichit formed a part was in some respects more generous, though less soin respect of vacation grants. It would be applied to all students at universities, to those taking comparable courses of further education and those attending teacher training colleges. On that basis theadditional cost of grants to students in the next academic year wouldbe about  10 millions, which was about the same as the cost of the minority recommendation of the Anderson Committee on theassumption that vacation grants were treated as now proposed. Theadditional cost of abolishing the means test on a similar basis wouldbe  15 millions.The Minister of Education said that, while he still consideredthat it would be better to abolish the means test, he accepted the viewof the Committee that it was not practicable to do so at once. he therefore sought the authority of the Cabinet to make an immediate announcement of the Governments decision to introduce, as from october 1961, a radically revised means test, indicating, if pressed,that this would be without prejudice to the possibility of abolitionat some later date. Thereafter the details of the new plan wouldbe negotiated with the local authorities.Discussion showed that there was general support in the cabinet for this proposal. Politically, outright abolition of the means testmight in some ways have been more attractive, though the present proposal avoided one undesirable effect of abolition -that it wouldconcentrate relief at the income levels where it was least needed and,because the tax allowance would not be withdrawn, it would actuallybe more generous at the lower income levels.EducationGrants toStudents(previous reference:C.C. (60) 52ndConclusions,Minute 5)
national theatre(previous reference:C.C. (60) 58thConclusions,Minute 7)6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that at their meeting on 17th November the Cabinet had not been disposed toproceed at the present time with the original project for a national theatre embodied in the Act of 1949. They had invited him toconsider alternative methods of giving Government assistance to the theatre.The Chancellor said that he was due to receive on 9th Decembera deputation representing interests which favoured the establishmentof a national theatre. He hoped that nothing would be said, before he had received this deputation and considered its representations,to indicate that the Government were not disposed to favour theoriginal project. He proposed to review the whole question in thelight of those representations, and of the Cabinefs earlier discussion,and he would submit further recommendations to the Cabinet in due course.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,1st December, 1960.In further discussion it was pointed out that the application ofthe proposed plan to Scotland was being further considered.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal in C. (60) 180 for a scale of parentalcontributions in relation to grants to students.(2) Authorised the Minister of Education to make in general terms an immediate announcement of the Government^decision.(3) Took note that the application of the proposal in C. (60) 180to Scotland was being further considered.
