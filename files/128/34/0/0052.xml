The Queea&apos;s 1.   The Cabinet had before them notes bv the Home SecretarySpeeches on     (q (60) 138 and 139) covering drafts of The Queen&apos;s Speeches on thethe Prorogation Prorogation and Opening of Parliament,and Opening T    ,. ,  ,        ,of Parliament ^n discussion of these drafts various textual amendments were suggested and approved.The Cabinet (1) Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to circulate reviseddrafts of the two Speeches incorporating the amendmentsapproved in their discussion.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to submit the revised drafts forconsideration by the Prime Minister.East AfricanBuildingSocieties2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the colonial secretary (C. (60) 140) on the current financial difficulties of certainbuilding societies in Kenya.The Lord Chancellor said that at a meeting of Ministers whichhad been held earlier that day the Colonial Secretary had urged that,in order to avert a crisis of confidence in Kenya, which might spread to other British territories in Africa, an early statement should bemade that the Governments of the East African territories, with thesupport of the United Kingdom Government, would temporarilyassume control of the assets of these building societies and responsibility for their liabilities. The Economic Secretary, Treasury,who had attended the meeting on behalf of the Chancellor of theExchequer, had not felt able to agree to this suggestion and no decisionhad been reached.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to give further considerationto the proposal put forward in C. (60) 140 and to bring thematter before them again at an early meeting.Distribution ofIndustryNorth BritishLocomotiveCompany(previous reference :C.C. (60) 50thConclusions,Minute 4)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 134) describing the working ofthe special preference scheme for Government contracts and setting out the arguments for extending it to the nationalised industries.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the application ofthis scheme to the North British Locomotive Company might enablethe company to secure part of the contract for the manufacture of anew type of diesel locomotive for the British Transport Commission.The nationalised industries had already agreed in principle to ameasure of preference for firms in development areas. He recognisedthat the Commission^ attitude must be affected by the form in whichthe original tenders had been invited. If, however, the company didnot obtain part of this contract there would be a substantial increasein unemployment in Glasgow, and the locomotive manufacturing industry would all be concentrated in the south.The Minister of Transport said that the Transport commission were proposing to offer this contract to two other firms and took theview that it would be improper for them to divert any substantial partof the order to the North British Locomotive Company. If they did so, the other two firms might accuse them of breach of faith and might also be justified in raising their price for the proportion of the workleft with them. The Commission were not in any event satisfiedthat the North British Locomotive Company could meet their requirements either on price or on delivery dates. He had verified thattenders for this contract had not been submitted by any other firm in
a development area or by the Commission^ railway workshops. Hethought it would be very difficult for the Government to bring further pressure on the Commission to give any part of this contract to this company.In discussion it was generally agreed that it would not be rightto press the Transport Commission to give special preference to theNorth British Locomotive Company.The Cabinet Agreed that no steps should be taken to persuade the british transport Commission to apply the provisions of the specialpreference scheme to the North British LocomotiveCompany.Canada 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theTenure of Commonwealth Secretary (C. (60) 136) covering an Address to TheOffice of Queen from the Senate and House of Commons of Canada prayingJudges that legislation be laid before the Parliament at Westminster to amenda section of the North America Act, 1867, dealing with the tenure of office of certain judges. The memorandum invited the Cabinet to approve the introduction of the necessary legislation.The Lord Chancellor said that the purpose of this legislation wasto introduce a retiring age of 75 for judges of the superior courts inCanada. This was generally in line with recent legislation relating tojudges in this country, save that it would require existing judges whohad already reached the age of 75 to retire as soon as the Act came into operation.The Lord Chancellor also said that the draft Bill embodied inthe Address from the Canadian Parliament did not, in certain mattersof form, accord with the practice currently followed by parliamentary counsel in this country. As these Bills had to be passed by the parliament at Westminster, it would be convenient if parliamentary counsel could be consulted at an earlier stage of their preparation.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that legislation should be introduced in the coming session of Parliament to amend the British North AmericaAct, 1867 in the sense proposed in the Address from theCanadian Parliament annexed to C. (60) 136.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to suggest to theCanadian authorities that, on future occasions when someamendment of the British North America Act was required, they should give Parliamentary Counsel anopportunity to comment on the form of the amending legislation before its terms were submitted to the canadian parliament.EducationGrants toStudents(previous reference:C.C. (60) 34thConclusions,Minute 6)5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister ofEducation and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 141 and 142)about the parental means test in relation to grants to students.The Minister of Education said that the majority of theCommittee on Grants to Students, under the chairmanship ofSir Colin Anderson, had recommended that the means test whichgoverned the amount, if any, of grants from public funds to studentsat universities and other institutions of further education should be abolished and the relevant income tax allowances withdrawn. a minority of the Committee had recommended that the means testshould be retained but made substantially more generous. TheEducation Policy Committee had so far been unable to reach adecision on this question, but some statement on it would have to bemade at the Conservative Party Conference in the following week.The Minister said that, in his view, there was a strong case forabolishing this means test. It was in the national interest that young
people who would benefit from education at university andcomparable levels should not be debarred from receiving it by thefinancial circumstances of their parents. Abolition of the means testwould enable a significant number of able students to remain longerat the grammar schools and to go on to a university. The principleestablished by the Education Act of 1944, that educational advantagesshould no longer be a prerogative of those whose parents were ableto pay for them, had not yet been applied above the level of secondary education. Abolition of the test would, moreover, accord with thecontemporary view that young people of 18 were to be regarded asadults and ought to be financially independent of their parents. Thedifference in cost between abolishing the test (and withdrawing theincome tax allowances) and relaxing the test in its present form was estimated at only . 4J-5^- millions a year, as compared with the 740 millions which was the total annual cost of education. Sincethe publication of the Anderson Committee&apos;s report there had been almost universal support, in both educational and political circles, forthe majority recommendation.The Minister therefore sought authority to announce at theConservative Party Conference that the Government accepted themajority recommendation in principle. If, on financial grounds, itcould not be adopted from the beginning of the next academic year,he hoped that he could be authorised to say that the Governmentwould introduce in the meantime a revised means test substantially more generous than that now in operation. A decision was urgently required since, apart from the coming Conference, it would benecessary within a few weeks to open negotiations with the localauthorities on the amount of the general grant for the followingfinancial year.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that the additional costas between abolishing and relaxing the means test was not great in comparison with the total cost of education. He feared, however, that acceptance of the principle that all parental responsibility ended onthe child&apos;s attaining the age of 18 would stimulate pressures forassistance from public funds in many other fields and that it might prove impossible to confine the concession to students attending full-time courses leading to a university degree or some comparablequalification. From the point of view of social policy, abolition of themeans test was likely to lead to increased State control over entry tothe universities and possibly to increased control over the independent and direct-grant schools. It was, moreover, by no means certain thatabolition of the test would achieve the desired results: if it were accompanied by withdrawal of the relevant income tax allowances,about half of the parents of students holding awards would be in aworse position or in no better position than under the present system.The Chancellor would as soon as possible put before the EducationPolicy Committee alternative proposals for helping those who were most in need.Discussion showed that there was considerable support for theproposal that the means test should be abolished. If, however, itcould be substantiated that abolition would make even worse theposition of those in the lower and middle income groups who were now finding it difficult to secure for their children educationaladvantages from which they were capable of benefiting, then it was clear that abolition would defeat its own end and some alternative method of helping these people should be sought. On the other hand,further examination of the facts might show that the effect of thepresent system was actually to give certain groups of parents moreassistance from public funds than was needed to maintain a student ata university. In such cases some reduction in the amount of assistanceprovided could be defended without difficulty.
Summing up the discussion the Home Secretary said that before a decision should be reached there should be further consideration ofthe effect of abolishing the means test on parents in the middle and lower income groups and of alternative methods of helping them tosend their children to universities and other institutions of further education. Meanwhile, no indication should be given that theGovernment were unfavourably disposed in principle to the abolitionof the means test and the Minister of Education might, at the comingParty Conference, commit the Government at least to some relaxation of the present test.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to put before theEducation Policy Committee (a) a more detailed analysis of the effect on parents in thelower and middle income groups of the abolition ofthe means test and the withdrawal of the relevantincome tax allowances;(b) alternative proposals for assisting parents in these groups.(2) Invited the Minister of Education, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to prepare, for submission to the Prime Minister, a draft of a statement which couldbe made at the Conservative Party Conference.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 144), covering a draft white paper on the public investment programme in 1961-62 and 1962-63.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in accordance withthe Cabinefs decision of 21st June, the estimates of public investment expenditure in 1961-62 had been reduced, with the agreement of theMinisters concerned, to a total of  1,730 millions. This had been achieved by restraining the proposed growth of certain programmes,and in particular by holding investment in the road programme andthe British Transport Commission to a total of  274 millions. Subjectto the settlement of the final details of borrowing by nationalised industries, he invited the Cabinet to approve the programme of public investment expenditure in 1961-62 as set out on page 10 of the draft white Paper and to authorise the presentation of the White Paper.Officials were still studying the proposals for public investment in1962-63 and he would report the outcome to the Cabinet later.Discussion showed that there was general agreement with theestimates of public investment expenditure in 1961-62 set out in theWhite Paper.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals for public investment expenditurein 1961-62 as set out in the draft White Paper attachedto C. (60) 144.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer (i) to arrange for the presentation of the White Paperattached to C. (60) 144, subject to any further amendments which Ministers might have tosuggest:(ii) to consult the Prime Minister, the Home secretary and the Chief Whip on the proposed date of publication of the White Paper;(iii) to report to the Cabinet later on proposals for public investment in 1962-63.investment programme(previous reference:CC.
