1 - j* - &apos; 1      - v C.C...62.(60)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Home Secretary said that the House of Commons had recently passed a resolution calling on the Government to institutean enquiry into the Press. In the debate on the resolution it hadbeen stated that in the Governments view such an enquiry would serve no &quot;useful purpose. He now proposed to say, in reply to parliamentary Questions, that the Government remained of that view.The Home Secretary said that pressure might develop for a(debate to be held before the Christmas recess on the question ofcapital punishment. The Opposition hadv however, tabled an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill to raise the age below; whichsentence of death may not be passed and that amendment would afford an opportunity for a full discussion on the death penalty. Itwould be preferable to avoid having a separate debate on this subject.- The Cabinet-Took note with approval of these statements by the HomeSecretary.CiA\ Service(previous reference:C.C. (59) 15thConclusions,Minute 3)*2., The Chancellor of the&apos;. Exchequer said thatthe economic policy Committee - had been considering (i) the general question ofa new approach to the handling of adjustments in Civil Service pay and (ii) a request for an early increase of pay for grades up to thearbitrable limit.  The object of the new approach was to remove ormitigate some of the more unsatisfactory features of the arrangements which had been in force since the acceptance of the recommendationsof the report of the Priestley Commission on the Civil Service.  Inparticular the frequency with which individual grades could have access to the Pay Research Unit was to be severely reduced, and the units activities were to be planned in a more co-ordinated way.  Itwasj proposed; that the Pay Research Unit should in future reviewindividual classes at intervals of not less than five years; and that-any adjustments called for meanwhile should-.be made by means of central pay settlements covering, with onlyr;a few. exceptions, theentire non-industrial&apos;Civil Service up to the arbitrable limit.   the criterion,; for considering whether a central / pay settlement was justified would be a rise of five poinits; in the Wages Index by the november following the last previous settlement.   Whether thereshould be adjustment and, if so, the amount of it, would be determined,not solely by reference to the movement in the Wages Index, butin tlie light of all available information.;  Any increases would be effective from the following 1st January.   The planned operations of the Pay Research Unit would be geared to a&quot; pay research year &quot;running from 1st July to 30th June; and all pay increases derived fromsurveys by the Unit would be effective from a common operative date,namely 1st January in the middle of the pay/research year.   Thiswould v:&apos;.not/&apos;entirely eliminate retrospection, but. the amount ofbackdating would be much less than had been customary in recentyears. ./:/   ;.;-/&apos;.:&apos;&apos;.&apos;&apos;:&apos;.&quot;/.- - /u-;/-:-:&apos;-r-;--; -   -:; .. Acceptance of this new procedure by the Staff Side of theNational Whitley Council would considerably restrict the freedom ofaction of the Staff Associations. They might1 refuse to accept thenew procedure unless there were an early pay settlement.

3. The Lord Chancellorsaid that the Government of Icelandwere now prepared to accept a settlement of the fisheries disputeon the basis of a 12-mile fishery limit;:a&apos;transitional period of three or possibly four years during which our:fishermen could fish incertain areas within the 6 to 12^mile: zone, provided -that during that period an area outside the 12-mile limit was reserved forIcelandic fishermen; and, immediate changes in certain of the icelandic base lines for the purppsesof the;fishery zone but not ofthe territorial sea.jiThe Icelandic.;^ be prepared togive an assurance tothe effect that they/would continue to work forthe implementation of theVresolution passed&apos;by their Parliament on 5th May, 1959, regarding the extension of fisheries jurisdiction aroundIceland: that six months&apos; notice would be given of the applicationof any such extension; and that in the event of dispute the measures would be referred, at the request of either party, to the international court of Justice.It was now unlikely that we should be able to secure a settlement on more favourable terms and the proposed assurance by the icelandic Government, although unsatisfactory.in fonm, would give us the substantial advantage of the right to refer to the International-Court any proposal to extend the Icelandic fishery limits beyond12 miles. Certain minor amendments of the wording of the proposedassurance, which we regarded as desirable, were likely to be acceptedby the Icelandic Government.Our own fishing industry would have: preferred a transitional; period of five years; but they- especially : disliked - the proposal to reserve!areas for Icelandic fishermen outsideJhed2rmile limit and inreturn for the withdrawaJ of that proposal would be willing to accepta transitional period as short as three years.If we were to reach a settlement on these lines, H.M. ambassador should at once be instructed to inform the Icelandic Governmentthat we would accept- a settlement 1 on the basis of the assurance offered ^subject to certain-minor amendments); immediatechanges in the base lines for fishery purposes alone; and either a transitional period of five years with an area outside the 12-mile limit reserved for Icelandic fishermen, or a shorter period with noreserved area outside that limit. We should propose that the shortertransitional period should&apos;be fouriyears, but should be willing toaccept three: -    ;Discussion showed that the Cabinet&apos;were in agreement with thecourse proposed by the Lord Chancellor. A settlement on these terms would in due course entail the need for some compensation to thefishipg industry, and consideration would have to be given to theform,; such:&apos;;as Government grants for modern of vessels andgear, which this.might best take.The Cabinet-(l).Endco-sed the proposals put.forward by the Lord Chancellor.:.for a settlement of the; fisheries dispute with Iceland.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct H.M. ambassador in Reykjavik accordingly. ;Law of the.Sea vIcelandic&apos; H-&apos;SFisheries   ;&apos;;(previous reference:C.C.

7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 182) on the public investment&apos; programmes for 1962-63.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that the Cabinet had agreed that, to enable investment programmes to be properly planned,minimum programmes should be fixed for 1962-63 within theprovisionally agreed programmes for that year, with the intention that such minima should not subsequently be reduced save in themost exceptional circumstances.   Minimum figures had accordingly been suggested for a number of programmes, set out in group A ofthe Annex to C. (60) 182, which included most of the larger projects.If economic conditions allowed, it might be possible in July to increasethese amounts within the margins ^indicated.   The investment programmes for the British Transport Commission\ and the atomic energy Authority were currently under review, and in due course it should be possible to apply the same procedure to these. Therewere various other programmes, set out in group C of the Annex, forwhich it was not practicable to fix minima at the present time. If theeconomic situation did not allow the minimum programmes whichhad been fixed to be increased to the whole extent of the prescribedmargins, it might well be necessary to call for adjustments to the programmes in group C.The total of the public investment now proposed for 1962-63amounted to  1,810 millions, which; represented a considerable increase over the total for 1961-62: It would be necessary to avoid further increases, and to refrain from entering into any commitments for 1962-63 which might involve an excess over the minima nowproposed; before final decisions about the level of these programmes were taken in July.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The Postmaster-General said that in view of the specialcommercial circumstances of the Post Office he would wish to discuss further with the Chancellor of the Exchequer the total level of investment for the Post Office in 1962-63.(b) The Home Secretary said that he proposed to discuss withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer the need for a small amount ofadditional investment for remand centres and magistrates&apos; courts.(c) If it, were decided to proceed with railway modernisationplans which were at present suspended, this would involve asubstantial increase in the capital investment programme of the british transport Commission.The Cabinet  -(1) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would discuss with the Postmaster-General the level of the PostOffice investment programme for 1962-63.(2) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would discuss with the Home Secretary the question of investment onremand centres and magistrates&apos; courts.(3) Subject to Conclusions (1) and (2) approved the proposals in C. (60) 182.Housing Policy 8.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous Minister of Housing (C. (60) 177) containing a number of proposalsReference: for inclusion in the Housing Bill which was to be introduced afterC.C. (60) 46th the Christmas recess.MinulelTnd The Minister of Housing said that the Housing Policy CommitteeCC (60)51st had considered his proposal that power should be taken m this BillConclusions, to make Exchequer loans, at the rates of interest currently applicableMinute 2) to borrowing by local authorities, to finance schemes by approved(previous references:C.C. (60) 52ndConclusions,Minute 6 andC.C. (60) 43rdConclusions,Minute 5)
housing trusts or associations for building dwellings to let at economicrents. In order to safeguard the position of the Exchequer, theMinister proposed that the total of such loans should be limitedto  25 millions and that the scheme should be reviewed after fiveyears. The scheme would be wholly under his own control; and houses built under it, being counted against the housing programme in the public sector, would not increase the total Exchequer investment in housing. The Minister was satisfied that there was a genuineneed for new houses and flats for people unable to buy, but noaccommodation was at present being built for letting except by thelocal authorities. There was reason to believe that, if a scheme onthe lines proposed could demonstrate that a ready market existed,private enterprise would in course of time cease to concentrate whollyon building for sale. From the political point of view the proposed scheme was the only available answer to the Opposition^ policy of municipal ownership.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that. he had felt it rightto make clear in the Housing Policy Cbmmittee&apos;s discussions thatthe proposed scheme involved a concealed subsidy, in that the housing associations would be enabled to borrow at about six per cent, when in the open market they would be obliged to pay eight or nine percent. But he fully recognised the value of the Minister^ proposal and, more especially as the housing associations were non-profit-making bodies, he would not wish to press the objection. while there would be some risk to the Exchequer, he agreed that the riskwas a reasonable one to accept.In discussion there was general agreement with the Minister^proposals. The control of the scheme, which would be exercised by the Minister himself, the limit of  3,500 on the value of dwellingsto be provided under it and the policy of the housing associations,should together ensure that accommodation provided under thescheme was not let to people whose resources were sufficient toenable: them to provide for themselves,The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposal in C. (60) 177 that the Governmentshould take power in the Housing Bill to make loans to housing associations for building dwellings to let.The Minister of Housing said that the Housing Policy Committeehad also considered two proposals designed to encourage landlordsto carry out much-needed improvements to their property and toincrease the amount of accommodation available by effectingconversions. The Committee had agreed that the amount which a landlord might add to the rent after making improvements should beincreased from 8 per cent, to 12  per cent, of his share of the cost.This would help to remove the deterrent to improvements under theexisting law and the position of the tenants would be protected,since no improvements could be carried out without their consent.The Committee had, however, felt some difficulty about theproposal to reduce from ten to three years the period during whichthere was a restriction on the rents of grant-aided conversions andof decontrolled houses in which grant-aided improvements had beenmade. This proposal would not in fact be a breach of the undertaking given at the time of the General Election that there would be nofurther decontrol of rents in the present Parliament, since these houses were or would become outside control; Landlords were in any event empowered already to sell the houses for owner-occupationthree years after the improvements had been made. The Ministerrecognised, however, that in the present state of political and publicopinion on rents, his proposal might be open to misapprehension and consequent criticism.:
In discussion it was agreed that it would be preferable not toaggravate the political difficulties of the Housing Bill by including in it the second of the two proposals put forward by the Ministerof Housing.The Cabinet (2) Approved the proposal in C. (60) 177 that the Housing Billshould increase the permitted addition to the rent whichmight be charged after improvement from 8 per cent, to121 per cent, of the owner&apos;s share of the cost.(3) Agreed that the period of restriction of the rents of grant-aidedconversions and de-controlled houses improved with the aid of grant should not for the time being be reduced.Europe 9   jhe Cabinet had before them a memorandum by there organisation ;Chancellor of the Exchequer,:(Cf (60) 183) on the reform of theof O.E.E.C.   /Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.)(Previous &apos;Reference: 1 The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the proposal toC.C. (60) 44th   transform the O.E.E.C. into a new Organisation for EconomicConclusions,    Co-operation and Development had arisen froni the need to takeMinute 6)       account of changing economic conditions and to strengthen theeconomic ties between Western Europe and North America.   Thenew Organisation, of which the United States and Canada would..... be full members, would be a valuable instrument for economic co-operation, and would facilitate international consultation on themeans of assisting the less-developed countries, whether or not theywere members of the Organisation. He and the President of theBoard V of Trade would be representing the United KingdomGovernment at a meeting in Paris on 13th and 14th December, themain purpose of which was to approve the draft Convention of thenew Organisation. He sought the Cabinets authority to sign thisConvention.In discussion it was suggested that these changes would give riseSi.3 to some misgivings among countries, including some commonwealth countries, who would not be members of the new Organisation. they feared that it might be concerned to safeguard the interests of the highly industrialised economies of Western Europe and north america. Even so, it was clearly desirable that the United kingdom should support the establishment of this new Organisation andco-operate fully in its work.The Cabinet Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to sign theConvention of the Organisation for^Economic Co-operation and Development on behalf of. r the United KingdomGovernment.CommercialJapan(previous reference:C.C (60) 30thConclusions,Minute 6)10. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer reporting the progress of the negotiationsfor a commercial treaty with Japan.      ^The President of the Board of Trade said that the Japanese had accepted the broad principle that a commercial treaty giving themmost-favoured-nation rights in respect of quantitative import restrictions should contain safeguards enabling us to maintainrestrictions on certain sensitive products and to retain the right to
Suez Finance .       11.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCompany       Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60)163) about the disposal of the government&apos;s holding in the Suez Finance Company.&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Governmentsholding in the Company (formerly the Suez Canal Company)represented about one-third of the equity, and was valued at about 17 millions at current share prices.   Part of the assets of theC.C. 62 (60)impose restrictions on other products if necessary. The next stage of the negotiations would be concerned with the method by whichthis objective should be carried into effect. We could continue to invoke Article XXXV of the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT) under which we imposed discriminatory quantitative restrictions on imports of most Japanese manufactures; but in that event the grant of most-favoured-nation rights on both sides wouldbe on a short-term basis, as would also be the bilateral arrangementsfor safeguarding sensitive products. It would be preferable tonegotiate, without commitment, for a more permanent arrangement,under which we would cease to invoke Article XXXV subject to a bilateral agreement which would allow us to retain restrictions on alist of sensitive items and to impose restrictions on any imports whichin our judgment threatened to disrupt our market. This agreement would last until terminated by mutual consent or until an acceptablesolution for dealing with the problem of market disruption wereevolved in the GATT. It would, however, be essential to resist a japanese proposal that any dispute about the application of the safeguards should be referred to the GATT/Our ceasing to invoke Article XXXV would have general political advantages, and an agreement on the lines suggested would give ourexporters permanent most-favoured-nation rights in the expandingJapanese market. There would be pressure from the Japanese toreduce our list of sensitive items and to limit the time during whichthese items would be protected. But the list of sensitive items whichwe had given to the Japanese negotiators was a comprehensive one.The Japanese would also urge that the restrictions necessary to protectColonial interests in the United Kingdom market should be limitedto traditional Colonial products. They had also suggested that therestrictions on goods in the sensitive list and any restrictions necessaryto avoid disruption of any market should wherever practicable be operated by the control of exports in Japan. This might be acceptableprovided it was clear that Japanese export control was fully effective.In discussion it was pointed out that, if restrictions on Japaneseexports were effected by means of export controls in Japan, this mightwell lead to demands by India and Pakistan that the restrictions ontheir exports of textiles to the United Kingdom should similarly be  effected by export controls in their countries. On the other hand,it was recalled that it had been generally accepted that exportcontrols in India and Pakistan for this purpose would be impracticable.Nevertheless, it was essential to maintain the existing arrangements to protect our textile industry, and the Japanese proposal shouldnot be accepted if it would lead to difficulty in this connexion.The &quot;Prime Minister said that it was the general view of theCabinet that negotiations for a commercial treaty with Japan should proceed on the basis proposed by the President of the Board of Trade.The Economic Policy Committee should be kept closely in touchwith the progress of these negotiations, and should be consulted indue course on the content of the list of sensitive items.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals put forward in C. (60) 181.
Company consisted of the compensation of  29 millions from theUnited Arab Republic, of which three annual instalments of  4-1millions each were still outstanding. There seemed no reason whythe Government should retain this holding indefinitely, but the timing of its disposal was a matter of some difficulty. It was obviouslydesirable to obtain the best price, and at present the shares were thought to be under-valued. Moreover a sale might provoke pressure to supplement the fund of  27-5 millions which had been providedby the Anglo-Egyptian settlement to compensate the former owners of property in Egypt. But the retention of the holding might become embarrassing if, for example, the United Arab Republicdefaulted on the outstanding compensation. On balance it seemedadvisable to be ready to dispose of the Governments holding atthe first favourable opportunity.In discussion it was pointed out;&apos;that the Company had certaininterests in Saharan oil which might turn out to be of considerablevalue. It was also concerned with the promotion of the ChannelTunnel. It seemed desirable that expert opinion should be obtained on the future prospects of the Company before deciding on an earlysale.&apos;The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forfurther consideration to be given to the financial advantages and disadvantages of an early sale of the Governmentsholding in the Suez Finance Company, and to the methodof disposing of the holding.Ford Motor 12.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Ford motor company Company in the United States had entered into a contract to purchase(Previous for dollars the sterling required to enable them to carry throughReference: their offer to buy the 45 per cent, shareholding in the Ford MotorC.C. (60) 58th Company of the United Kingdom which they did not already own.Conclusions, The United States Company expected their offer to be acceptedMinute 3)       by the shareholders.  Contrary to certain reports, the United StatesGovernment had at no time intervened to object to the proposedpurchase.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Tourism 13.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda on tourism bythe President of the Board of Trade and by the Home Secretary(C. (60) 179 and 184).The President of the Board of Trade said that earnings fromoversea visitors formed an important part of our export trade.While there had been a steady increase over recent years, there was still considerable room for improvement, especially in relation tovisitors from Europe. Public attention was constantly drawn tocertain factors which were regarded as obstacles to the expansionof our tourist traffic in particular to our system of immigration control, customs control (especially in relation to motor cars), theshortage of hotel accommodation, the. poor facilities at many of ourseaports and the over-crowding of our holiday resorts because of the peak in our holiday season. The President sought the assistance ofhis colleagues in reducing these and any other obstacles to theexpansion of our earnings from tourism.The Home Secretary said that a considerable amount of preliminary work had already been done on some of the matters
C.C. 62 (60)mentioned by the President. The material prepared could be madeavailable for any further study of the subject which might be instituted. So far as the immigration service was concerned, thefacilities at many of the seaports constituted a severe handicap to efficiency, and he was already in communication with the Ministerof Transport on this point.In discussion it was generally agreed that further efforts shouldbe made to expand our tourist trade. This was a form of exportmore readily capable of expansion than any other, and the objectionsto offering financial incentives to the expansion of exports generallyhad little or no application to it. Additional hotel accommodationwas now being provided in London, but little was being done toimprove the quantity or quality of accommodation in the provinces and special attention should be devoted to this. The most convenientmethod of working on the problem as a whole might be to appoint a Committee consisting predominantly of junior Ministers, to studymethods of expanding tourism in the context of expanding our exporttrade generally.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for aCommittee of Ministers to be appointed to study methodsof expanding the tourist trade.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th December, I960.
