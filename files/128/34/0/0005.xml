industrial disputes.&quot;Railway Wages!(previous reference:C.C. (60) 4thConclusions,Minute 2.)Engineering.&apos;The Minister of Labour said that he was opposed to any statement implying that the Government were formally in touch withthe T.U.C. at this stage. He had been approached by the general secretary of the T.U.C. in a private capacity and had asked him tokeep him in touch with developments. If ;the Government now madea public statement, it might appear that the T.U.C. were conductingtheir discussions at the request of the Government. This would clearly embarrass them and would probably result in their handingthe problem to the Government immediately. The Governmentwould then become involved in the dispute before the dispute betweenthe railway unions had been patched up.Discussion showed that the Cabinet agreed on balance that itwould be advantageous for the Government to defer any public statement until the outcome of the T.U.C. discussions with the railway unions was known. It had to be recognised, however, that theGovernment might well be criticised if they allowed a national striketo take place in the knowledge that the Guillebaud report was likelyto recommend much higher wage increases than the figure which hadbeen suggested for an interim increase. If, following the meeting with the T.U.C, the railway unions were to ask Sir Brian Robertson,Chairman of the British Transport Commission, what interim increasehe had in mind, there would be advantage in his plainly stating a figure of 4 per cent, in an effort to avoid the unions going to the guillebaud Committee. It would be preferable for such an offer totake place in direct discussions between Sir.Brian Robertson and theunions than for such a figure to be discussed in the context of talkscalled by the Ministry of Labour. In the latter event, the ministry would find themselves in a difficult position if they had to argueagainst a proposal by the unions that the Guillebaud Committeeshould be consulted. Sir Brian Robertson took the view that theunions should settle their differences before he made such an offer;:but since strike notices had already been issued for 15th February,the offer should not if possible be delayed beyond 8th or 9th February.The Cabinet were informed that officials had reviewed theemergency machinery and had prepared a draft of a proclamation.Various preliminary arrangements were in hand. It appeared that avery large proportion of stocks of food was riow^ carried by road services, but, if a railway strike did take, place, the carriage of milk and potatoes might cause some difficulty. Officials would report, ifnecessary, on these arrangements to the appropriate ministerial committee.The Cabinet were informed that there was a chance that theengineering trade.-unions would accept the offer made by theengineering employers of a reduction of two hours in the standardworking week, and would be prepared to drop their claim for a wage increase. The view was expressed that it was important, as a matterof principle, for the Government not to intervene in negotiations between private employers and the trade unions.The Home Secretary, summing up, said that the Governmentshould continue for the time being to defer making a statement aboutthe railway situation pending the outcome of the T.U.C. discussions with the three railway unions.   The Ministers concerned should meet,.1. The Minister of Transport said that representatives of theTrades Union Congress (T.U.C.) would formally discuss the presentposition with the three railway unions that day. If the situation were allowed to develop without Government intervention, there was apossibility that the unions would approach the Guillebaud Committeeand learn that an interim wages increase of 5 or 6 per cent, would notembarrass them.
daily if necessary, to keep the situation under review. He was himself in close touch with the work being done by officials to review thearrangements required for an emergency, and would if necessarybring these matters before the relevant Ministerial Committee. Thequestion of principle concerning the Governments position in relationto the claims in the engineering industry should be discussed at ameeting of the Wages Policy Committee on the following day.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Government should defer a statement on therailway situation pending the outcome of the discussion between the T.U.C. and the three railway unions.(2) Took note that the Home Secretary would arrange for ministers to meet as necessary to keep the railway situation under review.(3) Took note of the Home Secretary&apos;s statement concerningemergency arrangements.(4) Took note that the Home Secretary would arrange for ministers to discuss the Governments position in relationto the claims for shorter hours and higher wages in theengineering industry.Law ofthe Sea.IcelandicFisheryDispute.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 1stConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that M. Lange and M. Spaak,the Chairman and the Secretary-General of the North atlantic council, had been using their good offices to try to find some modus vivendi between the United Kingdom and Iceland regarding the fisheries dispute. They had put forward the proposal that the UnitedKingdom should withdraw naval protection from the area within12 miles of the Icelandic coast until the result of the forthcoming conference on the Law of the Sea was known, and that in returnIceland should permanently waive her charges against our fishermenfor alleged past offences against their fishery regulations. Towithdraw our naval protection might, however, prejudice our legal position at the Conference. In any case Iceland was not willing to waive the charges against our fishermen permanently, but only to suspend them until after the Conference. A temporary waiver wasnot acceptable to us. In these circumstances, it might be preferable to ask M. Lange and M. Spaak to propose an alternative arrangement.The United Kingdom Government would attempt to dissuade theBritish fishing industry from fishing within 12 miles of the Icelandiccoast during the period of the Conference. In return we would hope for an understanding with the Icelandic Government that they wouldnot arrest our trawlers if they happened, through navigational orother reasons, to stray within this limit. It would also be necessaryfor our trawlers to be allowed to enter Icelandic ports to put sick menashore and for other emergencies.In discussion it was suggested that the arrangement suggestedby M. Lange and M. Spaak would have a greater effect in creating a good atmosphere in the Conference and might persuade some ofthe uncommitted countries to support the United Kingdom&apos;s case.On the other hand, having regard to the way in which internationallaw was created, there was a real danger that formal acceptance ofthis arrangement might prejudice our legal position. It was important that no incidents within the 12-mile limit should take place duringthe Conference, since this would lose us goodwill. It was therefore desirable that the fishing industry should be persuaded to suspendfishing within the 12-mile limit during the period of the Conference,and that the proposed private undertaking by the icelandic government should be sought in return.
The Home Secretary said that the Cabinet were generally agreedthat the alternative arrangement proposed by the Foreign secretary should be pursued. The manner of handling this problem wouldrequire further detailed consideration.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal that the fishing industry should beasked to suspend fishing within 12 miles of Iceland duringthe period of the Conference on the Law of the Sea; andthat a private undertaking should be sought from the icelandic Government not to interfere with any british vessels which inadvertently strayed within the 12-mile limitduring this period.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for further detailed consideration to be given to the handling of Conclusion (1)above.Germany.Armaments.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 3rdConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (60) 10) about a German request for permission tomanfacture larger warships and influence mines.The Foreign Secretary said that the Federal German Governmentwere prevented under the Brussels Treaty from manufacturingwarships of more than 3,000 tons displacement. The naval plans ofthe North Atlantic Alliance called for a German contribution of12 destroyers. In order that these vessels might be armed withguided weapons, the German Government wanted to be able to buildvessels of up to 6,000 tons. The Germans also wished to constructrepair and supply ships exceeding 3,000 tons, and to manufactureinfluence mines, which they said they could not obtain from other sources.Despite the natural dislike which many people had for german rearmament, it was desirable to encourage Germany to play her full part in the North Atlantic Alliance. It would therefore be advisable to agree to the German request to build warships up to 6,000 tons;but, in view of the fact that it seemed possible for Germany to obtainthe mines they needed from United States or British sources, their request to manufacture influence mines should be refused unless they could show that they had no alternative way of obtaining them.He proposed to seek the agreement of the French, and if possible ofthe other Western European Union Powers, to a reply on these lines.The Minister of Defence said that, if Germany were to play afull part as an equal member of the North Atlantic Alliance in thedefence of Europe, it followed that she must from time to time obtainrelaxations from the limitations on arms production which she had accepted under the Brussels Treaty. To refuse the current requestentirely would provoke deep resentment from the GermanGovernment, and would bring to an end the co-operation in and knowledge of the German defence developments which we at presentenjoyed. The Chiefs of Staff thought that these German guided weapons for warships should not be equipped with nuclear warheads.It would certainly be desirable to ensure that the control of anynuclear weapons in these vessels was reserved under the normal procedure to the Supreme Allied Commander. It might even bepossible to arrange for the guided weapons for the warships to besupplied by British manufacture.
In discussion the following points were made :(a) The German defence programme had fallen behind schedule.This was in part responsible for the present difficulties facing theNorth Atlantic Alliance; the situation would be aggravated if it now appeared that we were preventing Germany from fulfilling her obligations.(b) While it was reasonable that Germany should be equipped with adequate armaments to fulfil her defence obligations in the north atlantic Alliance, it did not follow that she should be allowed todevelop a heavy armaments industry.(c) There would be great advantage if Germany&apos;s requirement for larger warships could be supplied from British manufacture. Thecase for doing this would be strengthened if the guided weaponssystem of these warships was British. The possibility of our meetingthe requirements, not only for the weapons system but also for someof the vessels, should be further explored.(d) It had nevertheless to be recognised that it was likely that,for prestige and other reasons, Germany would decide to manufactureher own warships. Indeed we had to face the prospect of a growingheavy armaments industry in Germany and a steady development inthe German defence potential.(e) The extent to which we were encouraging the rearmament ofGermany and the development of the German heavy armament industry would require careful handling in the forthcoming debate in Parliament on foreign affairs. In this connection, apprehensionwas expressed about the German proposal to obtain logistic andtraining facilities from the Spanish Government. There were obviouspolitical objections to such an agreement, and we should try to ensurethat the proposal was defeated.The Home Secretary, summing up, said that the Cabinet, while recognising the political difficulties of supporting Germanreamament, took the view that, in the interests of the North atlantic alliance and of maintaining our influence on the development ofGerman defence policy, the course proposed by the Foreign secretary should be followed. The question was, however, of such importance that he would report the Cabinet&apos;s view to the Prime Minister.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Home Secretary would report their views to the Prime Minister.(2) Subject to the Prime Minister^ comments, agreed with theproposal in C. (60) 10.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Defence, to be guided in the further negotiations on this subject by the points raised in their discussion.Cyprus.(previous reference:C.C. (60) 3rdConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Foreign Secretary said that it had been suggested thatthe Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies should visit Cyprus. Such a visit might be taken to indicate that theGovernment were prepared to make further concessions to theCypriots. On the other hand, the presence of a United kingdom minister in Cyprus might be the best way of making it clear toArchbishop Makarios that the Government were not contemplatingfurther concessions. Unless the terms which we had now offeredwere finally accepted within the next few days, a further postponement of the timetable would be inevitable. In that case a considerablenumber of administrative problems would arise, and it would assist
the Governor of Cyprus if these could be discussed locally with a united Kingdom Minister. If the visit were made, it would benecessary to make it clear to the Greek and Turkish governments that it was not made for the purpose of negotiating a settlement withArchbishop Makarios on the basis of fresh concessions.The Cabinet Agreed that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forthe Colonies should visit Cyprus.House ofCommons.accommodation of Members.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 71stConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Works (C. (60) 11) on accommodation for Members of Parliament.The Minister of Works said that there was an urgent need for more accommodation in which Members of Parliament could workprivately.   His proposals to meet this need fell under three heads:(i) It would be considerably easier to make the best use of theexisting accommodation in the Palace of Westminster if the control exercised by the Lord Great Chamberlain could be reduced. he proposed to examine with the Home Secretary the possibilities of achange.(ii) The Home Affairs Committee had agreed that application should be made to the London County Council for designation forGovernment purposes of the site bounded by Bridge Street,Parliament Street, New Scotland Yard and the Embankment. Whilepart of this site would be required for Government offices, part of itmight be made available for Parliament. An alternative would be a building, in accordance with the original plan of Sir Charles Barry,on the north side of New Palace Yard.(iii) Permanent accommodation could not, however, be providedquickly enough to meet the demand. The Minister therefore proposed that a temporary building should be erected in the StarChamber Court which could be ready for occupation about 12 monthsafter a decision was taken. An informal offer had also been made bythe Chairman of the St. Stephen&apos;s Club to sell to the Government the freehold of their existing building, with vacant possession in about six months.   Either or both of these proposals might be adopted.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that on merits there was a case for taking control of the palace of Westminster out of the hands of the Lord GreatChamberlain. It would, however, be preferable that the Governmentshould not themselves take the initiative in this matter and that itshould be left to the Opposition to raise it in a debate during the nextfew months, which would provide the Government with an occasion to approach the Lord Great Chamberlain. In the meantime, theGovernment should formulate their own views.So far as permanent accommodation for Members was concerned, the Cabinet endorsed the conclusion of the Home AffairsCommittee that the Bridge Street site should be designated forGovernment purposes. The use to which the land would be put, if and when acquired, could be considered later, including the questionof leasing premises on it to the St. Stephen&apos;s Club (although this might involve certain difficulties, both political and legal). In themeantime the possibility of building on the north side of New PalaceYard should not be ruled out.In further discussion it was agreed that, until such time as these plans matured, additional accommodation for Members must beprovided on a temporary basis.   There was considerable support for
8-secret the proposal for a temporary building in the Star Chamber Court,which, being an integral part of the Palace, would avoid anydisruption of the corporate life of the House of Commons. Furtherconsideration should, however, be given to the possible advantages of adapting the present premises of the St. Stephen&apos;s Club, if the offer of them to the Government were confirmed. The relative merits ofthe two projects, including the cost of them, and the effect oncar-parking facilities, should be examined.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Home Secretary would report their discussion to the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Minister of Works, in consultation with the HomeSecretary, to examine the possibility of a change in thefunctions of the Lord Great Chamberlain on the lines agreed in their discussion.(3) Endorsed the conclusion of the Home Affairs Committee thatthe Bridge Street site should be designated for Governmentpurposes.(4) Invited the Minister of Works to give urgent consideration in the light of their discussion to the relative advantages of providing temporary accommodation for Members ofParliament in the Star Chamber Court and in the presentpremises of the St. Stephen&apos;s Club; and to bring the matter before them again.national health service.Contributions.(previous references:C.C. (59) 45thConclusions,Minute 3 andC.C. (59) 44thConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C. (59) 13) on a proposal to increase the National health service weekly contribution.The Lord Chancellor said that the Social Services Committeehad discussed a proposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that immediate action should be taken to increase the National health service weekly contribution by Is. (lOd. from the employee and2d. from the employer) with effect from, say, the following July.The Committee had felt considerable doubt whether this proposal should be accepted: but he was himself impressed with the difficultyin which the large increase in the Supply Estimates for 1960-61 put the Chancellor, from the point of view both of the economy generally and of its effect on confidence in sterling. The Committee had decided to study the possibilities of a radical reorganisation of thefinancial structure of the National Health Service, but this would necessarily take some time and would not help the Chancellor in hisimmediate difficulties.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was a real danger that excessive inflationary pressure would develop in the economy. Our external position had been deteriorating graduallyfor some months and was likely to continue to do so. At home,industrial production had over the last year risen by 9 per cent, and production generally by 6 per cent. Investment, both public and private, and consumption were rising at a rate which caused concern;pressure for substantial wage increases was building up; and the retail price index was likely to rise to some extent in the course of theyear. The presentation of Supply Estimates 8 per cent, higher thanin the previous year would have a dangerous effect on confidence inthe economy both at home and abroad, and it was important to limitas far as possible the overall deficit in the Budget.This situation fully justified the immediate introduction oflegislation to increase the Health Service contribution by Is. Theredid not seem to be any method of meeting the increase in estimates
other than those of the National Health Service. But, apart fromthe question of Estimates, it was important to safeguard the principlethat the weekly contributions should continue to meet about20 per cent, of the cost of the Service: at their present level theywould meet only 17% per cent, of the estimated cost for the coming year, without taking account of the large increase which was likelyto result from the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the remuneration of doctors and dentists. The Health service contribution was admittedly a form of tax, but the right balance between different forms of taxation must be preserved. It wouldcertainly be necessary to increase the contribution at least once duringthe next few years and the present time was the least inopportunepolitically.The Minister of Health expressed grave concern at this proposal,An increase in the weekly contribution would not in fact reduce theactual amount of Government expenditure. The contribution was aregressive form of poll-tax which, unlike other forms of taxation,made no allowances for hard cases. Payment was not related toentitlement to the benefits of the Health Service and increases in thecost of the Service should therefore be borne by the taxpayersgenerally rather than by one particular class of taxpayer.The Minister of Pensions said that, following the Governmentspledge that pensioners should be enabled to share in the benefits ofincreasing prosperity, pressure would develop before long for anincrease in the rate of pension. To raise the rate of contributionwithout giving any increased pension benefits was likely to precipitatedemands for a pension increase at an earlier date than might otherwise be the case. The situation was complicated by the fact that he hada statutory duty to conduct his quinquennial review of the adequacy of national insurance benefits during the summer. While no decisionhad yet been reached, the Social Services Committee were inclined to the view that no pension increase should be granted before April1961, when the new national insurance scheme came into operation,primarily on the ground that it would not be reasonable to increasecontributions before that date: if the pension element in the contribution could not be increased, neither should the Health Serviceelement. After April 1961, the Government had undertaken toreduce the contributions paid by the lower paid workers. If this reduction were not effected, it would be possible to finance a modestincrease in pension rates; but to hypothecate to the National health service about half of this amount, or a substantial proportion of whatever the Government might decide was the maximum tolerableincrease in the total contribution, would make almost impossible any satisfactory handling of pension policy until the later part of 1962.An increase in the pension element in the contribution could be defended on the ground that the scheme was based on the principleof insurance but this did not apply to the Health Service element.It would in the Ministers view be preferable to postpone any increasein the Health Service element until the Government had reached adecision on the amount and timing of any pension increase, so thatthe effect on the contribution as a whole could be clearly seen.General discussion showed that, while the political difficultiesof increasing the Health Service contribution and of the effect, of this in the pension field were recognised, there was neverthelessconsiderable support for the view that the general economic situationand the increase in the Supply Estimates for 1960-61 demandedsome special action. A possible compromise might be to announceat the time the Estimates were presented that the Health service contribution would be increased later in the year when theGovernment had completed their examination of the possibilities ofa radical reorganisation of the financial structure of the Service.
Summing up the discussion, The Home Secretary said that itwould be necessary to reach a decision by the beginning of thefollowing week. It had been arranged that the Economic PolicyCommittee would review the general economic situation at a meetingon the following day; and it would be appropriate for that meeting,which it should be open to any member of the Cabinet to attend, tocontinue discussion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ proposal.The matter could be referred to a subsequent meeting of the cabinet if that were required.The Cabinet Invited the Economic Policy Committee to consider at their next meeting the proposal for an immediate increase in theNational Health Service contribution, in the context of thegeneral economic situation.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,3rd February, 1960.
