There was, however, some hope that a degree of order and stability might be restored if the local representatives of the United Nations were willing to co-operate withthe more reliable leaders. Some of the foreign Governments whichhad been supporting Lumumba now appeared to be losing confidence in him, and there seemed to be some chance that the authority ofmore reliable leaders, like Mobutu, might increase.The Cabinet were informed of certain developments which might indicate that the Government of Ghana were contemplating some further initiative in the Congo. These developments should be carefully watched.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Egypt 3.

(60) 36thConclusions,Minute 4)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (60) 145) on the next steps towardsthe denationalisation of the steel industry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that the Governmenthad declared their intention to return the steel industry, includingRichard Thomas and Baldwins, Ltd. (R.T.B.), to private ownershipduring the present Parliament. Further progress in this directionwas, however, complicated by the need for substantial capital to finance the expansion of R.T.B. In addition to a loan of  70 millions to be made by the Minister of Power, they would require a further 120 millions to finance their expansion programme.   It had beenUnited Nations 1. The Foreign Secretary said that the General Assembly ofGeneral the United Nations had now completed its general debate on worldAssembly        affairs, and Mr. Khrushchev had left New York.   It was perhaps(Previous        too early to assess the effect of his personal intervention in the reference:      Assembly.  But, to the extent that he had hoped to draw the smallerC.C. (60) 53rd   uncommitted countries into the Communist camp, his visit had conclusions,    probably been unsuccessful.  The representatives of those countriesMinute l)        had, for the most part, reacted unfavourably to his approach; andhis tactics had probably had the effect of discouraging those countries from closer contact with the Soviet Union. On the other hand, therewere indications that the pressures which Mr. Khrushchev hadinitiated for a reorganisation of the United Nations Secretariat wouldbe maintained.
intended that  50 millions of this should be found by the issue of newdebentures in the company, and the Iron and Steel Holding andRealisation Agency had consulted their advisers in the City aboutthe form which such an issue might take. It now appeared that a straight debenture issue would not be attractive to private investorsat present, because the interest cover available at this stage ofR.T.B.&apos;s development would be inadequate, and that any scheme for making a debenture issue more attractive by linking it with thedisposal of some part of the equity would not secure the best possibleprice for the sale of these assets. For these reasons the economic policy Committee recommended that it would not be desirable toproceed with a debenture issue in R.T.B. at this stage, and that itwould be preferable to sell the prior charges in the other steel companies. This sale might yield between  75 millions and  100millions by the end of 1961, and this could be added to the loan of 70 millions which the Minister of Power was able to make to R.T.B.There would still remain the possibility of raising about  30 millions of short-term capital from the banks, if necessary. The question of returning R.T.B. to private ownership should be reviewed in 12 to18 months&apos; time.Discussion showed that there was general support for these recommendations. It was desirable that the Agency should proceedrapidly with the disposal of its other holdings. This would help to reconcile Government supporters to the postponement of the saleof R.T.B. It would in any case be necessary to explain to them the disadvantages of disposing of R.T.B. at the present stage of its development, and to confirm that it was still the governments intention to return this company and the other nationalised assets of the steel industry to private ownership during the present parliament. At the same time, care should be taken to avoid any firm commitment to do this whatever the circumstances.The Cabinet Approved the recommendations put forward in C. (60) 145.Pensions andNationalInsurance(previous reference :C.C. (60) 30thConclusions,Minute 5)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C. (60) 146) recommending increases in retirement pensions and in the scale rates of national assistance.The Lord Chancellor recalled that the Cabinet had asked theSocial Services Committee to consider the form, amount and timing of the increase in retirement pensions to which the Government were committed by their Election Manifesto. While the introduction ofdifferential rates of retirement pensions would have certainattractions, the Committee had concluded that this would be open toconclusive objections, both practical and political, and that the nextpension increase should take the customary form of an all-roundincrease of benefits. This they proposed should be 7s. 6d. on thepresent rate of 50s. (single) and 12s. 6d. on the 80s. rate (married).This was the largest increase which could be made if the contributionpayable for the minimum level of benefits under the new graduated pensions scheme was not to exceed the contribution payable atpresent. The Committee also took the view that a pension increaseof less than 7s. 6d. (single) and 12s. 6d. (married) would not be politically acceptable. They proposed that the increase should take effect from the following April and that the necessary legislation should be introduced immediately the new session opened.A pension increase must be accompanied by an increase in thescale rates of national assistance. There was reason to believe that,if pensions were increased by the amount proposed, the national assistance Board would recommend increases in assistance rates of
6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the Minister of Pensions and the Minister ofHealth (C. (60) 148, 151 and 150) about the possibility of increasingthe contribution made by insured persons towards the cost of theNational Health Service, and a memorandum by the Home Secretary(C. (60) 137) about the supply of medicines on National health service terms to the private patients of general practitioners.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that between 1959-60 and1962-63 Supply expenditure was expected to rise by  1,000 millions;over the same period the gross cost of the National Health service was expected to rise by more than  125 millions, and by nearly 200 millions over the period from 1958-59. In these circumstances it was desirable to secure a substantial increase in the revenue derivedfrom the National Health Service contribution. He therefore proposed that the weekly contribution should be increased by Is.,divided as to lOd. from the employee and 2d. from the employer.This would yield about  50 millions a year. The necessary legislation should be introduced early in the new session in order that theincrease could take effect from the following April. He recognisedthat this could be represented as an increase in taxation which wouldNationalHealthService(previous references :C.C. (60) 53rdConclusions,Minute 2, andC.C. (60) 6thConclusions,Minute 4)C.C. 54 (60)not more than 3s. (single) and 5s. (married). The Social services committee proposed that, if this recommendation were made, itshould be accepted.The Chancellor of the Exchequer concurred in these proposals,which, taken together, would cost the Exchequer some  15 millions a year.In discussion it was pointed out that the effect of the graduated pensions scheme would be to raise the contribution of a man earning 15 a week from 9s. lid. to 13s. 5d. and that the proposal now beforethe Cabinet would involve a further addition of Is. 5d. to the employee^ contribution. The Government had undertaken that under the graduated pensions scheme the minimum contributionpayable, by men earning  9 a week or less, would be less than thatpayable at present. With the increase in contribution now proposed,it would be represented that the Government had failed to fulfil this undertaking, since the minimum contribution from the followingApril would be only twopence less than the present contribution.The increase in contribution could, however, be justified by referenceto the substantial increase in benefits now proposed, which includedsickness, unemployment and other benefits as well as retirement pensions.If the Bill were introduced at the beginning of the new session,it would be technically possible to bring the increased benefits intooperation in the following February and there would no doubt be pressure for that or an even earlier date. This pressure should,however, be resisted. There would be serious administrativeinconvenience if two changes in the rates of contribution were to bemade within two months, especially at a time when final decisions oncontracting out of the new pensions scheme might not all have beenmade.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (60) 146 for increases in retirement pensions and other benefits and, ifrecommended by the National Assistance Board, in thescale rates of national assistance.(2) Agreed that the necessary legislation should be introduced atthe beginning of the new session.
fall disproportionately on the lower-paid worker. But an increase inthe contribution would be the best way of bringing home to the public that the money must be found to meet the rising cost of the Service.It would hardly be possible to avoid increasing the contributionbefore the end of the present Parliament and, while the decision was an unwelcome one at any time, the following April would be a convenient time, and no more politically embarrassing than any other,for the increase to take effect. At that date, when the new graduated pensions scheme and the increase in benefits now approved by theCabinet came into operation, there would be a sharp increase in thenational insurance contributions payable by the higher-paid workers.The addition of lOd. to the National Health Service element in the worker&apos;s contribution would not significantly add to the public reaction which must be expected in any event. Nor would theproposal involve a breach &quot;of faith with the lower-paid workers,whose contributions the Government had undertaken to reduce whenthe new pensions scheme came into operation, since the health service element in the total contribution had no essential connexionwith the national insurance element, to which the Governmentsundertaking had related. If the proposal were accepted, about 22 percent, of the gross cost of the Health Service would be borne by contributions and patients&apos; charges, as compared with the 20 per cent,which had, from the beginning of the Service, been accepted as theright proportion to be borne from non-Exchequer sources.Discussion showed that there was a substantial measure of support for the proposal that the amount of the weekly contribution should be raised. A fiat-rate contribution, though in theory a formof regressive tax, had been an integral part of the financial structure of some of the social services for many years, and the principle ofincreasing the Health Service contribution to meet rising costs hadbeen accepted since 1957. Means must be found of relieving theExchequer of some of the growing burden of the Service, especially if there were to be any question of further increasing it, by allowingprivate patients to obtain their medicines on National Health Serviceterms. Moreover, the alternative of an increase in direct taxationwould be contrary to the Governments general policy, and to find the money from indirect taxation would be hardly less regressive than to increase the contribution.On the other hand it was generally recognised that, if an increasein contributions were to be made, the timing of it presented a verydifficult problem. Although it should be possible by carefulpresentation to make clear at the time the distinction between theNational Health Service element and the National Insurance element in the total contribution, there was no doubt that the increase ininsurance benefits now approved would be less than was generallyexpected and the simultaneous increase in the total contributionspayable would involve the Government in some political embarrassment. Moreover, the Minister of Health was hoping to beable to put before the Cabinet certain proposals for effectingeconomies in the National Health Service and it might be moredifficult to secure general acceptance of these if the prospective increase in the cost of the Service had already been largely met by increased contributions. Nor would it be easy, if the Ministersproposals were such that they could be represented as reducing thescope of the Service, to justify first increasing payments towards thecost of the Service and then reducing the service paid for. Onthe other hand, it might be no less difficult to justify increasingcontributions after the scope of the Service had been reduced. Itwould therefore be easier to decide whether to increase the contribution if it were known what economy measures the Ministerof Health had in mind. The Cabinet were also reminded that areport was expected shortly from a committee of officials which hadbeen studying a number of alternative methods of financing theService.
It was suggested that an increase in the Health service contribution might be more acceptable if it were larger than the Is.now proposed but were accompanied by abolition of the presentprescription charge, the yield of which was some  12 millions. Thiswould provide a favourable context for the proposed concession to private patients. In this connexion the Cabinet reaffirmed theconclusion reached at their earlier discussion that, while there wasa danger that the concession might in time lead to a deterioration inthe standard of service given to those who did not choose to beprivate patients, it was hardly possible on political grounds to avoidmaking the concession at the earliest time compatible with the otherdevelopments under discussion. An increase in the contribution was likely to aggravate the pressure for the concession to private patients.On the other hand, the Government would lay themselves open to criticism if this concession coincided in time either with an increasein the contributions or with drastic economies in the Health Service,or with both.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that theCabinet appeared to be generally in favour of some increase in theNational Health Service contribution. But the timing of the increaserequired further consideration. It would be helpful if the cabinet could be supplied with an analysis showing the contributions atpresent payable by different types of employee and the changesresulting from the introduction of the new pensions scheme, theincreased benefits now agreed and the increase in the National health service contribution proposed by the Chancellor. The cabinet should resume their discussion of this proposal at an early meeting,when the proposed concession to private patients could also befurther considered.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance to circulate an analysis of the contributions payable by employees, on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of C. (60) 148, 150, 151and 137 at an early meeting.Cabinet Office, SWA,18th October, 1960.
