nationalised industries.parliamentary questions.(previous reference :C.C. (59) 42ndConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (60) 29) on the scope of Parliamentary Questions aboutthe nationalised industries.The Home Secretary said that the Government had been pressed for some time to agree to an extension of the scope of parliamentary questions on the working of the nationalised industries. hither to the accepted practice had been that the Ministers responsible shouldanswer Questions relating only to those matters for which they hadstatutory responsibilities or to matters on which they had, or mighthave, issued directions. After consultation with the ministers concerned, he was satisfied that, while no substantial departure fromthis principle could be conceded, there might be some small scope forbroadening current practice at the discretion of the ministers themselves. He proposed, therefore, after consultation withMr. Speaker, to make in the House of Commons an early statement to this effect.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith the draft statement annexed to the Home Secretary&apos;smemorandum. It was, however, agreed that, in order to avoidestablishing embarrassing precedents, any Minister who contemplatedgoing beyond the present practice should consult his colleagues inadvance.The Cabinet Approved the statement on Parliamentary Questions relatingto the nationalised industries which was annexed toC. (60) 29.british transport commission.(previous references:C.C. (59) 54thConclusions,Minute 8 andC.C. (60) 9thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Prime Minister said that he had had a number of meetings with the Minister of Transport and the other ministers concerned, as a result of which proposals to deal with the problemsof the British Transport Commission could now be put before theCabinet. These would entail a major reorganisation of theCommission, for which legislation would in due course be required.In the meantime the Commission would of course continue to conduct the various undertakings for which they were statutorilyresponsible. They would also shortly have to negotiate with therailway unions in the light of the report which the committee underthe chairmanship of Professor Guillebaud were expected to presentin the following week. It would also be necessary for the Commissionto re-examine the railway modernisation plans in consultation withthe Ministry of Transport.While the Government would have to decide the broad lines ofthe reorganisation of the Commission, the details should be worked out by a planning committee composed of representatives of theCommission, officials of the Treasury and the Ministry of transport and probably some independent advisers. It would be desirable toappoint an independent person as special adviser to the Minister ofTransport who could also be chairman of this planning committee.The broad lines of the reorganisation plan would be as follows.A Transport Council would be formed to hold, as trustees, all the assets at present held by the Commission. The assets would be allocated among the different undertakings, which would becomeseparate organisations, each with an independent board. TheTransport Council would be empowered to retain or dispose of the assets in a number of ways, and it might also act as an advisory body to the Minister of Transport; but the Council would not exercise any
managerial functions, and the Minister of Transport would havedirect access to the chairmen of the separate organisations.As regards the reorganisation of the railways, the broad principles should be to remove restrictions on their commercial freedom, to divide them into autonomous groups, and to entrust co-co-ordination between them to a central body which might be composed of thegeneral managers of the autonomous groups. In order to meet some part of the Commission^ deficit, including the cost of the interimwages payment and of any further wage increases that might be madein the light of the report of the Guillebaud Committee, theCommission should consider increasing railway freight charges andfares. From a presentational point of view, it was desirable that any increases should be made in the context of the report of the guillebaud Committee and of the serious financial position facing theCommission. Further study was necessary before it could be decidedhow to deal, in the longer term, with the financial difficulties of theCommission: such questions as the writing-off of capital, there organisation of the capital structure and the payment of subsidiescould not be finally decided except in the light of the detailed plan for the reorganisation of the Commission.If these proposals were accepted by the Cabinet, the Minister ofTransport would begin formal discussions with the transport commission. It would also be desirable to prepare a comprehensive statement of policy towards the Commission, in case it became necessary for the Government to make such a statement soon afterthe report of the Guillebaud Committee became available. Thisshould cover the financial position of the Commission, the effect ofthe findings of the Guillebaud Committee, and the government&apos;s intention to arrange for a planning committee to study what formthe reorganisation of the Commission should take. In order to avoidarousing unnecessary apprehensions among the trade unions, thestatement should not go into the details of the reorganisation of theCommission.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The Minister of Transport said that the proposals had been described informally and in general terms to the Chairman of theTransport Commission. He had indicated that he would co-operate in them, though he had expressed the hope that the proposedTransport Council would be given some effective functions. In viewof the fact that the Commission would in any case have to continueto conduct their undertakings for some time, and that their co-operation in planning the details of the reorganisation was essential, it was important that their full support for the proposals should be enlisted.(b) The report of the Guillebaud Committee would be presented to the Commission and the railway unions, and would be a matter for negotiation between them. The Chairman of the commission would propose to the unions that the normal negotiating machineryof the industry should be used to consider the report. There was reason to hope that the Government might not be expected to express a view about the report. On the other hand there was an expectation that the Government would shortly announce their general policy towards the Commission and the railways.(c) It was also possible that the railway unions would not beprepared to deal with the report of the Guillebaud Committee throughthe normal negotiating machinery. They might press that theprinciple of the report should be accepted by the Commission, andby the Government. They might indeed seek further interim wage increases immediately. While it would be reasonable to considergranting an interim increase in respect of differential wages, a second interim increase in railway wages generally should be resisted, onthe grounds that the general financial position of the Commission
)C.C. 12 (60)would not justify this. The railwaymen might claim that a furtherimmediate increase was fully justified because of the extent to whichthe level of their wages had fallen behind the level in comparableindustries. But it would have to be explained to them that there wasa limit beyond which the deficit of the industry could not be borne bythe Exchequer in the current year, and that this meant that the findings of the Guillebaud Committee could only be implementedover a considerable period. In this connexion it was pointed outthat it would be difficult to make an interim increase in respect ofdifferential wages until a thorough regrading of railway jobs had beencarried out.(d) The agreement of the railway unions to a phased settlementof the claims which would follow the Guillebaud report could onlybe obtained if they were prepared to co-operate in dealing with theproblem of the reorganisation of the Commission. The unions had accepted the need for a rationalised and smaller railway industry,provided that the reduction in the labour force would be effected bythe normal process of wastage. It would be necessary to convince the unions that the Government intended to support a rationalisedrailway industry even if this meant accepting the need to subsidisethe railways in respect of services which could not be commerciallyprofitable.Further discussion showed that the Cabinet were in generalagreement with the proposals outlined by the Prime Minister.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Transport to discuss the governments proposals for reorganisation with the British transport commission.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister had arranged for astatement of the Governments policy towards the british transport Commission to be prepared by the ministers concerned.Law of theSea.(previous reference :C.C. (60) 11thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Minister of Agriculture said that the fishing industry had now announced that they intended to suspend all fishing on the high seas in the vicinity of Iceland during the period of the conference onthe Law of the Sea which was to begin on 17th March. The industry had not been willing to refrain from fishing only within twelve miles of the coast of Iceland. They had expressed the view that it wouldnot be desirable to suggest that the Icelandic authorities, in response to this gesture, should be prepared to afford shelter and hospitalfacilities to our trawlers during that period. They also thought itwas unnecessary to seek the agreement of the Icelandic authoritiesto limit their landings of fish in this country, since this was alreadysatisfactorily covered by arrangements made between the fishingindustries of the two countries. It would, however, be of great value. if the Icelandic authorities would agree not to take proceedings against our fishermen in respect of alleged past offences against theirfishing regulations. He would consult with the Foreign Secretaryabout the way in which this point should be pursued with theChairman and Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Council, witha view to making the best use of their good offices.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Agriculture, to consider how the announcement by the fishing industry should be pursued with the chairman and Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Council, witha view to making the best use of their good offices.
Federationof rhodesia and Nyasaland.(previous reference :C.C. (60) 11thConclusions,Minute 1.)*4. The Cabinet were informed of the latest developments(reported in Salisbury telegrams Nos. 183 to 187) in theCommonwealth Secretary &apos;s discussions with the Governments of theFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and of Southern Rhodesiaon the release of Dr. Banda and constitutional advance in Nyasaland and Southern Rhodesia.The Prime Minister said that it was evident that the Governmentsof the Federation and of Southern Rhodesia could not be shaken intheir view that Dr. Banda should not be released until after theMonckton Commission had finished its work in Nyasaland. Theirattitude was based on their assessment of the security risks involved(in which they were supported by the Governors of Nyasaland andNorthern Rhodesia) and on the view that, if Dr. Banda were releasedwhile the Commission was in Nyasaland, moderate and loyal africans in Nyasaland would be prevented by intimidation from givingevidence to the Commission. The Commonwealth Secretary had achieved a notable success in persuading them to accept anarrangement by which Dr. Banda would be released immediatelyafter the Commission had left Nyasaland. He was satisfied that, ifthe United Kingdom Government adhered to their original plan to release Dr. Banda early in March, there would be general elections in both the Federation and Southern Rhodesia and a great risk ofthe early disruption of the Federation; and he was convinced that inthis forecast of events by the two Governments there was no element of bluff. If, on the other hand, the United Kingdom government accepted the compromise proposed and postponed Dr. Banda&apos;s releaseuntil after the Commission had left Nyasaland, it would certainly be said that they had yielded to pressure from the european population of the Federation. This would give rise to great political difficulties in this country and would prejudice the government&apos;s policy in the Federation and elsewhere in Africa. On balance,however, the Commonwealth Secretary advised that the compromiseshould be accepted.On the question of constitutional advance in Southern Rhodesia,the Commonwealth Secretary contemplated that informal talks wouldbe held with the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia in london in April and that these would be followed by a formal conference inJune. Even if agreement were then reached, no action would betaken until after the review of the Federation constitution later in theyear. Meanwhile, although he himself intended to announce only that these discussions would take place, the Southern rhodesian government were likely to press that at the time of Dr. Banda&apos;srelease it should be announced that the reserved powers were to be withdrawn.In discussion there was general support for the view that thecourse recommended by the Commonwealth Secretary was the lesserof two evils. The Government would be strongly criticised for givingway to the demands of the Federation and Southern Rhodesia and preventing Dr. Banda from giving evidence to the monckton commission. On the other hand, the decision could be presented as based on the Governors assessment of the security risks in nyasaland and as necessary to enable Africans favouring federation to give evidence to the Commission without fear of intimidation.Dr. Banda&apos;s release would be postponed for only a few weeks beyondthe date originally contemplated and the recent release of largenumbers of detainees had gone some way towards implementing theGovernments announced policy. The proposed constitutionalconcessions to Southern Rhodesia were, however, a cause for somemisgiving: the reserved powers should not be surrendered unless they were replaced by effective local safeguards for African interests.The Government should not be committed at this stage to making any concessions to Southern Rhodesia on this point.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23rd February, 1960.The Prime Minister said that the present attitude of theGovernments of the Federation and of Southern Rhodesia was based on emotion rather than on reasoned argument. In thesecircumstances the Cabinet were faced with a choice between twoevils. He was satisfied that there was no element of bluff in theattitude of Ministers in Salisbury. It seemed to him that it wouldnot be justifiable to risk the disruption of the Federation on thequestion of delaying the release of Dr. Banda for three or four weeks, and that there was no alternative but to accept the course recommended by the Commonwealth Secretary. This must, however,be on the understanding that the Government were not committed to constitutional concessions to Southern Rhodesia and that, if itwere agreed that the reserved powers should be withdrawn, theyshould be replaced by effective local safeguards for the rights of the african population.The Colonial Secretary said that, while it might be necessary forthe Government to follow the course recommended by theCommonwealth Secretary, this would greatly increase his difficultiesin the discharge of his responsibilities as Colonial Secretary, and hewould have to consider the implications of such a decision on theconduct of Colonial policy in Africa.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a later meeting.
