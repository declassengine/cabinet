Kenya.(previous reference:C.C.(60)3rdConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Colonial Secretary said that good progress was nowbeing made by the Kenya Constitutional Conference. The African-elected members and the representatives of the new Kenya Groupwere near to agreement on a system of qualified franchise and on the composition of the council of Ministers. If they could be persuaded to accept satisfactory arrangements for the future of the speciallyelected members, there was good reason to think that, so far as thesetwo Groups were concerned, an agreed settlement of all the issuesbefore the Conference might be secured.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the colonial secretary and invited him to report further developmentsto a meeting of the Colonial Policy Committee early in thefollowing week.&quot;Parliament. 2.

He had conveyed this decisionto the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, who had shown himselfwilling to acquiesce in it, though he could not of course support thepolicy.   There was some pressure for a debate in the House ofCommons on the affairs of Northern Ireland, but this would be resisted.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Home Secretary.Government 4.

The regulations, which were in wideterms and included powers to requisition property and land, wouldthen be laid before Parliament; it was necessary that they should be approved by resolution of both Houses within seven days, and a fulldebate could be expected. Special arrangements had been made fortraffic in London, and provincial police forces had been advised tomake similar arrangements. It was desirable that announcementsabout these arrangements and about staggering working hours shouldbe issued later that day. These might be foreshadowed in a statement which he would make to Parliament in answer to a private notice question.In discussion there was general approval of these arrangements and of the draft emergency regulations. The Cabinet were informedthat instructions would also be issued to local authorities and to water undertakings about the maintenance of essential services. It wasagreed that the Service Departments should proceed with any necessary arrangements for making vehicles available at the outset ofthe strike.The Minister of Labour gave the Cabinet a detailed account ofrecent developments in the railway wages dispute. From his owndiscussion with representatives of the National Union of Railwaymen(N.U.R.), it emerged that they were particularly concerned with two points: the length of time likely to be taken to reach agreement onthe interim wages increase, the offer of which would be made withinseven days of receipt of the Guillebaud report, and the size of theoffer. There was some reason to suppose that the two other unions would agree not to attempt to negotiate increases in differentialrates when the interim increase was offered, and in that event itmight be possible to give the N.U.R. an assurance that there wouldnot be any delay. But it would be much more difficult to reassure the N.U.R. about the size of the interim increase which would be offered. The General Council of the Trades Union Congress were receiving a report on the dispute later that day.In discussion it was pointed out that the Government mightwell be criticised when the findings of the Guillebaud Committeebecame known if they had allowed a national strike to take place before any specific figure for an interim offer had been put forward.The difficulty was that the two craft unions were unwilling to agreethat the amount of an interim increase should be specified before the guillebaud Committee&apos;s report was available. It might nevertheless be possible to find some means of enabling Sir Brian Robertson,Chairman of the British Transport Commission, to propose the figureof 4 per cent, which he had had in mind when he originally asked theunions whether they would accept an interim increase. His proposal would have to provide that this amount would be consistent with the guillebaud recommendations and that it would not prejudice theposition as regards differential increases. It would be necessary to persuade all three unions to agree to such a formula. It was forconsideration whether any statement on these lines should be set inthe context of an announcement about the proposed reorganisation of the structure of the British Transport Commission. The statement should not imply that the Government would be prepared to acceptthe whole of the Guillebaud recommendations in one step.
Statement on 6.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister ofDefence, 1960.   Defence (C. (60) 14) covering a draft of the White Paper on Defence,1960.The Minister of Defence said that he had considered thepossibility of terminating the series of annual White Papers on defence. After discussion with the Prime Minister he had reachedthe conclusion that it would be desirable to publish a White Paperthis year, but that as far as possible this should be in non-controversialterms and in the nature of a progress report. His objective had been to. emphasise the continuity of defence policy and the long-term&apos; improvements in the Services, so that the White Paper would, with theannouncement on the previous day of increases in pay, help tomaintain recruiting at the level required for the all-regular forces.The maps and diagrams included in the draft were designed tobe of general public interest, but in view of difficulties in presentationhe would be prepared to omit the map representing the Alliancesof the Free World. He would also give further consideration to the description of the map indicating the principal British defence commitments, and to the way in which the presence of British Forcesin Commonwealth or foreign countries should be shown. The white paper was due to be published on 16th February.In discussion general agreement was expressed with the viewsof the Minister of Defence, and various amendments to the draft white Paper were suggested. It was felt that it was of particular importance to avoid any controversial statement about the Britishballistic missile BLUE STREAK, since decisions about its futured development and production could not be taken in time for anannouncement to be made in the course of the debate in ParliamentC.C. 7 (60)It was further suggested that the fears of the unions would beallayed if Professor Guillebaud could be persuaded, as an interim measure, to disclose the main conclusions of his report. He had,however, already stated his dislike of this course, and the balanceof view of the Cabinet was that any such statement would be boundto divert pressure on to the Government to make a reasonable interimoffer to avoid a strike.The Home Secretary, summing up, said that the Cabinet approved the arrangements which had been made to meet the emergencyof a national strike. As regards the negotiations with the unions,Ministers had taken the view that, on balance, there would be advantage in Sir Brian Robertson&apos;s placing on record, before a strikestarted, the nature of an interim offer he would be prepared to makeif the unions agreed. While the Minister of Labour should be givendiscretion to handle the negotiations as he thought best, he shouldtake an opportunity to explore the possibility that the partiesmight accept a formula on the lines mentioned in discussion.Presentationally, it was important that such a formula should linkthis offer with Sir Brian Robertson&apos;s earlier talks with the unions.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the emergency arrangements set out in C. (60) 22,and the draft emergency regulations.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour to be guided by the views expressed in discussion in his further handling of thenegotiations.
on 29th February. The relevant passage in the White Paper should merely indicate that development of BLUE STREAK was continuingand that the possibilities of mobile launchers, whether aircraft orsubmarines, for long-range delivery of nuclear warheads were being investigated.Summing Up, the Home Secretary suggested that the amendments proposed in discussion and any others which Ministers might putforward before the end of the day should be considered by theMinister of Defence, in consultation as necessary with the ministers concerned. Thereafter, the Lord Privy Seal and the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster might help the Minister to settle the finalterms of the White Paper.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for the draft white Paper annexed to C. (60) 14 to be amended in thelight of the points made in their discussion and for the amended version to be presented to Parliament on16th February.european free trade association.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (60) 17) on the privileges and immunities to be granted by member States in connexion with the European Free trade association (E.F.T.A.).The Foreign Secretary said that the E.F.T.A. Conventionrequired that privileges and immunities should be laid down in a protocol. The proposals set out in the Annex to his memorandum had been worked out in relation both to existing precedents and towhat was necessary to ensure the effective operation of theAssociation. Effect could be given to them without legislation. Ifthe Cabinet accepted his proposals, he would seek to secure theagreement of our partners in E.F.T.A.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (60) 17.The aircraft industry.(previous reference:C.C: (60) 5thConclusions,Minute 5.); 8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Aviation (C. (60) 21) on the aircraft industry.The Minister of Aviation said that his memorandum showed theprogress which had been made, in agreement with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, in applying the measures for assistance to, andrationalisation of, the aircraft industry which he had submitted tothe Cabinet at the end of the previous year. The nature and extentof the financial assistance which the industry might expect to receive from the Government would follow the general lines he had previously indicated. Satisfactory progress had been made towardsreorganising the industry into two main airframe groups, onehelicopter group and one aero-engine group. He proposed to make an announcement of the Governments policy towards the aircraft industry in reply to a Parliamentary Question in the following week in the terms of the statement annexed to his memorandum.The Cabinet agreed that an announcement of the government&apos;s policy towards the aircraft industry should be made on the lines proposed by the Minister of Aviation. Care should be taken to avoid the impression that public subsidies might generally be forthcomingfor industries that were unable to maintain a satisfactory economic

There was also the risk that countries whowere already subsidising their civil aviation would endeavour to make our support for development in the British aircraft industry a pretext for extending their subsidies in other areas, notably shipping.In further discussion of the terms of the statement to be made inParliament, the Cabinet were informed that the proposed referenceto &quot;public policy &quot; was intended to safeguard the position of ShortBrothers and Harland, in Belfast. With the same object in view itwould be desirable to make it clear that the Governments policyapplied to the United Kingdom as a whole.The Cabinet Took note with approval of C. (60) 21, subject to the points made in their discussion.
