CC. 75 (58)Cyprus.(previous reference:CC. (58) 73rdConclusions,Minute 4.)1. The Foreign Secretary said that the latest discussions in theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) suggested that it mightbe possible to arrange a conference on Cyprus under the auspices of nato and on the basis, which we could probably accept, that ourown plan would constitute the main subject for discussion but thatthe possibility of a long-term settlement might be added to the agendaas a secondary item. It appeared to be accepted by NATO that itwould be appropriate for the United Kingdom to convene theconference; and it was suggested that, in addition to the Greek and turkish spokesmen, a representative of the United States Governmentshould attend, together with M. Spaak, the Secretary-General of theOrganisation.. We might be pressed to agree that the conference should be held in the capital of one of the member countries of nato, whose representative should also preside over the discussions.It would be preferable, however, that we ourselves should, if possible,be in the chair.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of this statement.Broadcasting.(previous reference:CC. (58) 65thConclusions,Minute 1.)The Queen&quot;sChristmasMessage.2. The Home Secretary said that the Independent television authority (I.T.A.) had formally requested that, if The Queen&apos;sChristmas Message to the Commonwealth was to be televised thisyear, independent television should be used. The British broadcasting corporation (B.B.C.) were, however, anxious to retain sole responsibility for this broadcast, in conformity with their claim thatthey alone should be entrusted with the arrangements for broad-casting and televising State occasions.In discussion it was suggested that, from the point of view ofpublic opinion in other parts of the Commonwealth, the soundbroadcast of the Royal Message was the decisive consideration; and only the B.B.C. were able to broadcast overseas. Moreover, the message formed the culmination of an exchange of greetings between different parts of the Commonwealth which the Corporation hadintroduced in 1932 and had subsequently built up into an outstandingannual event. For these reasons the claim of the B.B.C. should be conceded in this instance, without prejudice to further consideration,at a later date, of the allocation of responsibility for broadcasting andtelevising State occasions. There was reason to believe that theI.T.A., who would in any event be allowed to transmit the broadcastin their own programmes, would not press their request.The Cabinet Agreed that, if The Queen&apos;s Christmas Message to theCommonwealth was televised this year, responsibility forthe arrangements should remain with the British Broad-casting Corporation.Reserve Forces 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordBi,L Chancellor (C. (58) 204) discussing the scope of the legislation which(Previous it was proposed  to introduce in  the forthcoming session  ofReference: Parliament in order to renew the Navy, Army and Air ForceCC. (58) 73rd Reserves Act, 1954.Conclusions,Minute 3.) The Lord Chancellor said that, in accordance with the wishexpressed by the Cabinet at their last discussion of this subject, he
had examined, together with the Minister of Defence, the Ministerof Labour, the Secretary of State for War and the FinancialSecretary, Treasury, the proposal that the Government should takeadvantage of the opportunity afforded by this legislation to takeadditional powers to create a new section of the Territorial Armycomposed of men who, in return for a special tax-free bounty, wouldvoluntarily accept the liability to be embodied for service at home oroverseas without a Proclamation. As a result, it was clear that,although a strong case could be made out on military grounds forsome addition to the Reserve Forces which existed at present, therewere substantial political and financial objections to the suggestionthat the Government should sponsor legislation on the lines proposed.If they did so, they would be liable to be accused of so arrangingmatters that they could embark on a policy of military adventurewithout a Proclamation; and they would attract, however wrongly,the further criticism that the need for this additional Reserve was theresult of the failure of their policy of relying on all regular Forces.In addition, there were objections of principle to a tax-free bounty.For these reasons the Committee recommended that, although thelegislation to give effect to the proposed Territorial Army reserves should be drafted and held ready for introduction at a later date, theBill to be introduced in the forthcoming session should be confined to the renewal of the 1954 Act and that, if it became necessary to callup Reserves additional to those available in Section A of the RegularReserve or Category I of the Army Emergency Reserve, theGovernment should continue to rely on a Proclamation for thispurpose.In discussion there was general agreement with this view. Thefollowing points were made:  (a) Some supplementation of the existing Reserve Forces wouldbe needed, irrespective of the future size of the Regular Army. Thedecision on the proposed Territorial Army Reserve could not,therefore, be postponed indefinitely.(b) It might be desirable to take this occasion to review theGovernments policy as regards Service manpower in the light of thefact that the last National Service entrants who could be recruitedunder the existing statutory powers would be called up in 1960 and discharged two years later.(c) The principle of a tax-free bounty would need to be further considered in the light of the possible need to institute a similarbounty in order to stimulate voluntary recruitment to the civil defence services.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the legislation on the Reserve Forces Bill to beintroduced in the forthcoming session should be confined to the extension of the Navy, Army and Air ForceReserves Act, 1954, in respect of men who joined theForces after 1948.(2) Agreed to consider further, on a subsequent occasion, theproposal to create a special section of the Territorial Armycomposed of men who would voluntarily accept theliability to be embodied for service at home or overseaswithout a Proclamation.(3) Inyited the Minister of Defence to circulate a memorandum&quot;on Service manpower policy in the light of the currenttrend of voluntary enlistment and the approaching end ofthe system of National Service.(4) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the proposal that a tax-freebounty should be instituted in order to stimulate voluntary recruitment to the Civil Defence services.

4. The Cabinet had before them notes by the Home Secretary(C. (58) 205 and 206) covering revised versions of The Queen&apos;speeches on the Prorogation and Opening of Parliament.In discussion of the draft speech on Prorogation various textualamendments were suggested and approved.The Cabinet (1) Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to circulate a final draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation ofParliament.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would submit the final draft for Her Majesty&apos;s approval.Opening The Cabinet then considered the draft Speech for the opening speech. Qf Parliament.   Various textual amendments were suggested and approved.The Cabinet also reviewed the legislative implications of theproposals outlined in the draft Speech. The main programme Bills,together with the other Bills which were known to be, or liable tobecome, essential would probably exhaust almost the whole of theParliamentary time likely to be available for legislation in the forth-coming session; and it was for consideration whether the opening speech should commit the Government to introduce, in addition,measures dealing with New Towns, Wages Councils, Assistance to small Farmers, Assistance towards House Purchase, and IncreasedGrant-Aid for Denominational Schools. It was agreed that the reference to the last of these Bills should be deleted from the speech and that the legislation dealing with New Towns and Wages councils should, if possible, be introduced in the House of Lords. It wasagreed also that there might be some political advantage in arranging for the Bill amending the Representation of the People Act as regardsthe use of cars to take voters to the Poll to be introduced, if possible,as a Private Member&apos;s Bill, on the understanding that the Governmentwould ensure its progress through Parliament.The Cabinet-(3) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the LordChancellor and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,to prepare a revised version of The Queen&apos;s Speech on theOpening of Parliament in the light of their discussion.(4) Invited the Home Secretary to give further consideration tothe possibility of introducing the forthcoming Bills on new Towns and Wages Councils in the House of lords and arranging for the Bill amending the Representationof the People Act as regards the use of cars to take votersto the Poll to be introduced as a Private Member&apos;s Bill.The Queen&apos;speeches.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 74thConclusions,Minute 4.)ProrogationSpeech.Pensions.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 72ndConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Prime Minister recalled that at their last discussion onthis subject the Cabinet had agreed that in the White Paper on pensions the first quinquennial increase in contributions should be shown as occurring in 1966. Subsequently, the Chancellor of theExchequer, who had not been present at the Cabinefs discussion,had expressed the view that the average deficits of the first fourquinquennia of the new scheme which would result from thisarrangement would be embarrassing and that it would be preferable that the first increase in contributions should be made in 1965. ThePrime Minister said that he had agreed that, subject to theconcurrence of. the other Ministers concerned (which had been given at a meeting of the Home Affairs Committee), the White Paper, whichwould be published that day, should be amended accordingly.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of this statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th October, 1958.
