CC. 44 (58)industrial disputes.(previous reference :CC. (58) 43 rdConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Minister of Labour said that he had thought it wise,in view of the imminence of the Whitsun holiday, to suggest thatthe parties to the London bus wages dispute should meet the chief industrial Commissioner of the Ministry of Labour that day in orderto ascertain whether any means could be found of bringing theLondon bus strike to an end. The discussions would be purelyexploratory; and they would not prejudice the position, which theGovernment must sustain, that there was no direct connection between the bus dispute and the recent railway dispute and no justification for any proposal that the former, like the latter, shouldbe settled by an increase in wages applying to all workers in theindustry. On this hypothesis the bus st: ike was unlikely to bebrought to a satisfactory conclusion in the very near future.The Cabinet &apos;Took note of this statement.Foreign Affairs.*Lebanon.(previous reference :CC. (58) 43rdConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the Lebanese Governmentseemed to be regaining control at least of some parts of the country.If President Chamoun adhered to his original intention of seeking a second term of office, a civil war might still develop. But he was now believed to be considering whether he should stand aside infavour of General Chehab, who was probably the most satisfactory alternative from the Western point of view.In discussion it was agreed that no attempt should be made to influence President Chamoun&apos;s decision. In the meantime, however,it would be desirable, in conjunction with the United States, tomaintain the present state of readiness of our forces to intervene inthe Lebanon, subject to such relaxations as it might be possible tomake in the interests of the units concerned without detracting from our ability to act promptly, if the need arose.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange that our preparations to intervene in the Lebanon should bemaintained, subject to such relaxations as could be made without prejudice to our ability to act promptly if the need arose.c ranee.(previous reference :CC. (58) 43rdConclusions,Minute 5.)Muscat andthe Oman.(previous reference :CC. (58) 54thConclusions,Minute 5.)The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the latest developments in the political situation in France and Algeria.In discussion it was agreed that we should take particular care,at this juncture, to avoid any appearance of intervening in the domestic affairs of the French people, whether in metropolitan france or in Algeria.The Foreign Secretary said that the Sultan of Muscat wouldvisit London in the following week. It would be desirable, before his arrival, that further consideration should be given to the detailsof the agreement which we hoped to conclude with him and to themethod by which the negotiations should be conducted. As regardsBuraimi, there might be advantage in proposing the establishmentof a tridominium, consisting of the United Kingdom, Saudi arabia and the Sultan of Muscat, provided that the Saudi ArabianGovernment would undertake to respect the existing frontier andto recognise the Sultan&apos;s sovereignty over Oman.
The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of these statements.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the /f\Chancellor   of   the   Exchequer,   the   Commonwealth %/Secretary and the Minister of Defence, to arrange for an inter-Departmental examination of the details of theagreement which we should seek to conclude with the sultan of Muscat.territorial waters.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 43rdConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the attorney-General (C. (58) 112) on the instructions to the Captain ofthe Fishery Protection Squadron about the protection of british vessels fishing in areas of the high seas over which the icelandic government might claim exclusive rights.The Foreign Secretary said that the Icelandic Government hadbeen urged by almost all members of the North Atlantic Councilto refrain from unilateral action and to enter into discussions with ourselves with a view to reaching some permanent agreement aboutfishing rights off the Icelandic coast. But it seemed probable thatthey would persist in their intention to claim base lines substantiallyamended in their own favour together with an exclusive fishery zone of twelve miles from the amended lines, although they might concedefor three years the maintenance of established fishing rights outsidethose lines.In discussion it was suggested that, if this claim was made by the icelandic Fisheries Minister without the authority of his Government,we should defer action until the policy of the Icelandic Governmentwas known. If, however, the claim was formally advanced by the icelandic Government, we should at once declare that we did not recognise it and that we should seek to prevent unlawful interferencewith British vessels fishing on the high seas. A declaration of thiskind might be unwelcome to the United States Government andour other friends in the North Atlantic Alliance and might be publiclycriticised by the Canadian Government. But a firm statement thatwe intended to protect our own trawlers followed, if necessary, byactive steps for this purpose, now seemed to offer the only prospectof bringing the Icelandic Government to discussion. This statementneed not refer to the attitude of the British fishing industry, whichcould be relied upon, at least initially, to co-operate in the measureswhich the Government proposed to take.In further discussion it was emphasised that the instructionsto the Captain of our Fishery Protection Squadron should be as clear and precise as possible in order that, if any incident was reportedto the United Nations or the International Court of Justice, our case should be well grounded. They should indicate, therefore, that force was to be avoided if possible and should be used only to prevent the arrest, or to secure the release, of a British fishing vessel and onlyto the extent required for those purposes. Moreover, it would bedesirable that, if the Icelandic vessels forced the issue to the pointof active hostilities, we should be able to demonstrate that they hadtaken the initiative in opening fire. The instructions should thereforemake it clear that, at least on the occasion of the first incident ofthis kind, our fishery protection vessels should not open fire on anIcelandic vessel which either refused to release an arrested Britishtrawler or herself opened fire, but should disengage without firing.Finally, our trawlers should be instructed strictly to respect theexisting Icelandic fishery limits, to conform to the directions ofH.M. ships, to ignore all Icelandic instructions and to seek to avoidor delay the arrest of their vessels by all means short of the use of firearms and explosives.
LocalGovernmentReform.Education.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 35thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment and the Minister of Education (C. (58) 113) on the implications of moving in the House of Lords an amendment to theLocal Government Bill to exempt capital expenditure by localeducation authorities from the new general grant and to restore thepercentage grant system for such expenditure. This amendmentcould be justified on the grounds that the need for capital expenditurevaried widely from one area to another and that it would constituteevidence that the Government were in earnest in their intention tomake proper provision for development under the new system oflocal government finance. On the other hand, the change proposedcould not be confined to education but would have to be extended to capital expenditure on all the relevant services. Moreover it wouldbe contrary to the arguments which had been advanced during thepassage of the Bill in favour of the principle of the general grant and would therefore be unwelcome to the Governmenfs supporters,particularly since the local authorities themselves had not asked for it.Finally, there would be formidable technical difficulties in the wayof introducing the amendment in the House of Lords.In discussion there was general agreement that the time was notopportune for the proposed amendment and that it would be preferable to devise other means of promoting the government&apos;s policy of developing and improving the education service.The Cabinet Agreed that the Local Government Bill should not be amended to restore the percentage grant on capitalexpenditure by local education authorities.government expenditure.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 14thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (58) 111) indicating the probableincrease in Government expenditure in 1959-60 and 1960-61.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he proposed to circulate further memoranda on these lines from time to time inorder that the Cabinet might be informed of the cumulative effectof the decisions of policy which they had taken or were considering.The increase in Government expenditure which could so far before seen, amounting to about  100 millions in 1959-60 and about 170 millions in 1960-61, was disquieting, especially since it was unlikely to be wholly offset by the further increase in revenue whichmight reasonably be expected. The additional commitments whichthe Government might wish to incur in those years must therefore be examined with care and should, if possible, be accepted only if theyC.C. 44 (58)The Cabinet \J (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to circulate, for consideration at their meeting on the following day, a draft of a public statement, on the lines agreed in their discussion,indicating the attitude of Her Majesty&apos;s government towards any unilateral claim by the Icelandic Governmentto extended fishery rights or territorial waters.(2) Invited the Attorney-General to circulate, for consideration at their meeting on the following day, a draft of the fullinstructions to be given to the Captain of the BritishFishery Protection Squadron, on the lines agreed in their discussion.
Steel.Location ofNew Works.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 37thConclusions.)6. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of memoranda bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister for Welsh Affairs(C. (58) 66 and 87) about the location of the proposed new steelstrip mill.The Prime Minister said that the arguments which had been advanced in support of the various possible sites during the cabinet&apos;s earlier discussions were very evenly balanced. A decision was noturgent, and it might therefore be desirable to defer discussion fora short time during which members of the Cabinet might reflectfurther on the issues involved. In doing so, however, they shoulddistinguish between the various considerations which were relevant.It was possible, for example, to regard the question as primarily oneof broad national policy, involving not merely economic factors butalso social and political issues, including sensitive questions of scottish and Welsh sentiment. It was also necessary, however, tohave regard to the considerations, in terms of distribution of industrypolicy, which the Government were bound to take into account in granting an Industrial Development Certificate for the constructionof a major industrial plant, and to enquire how far thoseconsiderations might properly be affected by the fact that theExchequer would have to provide practically the whole of the capitalexpenditure involved.   Moreover, the decision must inevitably becould be compensated by corresponding savings. It was also desirable that Supplementary Estimates in the current financial year should be restricted to the minimum and that, although new projectsmight be approved in principle, their implementation should be deferred wherever possible until the following year.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The functions of some Departments would inevitably expandfurther; and, since those Departments could not themselves offercompensating economies, it might be necessary to seek to securethe necessary saving in the activities of other Departments.(b) It would not be possible to prevent defence expenditurein the following year from rising above its level in the current financial year unless certain decisions of policy were taken.(c) It might be necessary to give special consideration to a moderate increase in expenditure on the prison service in order toimprove conditions in the prisons and to make adequate provisionfor the increase in juvenile prisoners.(d) The increase in expenditure on political and military supportof allied and friendly Governments might be legitimately reduced if a more realistic method of accounting was adopted. While itwould remain desirable to convince the recipients of our assistance that its value was substantial, the oversea Departments should notbe compelled unnecessarily to inflate their Estimates by acceptingcharges, primarily from the Service Departments and the Ministryof Supply, which in some cases exceeded the real worth of the equipment and services provided.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C. (58) 111.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary, the Commonwealth Secretary, theColonial Secretary and the Minister of Defence, toarrange for an examination of the inter-Departmentalaccounting arrangements which should govern theprovision of political and military assistance to allied and friendly Governments in order to ensure that the costof such assistance was assessed on a realistic basis.
CC. 44 (58)affected by the extent to which it was reasonable to suppose that effective management of the new plant could be secured irrespective of its site. These different considerations, though separate, wereinter-related; and it should be the Cabinets first objective to decide the relative weight which should be attached to each of them.In discussion there was general agreement with this view. Thefollowing points were made:&apos;  .(a) The Government should not defer a decision merely on theground that at the present time existing steel capacity was under-employed. The fall in the demand for steel products reflected thecurrent slackening of business activity generally; but the Govern-ment&apos;s future plans must be based on a confident expectation thatthe expansion of the economy would in due course be resumed,-and any public announcement that the Government proposed to defer for a time the decision on the location of the new strip millwould, for this reason, need to be drafted with care.(b) It would also be desirable to ensure that the forthcomingannual report of the Iron and Steel Board did not prejudice theGovernments ultimate decision. The Board had proposed toindicate that both they and the iron and steel industry were completely satisfied that, on economic grounds, Newport was themost suitable site for the new mill and that they were consideringdetailed proposals by Messrs. Richard Thomas and Baldwins for theconstruction of the mill on this site.(c) In terms of the unit cost of production the difference betweenthe sites at Newport and Grangemouth was marginal and might wellbe outweighed by the expenditure which the Government would haveto incur in seeking to provide alternative employment atGrangemouth if that site was not selected for the new strip mill.(d) There could be no certainty, in the absence of more detailed examination, that a consortium of iron and steel interests could be formed to undertake the management of a mill erected atGrangemouth.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.(2) Invited the Minister of Power to endeavour to ensure thatany reference made to the site of the proposed new steelstrip mill in the forthcoming annual report of the Ironand Steel Board would be so framed as not to prejudice the Governments ultimate decision on this question.(3) Invited the Minister of Power to consider, in consultationwith the Iron and Steel Board, the course which, if an industrial Development Certificate were refused in respectof the site at Newport, would be open to the leasti objection in terms of cost of operation, management andother relevant factors.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,21st May, 1958.
