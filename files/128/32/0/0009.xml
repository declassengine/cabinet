*2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Labour and the Minister of Transport (C. (58) 17 and 20) aboutthe current London bus dispute.The Minister of Labour said that further reflection had confirmed him in the view that the request by the Transport andGeneral Workers&apos; Union for the establishment of a committee ofenquiry into the London bus dispute should be accepted. To refuse the request would be construed as a challenge by the Governmentto the unions and an interference with the normal pattern of negotiations; it would be liable to provoke an immediate strikethroughout the transport industry, directed against the Governmentand not the employers; and it would deprive the Government of theopportunity to influence the selection of suitable representatives toserve on what would be regarded as an arbitral body. If his proposalj was adopted, however, it would be desirable to emphasise publicly that the Government were constituting the committee only becausethe parties to the dispute had so requested and that the committee^report, being addressed only to the parties, would not necessarilycall for any action by the Government.The Minister of Transport said that, while sharing the viewsof the Minister of Labour, he felt that it was necessary to considerthe situation which would arise if the committee made recommendations which were acceptable to the union and notcapable of being reasonably rejected by the London transport executive (L.T.E.). Although the recommendations would not be binding on the parties, they would be generally regarded as equivalent to an arbitration award; and in these circumstances itwould be consistent with existing Government policy if the L.T.E.accepted such recommendations on the basis that the increased expenditure on wages would be met not by an increase in fares buteither by an increase in productivity or by reductions in services.The L.T.E. would probably be able to make such reductions,although they would prove unpalatable to the general public. If,however, it was considered that Government policy would becompromised by action on these lines, a public direction would need to be issued to the L.T.E., instructing them, whatever the findings of the committee, not to grant any increases in wages. This woulddiscredit the motives of the Government in setting up the committee;and on this hypothesis it might be better to refuse to establish thecommittee.In discussion the following main points were made:  (a) In the light of repeated statements by government spokesmen that wage restraint was essential to the defence of sterling,a decision to set up the committee would be interpreted as indicating that .the Government were seeking, against the wishes of the L.T.E.,* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET52960-11 b 2BritishTransportCommission.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 8thConclusions,Minute 7.)Parliament. 1.   The Home Secretary said that it would be appropriate toProcedure. take an early occasion to pay a tribute in the House of Commons tothe late Mr. Walter Elliott, M.P. Precedent indicated that such a tribute might be best expressed by the Government spokesman atthe opening of the next debate in which Mr. Elliott would have wished to take part.The Cabinet-Invited the Colonial Secretary, in moving the SecondReading of the Overseas Resources Development Bill, topay tribute to the memory of the late Mr. Walter Elliott,M.P.
some means of compromise with the unions. Moreover, all previousevidence suggested that a committee of this kind would, in fact,recommend an increase in wages; and it would then be impossiblefor the L.T.E. or the Government to reject the recommendations ofan independent body. The effect on the Governments economic policies would be serious. On this assumption any attempt toemphasise that the Government were not committed to endorse thereport of the committee would be irrelevant. It might be wiser,therefore, to refuse to accept the union&apos;s request, on the ground thatthe parties had not yet had recourse to the normal procedure ofarbitration. Alternatively, the parties might be invited themselves toset up a body of enquiry, under the chairmanship, at their request,of an individual nominated by the Minister of Labour.(b) On the other hand, although the initiative in requesting theappointment of a committee of enquiry had come from the union,the L.T.E. had concurred in it; and it would therefore be untrue torepresent an acceptance of this request as action taken by theGovernment against the advice of the Executive. Moreover, theestablishment of bodies of enquiry of this nature was a recognisedprocedure. To reject a request for the institution of such acommittee in the present instance would be liable to provoke strike action directed against the Government for failing to follow normal practice and would alienate the growing body of moderate tradeunion opinion which was in broad support of the government&apos;s policy of wage restraint. It was improbable that the committeewould be able to reach agreement on any recommendation for anincrease in wages. They would be more likely to recommend thatthe issue should be referred to arbitration or that a wide-rangingenquiry should be established into the road transport industry. Theeffect of such findings would not only be helpful in the immediatecontext but might also tend to strengthen the resistance of employers in private industry to claims for increased wages.(c) It would be desirable to ensure that if, in the event, thecommittee recommended a moderate increase in wages, the L.T.E.would not attempt to recover their additional costs by raising fares,to the detriment of the Governments disinflationary policies.Further consideration might need to be given to this point, since theExecutive were statutorily entitled to apply for increases in fares and it might not be possible to issue a general direction to them to refrain from making such an application.(d) A refusal of the union&apos;s request might precipitate a busstrike, which might extend to other sections of the transport industry.It might not be possible to resolve an industrial dispute on this scaleexcept by the appointment of an authoritative and independent committee of enquiry. It was necessary, therefore, to consider notonly whether the Government were willing, and prepared, to facewidespread industrial dislocation but also whether it would be totheir advantage to appear ultimately to concede, under pressure,an enquiry which they had refused at the outset to establishvoluntarily.(e) It might be possible, however, to reject the union&apos;s requestin terms which would not justify a resort to strike action. It couldbe argued that the Government could not be indifferent to the difficult situation arising from provincial differentiation in the wagestructure of the road passenger transport industry; that, in the lightof this consideration and of the L.T.E.&apos;s confirmation of their inability to offer any increase in wages, no useful purpose would be served by establishing a committee to enquire into the London busdispute in isolation; but that the Government might be willing to reconsider their attitude if all the interests concerned put forward a request that the wages problem in the road passenger transport industry as a whole should be the subject of investigation. It would remain important to emphasise that the initiative for any widerenquiry of this nature would have to come from all the interested
3. The Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum by theMinister of Transport and Civil Aviation and the Minister of Supply(C. (58) 19) on the requirement of British European Airways (B.E.A.)for new jet aircraft.The Minister of Civil A aviation said that it was not yet possibleto take a considered decision on all the issues involved in the choice between the alternative designs of this aircraft put forward by thede Havilland Aircraft Company and the Bristol Aeroplane Company.The Bristol Aeroplane Company, who were co-operating with the hawker Siddeley Group in this project, were at present negotiating with Pan-American Airways for the sale of a substantial number ofthe Bristol aeroplane. In the light of these negotiations the hawker siddeley-Bristol consortium were likely to announce their intentionto proceed with their project, irrespective of the B.E.A. order. Hewas prepared to agree that a decision on the B.E.A. order shouldbe deferred for a fortnight, pending the outcome of the negotiations.If, however, this question was raised in the forthcoming debate on civil aviation in the House of Commons, a temporising reply on thelines proposed in paragraph 8 (ii) of C. (58) 19 would have to begiven.aircraft industry.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 86thConclusions,Minute 6.)parties and not from the Government. It might also be desirableto remind the union that, for reasons which they had been unwilling to disclose, they had refused to participate in the normal procedure of arbitration in the case of the London bus dispute. A reply onthese lines could not be guaranteed to prevent the union from takingstrike action. But it would make it more difficult for them to justifysuch action, and it might secure a postponement of the issue during a period in which the pattern of wage settlements for the current year would have been settled in negotiations which did not involvethe Government.The Home Secretary, summing up the discussion, said that the considerations involved were finely balanced. A committee ofenquiry which produced recommendations of a helpful nature wouldprovide the Government with a defensible position on which to faceany subsequent strike. Moreover, the problem of bringing such astrike to an end might be eased if the strike had not been precipitatedby the Governments refusal to set up a body of enquiry. On theother hand it was essential to avoid any measures which might beconstrued as a weakening of the Governments determination tomaintain their disinflationary policies; and a rejection of the union&apos;request, if based on reasonable grounds, would have the advantageof demonstrating the Governments determination to secure wage restraint, while possibly retaining the support of moderate opinion in the trade union movement and elsewhere. Before reaching adecision on this important issue, the Cabinet would need to give further consideration to the presentation of the argument in supportof a refusal to constitute a committee of enquiry.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Labour, in consultation with theMinister of Transport, to circulate, in the light of their discussion, the draft of a letter to the Transport andGeneral Workers&apos; Union rejecting their request for acommittee of enquiry.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion, on the basis of the draft letter referred to in Conclusion (1) above, at a meetinglater that day.
The Minister of Supply said that in the past it had been thepractice to allow B.E.A. to specify their requirements for a new aircraft without regard to the requirements of prospective foreignpurchasers. The future prosperity of the British aircraft industry,however, would depend increasingly on its success in the export market. It would therefore be important to give greater weight to export prospects in determining the types of civil aircraft to be manufactured in this country. For this reason the present initiative of the Hawker-Bristol consortium should be encouraged.In discussion it was agreed that it would be wrong to attemptto reach a premature decision on this important issue. It was alreadywell known that B.E.A. preferred the de Havilland aircraft; but,while the Government could not compel the Corporation to purchaseany particular aircraft, it would be important to avoid giving any undertaking in the debate that they would be given complete freedomof choice in this matter, especially since Government approval would,in any event, be needed for the capital investment involved in theorder for these new aircraft. There was unlikely tc be an exportdemand for more than one aircraft of this type, and other foreigncustomers would be influenced, perhaps decisively, by the choicemade by Pan-American Airways. The arrangements for meeting this B.E.A. requirement raised important issues of policy, whichshould be further considered when the outcome of the present negotiations between the Hawker-Bristol consortium and Pan-American Airways was known.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation to be guided by the sense of their discussion in any referenceto the B.E.A. requirement for a new jet aircraft duringthe forthcoming debate on civil aviation in the House ofCommons.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, inconsultation with the Minister of Supply, to circulate a further memorandum on this matter when the outcome of the current negotiations between the Hawker-Bristolconsortium and Pan-American Airways was known.Soviet Union.Letters toHeads ofGovernment.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 8thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the reply to besent by the Prime Minister to the letter of 9th January fromMr. Bulganin. They had before them a draft reply prepared in thelight of their previous discussion, which had been sent to the PrimeMinister (Commonwealth Relations Office telegram to New ZealandNo. 100 of 22nd January), together with the Prime Ministerssuggestions for an alternative draft (Commonwealth Relations office telegrams from New Zealand Nos. 61 and 62 of 24th January).In discussion the following points were made:  (a) While the reply should indicate, in its general tone, our willingness to contemplate a meeting of Heads of Government, itshould make it clear that our agreement to such a meeting was conditional upon adequate advance preparation and on agreement by the Soviet leaders that, in addition to their own suggestions, thetopics proposed by the Western Powers should be discussed. Thesestipulations should assist us in securing the agreement of our allies to the proposed meeting and should also allay any disquiet in thiscountry that, the Government were yielding to pressure from theSoviet Union.(b) The Soviet leaders were unlikely to agree that thepreparatory work should be entrusted to a meeting of foreign ministers since they had already rejected this suggestion as a meansof making further progress in the discussions on disarmament. Itwould be preferable, therefore, to retain the alternative suggestion
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th January, 1958.that the advance preparation should be effected through confidentialdiplomatic exchanges.(c) The Prime Ministers suggestion that our views on the main issues for discussion should be set out in an Annex would shorten the reply while ensuring that our constructive proposals were restatedpublicly. This Annex might be based on paragraphs 3-11 of thedraft circulated with C. (58) 13. It might also be desirable to limit the list of topics for discussion and, in particular, to omit thequestions of German reunification and European security on whichthere might be difficulty in reaching agreed views with all our Allies.(d) The inclusion of a suggested date for the meeting of Headsof Government would help to emphasise our genuine desire for sucha meeting. On the other hand it would be unwise to specify a date with too much precision since it would need to be agreed with our allies.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Ormsby-Gore) to prepare a revised draft reply, taking account ofthe Prime Minister^ suggestions and of the views expressed in discussion, for submission to the PrimeMinister and to the Foreign Secretary.(2) Agreed to give further consideration to this revised draft ata meeting later in the day.
