Parliament.parliamentary privilege.(previous reference:CC. (58) 50thConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Home Secretary said that the Government might face a difficult situation in the forthcoming debate in the House of commons on the two reports of the Committee of Privileges resulting from theproceedings for libel threatened by the London Electricity Boardagainst Mr. G. R. Strauss, M.P., in connection with a letter which hehad written to the Paymaster-General. The first report had recommended that letters from Members of Parliament to ministers should be regarded as privileged and had concluded that the LondonElectricity Board had therefore committed a breach of privilege. Thesecond report had recommended that no action should be taken inthis particular case. The latter recommendation was likely to be generally endorsed; but the findings of the earlier report would be strongly opposed by a section of the Governments supporters. as leader of the House of Commons and Chairman of the Committeeof Privileges he had no alternative but to move that both reports beadopted. He would, however, explain in his speech the arguments for and against the findings of the first report; there would be a free vote; and he was content that members of the Government shouldvote as they judged right.In discussion it was pointed out that, if the recommendation inthe Committee&apos;s first report was adopted, it would extend the degreeof privilege already enjoyed by Members of Parliament to includecases where the representations which they sponsored were founded on intentional malice. But the courts were unlikely to uphold theview that, in any legal action which resulted, the plaintiff was guilty of a breach of privilege. It was undesirable that the courts shouldbe brought into collision with Parliament in this matter. It was alsoundesirable that the House of Commons should appear to be seeking to enlarge unnecessarily the scope of Parliamentary privilege. on balance, therefore, it was preferable that the first report of theCommittee of Privileges should not be adopted. It would be convenient if some members of the Government abstained from voting on it, though any who wished to do so would be free to vote against it.In further discussion there was general agreement with these views. It was suggested, however, that the issues involved might with advantage be referred to a Select Committee.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that members of the Government should vote infavour of the second report of the Committee of Privilegeson the case of Mr. G. R. Strauss, M.P., but should be freeeither to vote against the first report of the Committee orto abstain from voting on it.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to consider the desirability ofproposing the appointment of a Select Committee toexamine the issues of privilege raised by these reports.SECRET 3CC. 52 (58)Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
nuclear energy.Amendment ofUnited StatesLegislation.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 51stConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the UnitedStates Atomic Energy Commission had agreed to omit, from the preamble to the bilateral agreement between the United States andthe United Kingdom about the exchange of information on nuclear energy, any reference to the purpose of this agreement which mightimply that its scope extended to the civil, as well as the military,application of nuclear energy. The agreement was, therefore, nowacceptable to us, and it was hoped that it might be executed and laidbefore Congress that day. Thereafter it would need to be published in this country as a White Paper.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement.Egypt.financial negotiations.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 51stConclusions,Minute 4)4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had given further consideration to the best means of anticipating renewedpressure on the Government in connection with the claims of Britishsubjects for compensation in respect of loss of, or damage to, their assets in Egypt. If possible, the forthcoming debate on this subject in the House of Lords should be postponed; and, if it would be ofadvantage in this connection, he would be prepared to considerextending to claims in respect of business assets the existing arrangements for making ex gratia advances which had hitherto been confined to claims in respect of private property. This possibilitymight be indicated confidentially to the spokesmen of the claimantswhen he met them, together with the Foreign Secretary, later that day.But it would be necessary to impress on them that the Governmentwould not be prepared to contemplate a concession on these linesunless the negotiations with the Egyptian Government, which were due to be resumed in the near future, had failed to reach a satisfactory conclusion after a reasonable interval and that, in the meantime, theGovernments intentions should not be made public.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of this statement.Economic 5.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he proposed,Situation.        subject to the approval of the Cabinet, to announce that day certain(Previous        modifications of the Governmenfs economic policy which could be reference:      made without impairing the fundamental objectives of strengtheningCC. (58) 48th   sterling and checking the wage-price spiral.   After the end of JulyConclusions,    the banks would no longer be required to restrict the total level of minute 4)        their advances to a prescribed figure and, for the future, bank creditwould be controlled by normal monetary measures, reinforced by anew arrangement under which the Bank of England would, ifnecessary, restrict the liquidity of the banking system by calling forspecial deposits.  This would be a temporary arrangement, pendingthe report of the Committee on Monetary Policy.   In addition, a revised directive would be issued to the Capital Issues Committee,which would enable them to take a longer view of proposals put before them, would relieve them of the obligation of considering theappropriateness of bank finance for capital purposes and the duty ofdealing with bonus issues and the capitalisation of reserves, and wouldrestore the exemption limit to the former level of  50,000.
Prison Reform.(previous reference :C.C. (57) 75thConclusions,Minute 4)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (58) 136) on prison reform.The Home Secretary said that conditions in many of the prisonswere in urgent need of improvement. The buildings were unsuitedto modern conceptions of penal treatment and disproportionatelyexpensive to maintain; and overcrowding, which was both an effect and a cause of the current increase in crime, had reached a point atwhich constructive work by prison staffs had become almost impossible. He therefore proposed to discuss with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, as part of the current review of capital expenditure,the possibility of building new prisons and other accommodation forthe treatment of both adult and young offenders. In addition he wascontemplating methods of reducing the number of persons who were sent to prison by providing more adequate facilities for the examination and appropriate treatment of offenders. Some of these measures would involve legislation, for which it might be difficultto provide time during the 1958-59 session. It would therefore be appropriate that, as an initial step, the Governments proposals should be published in a White Paper, for subsequent implementationas opportunity offered.In discussion it was generally agreed that, while increased capitalexpenditure was overdue in other social services, notably the hospital service, a White Paper on penal reform would be timely and appropriate. The Cabinet were informed that the Secretary of Statefor Scotland wished to be associated with the discussions on capitalexpenditure but to reserve his position on the question whetherproposals for the improvement of Scottish prisons would best be announced in a joint White Paper or separately.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland to discuss with the Chancellor of the exchequer the possibility of making increased capital available forthe prison service.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, after consultation with theSecretary of State for Scotland, to circulate the draft ofa White Paper on penal reform.C.C. 52 (58)In discussion there was general agreement that these proposals were appropriate to the uncertain economic prospect which lay ahead.It was suggested, however, that this relaxation of restrictions in theprivate sector would make it more difficult to resist the growingpressure for increased public expenditure, especially on housing and education. On the other hand, foreign opinion was particularly alertto detect any premature easing of the control over the governments own expenditure; and, in the light of the need to preserve overseasconfidence in sterling, it was too early to adopt a deliberate policy ofrelaxation in the public sector.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals of the Chancellor of the exchequer for a moderate relaxation of restrictions in the field of creditcontrol.
Pensions.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 49thConclusions,Minute 2)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (58) 137) about pensions.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet should seek to reach a decision on future pensions policy in the light of the fact, emphasised in C. (58) 137, that it would not be permissible to consider financing the emerging deficit on the National Insurance Fund for a short period by realising the invested balances of the Fund unless it was reasonably clear, by the date of the 1959 Budget, that legislation to remedy the defective finances of the existing scheme would be enactedand brought into operation in the relatively near future.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in response to thesuggestion of the Cabinet at their last discussion, he had ascertained that it should be possible to devise a modification of the SeptemberPlan which, while retaining the features of that Plan which werepolitically attractive, would also increase its prospect of solvency inthe longer term. For this purpose it would be desirable to prescribeannual increases of 3d. in the flat-rate contribution instead of the quinquennial increases of Is. which the Plan had hitherto assumed.It would also be necessary to assume that the long-term unemploymentrate in the future would be 2 per cent., by comparison with the rate of4 per cent, which was assumed for the purpose of the existing national insurance scheme. Since the present scheme, which was also thelower tier of the September Plan, already charged the contributormore than the actuarial contribution which was justified by anassumed rate of unemployment of 4 per cent., this modification would increase the element of &quot; overload &quot; in the contribution. Providedthat this result was politically acceptable, the September Plan, ifmodified as he had suggested, should remain approximately in balancefor some twenty years.On the other hand it remained open to substantial objections ofprinciple. First, it achieved its solvency by assuming future increases in the present fiat-rate contribution without increasing the existingflat-rate benefits and by employing the income of the new scheme tosupport the existing scheme without making any provision to finance the emerging costs of the latter. In neither respect was it defensibleby comparison with the August Plan, which would redress theemerging deficit under the existing scheme without creating anyserious new deficit of its own. Moreover, the September Plan wouldmake it compulsory for all employees earning over  10 a week tomake provision for old age in addition to the basic pension providedby the State. The August Plan, on the other hand, was confined tothe satisfaction of basic needs and left employees free to makesupplementary provision for themselves on the scale, and by themeans, which they considered appropriate to their circumstances.Finally, the September Plan could not be fairly represented as enablingoccupational schemes to enjoy immunity from interference by theState. A scheme which contracted out of the Plan would becomesubject to continuous State control, and many of the existing schemes would need to be modified in greater or less degree before they couldsatisfy the criteria for this purpose.The August Plan, on the other hand, had been criticised in respectboth of its treatment of self-employed persons and of the problems ofabatement of occupational schemes. But these criticisms wereexaggerated. Many self-employed people would pay little more, oreven less, than at present; while the recent consultations with industry had confirmed that the difficulties of abatement might well be less thanthe difficulties of contracting out. Moreover, if the August Plan was thought to imply too great an encroachment on the private sector, itwould be possible to adjust it in several ways in order to confine it toa more limited conception of basic provision. Even so, it would retain the decisive merit of avoiding a provision for contracting out,which would entail grave and increasing administrative difficultieswithout securing any compensating political advantage.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,3rd July, 1958.The Minister of Pensions said that any significant curtailment ofthe August Plan, by making it virtually indistinguishable from theexisting scheme, would be politically unrealistic. On the other hand the Plan, considered in its present form, compared unfavourably withthe September Plan. The difference between the two conceptions wasnot primarily financial; it lay in the fact that the August Plan couldnot fail to inflict considerable damage on occupational schemes,whereas the September Plan, by providing for contracting out, would reduce the adjustment of those schemes to the minimum whichindustry recognised as inseparable from any new pensions policy.The precise manner in which the periodical increase in contributions under this Plan would best be adjusted would need furtherconsideration; but if an adjustment of this kind would, in principle,satisfy the needs of the Exchequer, the case for the September plan was made out.It was possible, however, to envisage a compromise schemewhich would, in effect, introduce the September Plan in respect ofthose industries which wished, and were able, to exercise a right of contracting out and would apply the August Plan to the remainder of the employed population. Such a scheme would be less attractivethan the September Plan in as much as it would involve accepting,in respect of the majority of the working population, the principleof redistributive taxation which was inherent in the August Plan.Nevertheless its administrative implications for example, inconnection with the transferability of pension rights on change ofemployment should be no more formidable than those of the september Plan itself. It might therefore deserve furtherconsideration.In discussion it was suggested that a compromise of this kind would have certain advantages. In effect, it would preserve theprinciple of contracting out within the framework of the financiallysounder of the two Plans hitherto envisaged; and it would largelyresolve the problems associated with the treatment of self-employed persons and the abatement of occupational schemes. On the otherhand it might constitute an increased incentive to the more highly paid worker to contract out and might therefore prove to be lesseconomic in its long-term operation than the August Plan.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwould be desirable for the compromise scheme to be further examined.Without prejudice to the result of this examination, the SeptemberPlan should also be reconsidered with particular reference to theadministrative implications of contracting out, since it was mainly by reference to its practicability that the Plan must be judged.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the ministerial committee on pensions policy to examine in greater detail:  (i) the compromise scheme mentioned during  their discussion;(ii) the adminstrative feasibility of contracting out.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion, in the light of the resultsof the enquiry under Conclusion (1) above, at a meeting in the following week.
