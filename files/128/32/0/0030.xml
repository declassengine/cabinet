Budget. 1,   The Chancellor of the Exchequer communicated to theCabinet particulars of the proposals in the forthcoming Budget.In accordance with precedent, details are not recorded in theCabinet Conclusions.Aden; *2.   The Prime Minister said that at a meeting on 11th April the(Previous        Defence Committee had considered reports from the Governor of references:      Aden on subversive activities in the Protectorate.     Evidence had. (56) 5lst   come to hand that Muhammed Ali Jiffri and his brothers, who had conclusions,     for some time been engaged in anti-British activities, were seeking to minute 8 and    persuade the Sultan of Lahej to renounce his Treaty of AllegianceC.C. (57) 13th   wjth the United Kingdom and to declare the adherence of Lahej to conclusions.     the United Arab Republic.   The Governor of Aden had thereforeMinute 6.)       sought authority to arrest the Jiff ri brothers and to deport them toSt. Helena.   He was anxious to act on 17th April, as he had reasonto believe that Muhammed Ali Jiff ri was planning to leave, at the endof Ramadan, for the Yemen or Cairo in order to complete thearrangements for the adhesion of Lahej to the United Arab Republic.It was hoped that, after the arrest of the Jiffri brothers, the Sultan ofLahej could be persuaded to honour his Treaty obligations to thiscountry, but if he refused to co-operate it might be necessary todepose him.   The arrests could be carried out by the local forces in aden, but reinforcements from the United Kingdom would berequired to deal with any subsequent local disturbances. The DefenceCommittee had authorised the moves of the necessary reinforcements,and these were due to start early on the following morning.In discussion there was general agreement that the proposedarrests should be carried out as planned, with a view to frustratingany attempt on the part of the Sultan of Lahej to adhere to the united arab Republic. Such a coup cVetat would iseriously impair ourposition in the Aden Protectorate and would prejudice the chance of arranging for the progressive constitutional development of theColony and Protectorate in a manner favourable to the West. Someof the Rulers of the Protectorate States were now prepared toco-operate in long-term proposals for federation, and this opportunityfor constitutional advance should not be missed. The arrests would provoke criticism in the countries hostile to our position in the aden protectorate, but a show of firmness in dealing with subversive activities would be welcomed, at least privately, by friendly arab states. It would, however, be important to ensure that the reasonsfor our action were explained to all friendly Governments.Consideration should also be given to the means by which King Saudshould be informed of our motives. The Cabinet should be consultedfurther before any action was taken to depose the Sultan of Lahej.St. Helena appeared to be the most suitable place to which to deport the Jiffri brothers after their arrest, since the necessary powers for their detention already existed in that Colony. Our action might,however, be criticised as an infringement of the European convention for the Protection of Human Rights. The detention of the Jiffribrothers in St. Helena would have to be justified under the convention on the ground that their activities had constituted a threat to thesecurity of Aden Colony. In order to reduce the difficulties on this account further consideration should be given to the possibility of bringing the brothers to trial on a criminal charge or perhaps of removing them subsequently from St. Helena to some other area not covered by the Convention.
The Cabinet (I) Approved the arrangements for the arrest of the three Jiffribrothers  and   their  deportation   to  St.   Helena;(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to seek further authority before any action was taken to depose the Sultan of Lahej.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary, the Commonwealth secretary and the Colonial Secretary to arrange for instructions tobe sent to Her Ma jesty&apos;s representatives in the UnitedStates and in friendly Arab countries and to UnitedKingdom High Commissioners and Colonial Governors,as appropriate, about the basis on which they shouldcounter criticism of these arrests when they became known.(4) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider how the reason forthese arrests could best be explained to King Saud.(5) Invited the Colonial Secretary to prepare, for the PrimeMinisters approval, the draft of a statement to be madein the House of Commons after the arrests had takenplace.(6) Invited the Colonial Secretary, in consultation with theForeign Secretary, to submit to the Colonial PolicyCommittee proposals for further constitutional development in the Aden Colony and Protectorate.Cabinet Office, S.W. I,15th April, 1958.
