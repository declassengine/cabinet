Parliamentary 2.   The Home Secretary said that, after reflecting further on the privilege. issues raised by the recent debate on Parliamentary privilege, he had(Previous reached the conclusion that no useful guidance could be offeredReference: to Members of Parliament by the Government in relation toC.C. (58) 60th Parliamentary Questions about the nationalised industries. ThereConclusions, would be no advantage in promoting further Parliamentary discussionMinute 3.) about the permissible scope of such Questions, although he mightcomment on this point in the evidence which he would give to theSelect Committee on Procedure during the autumn.His forthcoming statement on Parliamentary privilege would therefore be confined to the problem of letters from Members ofParliament to Ministers. He proposed to remind Members oftheir responsibility to avoid making defamatory statements whichthey could not justify, or transmitting to Ministers allegations whichwere mischievous or frivolous. He would also explain that aMember, in communicating to a Minister a malicious letter from amember of the public, would continue to be protected by qualifiedprivilege provided that he was not himself actuated by malice. Hewould emphasise, however, that Ministers could not satisfactorilyinvestigate criticisms of the administration of public services withoutreferring to the organisations concerned the letters which they received from Members and that, in the absence of an express request to the contrary, they would feel at liberty to do so. At the same time members could be assured that Departments would be remindedof their responsibility to exercise due discretion in this matter andto deal with letters of this nature in the most circumspect mannerappropriate to each case.In discussion there was general agreement that a statement onthese lines would be appropriate.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the terms of the statement about Parliamentary privilege which the Home secretary proposed to make in the House of Commons in thefollowing week.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange forDepartments to be reminded of the need to exercisegreat discretion in dealing with letters from Membersof Parliament transmitting complaints and criticismsfrom members of the public.(3) Invited the Home Secretary to consider the possibility of supplying Members of Parliament with a suitable formof routine letter to be used for transmitting suchcomplaints and criticisms to Ministers.53860-5C.C. 64 (58)Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The debate on defence for which the Opposition had asked on28th July had been intended primarily to provide an opportunityfor discussion of the White Paper on the Central Organisation for defence. It would be desirable to seek to confine it, as far as possible,to the issues arising from that White Paper and to prevent any detailed discussion of current military activity in the Middle East.It was proposed that Parliament should adjourn for the summer recess on 1st August, subject to arrangements for recall should thisbecome necessary.
Middle East.(previous reference:CC. (58) 62ndConclusions,Minute 1.)Meeting of heads of governments.Lebanon.Jordan.*3. The Cabinet reviewed the latest developments in thesituation in the Middle East.The Foreign Secretary said that Mr. Khrushchev had now accepted in principle the Prime Ministers proposal that the issues arising from the military intervention by the United States and theUnited Kingdom in the Lebanon and Jordan respectively should bediscussed at an extraordinary meeting of the Security Council, to be attended by Heads of Governments. It would be important to ensurethat this discussion was confined to the situation in the Middle Eastand was not so enlarged as to constitute, in effect, the meeting of heads of Governments on which we had hitherto been unable toreach agreement with the Soviet Government. It would be for theSecurity Council to decide which other countries should attend theforthcoming meeting. Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s proposal that the PrimeMinister of India should be invited to be present should give riseto no difficulty; but it would be necessary to consider more carefullyhis suggestion that &quot; the interested Arab States &quot; should also berepresented. It would be premature to attempt to convene themeeting on 28th July, as the Soviet Government proposed, since itwould not be possible to complete by that time the necessarydiscussions with other Commonwealth countries and our allies.In the meantime, it would be desirable to counter any suggestionthat there was a difference of view between the United States and united Kingdom Governments about these arrangements.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of this statement.The Foreign Secretary said that negotiations for a solution ofthe political differences in the Lebanon were continuing under UnitedStates auspices. There were indications that the leaders of thevarious Lebanese Parties were beginning to realise the need toco-operate in reaching a compromise solution in order to maintainthe independence and integrity of their country. In the meantime,the Presidential election, which should have taken place that day,had been postponed for about a week.The Foreign Secretary said that, despite the outward appearance of calm, there was an undercurrent of tension in Amman. Theestablishment of an overland line of communication through Aqaba,for which arrangements were being made, should help to improve the situation, since it would then be evident that the arrangementsfor supporting our forces in Jordan were less vulnerable. Theobjections which the Government of Israel were raising to theoverflying of Israeli territory by British transport aircraft en route to Amman probably reflected a division of opinion in the presentcoalition Government in Israel. Representatives of the more extreme Parties might be attempting to exploit the present situationin order to discredit the Israeli Prime Minister. We were thereforeemphasising to the Israeli Government that their obstructive attitude would only serve to encourage the elements in Jordan which were opposed to King Hussein and could have serious consequences fortheir own security.In discussion stress was laid on the importance of ensuring the secrecy of the arrangements to establish an alternative supply route through Aqaba. For this reason the transfer of a company of theparachute battalion from Amman to Aqaba should be deferred until a ship carrying supplies to Aqaba had passed safely through the suez Canal.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for the proposed transfer of a parachute company from Amman to Aqabato be deferred until a ship carrying stores to Aqaba had passed through the Suez Canal.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
InvestmentProgramme1957-62.(previous reference :C.C. (57) 68thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (E.A. (58) 59) on the level of investment in the public sector in the period 1957-62.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that, in the autumn ofthe previous year, the Cabinet had agreed that public sectorinvestment in 1958-59 and 1959-60 should not exceed the levelachieved in 1957-58. At that time the latter figure had been estimated at  1,500 millions. In fact, it had proved to be of theorder of  1,430 millions, while in the current year public investmentappeared likely to amount to about  1,425 millions. So far, therefore,the objective established in the previous year had been broadlyachieved. But Departmental forecasts of public sector investmentsin 1959-60 indicated a total of about  1,520 millions and in subsequent years this figure rose steeply to a level of  1,780 millions in 1962-63. For the year 1959-60 a total of some  1,500 millions would be tolerable. But the programmes at present envisaged for1960-61 onwards would far exceed the resources likely to be available and would be liable to provoke a recurrence of the inflationary pressure which was only now being brought under control. It would53860-5C.C. 64 (58)Iraq. The Foreign Secretary said that a report from Her Majesty&apos;ambassador at Baghdad indicated that several members of the newRepublican Government in Iraq appeared to be genuinely shockedby the violence which had accompanied the coup d&apos;etat. Many ofthe new leaders might be actuated more by a sincere desire for domestic reform in Iraq than by sympathy with the policies of theUnited Arab Republic, and it was perhaps significant that the communists in Iraq had already indicated their opposition to thenew regime. Pending the forthcoming discussions with our alliesabout our future relations with the Republican Government, it wouldbe expedient to maintain our present non-committal attitude.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Bank of england had been asked by the Central Bank of Iraq whether they were free to continue to draw on their sterling account. At the same time,the Jordanian authorities had requested that no withdrawal from this account should be authorised without their consent since they nowclaimed to control the finances of the Arab Union. The Bank ofEngland had been advised that the Arab Union had no legal sanction for this request since the sterling account of the Central Bank ofIraq had remained under the control of the Iraqi authorities even after Iraq had acceded to the Union. Any attempt to intervene inthe normal relations between the Bank of England and overseascustomers would inevitably affect foreign confidence in sterling.Moreover, the Iraq Petroleum Company had so far been permitted to continue their operations and the new regime in Iraq seemedanxious to maintain commercial relations with the United Kingdom.The Bank of England would therefore allow normal business to betransacted through the Iraqi sterling account. They had been asked,however, to report any sudden request for large withdrawals of sterling.The Prime Minister said that, in accordance with precedent, therewould be no official mourning for King Feisal in this country. Butconsideration was being given to the possibility of arranging a memorial ceremony for the King and the other victims of theinsurrection.The Cabinet (3) Took note of these statements.
be reasonable to assume that, in the longer term, the gross domestic product would increase at a rate of about 2\ per cent, a year; and,in the light of the general consensus of opinion that we should devotea larger proportion of our resources to investment, it would be appropriate that in 1959-60 the level of public sector investment should be increased, by some  75 millions over the level in thecurrent year, to a figure of about  1,500 millions; that in 1960-61this figure should be increased by a further  75 millions; and that,in so far as it was necessary to plan further ahead, an annual growth of  75 millions should be assumed. On this hypothesis, public sectorinvestment would increase at a rate approximately double the rate ofthe assumed growth in the national product; and, in the light of theother demands on the national resources, particularly in respect of.private industrial investment and the essential surplus on the balanceof payments, it would represent the maximum allocation of resources to investment in the public sector which could be contemplated with reasonable safety.A decision of principle on these lines would, however, entailconsiderable reductions in planned programmes of investment,particularly in those cases where the forecasts indicated a sharp and rapid expansion, e.g., electricity, coal and transport. these programmes would therefore need to be critically examined by theTreasury in consultation with the Deparmtents concerned.As regards the remainder of the current year, it was debatablewhether a total of public sector investment amounting to some   1,425millions would suffice to prevent any serious under-employment ofindustrial capacity. If it became clear that unemployment was increasing, it would be possible to introduce measures which wouldinject into the economy an amount of additional investment expenditure which should suffice to check the decline in activity.These measures, which might include an increase in local authorityhouse-building, could, if necessary, be brought into effect rapidly and without prejudice to the level of public sector investment as awhole in 1959-60.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) In the long term the solution of our economic problems would only be found in a renewed increase in production. But thiswould depend on private, rather than public, investment; and our objective should be to stimulate an expansion of private investment as rapidly as possible. On the other hand an expansion of public investment, in so far as it promoted additional orders for plant andequipment, might represent one of the most effective means of stimulating a revival of investment in the private sector. the nationalised industries might have a particularly important role toplay in this respect.(b) In the shorter term the need was less for an expansion of capacity than for an increase in orders which would enable existingcapacity to be fully used. But the measures which might be appropriate for this purpose were also liable, by stimulatingconsumption, to renew the threat to the balance of payments. this risk would need to be borne in mind if it became necessary to stimulate a limited amount of additional investment to counter anincrease in unemployment in the months immediately ahead.(c) It was undesirable that the limit imposed on investment should be expressed in purely financial terms. In the absence of anymargin for increases in costs, Departmental investment programmeshad to be subjected to arbitrary and uneconomic modifications andthe objective of steady and sustained progress was frustrated. Itwould be helpful if investment allocations could be assessed in termsof constant prices.(d) There would also be advantage in distinguishing more clearlybetween investment which promoted new production and investment
which comprised merely the replacement or adaptation of existingassets.(e) Although it must remain one of our main objectives to achieve an adequate surplus on the balance of payments, the figureof  450 millions a year which was now proposed as the measure ofa satisfactory surplus represented a considerable increase over anyfigure hitherto contemplated. If this increase was attributable tothe need to make greater provision for investment overseas, it was for consideration whether such investment could legitimately expect to enjoy priority over investment at home. On the other hand, a figure of  450 millions represented no more than reasonable provisionfor the current surplus on the balance of payments when allowance was made, not only for the increasing demands of commonwealth countries for development finance, but also for our liability to begin to repay our short-term dollar indebtedness in the following year andto fortify the central reserves of the sterling area at a time when the earnings of its other members were subject to the pressure of a declinein the prices of primary products.(/) If we were to maintain the growth of the gross national product at an annual rate of 2\ per cent., it would be essential toensure that manufacturing industry was provided with a steady flow of orders on a sufficient scale. The most effective instrument for thispurpose might be a further reduction in interest rates in other european countries as well as in the United Kingdom; and, if the recession in the United States was drawing to its close, such areduction should assist the European economy to resume industrial expansion more rapidly than normally proved possible after thedelayed impact of a decline of activity in the United States.(g) Unemployment might reach a level of about 3 per cent, bythe beginning of the following year. From both the social and thepolitical points of view it would be undesirable that the Governmentshould appear to acquiesce in unemployment on this scale; and theymust therefore be prepared to expand investment in the public sectorat short notice and in a manner which would provide a selectiveimpetus to a rapid expansion of those industries which were most likely to be adversely affected.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theChancellor of the Exchequer should now discuss with theDepartmental Ministers concerned their investment programmes forthe years 1959-60 and 1960-61 on the basis that an increase of 75 millions in the total of public sector investment in each year would appear to be reasonable. It was important, however, thatthe Government should have ready a programme of short-term measures designed to take immediate effect in sustaining productionand thereby ensuring employment. It would be desirable that a listof such measures should be considered by the Cabinet before the recess. If it became necessary to implement them, they should bebrought into effect unobtrusively; and Government spokesmenshould avoid any major pronouncement of policy which might be interpreted as indicating that the Government apprehended a seriousor imminent deterioration of the economy.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss with theMinisters concerned the Departmental programmes of investment in the public sector for 1959-60 and 1960-61in order to ensure that they could be accommodated within a total of investment expenditure rising by notmore than  75 millions in each year.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate, beforethe summer recess, a list of measures which could beintroduced, with immediate and selective effect, if it
social investment.(previous reference :C.C. (57) 73rdConclusions,Minute 5.)Schools andHospitals.5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Education and the Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (58) 148 and153) about a forward programme of educational policy, togetherwith a memorandum by the Minister of Health (C. (58) 158) abouthospital development.The Minister of Education said that public opinion was receptiveto a further advance in educational policy. The most strikingevidence to this effect was provided by the increase in the numberof pupils remaining at school after the age of fifteen. This tendencywas more pronounced in the grammar schools than in the secondarymodern schools; but this comparison was misleading in that relatively few secondary modern schools were adapted to provide instructionappropriate to older pupils, and the majority were in many respectslittle better than the old-style elementary school. It was this feature of the educational system which was at the root of the currentcriticism of the eleven-plus examination; and much of this criticismwould be allayed if the secondary modern schools were developed on more progressive lines.For this purpose the Government should promote a five-year programme of school building which would complete there organisation of the remaining &quot; all-age &quot; schools, would improveor replace out-of-date primary and secondary schools, would providefor all pupils who wished to continue their education after age fifteen,and would eliminate over-large classes. A programme of this kind,if timed to mature in the years between 1961 and 1965 when thenumber of pupils in the secondary schools would fall, would enablethe Government to secure the maximum of social and political advantage at the cost of an addition of only some  6 millions to theincrease in current expenditure on education which the exchequer would in any case be called upon to meet over that period. It would,however, entail a substantial expansion of the building programme for primary and secondary schools, which would need to rise from itspresent annual level of  50 millions to  60 millions and eventually to 75 millions. But the impact of this programme would be relativelyslight in the year 1960-61 when the other demands of public sectorinvestment would be particularly heavy.As part of a forward policy of this kind it would be very desirable to continue the current five-year plan of expenditure for technical education, when it came to an end in 1960-61, at approximately the current rate of  15 millions a year. It would alsobe necessary to offer an increase in the capital grant to denominationalschools from its present level of 50 per cent, to a figure of 60 percent, or, possibly, 65 per cent. The Government would need tomaintain the principle that this grant was not applicable to theprovision of new denominational schools; but they might concedethat it should be extended to such schools of this nature as were needed to provide proper secondary educational facilities to matchexisting voluntary primary school facilities of the same denomination.In discussion there was general agreement on the advantage of adopting a forward educational policy. On the other hand, theprogramme outlined in C. (58) 148 would involve very substantial additional capital expenditure in the period 1960-65; and, if such expenditure was to be accommodated within an investment programme which would be acceptable from the economic point ofview, the needs of other services might suffer disproportionately.No new hospital had been completed in England and Wales sincethe end of the war; and, for the reasons outlined in C. (58) 158, a long-became necessary to take urgent action to redress adecline in industrial production and a rise in umemployment.
Training of teachers.(previous references :C.C. (57) 73rdConclusions,Minute 5,and 42ndConclusions,Minute 5.)term programme of hospital building was urgently required. Capitalexpenditure in connection with penal reform could also claim high priority. And if the Governmenfs housing policy, as exemplifiedby the Rent Act and the programme of slum clearance, was to proveeffective, house-building must not be unduly restricted. It would benecessary for the educational programme to be considered in more detail in relation to these competing claims on investment resources.The Cabinet -(1) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State forScotland, the Minister of Housing, the Minister ofEducation and the Minister of Health, to examine theproposals in C. (58) 148, 153 and 158 in relation to the competing claims on investment resources during thenext few years.The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Education (C. (58) 149) discussing proposals for increasing thenumber of places in teacher training colleges.The Minister of Education said that previous calculations of thenumber of teachers likely to be required in the next few years hadbeen seriously affected by the emergence of new factors an increasein the rate of retirement among married teachers, a further rise inthe birthrate and an unexpectedly large increase in the number of pupils remaining at school after the age of fifteen. Some permanentexpansion of the teacher training colleges was therefore inevitable,irrespective of the decision on the new programme of educationaldevelopment and school building. The National Advisory Councilon the Training and Supply of Teachers would shortly recommendthat 16,000 additional places should be provided in the colleges. Itwould not be feasible to effect so large an expansion in the time available; but a minimum of 12,000 places would certainly berequired. Of these, the first instalment of 2,500 had already been announced and it was desirable that a second instalment of 9,500places should now be authorised at a capital cost of  12-5 millions over the period 1959-62.In discussion it was suggested that, since even an expansion onthe scale proposed was not likely fully to satisfy the additional demand for trained teachers, it would be preferable to adopt themore radical course of abandoning or deferring the introduction ofa three-year, in place of a two-year, training course. On the otherhand, this change had been announced by the Government less thana year ago and had been accepted by informed opinion as representing a substantial advance in educational policy. It wouldbe politically impracticable to reverse the decision at this juncture,particularly if the Government were shortly to launch a major new programme of educational development. In principle, therefore, themeasures proposed in C. (58) 149 should be adopted. But they shouldbe regarded as constituting one element in the Governmenfs newforward programme; they should be announced simultaneously withthe programme of new school building; and the expenditure whichthey entailed would need to be further examined, together with theexpenditure attributable to the programme of school building, inthe light of the competing claims of other forms of social investmenton the total of investment resources likely to be available during theperiod in question.The Cabinet (2) Approved in principle an expansion of teacher training colleges on the lines of the proposals described inC. (58) 149.
(3) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for these proposals to be examined in greater detail in the context of the review of the school building programme to be carriedout under Conclusion (1) above.Malta. 6.   The   Colonial   Secretary   said   that,   after   prolongedDockyard.       examination of the future of the dockyard at Malta, the Malta(Previous        Committee proposed that it should be transferred to Messrs.

Bailey&apos;s was now the only practicable course,unless we were prepared to continue to maintain it ourselves in face of the political difficulties and uneconomic expenditure which sucha decision would entail.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal.The Chancellor of the Exchequer was willing to accept its financial implications, although he reserved his position on the total amountof the capital grant subsequently to be made available to Malta forpurposes of general development.The Cabinet (1) Approved the arrangements proposed for the transfer ofthe Malta dockyard to Messrs. C. H. Bailey and company Limited.(2) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to announce these arrangements in Parliament during the following week.H.R.H. Prince 7.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that The QueenCharles. had decided that H.R.H. Prince Charles should be created PrinceCreation as of Wales.

Majesty had been prevented by ill health from attending the Gamesin person, but she had recorded an announcement which would be broadcast in the course of the closing ceremony at the end of theGames. It would be made clear in the announcement that the formal ceremony of investment at Caernarvon Castle would not beheld until His Royal Highness had grown up.The Cabinet expressed their gratification at this decision which,they believed, would give deep satisfaction in Wales and throughoutthe Commonwealth.
