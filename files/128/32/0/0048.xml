primeministers visit toNorthAmerica.53860-71. The Prime Minister reported to the Cabinet the results of had discussions in Washington and Ottawa.In Washington he had obtained an assurance that the legislationamending the Atomic Energy Act would be passed in time to allow a bilateral agreement with the United Kingdom to become operativebefore the end of the present Congress. He was satisfied that thisbilateral agreement would authorise the communication of all theinformation about nuclear weapons which we could hope to get at.this stage. President Eisenhower had re-affirmed the principle ofprivate Anglo-American consultation on matters of common concernand had agreed that this principle, which had been applied successfullyin the political field, should now be extended progressively to continue and military matters. He had also agreed that tripartiteconsultation, including France, should be limited to those matters in which France already had an historical status, e.g., preparations for a meeting of Heads of Governments and questions relating toGermany. The United States Government were still sceptical aboutthe value of a meeting of Heads of Governments. They were contentthat the preliminary preparations should be continued, but they werelooking for a test of Russian sincerity and their final attitude wouldbe influenced by the behaviour of the Russian delegation at theforthcoming meeting of scientists in Geneva which was to considerthe technical problems involved in establishing a system of inspection and control over nuclear tests. Their attitude towards an international agreement for the suspension of tests would similarly be influenced by the results of that meeting. They agreed that a price should beexacted for such an agreement, but they were disposed to think thatan offer of suspension might be made if it were possible to secure inreturn the beginnings of a system of disarmament inspection involving the establishment of control posts on Soviet territory. In addition tothe consideration of some immediate specific problems, an interestingdiscussion had been held on general policy towards the Middle East.This had resulted in agreement that, for the present, the right course was to support our friends and to maintain a cool but correct attitudetowards Egypt. The United States Government were, however,showing anxiety about the longer-term problem of finding some alternative leader of Arab opinion who might be able to counterNasser&apos;s growing influence in the Middle East.Turning to economic subjects the Prime Minister said that it was evident that the Administration were unlikely to take any vigoroussteps to check the recession in the United States because, despite thefall in production and employment, there were signs of continuinginflationary tendencies in the economy. The Administrationrecognised the need for an expansion of world trade, but continuedto show some reluctance to take any public initiative to this end atthe present time. There were some signs that in this matter publicopinion was ahead of the Administration; and it was to be hopedthat, when Congress had risen, it would be possible to make some further progress. It was desirable that, if the United StatesGovernment intended to take some new public initiative, they should do so before the Commonwealth Economic Conference in September.Meanwhile, they had agreed that the machinery for Anglo-Americanconsultation on economic questions should be strengthened.In Ottawa useful discussions had been held on most of thepolitical questions covered in the Washington talks. Canadian ministers had, however, been specially concerned about the prospects for the Commonwealth Economic Conference in September. Theywere most anxious that some new and significant development shouldemerge from this, possibly in the form of a new Commonwealthinstitution, which might have the function, not merely of lending, but of mobilising the savings of small investors throughout theCommonwealth. Another suggestion which had emerged from this discussion was that, if some members of the Commonwealth were moreanxious than others to take some new economic initiative, they might
2. The Prime Minister said that, at a meeting on the previous day, the North Atlantic Council had welcomed the governments proposals for constitutional development in Cyprus. Therepresentatives of the Greek and Turkish Governments had, however,reserved their position and the Secretary-General had asked that theannouncement of our plan should be deferred for forty-eight hours in order to allow time for further efforts to be made to persuade those governments to discuss it in greater detail. After consultation withthe Foreign Secretary and the Colonial Secretary, he had accepted this suggestion and proposed to inform the House of Commonsaccordingly that afternoon.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, that the Prime Minister had agreed,in response to a request from the Secretary-General ofthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, to defer forforty-eight hours the announcement of the governments proposals for constitutional development in Cyprus.The Commonwealth Secretary said that Lord Teviot had tableda Question in the House of Lords, for answer that day, about the archbishop of Canterbury&apos;s invitation to Archbishop Makarios toattend the forthcoming Lambeth Conference.In discussion it was agreed that, if Lord Teviot was unwilling towithdraw his Question, the reply should be confined to a statement that, since Archbishop Makarios was a British subject whom theGovernment had no power to exclude from this country, the proprietyof inviting him to attend the Conference was an ecclesiastical, not apolitical, question and that the Archbishop of Canterbury had been so informed.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to seek to persuadeLord Teviot to withdraw his Question in the House ofLords on the proposed visit of Archbishop Makarios tothis country and, if he was unwilling to do so, to replyto the Question on the lines agreed in their discussion.Cyprus.(previous reference:CC. (58) 47thConclusions,Minute 3.)Lebanon.(previous reference:CC. (58) 44thConclusions,Minute 2.)* 3. The Foreign Secretary said that the situation in the Lebanonwas deteriorating. The observers despatched by the United nations organisation were unable to take any effective action, and a deadlockappeared to be developing between President Chamoun and GeneralChehab, the Lebanese Commander-in-Chief. If President Chamounwere to invite the United Kingdom, and United States governments to intervene, it might now be necessary, in the light of Lebanon&apos;recent appeal to the Security Council, to make some approach to theCouncil before any initiative was taken by the two Governments.   If,* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.go forward with it among themselves leaving others to join in later ifthey so desired. Now that the members of the Commonwealth were more numerous and their economic interests more diverse, it would $ \be wrong that progress should be frustrated by too rigid an insistence on the principle of universality. Finally, it had been recognised thatany new initiatives taken in Montreal in September should be consistent with anything which the United States might decide to putforward at the meeting of the International Bank and Fund in Delhiin October.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement and expressed their congratulations on the success of his visit to washington and Ottawa.
EconomicSituation.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 30thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that investment,although likely to remain high in the public sector, appeared to bedeclining in the private sector. In his Budget he had proposed anincrease in the initial allowances from 10 per cent, to \2\ per cent, for industrial building and from 20 per cent, to 25 per cent, for plant and machinery. He now proposed to announce in the House ofCommons that day that, in order to provide some further stimulus to private investment, he would, on the Report Stage of the finance bill, propose an amendment increasing these allowances to 15 percent, and 30 per cent, respectively.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement.industrial disputes.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 47thConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The Minister of Labour said that the London bus strike hadnot yet been brought to an end and the votes cast by individualgarages in favour of, and against, a resumption of work were veryevenly balanced. It now seemed inevitable that there would be asubstantial reduction in bus services when the strike ended.Moreover, unless work was resumed within the next few days, itmight be desirable for the London Transport Executive to indicatethat they could no longer regard themselves as bound to adopt2nd July as the operative date for the payment of some increase in wages to the bus crews excluded from the recent award of theIndustrial Court.The dispute at Smithneld also remained unresolved and he had appointed a committee of investigation.Work had been resumed at a large number of docks, but in theTooley Street area men were still on strike. The situation was complicated by the reluctance of certain cold-storage companies togive an undertaking that they would not employ unregistered labour.If the strike was not to extend more widely, it would be necessary to persuade them to give a satisfactory assurance on this point.The national wage claim which had been put forward by the dockers would probably be rejected by the employers and, sinceneither party was likely to be willing to submit the issue to arbitration,a fresh dispute might develop in the docks throughout the countryin the near future.The Cabinet (1) Took note of this statement.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, in consultation with theMinister of Labour, to seek to dissuade cold-storagecompanies from employing unregistered labour at thepresent juncture.(3) Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theMinister of Labour, to invite the London transport executive, if the London bus strike was not brought toan end in the next few days, to consider the desirabilityC.C. 48 (58)however, our joint proposals were vetoed in the Council, we might then need, and should, under the Charter of the United Nations, beentitled to take independent action.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.
of indicating that they could no longer be bound to adopt2nd July as the date for the payment of some increase in wages to the bus crews excluded from the recent award of the Industrial Court.(4) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the emergencies committee to consider the implications of a national dockstrike.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,17 th June, 1958.
