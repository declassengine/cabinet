The Cabinet reviewed the situation created by the Soviet(Previous        announcement of their unilateral decision to suspend tests of nuclearReferences:     weapons.

It would be particularly difficult for the United KingdomNuclear Tests.  Government to  forgo these before  they knew precisely what information they might expect to obtain from the United states authorities after the proposed amendment of the MacMahon Act.This would be regulated by a bilateral agreement which, after the amending legislation had been passed, would have to lie beforeCongress for thirty days; and. if this procedure could not becompleted before Congress rose in the summer, the agreement couldnot come into operation until February 1959.   Fortunately, therehad recently been indications that the Administration were now more conscious of the need to expedite this process; and it waspossible that the terms of the agreement might be finally settledduring the Prime Ministers visit to Washington in June.Consultations would now be opened with Allied governments on the nature of the public response to be made to this Sovietannouncement, and no formal statement of the United kingdom governments position could be made until those consultations hadbeen completed. The Prime Minister would however need to make some interim statement in reply to Questions which were to beaddressed to him in the House of Commons that afternoon. It wasagreed that, in the course of this, attention should be drawn to thefact that the Soviet announcement had been made at a moment when an extensive series of Russian tests had just been finished, a further-series of American tests was about to begin and the current seriesof British tests had not been completed. Reference should also bemade to the fact that the disarmament proposals, which had beenput forv/ard by the Western Powers but rejected by the soviet union, had included provision for the suspension of nuclear testsif accompanied by a satisfactory system of international control.Finally, the issue should be linked with the suggestion for a meetingof Heads of Governments, at which proposals for an international agreement on the suspension of nuclear tests could be considered. Itwas fortunate that the statement on the attitude of the Western Powerstowards such a meeting had been endorsed by the North atlantic council before the Soviet announcement on nuclear tests had beenmade. Its simultaneous publication had gone some way to reducethe impact of that announcement on public opinion in the free world.The Cabinet (1) Approved the terms of the interim statement which thePrime Minister proposed to make in the House ofCommons that afternoon on the Soviet announcementof their unilateral decision to suspend nuclear tests.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for consultationsto be opened with Allied Governments on the nature ofthe public response to be made to this Soviet initiative.
be induced to bring the discussions to a head; and it might also benecessary to invoke the assistance of the United States Governmentfor this purpose.The Minister of Defence said that, on the other hand, there was some hope that, as a result of his recent discussions in Bonn and rome, the German and Italian Governments would be preparedto consider the possibility of enlarging the scope of their agreementwith the French Government for the manufacture of arms so as toextend it to the United Kingdom.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Cyprus. 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that, in view of the postponement(Previous        of the Greek elections, there was now no prospect of an earlyReference :      resumption of negotiations with the Greek Government about Cyprus.C.C. (58) 17th It would be difficult to justify to Parliament a period of completeConclusions,    inactivity over this problem, and some means must therefore be minute 4.)      devised of maintaining discussions with the Turkish Government inthe interim.   As a first step he had informed them that they werenot entitled to interpret his recent discussions in Ankara as offeringthem a strategic base in Cyprus except as part of a plan for a political settlement  likely  to  command   the  acquiescence  of  the  three governments concerned and of both the Cypriot communities.  Thenext step would be to indicate to them our own view of the possible basis of such a settlement.   For this purpose we might suggest tothem an arrangement whereby, in return for the establishment of a turkish base in Cyprus, they would r clS3.SC US from our undertaking to accept a partition of the Island in the last resort and wouldacquiesce in a policy of unitary self-determination for the part ofthe Island outside the British and Turkish bases with the minimum of delay, subject to adequate guarantees, embodied in a Treaty, forthe rights of minorities and to certain limitations of sovereignty asregards militarisation and foreign policy.In discussion it was suggested that, if we put forward thisproposal immediately after appearing to modify the undertakingabout the establishment of a Turkish base in Cyprus, the TurkishGovernment would be likely to reject it and to adopt an even moreintransigent attitude towards any other solution which might subsequently be suggested, including the conception of tri-dominium.Moreover, the proposal would imply that, apart from the Britishand Turkish bases, Cyprus would be free to achieve union with greece; and if, as a result, communal disorders broke out or theSoviet Union sought to gain a foothold in the Island, public opinion in this country would be critical of an arrangement whereby, although we retained troops in Cyprus, we failed to intervene in order to restorelaw and order. For this reason it might be wiser to put forward the concept of tri-dominium at the next stage in the negotiations and to reserve the proposal outlined by the Foreign Secretary for discussiononly if tri-dominium proved to be unacceptable.On the other hand, this proposal was known to have the supportof the United States Government. Moreover, it was likely to bemore acceptable than tri-dominium to the Greek Government; andit could be regarded as deriving originally from a suggestion whichthe Turkish Government themselves had tentatively made at one point during the earlier discussions. There was no reason to suppose that, if the situation in Cyprus deteriorated again, a system of tri-dominium which would depend upon the full co-operation of thethree Governments concerned would be any more effective in securing the maintenance of law and order.
Parliament. 4.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons the week after the Easter recess. TheBudget would be opened on 15th April. It was hoped that the debate on the Budget Resolutions would be concluded on 21st April.Rent(previous reference:C.C. (58) 27thConclusions,Minute 1.)*5. The Minister of Housing said that, following the cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion of his proposals for legislation to mitigate hardshiparising out of the Rent Act, 1957, he and the Secretary of State forScotland had again considered, with the Lord Chancellor, what should be the level of rent payable after a landlord had applied tothe County Court for an eviction order. As a result he did not wishto modify his earlier proposal that, as from 6th October, 1958, thetenant should be required to pay a rent equal to the &quot; controlled &quot;rent of twice the gross value of the property (or the corresponding figure in Scotland) up to the date on which the landlords applicationwas determined by the court. But he now proposed that, if stay ofeviction was granted, the proposal in paragraph 6 (vii) of C. (58) 64should be modified and that the tenant should thereafter be requiredto pay, throughout the period of postponement, whatever rent was asked by the landlord, subject to the power of the court, if satisfiedthat this sum was more than the tenant could reasonably afford, toabate it to a level not less than twice the gross value of the property.This proposal should protect the tenant from financial hardship andwould at the same time give less cause for complaint to those tenantswho had already made agreements with their landlords.Discussion showed that there was general agreement that thisproposal was preferable to the earlier suggestion that the courfsdetermination should be subject to an upper limit of 2\ times the gross value of the property. Under the latter scheme the tenantwho had already reached agreement with his landlord on a rentabove the prescribed limit would be aggrieved, while the fact thatthe Government recognised a certain formula as defining a permissiblerent would tend to cause all rents to be fixed at or near the limitallowed by that formula. It could admittedly be argued that, if noupper limit was fixed, a landlord who wished to gain possession ofhis property in order to sell it outright would be able to secure anartificially high rent if the tenant were unable to prove that he could* Previously recorded in a Most Confidential Record.C.C. 28 (58)The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of advantage appeared to lie in putting this proposal to theTurkish Government not as a definite plan which we sponsored butas a suggestion which they themselves had originally made and wehad subsequently been considering. This approach should be madeas informally as possible, preferably through the Turkish ambassador in London, in order to ascertain whether the Turkish Governmentwere prepared to entertain it. If they rejected it, we should then-have no alternative but to put forward publicly our own solutionbased upon tri-dominium, for which we should continue to make preparations.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to ascertain informally, on thelines indicated by the Prime Minister, the Turkish reaction to the proposal which he had submitted to the Cabinet.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to arrange for officials tocontinue their examination of the means of giving effectto the conception of tri-dominium.
Land: 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeCompulsory Secretary (C. (58) 70), covering the report of a Sub-Committee of theAcquisition. Home Affairs Committee, under the Chairmanship of the Lord(Previous Chancellor, which proposed that the basis of compensation for reference: compulsory acquisition of land should be amended to provide force.C. (57) 74th market value; that no change should be made in the compensationConclusions, payable for planning restrictions; and that no attempt should be minute 4.) made to provide for recovery of betterment.In discussion it was recognised that there were strong arguments of equity for amending the present system under which a land-owner was liable to receive a lower price for his land if it wascompulsorily acquired by a public authority than if he sold it to aprivate purchaser. Moreover, a Private Membets Bill which sought to provide compensation on the basis of market value for compulsory acquisition of land had already received an almost unanimous SecondReading and had been warmly welcomed by the government&apos;s supporters both in the House of Commons and in the country. the mover of this Bill, Captain Corfield, M.P., was unwilling to withdrawit in the absence of an assurance of Government legislation.On the other hand, a statutory obligation to pay compensationat market values would in certain cases materially increase the costto public authorities of acquiring land. This would expose theGovernment to the criticism of impeding municipal development,which would be particularly embarrassing in relation to slum clearance in Glasgow and other congested urban areas. Moreover,a Bill which increased the level of compensation for compulsory acquisition but made no attempt to deal with the problem ofbetterment would be likely to revive public interest in the wholequestion of the taxation of land values, on which it would neitherbe practicable nor politically desirable to attempt to legislate in thelast session of the present Parliament.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would need to give further consideration to the issues involved before deciding whether it would be appropriate to introduce,during the forthcoming session, legislation dealing with compensationfor the compulsory acquisition of land. Meanwhile, however, therewould be advantage in proceeding with the preparation of a draftBill. Captain Corfield, M.P., could be given no assurance that theGovernment intended to legislate but should be persuaded, ifpossible, to agree not to proceed further with his own Bill.not pay it without hardship. In practice, however, there were likelyto be few cases of this kind. Nor was it reasonable that the courtsshould be required to determine rents, during a stay of eviction, onthe basis of open market values, since they would be unable todischarge this duty without in each case inspecting the premises.In further discussion there was general agreement that the balanceof advantage lay in the early introduction of legislation on the lines proposed in C. (58) 64, amended on the lines indicated in thediscussion as regards the rent to be payable during a stay of eviction.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Housing to announce on thefollowing day the outline of the Governments proposals to mitigate hardship arising out of the Rent Act, 1957.(2) Invited the Minister of Housing to settle the terms of theannouncement with the Lord Privy Seal, the Secretaryof State for Scotland and the Chief Whip.(3) Invited the Minister of Housing to arrange for the drafting of the necessary legislation and for its introduction ona date to be agreed with the Lord Privy Seal.
Malta. 7.   The Colonial Secretary said that the Governor of Malta(Previous        had assented to the Appropriation Bill which had been passed by reference:      the Maltese Legislature and was about to sign the necessary warrantsC.C. (58) 26th  for the issue from the Consolidated Reserve Fund of the moniesConclusions,    required for capital works during the financial year 1958-59 and for minute 2.)      recurrent services during the first quarter of that year.    the governors action was constitutionally correct, as he was obligedin this matter to act on the advice of the Maltese Government.  Hehad, however, been instructed to inform the Government, when hesigned the warrants, that the United Kingdom subvention to the maltese budget would not be increased beyond  5 millions and thatany deficit above this figure must be made good from the financial resources of the Island.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of this statement.Territorial 8.   The Lord Chancellor said that the Attorney-General hadWaters. sought authority to make public forthwith at the International(Previous Conference on the Law of the Sea our proposal that the limit ofReference: territorial waters should be established at six miles for all purposes,C.C. (58) 24th subject to an appropriate reservation on rights of passage for warshipsConclusions, and aircraft. This proposal would be unwelcome to the CanadianMinute 2.)      Delegation who were still seeking to persuade us to support their plan for a three-mile limit to territorial waters coupled with exclusive fishing rights up to a limit of twelve miles.In discussion the Cabinet reaffirmed their view that our ownproposal should be put forward at whatever point was judged by our representatives at the Conference to be appropriate.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the Attorney-General that he should formally propose, at the point whichhe judged appropriate in the discussions at the international conference on the Law of the Sea, that the limit of territorial waters should be established at six miles for all purposeswith a reservation of rights of passage for warships without prior authorisation and rights of passage for aircraft outsidethe three miles.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,1st April, 1958.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Housing to arrange for the drafting of a Bill to provide that the basis of compensation for compulsory acquisition of land should be market value.(2) Agreed to consider further, at a subsequent meeting, whetherit would be appropriate to introduce this Bill during the1958-59 session.(3) Invited the Minister of Housing, in his further discussions with Captain Corfield, M.P., to be guided by the points made in their discussion.
