EconomicSituation.AllegedLeakageof Information.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 5thConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Home Secretary said that the debate on the Report ofthe Tribunal of Enquiry into the alleged premature disclosure of thedecision to raise Bank Rate would take place in the following week.The Cabinet would need to discuss, before the debate, theGovernments attitude to the problem of the conflict of loyalties towhich a member of the Court of the Bank of England might be subjected if he was required, while discharging his normal obligations to his partners and associates in business, to be party to the discussion,.within the Bank, of matters of such consequence as an increase inBank Rate.In discussion it was suggested that the Governments supporters in the House of Commons might wish to table amendments to the formal Government Motion on which the debate would be based, inorder to emphasise the undesirability of any attempt by Members ofthe House of Commons to take advantage of Parliamentary privilegein order to impugn the personal honour of individuals who, not beingMembers of Parliament, were unable to make any effective reply. Itwas agreed that amendments of this nature need not be discouragedprovided that they were so worded as not to embarrass theGovernment in supporting them.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the debate on the Report of the Tribunal ofEnquiry into the alleged premature disclosure of thedecision to raise Bank Rate should take place on30th January.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate, before this debate, a memorandum discussing the government&apos;s policy towards the problem of the conflict of loyalties towhich members of the Court of the Bank of Englandmight, in certain circumstances, be subjected.government expenditure.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 7thConclusions,Minute 4.)* 2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion on the level ofGovernment expenditure in 1958-59.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the fresh scrutiny of departmental Estimates which the Cabinet had invited him toundertake had revealed new economies of slightly more than 1 million, which could be further supplemented by a saving of 1 million, or possibly  2 millions, on the Estimate for the assistance board. He was satisfied that it would not be possible to reduceordinary Departmental expenditure any further without taking whollyunwarranted risks. In addition, however, if it proved possible toreduce to 350,000 or 325,000 the level of unemployment to be assumed in 1958-59 for the purpose of calculating the deficit on the national insurance Fund, that deficit would be reduced from  23 millions to either  16 millions or  14 millions.On these assumptions Government expenditure in 1958-59 would remain in excess of its level in the current year by an amount of theorder of  68 millions or  66 millions. It this increase was to bereduced to a figure significantly below  50 millions, there was no alternative to a substantial increase in the National Health service contribution ; and after further consideration he had reached the firmconclusion that this contribution should be increased by 8d. as from 1st July. An increase of this order would suffice to achieve theGovernments objective in 1958-59 and would provide a margin fromwhich to meet, without any further increase in the contribution,* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
subsequent increases in the cost of the National Health Service. Itwould not infringe the principle that not more than 20 per cent, of thecost of this Service should be financed by contributions and charges ;and, if it was apportioned between employer and employee in the ratio of 2d. and 6d., the payment required of the latter would still bemarginally less than 10s. Od. It was now politically essential to achieve some identifiable economy in the social services, and of all thepossible courses which the Cabinet had discussed an increase in theNational Health Service contribution was the least open to objection.The Minister of Labour said that, after discussing with- his advisers the incidence of unemployment to be assumed in 1958-59,he had reached the conclusion that a figure of 350,000 could properly be adopted. This hypothesis, which provided for a small increase of25,000 in unemployment in the forthcoming year, would reduce theemerging deficit on the National Insurance Fund to  16 millions.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance said that anincrease of 25,000 unemployed persons in an insured population ofsome 23 millions was so marginal that he would feel justified in assuming that the deficit on the National Insurance Fund in 1958-59would not exceed  14 millions. This figure had been quoted in recentParliamentary debates and it would be impolitic to modify it in theabsence of any significant alteration in the economic factors by reference to which the change could be publicly justified.In discussion it was suggested that, although it would be unwise to imply that the Governmenfs economic policies were liable toproduce a substantial degree of unemployment, it would be no lessundesirable to indicate that these policies were likely to have no effect in reducing the pressure on the labour market. Nor should it beassumed that, if an industrial recession developed in the United States,the level of employment in this country would remain unaffected. Ona balance of these considerations, the higher figure of  16 millionsmight be the more appropriate measure of the probable deficit on theNational Insurance Fund; but the question should be further considered by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in consultation withthe Minister of Labour and the Minister of Pensions.In further discussion there was general agreement that anincrease in the National Health Service contribution, of the orderproposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was probablyunavoidable if the Government were to demonstrate beyond questiontheir ability to limit the increase in their expenditure in 1958-59 to asum appreciably less than  50 millions. The increase in this contribution was admittedly open to considerable objection. It wouldbe ill-received by public opinion, which would regard it as little morethan the equivalent of a regressive poll-tax ; and its announcement, atthe moment when the latest increase in the National insurance contribution would be first coming into effect, would be unfortunatelytimed. Nevertheless, there was no longer any possibility thatre-examination of Departmental Estimates would secure the requiredeconomies ; and, in these circumstances, the proposed increase in theNational Health Service contribution must be accepted. Itsopportionment as between employer and employee would, however,need further consideration, together with the proposal that the deficit on the National Insurance Fund might be financed by the realisation of part of the invested balances of the Fund.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that the element in the National insurance contribution which was attributable to the national health Service should be increased by Sd. with effect from 1st July, 1958.(2) Agreed that this increase should be announced immediately before the publication of the Vote on Account.
Arts Council. 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (58) 14) about the grant to the arts council for 1958-59.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Exchequer grant to the Arts Council had risen rapidly in recent years until it now stood at a level of  985,000. The Council had indicated that, while theactivities which they at present supported could continue on a grant of 1,100,000 in 1958-59, any lesser grant would probably compel themto bring to an end their support of Sadler&apos;s Wells and of a number ofsymphony orchestras. In that event Sadler&apos;s Wells would probably have to be closed and the orchestras disbanded. Nevertheless, therewas no case in existing circumstances for conceding the Council agrant of more than  1 million; and a decision to this effect wouldprovide striking evidence of the Governments determination toenforce all possible economies in public expenditure. The GulbenkianFoundation might, however, be disposed to supplement an exchequer grant of  1 million, at least during the interval until they received thereport of the enquiry which they had recently instituted into the whole problem of the financial support of the arts in this country.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The closure of Sadler&apos;s Wells would remove one of the outstanding attractions which this country had to offer to foreigntourists. It would also be criticised by public opinion, which would tend to regard the administration of Covent Garden as offering more appropriate scope for economy.(b) A saving of some  200,000 to  250,000 might be achieved bythe abandonment of the scheme, to which the Government were notpledged, for the preservation of the Collcutt Tower as part of theCommonwealth Institute Building.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Exchequer grant to the Arts Council for1958-59 should not exceed  1 million.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to seek to arrangefor this sum to be supplemented by a grant from theGulbenkian Foundation on such a scale as would avoid,if possible, the closure of Sadler&apos;s Wells.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to report further, ata subsequent meeting, on the possibility of securing asubstantial economy in respect of the Collcutt Tower.52960-10(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give furtherconsideration, in consultation with the ministers concerned, to the apportionment of this increase betweenemployer and employee.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to submit to theCabinet in due course his detailed proposals for bringingthis increase into operation.(5) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Labour and the Minister of Pensions and national Insurance, to give further consideration to the incidence of unemployment in 1958-59 to be assumed forthe purpose of calculating the deficit on the national insurance Fund in that year.(6) Agreed to resume, at a later &quot;meeting, their consideration ofthe proposal that the deficit on the National insurance fund in 1958-59 might be financed by realising part of theinvested balances of the Fund.
Soviet Union. 4.   j/he Cabinet had before them memoranda by the ForeignLetters to Secretary (C. (58) 9 and 13) dealing respectively with relations withHeads of the Soviet Union and the reply to Mr. Bulganin&apos;s letter of 9th January,Government.     1958.(Previous The Foreign Secretary said that in a recent message the PrimeReference:       Minister had suggested that, in this further reply to Mr. Bulganin, heC.C. (58) 5th   should offer to visit Moscow himself to discuss with the Soviet leadersConclusions,    the timing and agenda for a meeting of Heads of Government. WhileMinute 8.)      there was a clear need for some imaginative new initiative to break the present deadlock on the question of further negotiations with theSoviet Union, a proposal on these lines would be likely to provokeanxiety and suspicion among our Allies and to be interpreted in thiscountry as indicating a weakening in the attitude hitherto adopted bythe Government. After consultation with the Home Secretary, he hadconveyed to the Prime Minister these objections to his proposal andhad suggested that the further reply to Mr. Bulganin should concentrate on the topics which we should be prepared to discussat a meeting of Heads of Government and on the preparatoryarrangements which would be needed to ensure that the meetingproduced positive results.In discussion the Cabinet endorsed the view that it would be inadvisable for the Prime Minister to propose a personal visit to moscow. There might be less objection to a visit by some other minister in order to assess whether the Soviet leaders genuinelydesired to enter into negotiations or were merely proposing a further meeting of Heads of Government for purposes of propaganda.The Cabinet next considered the terms of the draft reply toMr. Bulganin.The Foreign Secretary explained that the items for discussion hadbeen set out in considerable detail with a view to convincing publicopinion, particularly in the uncommitted countries, that we hadreasonable counter-proposals to those put forward by the soviet leaders. The subjects which we had in mind would, however, have tobe agreed with our Allies, many of whom were doubtful about theadvantages of further discussions with the Soviet Union. It wouldprobably help us to obtain their agreement to the procedural proposals in the later part of the draft reply if the suggested topics for discussion were described in reasonable detail.In discussion it was suggested that the general tone of the reply should be rather less contentious than in the draft annexed toC. (58) 13, since the main objective was to alleviate the present sense of frustration about the possibility of an improvement in the relationsbetween the Soviet Union and the Western Powers. To this end itwould be preferable to give greater emphasis to our genuine desire toenter into negotiations v/ith the Soviet Union and to abbreviate the reply without sacrificing the substance of the present draft. Forexample, under certain headings it would be possible merely to refer to previous statements of our views on a particular question withoutrepeating them in detail. It might also be desirable to prepare a shorter and less ambitious list of topics for an initial meeting, on theunderstanding that there would be further discussions if this initialmeeting was successful. We should accept the Soviet suggestion aboutthe location of a meeting and we should seek to reach agreement onthe timing. In our reply we should suggest that the meeting shouldbe held &quot; in the mid-year.&quot; If agreement could be reached on theplace and date for a meeting, the Western Powers would be in aposition to place on the Soviet leaders the onus for any delay if they refused to agree to reasonable preparatory arrangements.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) It might be preferable to alter the present order of the draft reply by inserting paragraphs 12-15 immediately after the two openingparagraphs.   We should thus avoid the implication in the existing
Cyprus. * 5.   The Foreign Secretary said that during his forthcoming visit(Previous to Ankara for the meeting of the Council of the Bagdad Pact he would reference: discuss with the Turkish Government their objections to our latestC.C. (58) 5th proposals for constitutional development in Cyprus and would exploreConclusions, further the possibilities of devising some form of federal institutionsMinute 6.) for the Island and of arranging for Turkey to enjoy a military basethere. He would also propose to indicate that, while we intended to draft that Soviet acceptance of the proposed list of topics fordiscussion was a prerequisite to the holding of a meeting, while making it clear that the meeting should discuss not only the items which the Soviet leaders had suggested but also the points of interestto the West.(b) In paragraph 4 (a) it would be preferable to omit the existingreference to &quot; a joint effort to prevent the use of outer space formilitary purposes,&quot; since we had only offered, in the Westerndisarmament proposals, to set up a committee of experts to study this problem. Any control of outer space could only be contemplated aspart of a comprehensive disarmament agreement since, pending suchan agreement, the use of ballistic missiles would be essential to themaintenance of an effective deterrent.(c) It would be desirable to refer specifically to the Middle Eastas one of the suggested topics for discussion.(d) The reference to the question of trade with the Soviet Unionmight need to be expanded, and further consideration should be givento this problem.The Home Secretary said that the draft reply, amended in thelight of the discussion, would be submitted to the Prime Minister.Members of the Cabinet might welcome an opportunity to reconsider the revised text in the light of the Prime Ministers comments.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to prepare a revised draft replyto Mr. Bulganin in the light of their discussion and toarrange for it to be submitted to the Prime Minister.(2) Took note that the Home Secretary would arrange for the revised draft to be circulated when the Prime Minister^comments had been received.(3) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to circulate amemoradum on trade with the Soviet Union.Soviet Pro- The Foreign Secretary referred to a recent Soviet announcementposals for the about the establishment of an area in the Middle East in which nuclearMiddle East, weapons would be banned. He suggested that Her Majesty&apos;ambassador at Moscow should be authorised to enquire whether this announcement constituted a formal proposal by the SovietGovernment; whether there would be a corresponding zone in thesouthern part of the Soviet Union; and whether the proposalcomprised adequate arrangements to ensure that its provisions wouldbe implemented. Our Allies in the North Atlantic treaty organisation could not reasonably object to an initial enquiry on theselines.The Cabinet (4) Approved the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal.
honour our undertaking about the right of the Turkish cypriot community to determine its future status and were prepared, ifnecessary, to embody this undertaking in a formal treaty, wemaintained our view that the partition of the Island was a solution which we were prepared to consider only in the last resort. He would seek to enlist the co-operation of the United States Secretary of State,who would also be in Ankara for the Bagdad Pact meeting and had indicated that he supported our proposals. If, however, the TurkishGovernment remained obdurate, it would be necessary for him,-before he left Ankara, to seek guidance from the Cabinet, as a matterof urgency, on the tactics to be adopted.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.The following points were made:  (a) The Turkish Government had objected to the Governor of cyprus visiting Ankara for discussions if he also intended to visitAthens. Nevertheless, it would be desirable for the Governor to take part in the discussions at Ankara and the Foreign Secretary shouldmake renewed efforts to this end.(b) The discussions should be so conducted as not to exclude thepossibility of partitioning the Island, if necessary, at an earlier pointthan was envisaged, as a hypothesis, in our latest proposals. Ifterrorism broke out again in Cyprus, we could not afford indefinitelyto devote military resources to its repression.(c) The Turkish economy depended to a considerable extent onthe provision of United States aid. The United States Secretary ofState should therefore be able to exercise a proportionately greaterinfluence on the Turkish attitude towards our proposals.(d) The Canadian Government should be informed, at theappropriate time, of developments in the situation; and the PrimeMinister would no doubt inform the Australian and New zealand governments of the position during the course of his visit to thesetwo countries.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to be guided, in his forthcoming discussions with the Turkish Government about Cyprus,by the considerations which had emerged during their discussion.(2) Agreed to resume their consideration of constitutional developments in Cyprus at a future meeting in the light ofthe results of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s discussions inAnkara.Bagdad Pact. 6.   The Foreign Secretary said that a meeting of the Council ofthe Bagdad Pact was to be held in Ankara from 27th-30th January.The United States Government would offer a contribution of$10 millions towards expenditure arising in connection with the Pact.There was no need for the United Kingdom to make any further funds available at the present time, especially since the assistance which wehad already offered had not yet been fully committed. The questionof a further United Kingdom contribution could be examined in due course.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Foreign Secretary&apos;sstatement.
british transport commission.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 67thConclusions,Minute 3.)* 7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Transport (C. (58) 15) about a request by the transport and General Workers&apos; Union that the Minister of Labour should setup a committee of enquiry into the current London bus dispute.The Minister of Transport said that, following a statement bythe London Transport Executive (L.T.E.) that they could not afford to make any offer in response to the claim by their bus crews for a wage increase of 25,s. Od. a week, the union had refused to acceptarbitration and had requested that a committee of enquiry should beestablished. A rejection of this request would be contrary toprecedent and would be liable to precipitate a strike of bus workers,which might well extend to dockers and railway workers. If,however, it was decided to constitute the committee, two courses were open. The L.T.E. might state, at the outset, that in no circumstances could they afford to implement any increases which might be recommended: but it would probably be necessary for theGovernment to issue a direction to them in this sense. Alternatively,they could make it clear in their evidence that they had not asked forthe committee to be set up, that they could not undertake to be bound in advance by its findings, and that they could not afford tomake any offer of an increase in wages. It would be understood, inany event, that the L.T.E. would consult the Government before reaching a decision on the findings of the committee. If the committee recommended only a modest increase in wages, the Government might need to issue a public direction to the Executive not to implement it.In discussion it was suggested that it would be difficult to refuse the request of the union, particularly as it had been made v/ith theconcurrence of the L.T.E. and it was generally assumed that, in thesecircumstances, the Minister of Labour would agree to establish thecommittee. Public confidence in the Governments adherence to theirdisinflationary policy was not likely to be shaken, provided that it wasmade clear that neither the Government nor the L.T.E. were committed to accept the committee&apos;s findings, which would, in anycase, be addressed to the parties to the dispute and not to theGovernment. Moreover, the committee might prove unable to reachunanimous conclusions or might decide to make no preciserecommendations. Alternatively, their recommendations might be either so inflated as to be capable of being rejected outright by theL.T.E. or so low as to be refused by the union. In any of theseeventualities the Governments position would be strengthened ratherthan weakened, whereas a refusal to establish the proposed committeewould be liable to provoke widespread industrial unrest, directed not against the employers but specifically against the Government forfailing to follow the accepted pattern of negotiation. If industrialagitation of this nature had to be settled in the end by the appointmentof a committee, the Governments authority would be undermined.On the other hand it was argued that a decision by theGovernment to set up the committee would be widely interpreted,both in this country and abroad, as a sign of retreat from thedisinflationary policy. This was the first major wage claim of thepresent series and, particularly since it concerned a nationalised industry, would be regarded as a test of the governments determination to secure wage restraint. If the proposed committee recommended only a modest increase in wages, the Government might find difficulty in directing the L.T.E. not to implement thisrecommendation, since it would represent the considered opinion ofan independent body set up by the Government themselves. The busworkers&apos; claim was unlikely to command the support of publicopinion generally: and it might therefore be wiser to refuse toestablish the committee on the ground that such an enquiry could
serve no useful purpose in the light of the Transport Executive^repeated statement that they could not afford to concede any increasein wages. As an alternative, the parties might be invited to establishtheir own committee or to submit the issue to arbitration. While both these courses were open to objection the first because it might notbe practicable, the second because it might result in a higher award they had the advantage that the Government would avoid becomingdirectly involved in the dispute.The Home Secretary, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment^ attitude towards the bus workers&apos; claim might exercise a decisive influence on the success of the policy of wage restraint. TheCabinet would therefore need to give further consideration to the issues involved.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.8. The Foreign Secretary said that the Central Office ofInformation had sponsored the production of a film of the recentUnited Kingdom thermo-nuclear tests in the South Pacific. It wouldbe inopportune, however, to release this film for public exhibition atthe present time in the light of the public expectation that the projected discussions with the Soviet leaders might result in genuineprogress towards disarmament.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of this statement.The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet that an announcement would be made on 24th January of the recent achievement of acontrolled thermo-nuclear reaction at the Atomic Energy research establishment. It was desirable that Ministers, in any public reference to this announcement, should describe it in terms which,while in no way diminishing the significance of this further advance by the United Kingdom in the development of nuclear energy, wouldnot excite premature expectations of its commercial application orimply that we had necessarily established a decisive advantage overother countries with whom we sought to co-operate in nuclearresearch.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to circulate a memorandum indicating the terms in which ministers might appropriately refer in public to the achievement ofa controlled thermo-nuclear reaction by the atomic energy Research Establishment.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,22nd January, 1958.atomic energy.Nuclear Tests.(previous reference:C.C.
