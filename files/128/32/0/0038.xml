aircraft industry.(previous reference:CC. (57) 60thConclusions,Minute 5.)53440-4CC. 38 (58)1. The Cabinet had &quot;before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (58) 94) covering.:  (i) the first report by the working party of officials which hadbeen set up to examine the future of the aircraft industry in the UnitedKingdom;(ii.) the draft of a statement, to be made by the Minister of supply in Parliament, announcing the action to be taken on the main -conclusions of this report.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the report had beenconsidered by the Economic Policy Committee who had agreed that,from the point of view of both defence and economic policy, theaircraft industry was sufficiently important to justify the continuation of Government support at a higher level than was accorded to most other industries. In the past the British industry, like the aircraft industries of all other countries, had relied mainly on financial support from the Government in order to give effect to its research anddevelopment programmes, and we should have to continue thissupport if we wished to retain an aircraft industry and to expand our exports of civil aircraft in an increasingly competitive world market.But although the Government would have to finance the major partof research expenditure for some years, the industry should be encouraged to assume a progressively increasing share of theresponsibility for expenditure on development if we were to avoidcharges that the Government were subsidising exports of aircraft.The industry should also be pressed, in return for continuing financial support from the Government, to reorganise itself on a more efficient and economical basis in order to meet the changed conditions withwhich it was now faced.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.The following points were made:  (a) In the past, aeronautical research had made valuablecontributions to technical developments in many other industries.The Advisory Council on Scientific Policy might be invited to considerthe effect of probable future changes in the aircraft industry ,on the deployment of technical manpower and the provision of educational and research facilities generally.(b) Very large capital investment was involved in thedevelopment and production of modern transport aircraft. Thefuture financial structure of the industry would therefore need tobe carefully considered. Moreover, export orders would dependincreasingly on the methods of sale employed and the credit facilities which could be offered to prospective purchasers. The working party should be asked to give particular consideration to these two problems in their further reports.(c) It would he desirable to ensure, so far as possible, thatGovernment expenditure on the civil and defence aspects ofaeronautical research and development was accounted for separately in order that Service Estimates should not be inflated by non-military expenditure. On the other hand much of the expenditure involvedserved civil and military purposes indiscriminately; and it might notbe unreasonable that it should be charged to the Defence Budget inthe interests of anticipating criticism that the Government weresubsidising exports of civil aircraft.(d) The second and third paragraphs of the draft statement inAppendix B should be amalgamated and the latter part of the second sentence in the second paragraph should be omitted.&apos;(e) The sixth paragraph of the draft statement, dealing withdevelopment, should be amplified on the lines of paragraphs 58 and 59of the working party&apos;s report in order to indicate the governments intentions in this respect more clearly.

(58) 91) to which was annexed the report of the(Previous        Committee which he had appointed to consider the present conditionReference:       of Nos. 10, 11 and 12 Downing Street and the proposals for theirCM.

The Committee, had recommended that the threeConclusions,     houses should be so reconstructed as to preserve their external structureMinute 9.)       substantially in its present form and that, subject to the preservation of certain features of historical or architectural interest, their interior(should be replanned in order to make the most efficient use of theavailable space.   The estimated cost of this work was  400,000.   Itthe Treasury buildings in Whitehall were to be reconstructed (at an estimated cost of  750,000), that work should  be carried outconcurrently.    Meanwhile,   temporary   accommodation   for   theoccupants of Nos. 10, 11 and 12 Downing Street could be providedby adapting Admiralty House, No. 36 Whitehall and one wing ofthe Admiralty main building.The Prime Minister said that it might be inadvisable for theGovernment to accept, without allowing an opportunity for theexpression of public opinion, a report which entailed considerable expenditure for a debatable purpose. He proposed, therefore, todiscuss the report with the Leader of the Opposition with a view to obtaining his agreement to its publication. Thereafter the issue would need to be further considered; and it might be found appropriate to announce that the Government intended initially to undertake no more than the preliminary adaptation of Admiralty House and the associated accommodation, at a relatively modest cost.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the Prime Ministers statement.(/) The final paragraph of the draft statement should be amended in order to avoid provoking further questions in Parliament about theother problems affecting the aircraft industry which were still being studied.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Government should continue to providefinancial support for civil aeronautical research anddevelopment on the lines proposed by the working party of officials.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theworking party to include, in their further reports, an examination of the future financial structure of the aircraft industry with particular reference to the problems involvedin the development and production of large transport aircraft and in the promotion of exports.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Defence and the Minister of Supply, to review the arrangements for accounting for government expenditure on aeronautical research and development.(4) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with the Ministerof Supply, to arrange for the Advisory Council on scientific Policy to consider the effect of the probablefuture changes in the aircraft industry on the deployment of technical manpower and the provision of educational and research facilities in general.(5) Invited the Minister of Supply to prepare in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, for the approval of thePrime Minister, a revised statement on Government policyin relation to aeronautical research and development onthe lines indicated in their discussion.(6) Invited the Minister of Supply to agree with the Chancellorof the Exchequer the lines on which any SupplementaryQuestions in Parliament about the future scale ofGovernment support for the aircraft industry should be answered.

The Cabinet reviewed the latest developments in the railway wages dispute in the light of the strike which had now been declared by the London busmen. They were informed that discussions hadbeen resumed between the Chairman of the British transport commission and the railway unions and that the union representatives had initially indicated that they were not prepared to reach agreementwith the Commission unless they were offered an immediate wage increase.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) If the unions intended to break off negotiations and to declarea railway strike, it was desirable that, before the discussions came toan end, the Transport Commission should have made the offer whichthe Government had authorised, namely, that they would be preparedto re-examine the possibility of granting a wage increase in the autumnprovided that, the unions would co-operate with the Commission andthe Government in a combined effort to increase productivity on therailways in the interval.(b) The situation which would result from a final rejection ofthis offer by the unions would be liable to be aggravated by the factthat the wage claim put forward by the dock workers would also be rejected that day. Normally this issue would thereafter be submittedto arbitration; but it was possible that in present circumstances the dock workers might strike forthwith. The oil tanker drivers had also been recently refused a wage increase and were already enforcinga system of unofficial licensing of oil supplies in support of the busstrike. If a general transport strike appeared likely to develop, theGovernment must be prepared to act at short notice in order tomaintain the distribution of oil supplies.(c) The situation would be further aggravated by the fact thatit would be necessary to announce, about the middle of the month,that the cost-of-living index had risen, possibly by as much as two points.(d) The Opposition had tabled a motion deploring the refusal ofthe Minister of Labour, in pursuance of the economic and industrial policy of the Government, to attempt to bring about a settlement ofthe London bus dispute. It would be necessary for this motion to be debated within the next few days if the Government were not to appear to remain inactive in an increasingly critical situation. If thenegotiations between the Transport Commission and the railway unions were still proceeding when this debate took place, there wouldbe advantage in seeking to limit Parliamentary discussion, as far aspossible, to the issues arising from the London bus dispute,particularly the refusal of the Minister of Labour to intervene at therequest of only one of the parties to the dispute. It would also bedesirable, in defending the Governmenfs economic policy as a whole,to rebut any attempt by the Opposition to imply that this policy was responsible for the award of the Industrial Court. If, however, thediscussions between the Transport Commission and the railway unions had broken down before the Opposition motion was debated, the issues which would then arise would be far graver and it might bedesirable to seek to persuade the Opposition to defer a debate whichmight transform an industrial dispute into an acute political crisis.(e) For this reason the negotiations between the transport commission and the railway unions should not be allowed tc failwithout some further intervention by the Government. In the caseof the railways it would be in accordance with the normal conciliationprocedures that the Minister of Labour should intervene after an arbitration in a manner which was not open to him in the case of theLondon bus dispute; and he should be prepared, if necessary, to take an initiative for this purpose.
