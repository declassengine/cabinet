* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET52960-3 b government * The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ChancellorExpenditure     0f the Exchequer (C. (58) 2) on Government expenditure in 1958-59(Previous        together with a memorandum by the Minister of Defence (C. (58) 3)Reference:       on the Defence Estimates, 1958-59.C.C.   (57)   86thConclusions, The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the draft Estimates for minute 4) civil and defence expenditure in 1958-59 showed an increase of 153 millions over the total of original and Supplementary estimates for the current financial year. If the- Government were to sustain theposition of sterling as an international currency and to demonstratetheir determination to adhere to the disinflationary policy on whichthey had embarked, it was essential that they should subject theirown expenditure to the same discipline as they had imposed on public investment and the private sector. For this purpose public expenditure in 1958-59 must be held substantially at the same level asin 1957-58.The most recent review of civil Estimates, which had been undertaken by Ministers in response to a request by the PrimeMinister, should yield fresh economies of the order of  40 millions.Comparable savings on the Estimates of the Service Departments andthe Ministry of Supply should yield a further  12-J- millions. the elimination of provision for nuclear tests during 1958-59 would save 8^ millions ; and a further  7 millions could be saved by deleting thatelement in the proposed provision of  35 millions for improvements in Service pay and allowances which was designed not merely to restore broad parity between Service pay and comparable civilianemoluments but to improve the relative remuneration of service personnel. In addition, economies of the order of  30 millions in1958-59 might be effected in the social services, e.g., by suspending the supplementary ophthalmic service, by increasing the charge forwelfare milk to 6d. a pint, and by adding 5d. to that element in theNational Insurance contribution which was attributable to theNational Health Service.In total these measures should yield a saving of the order of 100 millions. To cover the remaining deficit of some  50 millionsit would be necessary to adopt a selection of measures from thefollowing possibilities, each of which should yield a further saving ofabout  20 millions in 1958-59 : -(i) The immediate improvement in Service remuneration mightbe confined to the marriage and out-of-quarters allowances, animprovement in basic pay being deferred until the Government hadreceived and considered the report of the Committee which had beenconstituted, under the chairmanship of Sir James Grigg, to review thewhole range of inducements to voluntary recruitment. It would inany case be inopportune that an improvement in Service pay shouldbe conceded in the near future, when it would be essential to maintainthe Governments policy in face of the new wage claims which werebeing formulated.(ii) As an alternative to the proposed changes in the group of social services, the family allowance for the second child might be abolished.(iii) If no change was made in the system of family allowances,more stringent economies might be enforced in the group of social services, e.g., by increasing the National Health Service contribution by M. instead of 5d. and completely abolishing the subsidy on welfare milk by increasing the charge to Sd. instead of 6d. a pint.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Agriculture. As  the  result  of  a  reassessment of  the assumptions on which expenditure attributable to the agriculturalprice guarantees had been calculated, a further saving of  10 millions
could probably be achieved on the Estimates of the agricultureDepartments.(b) Service Estimates. The Governments intention to improveService pay and allowances had been announced in the 1957 defence white Paper. Action to this end had already been once deferred, inthe autumn of 1957, in the light of the financial emergency which had then developed ; and the Government were now being increasinglycriticised for their failure to implement their undertaking for nearly a year. Further delay would be politically indefensible and would seriously retard the prospect of stimulating that voluntary recruitmenton which the Government relied to secure the abolition of NationalService. It would, in any case, be difficult to achieve this objective ;any further postponement of improvements in pay and allowances would render it impossible.(c) Family Allowances. The abolition of the family allowance for the second child could be argued to be preferable, both politically and administratively, to any combination of reductions in the other social services. Although it would be a drastic measure, it would constitute a single act which could be explained and justified by thefinancial circumstances and should not attract more odium than aseries of separate measures directed against individual services. Onthe other hand it was open to grave objection, it would imply thewithdrawal of more than half of the only post-war social service whicha Conservative Government could claim to have created. It wouldinvolve very controversial legislation, including further amendment ofthe National Insurance provisions which had only recently been enacted. It would constitute a reversal of the policy, which theGovernment had pursued consistently since 1951, of abolishingsubsidies wherever possible but supplementing incomes in appropriate cases. And its political impact, particularly on the five millionfamilies who would be completely deprived of family allowances,would be very damaging.(d) Supplementary Ophthalmic Service. The suspension of this service would require legislation, which would undoubtedly be controversial in view of the repeated pledges that the service would remain a permanent element in the National Health Service.Moreover, the resultant economy might not exceed more than 44- millions in 1953-59 after allowance had been made for contractualcommitments already incurred.(e) National Health Service Contribution. If the element in theNational Insurance contribution attributable to the National health service was increased, the contribution would have been raised three times within twelve months. It had been generally agreed that thelevel of 175. 6d. a week, which the basic contribution would reachwhen the latest increase came into effect in February, was themaximum which was politically tolerable until a further interval had elapsed.(/) Welfare Milk. The charge for welfare milk had been increased from \\d. to Ad. a pint as recently as 1st April, 1957, andthis increase had been defended on the ground that it would reducethe subsidy involved to the level at which it had stood on theintroduction of the service. It would not be possible to defend afurther increase, after so short a time, in the charge for a service whichwas of benefit to expectant mothers and children under five. the reaction of the general public to the increase would be highly critical;and the saving in the first year would be less than was supposed if due allowance were made for the necessary period of notice.(g) School Milk. It would be possible to secure an additionalsaving, of the order of  13 millions in a full year, if a full charge waslevied in respect of school milk, which was at present supplied free of charge. Moreover, it would be more defensible to require payment in respect of a service enjoyed by schoolchildren and adolescents thanin respect of a service operated primarily for the benefit of children under five. But the change would be strongly resisted by school-teachers, who already resented their liability to collect charges for
school meals and would strongly oppose any extension of this obligation.(h) Hospital Boarding Charge. The imposition of a hospitalboarding charge, at the rate of 55. a day, would yield some  11 millions a year. But it would involve the employment of about 1,000additional clerical staff; it had been rejected as undesirable by the guillebaud Committee ; and, while it would in any case be unpopular,it would be particularly resented by public opinion if it was combined with an increase in the National Health Service contribution.In further discussion there was general agreement on the urgency and importance of securing the maximum economy in government expenditure which was politically practicable.   The future of theUnited Kingdom, both domestically and as an international Power,would depend on the strength of sterling and the stability of the economy. But the measures to be adopted to secure these objectivesshould not be such as either to imperil our ability to pursue a foreignpolicy which would continue to command the respect of othercountries or to jeopardise the achievement of the wage stability whichmust remain for some time the cardinal objective of the governments policies.   It was debatable whether defence expenditure could befurther  reduced  without  engendering  a  lack   of  international confidence in this country as a friend and ally. It was no less arguablewhether the proposed economies in the social services could been forced without provoking social and industrial discontent on a damaging scale.   The least objectionable of these measures waspossibly the proposed increase in the National Health service contribution. But in respect of this no less than of the other proposalsit would be inexpedient to embark on major changes in social policy at short notice in order to achieve an ideal arithmetical presentation of public expenditure in a single year.   The Estimates for public expenditure could legitimately be distinguished from public invest-ment and the activities of the private sector of the economy.   Thelatter had properly been subjected to the full rigour of theGovernments disinflationary policy; but the Governments current expenditure could not be regulated with an equal exactitude.  It was determined to a large extent by factors which the Government did notcontrol, e.g., the increase in the numbers of schoolchildren and oldpersons, the decline in the world prices of agricultural commodities the fact that wage increases granted before the introduction of thedisinflationary policy in the autumn of 1957 would inevitably exert adeferred impact on the Estimates for 1958-59.   It would be impracticable and unwise to seek to compress the inescapable effects of such factors within an arbitrary level of total government expenditure. Moreover, the issues which the Government confrontedwere largely psychological.   Sterling had regained much of theground which it had lost in 1957; and the Government had therefore secured the first objective of the policy which they hadlaunched in the previous autumn.  In the second stage of this policy,which lay ahead, their primary concern must be to recreate confidence in the internal administration of the country by keeping government expenditure within reasonable limits and indicating, at the same time,the further measures for example, a graduated pensions scheme andpossibly some revision of the structure of public education by whichthey proposed to put the social services on a sound and economic basis.   The fact that such measures could not be put into effect forsome time was relatively unimportant; but a statement of theGovernments intentions in this respect would do much to enablepublic opinion, at home and abroad, to view the level of government expenditure in a proper perspective.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment were facing a grave decision at a critical point in theirterm of office.  In their first year they had been more successful in
frestoring the position of the country than they might have hoped atthe outset; and further opportunities, both of economy and ofdevelopment, were in prospect if they could surmount the difficult period ahead, during which their wages policy might be severely testedbut relations between this country and the United States might, if we remained unshaken in our purpose, become even more close andfruitful. If the Government were to overcome the dangers and to seize the opportunities which would arise in this period, they mustweigh with great care the relative advantages of, on the one hand,securing such economies in Government expenditure as wouldconvincingly demonstrate their adherence to their disinflationarypolicy and, on the other hand, avoiding any measures which might provide the occasion for a renewal of inflated wage claims and theoutbreak of industrial unrest. It was in the light of this balance of considerations that the Cabinet should seek to reach agreement on a level of Government expenditure in 1958-59 which would be bothpolitically and socially justifiable. Renewed consideration should,therefore, be given to the possibility of securing further economies in defence expenditure, whether by deferring increases in basic pay forsome period to be defined or by announcing the proposedimprovements in both pay and allowances without further delay butdeferring their introduction until later in the year. The civil estimates should similarly be examined in order to establish how further economies of the order of  30 millions might best be achieved by a combination of measures selected from those which the Cabinet had discussed. If, in the event, a total saving of the order of  100 millionsor more could be achieved, the residue of some  50 millions,representing an increase of no more than about 1 per cent, inGovernment expenditure, could perhaps be regarded as defensible initself and consistent with the Governments broad purpose ofmaintaining a firm control over the supply of purchasing power in the economy.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Ministers concerned, to examine the possibility ofsecuring further economies in Government expenditure onthe lines indicated by the Prime Minister.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,9th January, 1958.
