1.   The Cabinet had before them:  (i) a memorandum by the Minister of Pensions and national insurance (C. (58) 189), to which was annexed a revised draft of the projected White &quot;Paper on the new pensions scheme;(ii) a memorandum by the Lord Chancellor (C. (58)  191)discussing the desirabilty of publishing, through the agency of the Stationery Office, a popular version of the&apos;White Paper, prepared- by the Central Office ofInformation.The Minister of Pensions said that the draft White Paperembodied various amendments which had resulted from discussionof the text by the Ministerial Committee on Pensions. The onlyoutstanding point of substance arose on Appendix II, whichcomprised a table illustrating the future income and expenditure ofthe new scheme. This table indicated that, on the assumption thatthe first quinquennial increase in contributions took effect from 1st April, 1966, the scheme would incur, in the first three quinquennialperiods, an average annual deficit which was rather larger than wouldbe consistent with the basic hypothesis that the government&apos;s proposals had been devised in order to put the finances of national insurance on a sound foundation. These deficits could be reduced tonegligible amounts if the first quinquennial increase in contributionswas advanced by one year, i.e., to 1965. The presentationaldisadvantage of requiring the first increase of this nature at the endof four, rather than five, years from the beginning of the scheme would be reduced if the principle of quinquennial increases wasapplied also to the Exchequer supplement.In discussion there was some support for the view that it wouldbe unwise that a scheme which was explicitly designed to restore thefinancial integrity of the National Insurance system should be seen to operate at an average annual deficit for the greater part of the first two decades of its life. On the other hand, the deficit was insignificantby comparison with that which, as was made clear in the White Paper,would arise if the existing insurance scheme was continued without modification. Moreover, the calculations in Appendix II of theWhite Paper were based on the assumption that earnings would increase at a rate of only 2 per cent, per annum. In so far as this rate was exceeded, the average annual deficit under the new scheme would be reduced. The balance of political advantage thereforeseemed to lie in launching the scheme on the basis of a small measureof deficit financing in its early years rather than in rectifying this anomaly by an arbitrary acceleration of the first quinquennialincrease in contributions which would be liable to be resented bycontributors on whom the new scheme would, in any event, bearsufficiently hardly. If the initial deficits provoked public criticism,it would be possible to make the necessary adjustment in the schemebefore legislation was introduced in Parliament.A quinquennial increase in the Exchequer supplement would bean additional reinforcement during the early years of the new scheme,in that it would eliminate the residual average annual deficit whichwould remain even if the first quinquennial increase in contributionswas advanced by one year. Moreover, it would have the presen-tational advantage of preserving the principle, which had beeninherent in the National Insurance system from the beginning, thatthe finances of National Insurance rested on a tripartite partnershipof employer, employee and Exchequer, in which each party carrieda proportionate share of the burden. On the other hand, the new scheme should yield an average annual surplus in its later years evenwithout a quinquennial increase in the Exchequer supplement; andit was undesirable to inflict an additional burden on the Exchequer
Tin. 2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous Minister of State, Board of Trade (C. (58) 190), on the latestReference: developments in the world tin market.C C (58) 71stConclusions, The Minister of State, Board of Trade, said that the floor priceMinute 6.) 0f tin had broken on 18th September but that thereafter the price in order to resolve a temporary and minimal embarrassment of thescheme in the first years of its life. The scheme would benefit fromthe outset from the fact that the Exchequer supplement which itwould receive was higher than the corresponding supplement to theexisting system of National Insurance; and the Chancellor of theExchequer would see strong objection to any further increase in this commitment. The question could, however, be reconsidered beforelegislation was introduced to bring the scheme into operation.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) The statistical calculations throughout the White Paper were based on an assumption of an average level of unemployment of 3 percent. This was lower than the - figure currently assumed for thepurposes of long-term forecasts in relation to the National Insurancescheme. In order to anticipate any misinterpretation of this change,it should be made clear, at the relevant points in the text, that until1951 the rate of unemployment assumed for such forecasts had been8^ per cent., that it had been reduced in 1951 to 4 per cent, and thatit could now reasonably be reduced still further to 3 per cent.(b) Appendix II indicated that the assumptions about the levelof future unemployment and the probable extent of contracting out under the new scheme were based &quot; on Government instructions.&quot;Although this phrase might give rise to some misunderstanding, itshould be retained in the text, since the assumed rate ofunemployment represented a modification of a hypothesis for whichthe Government had always accepted responsibility, while theassumption about the degree of contracting out was inevitably, atthis stage, insufficiently precise to constitute the basis of actuarialcalculation.Discussion then turned to the advisability of publishing, throughthe agency of the Stationery Office, a popular version of the white paper, prepared by the Central Office of Information. It was agreedthat precedent, although inconclusive, indicated that the Governmentwould be liable to be challenged about the propriety of publishing,as a charge to public funds, a popular version of proposals whichwere to be the subject of legislation in the near future. Moreover,it would be tactically unwise to allow public attention to be diverted from a discussion of the merits of the new proposals by an irrelevantcontroversy on this minor issue.The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to the amendments agreed in their discussion, the draft White Paper on pensions annexed to C. (58) 189.(2) Invited the Minister of Pensions to arrange for thepublication of the White Paper, as amended, on14th October, 1958.(3) Agreed to defer for later consideration the question whether,before legislation on this subject was introduced inParliament, the date of the first quinquennial increase in contributions should be advanced by one year and theprinciple of quinquennial increases should be applied tothe Exchequer supplement.(4) Agreed that no further steps should be taken to publish,through the agency of the Stationery Office, a popularversion of the White Paper, prepared by the central office of Information.
3. The Minister of State, Board of Trade, said that, in response to a request from the Canadian Government that we would take action to counter the dumping of Russian aluminium in this country,we had informed the Soviet Government that, unless they wereprepared to limit their exports of aluminium to the United Kingdom,we should be compelled to impose an anti-dumping duty. The SovietGovernment had now agreed to accept a limit on their exports.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of this statement by the Ministerof State, Board of Trade.4. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the dispute over Quemoy and the offshore islands appeared to have reached a deadlock. Little progress had been made in the discussions in warsaw between the Ambassadors of the United States Governmentand the Peopled Government of China, although the latter seemedunwilling to break off the discussions entirely. Meanwhile, theChinese Nationalist forces were having considerable success inrunning the blockade of Quemoy, and could probably maintain their position on the island for some time ahead.The Prime Minister said that he had agreed to receive that days deputation from the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.) to discuss thesituation in the Far East. He proposed to say little more than hehad already said in his published reply to the recent letter from the leader of the Opposition, namely, that the dispute should be resolved by peaceful means rather than by force.In discussion it was agreed that a continuation of the stalemateat Quemoy might offer the best prospect of securing a period ofrelative tranquillity in the area, during which it might be possible tohad not fallen to the exent which had originally been feared.Meanwhile, the International Tin Agreement remained in being andthe import restrictions on Russian tin were being maintained. TheSoviet Trade Commissioner had recently made representations against these restrictions; but there was some reason to believe that theSoviet Government were in fact contemplating adhering to theAgreement. In accordance with the Cabinet&apos;s earlier decision, wehad invited the United States Government to consider the possibilityof negotiating a reconstruction of the Agreement which would place the scheme on a sounder basis; but it seemed unlikely that they wouldbe willing to co-operate in any venture of this kind.In discussion it was agreed that the results of the fall in the priceof tin had, so far, been less serious than had been expected. Publicopinion in Malaya and Nigeria remained unshaken; and there appeared to be no disposition in those countries to blame the UnitedKingdom for the interruption in trading. Nevertheless, we shouldcontinue to seek to enlist the interest and support of the United StatesGovernment in creating a more stable and economic basis for international dealing in tin.The Cabinet -Invited the Minister of State, Board of Trade, to arrangefor further developments in the international tin market tobe kept under close review, in concert, so far as possible,with the United States Government.
arrange for the opposing forces to disengage without loss of prestige.But since the approach by the T.U.C. was prompted primarily by political motives, any communique issued at the end of their interview with the Prime Minister should not be merely non-committal in tonebut should indicate that the Prime Minister was in close and activeconsultation with the President of the United States in an endeavourto promote a peaceful solution of the problem. Provided that astatement of this kind could avoid any implication that we favoured a negotiated withdrawal of the Chinese Nationalist and United states forces from the islands, there would be advantage in indicating thatthe Western Powers retained the political initiative and were not, asthe Socialist Opposition maintained, merely waiting passively on afurther deterioration in the situation.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation withthe Minister of Labour and the Minister of State for ForeignAffairs, would give further consideration, in the light oftheir discussion, to the terms of the communique whichmight be issued at the end of his forthcoming interview withleaders of the Trades Union Congress about the situationin the Far East.Cyprus.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 71stConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Prime Minister said that M. Spaak, the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), had proposed that the United Kingdom plan for the future of Cyprusshould be suspended pending consideration, at a conference of theGovernments of the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey, togetherv/ith representatives of the two Cypriot communities, of a modifiedversion of this plan prepared by himself and pending the submission to the International Court of Justice of a question on theinterpretation of the Treaty of Lausanne, which the GreekGovernment maintained was infringed by the United Kingdom plan.Meanwhile, it seemed likely that the Turkish Government would accept a suggestion, put forward by the United States, that, as atemporary measure, they should appoint their Consul-General atNicosia to act as the Governmental representative whom they were entitled, under our plan, to install in Cyprus on 1st October. Anarrangement of this kind would represent a welcome conciliatorygesture on the part of Turkey.In discussion it was suggested that, in view of the alarmengendered among the members of NATO by the Greek threat toleave the Organisation, it might be desirable to accept M. Spaak&apos;proposal for a further conference. There could be no question,however, of our suspending our own plan; nor should we allow public attention to be diverted from it, at this stage, in favour of othersolutions which might be put forward. While there might be noobjection to the discussion, at an international conference, of possiblemodifications in our plan, the plan itself must be accepted as constituting the agenda of the conference.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theColonial Secretary and the Minister of State for ForeignAffairs, would give further consideration to the reply tobe sent to the proposal by the Secretary-General of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation for an international conference on Cyprus.(2) Invited the Attorney-General, in consultation with theMinister of State for Foreign Affairs, to submit an opinion on the interpretation of the Treaty of Lausannein relation to the United Kingdom plan for Cyprus.
Middle East.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 67thConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The Minister of Stale for Foreign Affairs informed theCabinet that the new President of the Lebanon, General Chehab,had appointed the Leader of the former Opposition Party to bePrime Minister. As a result the Lebanese Government were likelyto send an early request to the United States Government to withdraw their forces from the Lebanon.The report of the Secretary-General of the United Nations onhis recent visits to the Lebanon and Jordan was to be presented to the General Assembly on 30th September. Meanwhile, theSecretary-General was pressing the Egyptian Government to complywith the Assembly&apos;s resolution of 21st August, which was directed to preventing interference by the Arab nations in each other&apos;s affairs.If the Egyptian response was satisfactory, it might become possible,and desirable, to consider the withdrawal of our forces from Jordan.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of State forForeign Affairs.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,25th September, 1958.
