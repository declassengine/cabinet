defence organisation.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 53rdConclusions,Minute 1.)53860-10-1. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposal topresent a White Paper on the Central Organisation for Defence. Inaddition to the draft of the proposed White Paper (C. (58) 142), they also had before them a note by the Prime Minister (C. (58) .147)covering amendments designed to meet some of the points which hadbeen raised in their discussion on the previous day.The Cabinet first considered whether it was necessary for theGovernment to make an announcement on defence organisationbefore Parliament rose for the summer recess; and, if so, whether thisshould take the form of a White Paper or of an oral statement in theHouse of Commons.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that an early announcement should be made. There waswidespread public speculation about the nature of the changes underdiscussion, and persistent rumours of differences of view between ministers on this subject. If no statement were made, the inferencewould be drawn that it had not been possible to resolve these differences, and the political authority of the Government would be weakened.On the form of the announcement, some doubts were expressed about the expediency of publishing a White Paper. This formalmethod of announcement might give the impression that the changes proposed were of greater substance than in fact they were. It wasboth difficult and unusual to define, in a formal written statement, therelations of Ministers inter se. And there were well-foundedobjections, both constitutional and practical, to disclosing the innerworkings of the central government machine and, in particular, the composition and functions of the standing committees of the Cabinet.On the other side it was argued that, in relation to defence organisation, there were precedents for departing from the normalconvention that details of the Cabinet committee structure should notbe disclosed. The central organisation for defence was a subject ofspecial interest to Parliament and the public; it was already thesubject of public discussion; and it would be difficult to guide that discussion along the correct lines if the proposed changes of organisation had not been explained in some detail. A detaileddescription of the earlier organisation, including the composition ofthe Defence Committee, had been published in the White Paper whichthe Labour Government had presented to Parliament in 1946. Finally,if an oral announcement were made, further information would besought on many of the details, including the relations between theMinisters concerned; and on such points as these, where a delicatebalance was involved, it would be dangerous to improvise oralanswers in reply to supplementary questions. On a matter of this kindit was wiser to publish a written statement which could serve, ifnecessary, as the basis for a subsequent debate. The Cabinetconcluded that the balance of advantage lay on the side of announcing the proposed changes of organisation by the presentation of a white paper.Discussion then turned to the text of the proposed White Paper(C. (58) 142) and the amendments which the Prime Minister had prepared (C. (58) 147) to meet criticisms put forward at the previous meeting. In this part of the discussion the following points weremade:  (a) There was general support for the proposal to include anintroductory passage on the lines suggested by the Prime Minister.This would help to put the proposals in their proper perspective.(b) The Cabinet accepted the substance of the Prime Minister^proposal for constituting the Defence Committee on a more flexiblebasis, so as to allow the various types of problem which came before it to be considered by the Ministers most directly concerned with
them. Some Ministers continued, however, to feel doubt about the expediency of publishing an actual list of members of the Committee.It was true that the Committee&apos;s membership, under the earlier formof organisation, had been indicated in the White Paper of 1946. Butthat disclosure had given rise to some practical difficulties, and therewere strong arguments in favour of preserving the convention that the membership of standing committees of the Cabinet should not be publicly disclosed. On the other hand, in view of the course which public discussion of this subject had already taken, it would benecessary to make it plain that the Service Ministers and the Ministerof Supply would be invited to meetings of the Defence Committee atwhich subjects directly affecting their Ministerial responsibilities wereto be discussed. It was finally agreed that, on balance, the best meansof making this plain would be to publish a list of the members of theCommittee, as proposed in the revised text which the Prime minister had circulated with C. (58) 147.(c) Some discussion followed on the related question whether itwas enough to say that the Prime Minister would determine which members should attend particular meetings of the Committee&quot; according to the subjects to be discussed and the Ministerialresponsibilities involved.&quot; Some Minister thought it preferable thatthis sentence should be phrased in terms of Ministerial responsibilities to Parliament. Others thought that the more general phrase&quot; Ministerial responsibilities &quot; was to be preferred, especially as theService Ministers attached particular importance to their responsi-bility for, and to, the Services of which they were in charge. It was finally agreed that this phrase should read &quot; according to the subjects to be discussed and with full regard to the Ministerial responsibilitiesinvolved.&quot;(d) The Prime Minister said that he hoped that no misunder-standing would arise from the statement that papers and minutes of meetings of the Defence Committee would be circulated to all members of the Committee. This would, of course, be subject to thenormal practice by which discussions of specially secret subjects wererecorded in Confidential Annexes, which were made available only tothose who had special reason to be informed of their contents.(e) The Cabinet were informed that the Minister of Defence was willing to accept the omission of paragraph 9, which stated that whenthe Service Ministers or the Minister of Supply wished to make proposals on any matter affecting defence policy (as defined inparagraph 5) they would normally submit them to the Ministerof Defence. It was however the general view of the Cabinet that, inits revised form, this paragraph was no longer open to the objections raised to it at the previous meeting, and it was agreed that it should beretained.(/) On paragraph 10 the Colonial Secretary drew attention to thedanger of attempting to define the circumstances in which a departmental Minister should seek the Prime Ministers approvalbefore making an appointment. He himself was responsible forsubmitting to the Crown recommendations for the appointment of colonial Governors: on some occasions he would consult the PrimeMinister before submitting his recommendations: but it was whollywithin his discretion to decide on which occasions such consultationwas advisable. The Prime Minister said that the inclusion of thisparagraph in the White Paper would not have the effect of castingdoubt on the practice which the Colonial Secretary now followed inthis matter.(g) There was general agreement that the revised version of paragraphs 17-19 would meet the criticisms expressed at the previous meeting. In particular, it would remove any grounds for suspectingthat the Chief of the Defence Staff might seek advice from members ofthe military staffs of the Services, without the knowledge of the Chiefof Staff concerned, and might thereby undermine the authority of a chief of Staff over the staff under his command.
Pensions.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 52ndConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (58) 145) discussing the implications of the compromisepension scheme which had been proposed by the Minister of Pensions.This scheme adopted the August Plan as tne basis of the new policy but permitted contracting out in favour of approved occupational schemes. The members of such of these schemes as were contracted out would not thereafter pay graduated contributions or receivegraduated benefits but would remain, irrespective of the level of their earnings, bound to contribute, and entitled to benefit, under theexisting flat-rate scheme. Contributions both under the graduated scheme and under the fiat-rate scheme would be increased at quinquennial intervals.The Prime Minister invited the Cabinet to consider the com-promise scheme in terms of its financial, administrative and political implications.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he remained of theopinion that the August Plan would constitute, from every point ofview, the wisest policy for the Government to adopt. The statistics inAppendix I to C. (58) 145 indicated that the compromise schemecompared not unfavourably with the August Plan in terms of the relief which it would afford to the Exchequer. But those statistics might not sufficiently reflect the fact that, since the contribution under the graduated scheme increased in proportion to the increase in theincome of the contributor, the option to contract out would alwaystend to be exercised to the disadvantage of the Exchequer. Moreover,they were confined to the quinquennial points at which thecontributions would be increased and therefore presented the schemeC.C. 54 (58)(h) The Cabinet confirmed their earlier agreement thatparagraphs 20 and 21, though their substance was approved, need notbe included in the published description of the new organisation.(/) The draft White Paper, having originally been framed as a directive, was cast mainly in the future tense. As a result, there were some passages which gave the impression that innovations were about to be made although in fact they merely recorded existing practice.In the revision of the draft the wording should be adjusted so as toavoid creating this impression.The Prime Minister, at the end of the discussion, said that he was glad that the Cabinet had been able to reach agreed decisions on thisquestion. This was a difficult organisation to frame and to operate,for it must hold a delicate balance between important interests and responsibilities. It also had a difficult task to perform; for it had to plan Forces which would make an adequate contribution towards theultimate objective of preventing major war and would, at the sametime, be suitable for the lesser military operations in which we mighthave to engage and it had to do this within the limitations imposed by the state of our national economy. This called for a full measureof co-operation between all the Ministers concerned.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for thepreparation of a revised text of the draft White Paper onthe Central Organisation for Defence (C. (58) 142) taking account of the amendments which he had circulated(C. (58) 147) and of the points raised in their discussion.(2) Authorised the Prime Minister to arrange for the white paper, as so revised, to be presented to Parliament on15th July.
in the most favourable light. In the intervals between the quinquennialincreases in contribution the compromise scheme would incur a deficit,whereas the August Plan would remain solvent over any period whichmight be selected for illustration. The finances of the compromisescheme could admittedly be improved if the point at which graduationbegan was raised from an income level of  8 a week to one of  9 aweek. But the implications of this modification would need furtherconsideration and some alternative means of improving the financialbalance of the scheme might be found to be preferable.From the point of view of presentation the August Plan had theadvantage of being based on a single straightforward conception: the compromise scheme was, in effect, a combination of the August and september Plans. The inclusion of a provision for contracting out wasa further objection to the new scheme. The principle of contracting out was unlikely to be welcomed by the Governments supporters,particularly when it was realised that, since it would necessarily be operated on a collective basis, it could be represented as overriding theright of the individual to freedom of choice in this matter. Neverthe-less, the extent of contracting out was likely to be less under the compromise plan than under the September Plan and its administra-tive implications, though still formidable, should be simpler.Moreover, the compromise scheme would simplify the problem of self-employed persons, who could be automatically contracted out of the graduated scheme and allowed to supplement as they saw fit thebenefits which they would continue to draw under the existing flat-ratescheme. On a balance of considerations, therefore, the compromisescheme merited serious consideration.The Minister of Pensions, while admitting the problem inherent in the collective nature of contracting out, emphasised that the only alternative to a provision for contracting out would be a provision forthe abatement of occupational schemes and that, as was illustrated by statutory precedent, abatement would itself need to rest on theinitiative of the employer and could not be effected without infringingthe right of employees to exercise a completely free choice. Indeed,from the presentational point of view, abatement would appear even less attractive than contracting out. Moreover, it would be reasonable to stipulate, under the compromise scheme, that an employer, beforecontracting out an occupational scheme, should ascertain the wishes of his employees, possibly by means of a vote.The problem would be at its most acute in the case where an employer, by contracting out, might be represented as virtuallycompelling his employees, up to an income level of about  11a week,to pay a higher contribution than they would be required to pay ifthey remained members of the State graduated scheme. On the otherhand, it was unlikely that employers would deliberately inviteindustrial discontent by seeking to enforce contracting out against the declared wish of the majority of their employees; while the latter, whowould ex hypothesi be members of an occupational scheme fromwhich they might expect ultimately to derive substantial benefit, would realise that they would enjoy the protection of the criterion ofequivalence which would be a condition of permission to contract, out and that the application of contracting out would in any event leave them liable to pay no heavier a contribution than was already required of them. The scope of the problem might be even further reduced ifthe point at which graduation began was raised to an income level of 9 a week or if an arrangement was introduced, by analogy with aprovision in the existing scheme designed to protect the lowest paid workers, whereby the employer would be required, as.a condition of receiving permission to contract out, to pay a rather higher proportionof the flat-rate contribution than at present.Apart from this issue, the compromise plan had clear advantagesover the August Plan. It preserved the principle of contracting out,and it gave effect to  that principle  with  less  administrative
CC. 54 (58)complication than would have been entailed by the September Plan.It solved the problem of self-employed persons. It simplified the task of preserving the benefit rights of individuals, since it made the assessment of those rights a relatively straightforward matter. And,although it might be thought to provide the higher paid worker witha marginal incentive to contract out to the disadvantage of theExchequer, this risk was not so great as to prevent the scheme from being presented as financially sound.In discussion there was general agreement that the compromisescheme had considerable advantages. The limited degree of contracting out which it should involve would be preferable to the abatement entailed by the August Plan and would simplify theproblem of providing appropriate treatment for members of established occupational schemes, e.g., the teaching profession. At thesame time it was politically desirable that the Government shouldpreserve the principle of contracting out since, by abandoning it, theywould offer the Labour Party an opportunity to delete it from theirown plan without risk of criticism and, by resting merely on a graduated scheme, they would enable a future Government to increasethe level of the contributions to a point at which occupational schemes would be virtually destroyed. The only alternative to the compromisescheme appeared to be an abbreviated form of the August Plan,stopping short of the income level of  15 a week to which that Planextended. But such an arrangement would provide inadequate relief to the Exchequer. By contrast, the compromise scheme should be both financially sound and administratively practicable; and it would secure justice to the individual in terms of the preservation of his rightto benefit.In principle, therefore, the compromise scheme should be adopted.But there was some risk that, when public opinion realised its implications for the lower paid employee whose employer proposed to contract out, pressure would develop for the plan to be amended inorder to provide that in such a case the employee should be permitted to pay a graduated, rather than a flat-rate, contribution. Since a combination of graduation and contracting out had already beenfound unacceptable in the context of the August Plan, it was important that the position of the lower paid employee under the compromisescheme should be further considered; and it might be wise from thispoint of view to publish the scheme as a White Paper, for publiccomment and discussion, before the Government were too faxcommitted to the precise detail of the necessary legislation. Such a white Paper would have the further advantage of demonstrating thatthe Government were concerned primarily to establish the national insurance system on a sound and secure financial basis rather than to court popularity by the promise of lavish and improvident benefits.The date of its publication would need further consideration; but the drafting of the essential features of the legislation should be put inhand as soon as outstanding points of detail had been settled.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the compromise pension scheme outlined in C. (58) 145.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the ministerial committee on Pensions to examine, as a matter of urgency, the detailed issues which remained to be resolvedand to ensure that instructions v/ere issued to the draftsman as rapidly as possible for the preparation of aBill to give effect to this plan.
(3) Invited the Minister of Pensions to circulate, before the recess,the outline of a White Paper discussing the scheme andillustrating its implications for the general public in clear and simple terms.Cabinet Office, S.W. I,11th July, 1958.
