(58) 77thConclusions,Minute 8.)Germany.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 81stConclusions,Minute 2 andC.C. (58) 84thConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that, during his recent visit to Paris to attend the Ministerial Council of theNorth Atlantic Alliance, he had had a frank and cordial discussionwith the French Prime Minister, General de Gaulle, with particular reference to our project for the&apos; creation of a European Free trade area. He had emphasised that commercial discrimination by the six Powers against the rest of Europe would be liable to convert theEuropean Economic Community into an exclusive political blocregulated by supra-national institutions of the kind which General,de Gaulle himself rejected. The General had appeared to be impressed by this consideration; and, although he was mainly concerned to promote his own project for the creation of a tripartitedirectorate of the United States, the United Kingdom and France,he might be expected henceforward to show greater awareness of thepolitical implications of the Treaty of Rome.The Cabinet were informed that the Shell Oil Company had now reached agreement in principle with the Egyptian Government onthe satisfaction of their claim for compensation, subject to a financial settlement being reached between the British and EgyptianGovernments. Mr. Black, the President of the International bank for Reconstruction and Development, had now indicated that, in an endeavour,to expedite this settlement, he would be prepared to advance the date of his informal negotiations with the egyptian government to 31st December. Meanwhile, the Egyptian authorities had proposed that we should allow them to draw on their blockedsterling funds to finance an initial deposit on an order for british aircraft and to enable them to discharge the sum of  3-3 millionsdue to be paid on 1st January, 1959, as compensation to the suez canal Company.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Some 40 per cent, of the payment to the Suez Canal company would accrue to the benefit of shareholders in the United Kingdom,including Her Majesty&apos;s Government. If Mr. Black considered thathis negotiations would be facilitated by our agreement to allow thispayment to be charged to the blocked Egyptian balances, the point could probably be conceded.(b) The release of blocked sterling, in advance of a general financial settlement, to enable the Egyptians to pay a deposit on anorder for British aircraft was open to more serious objection. Itwould be liable to be regarded as giving one industry preferential treatment as regards the gradual re-establishment of commercial relations with Egypt and as giving priority to industrial interests overthe claims of the British refugees from Egypt. It would be preferable that, until a financial settlement had been agreed, the egyptian authorities should be required to charge to their free resources any payments other than the payment to the Suez Canal Company.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary, to endeavour to arrange for Mr. Black, thePresident of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Develop-ment, to enter into informal negotiations a.t an early date with theview to reaching an Anglo-Egyptian financial settlement subject tothe points made in their discussion.The Foreign Secretary said that there had been unanimous agreement at the recent meeting of the Ministerial Council of theNorth Atlantic Alliance on the attitude which the Governments ofthe United States, the United Kingdom, France and Western germany should adopt towards the question of the future status of Berlin. Adraft reply to the latest communication from the Soviet Governmenton&quot;this issue should now be submitted to the Permanent Council of nato as rapidly as possible.   There would be advantages in
Cyprus.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 86thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that recently there appeared tohave been a certain improvement in relations between the greek and Turkish Governments. During the meeting of the ministerial council of the North Atlantic Alliance he had been asked by theForeign Ministers of these two countries whether the United KingdomGovernment would see advantage in their pursuing the possibility ofa new settlement in Cyprus whereby both the local communities wouldenjoy a measure of autonomy and the Island itself would become independent, apart from certain areas which would remain underexclusive British sovereignty. These arrangements would be guaranteed by treaty between the parties concerned.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Past experience illustrated the risks inherent in seeking tomaintain a strategic hold on limited areas in a country which wasotherwise not under our own control. In the present case, however,the interests of the Turkish Government would largely coincide withour own; and, if Turkey guaranteed our strategic facilities in Cyprusby treaty, we should be able to maintain our position. Moreover, weshould be relieved of the liability of military occupation of the wholeIsland : and, provided that we were assured of all the facilities whichwe should require for the efficient maintenance of our bases, anarrangement on these lines would have substantial strategicadvantages.(b) On the other hand there could be no certainty as yet thatthe Greek and Turkish Governments were genuinely committed tothe proposals which their Foreign Ministers had put forward or that they would succeed in reaching agreement on them.&apos; Whileencouraging discussions to continue, we should refrain fromendorsing the scheme too explicitly; and we should not relax our security measures against violence and terrorism in the Island. Itcould not be assumed that, even if the Governments concernedreached agreement, EOKA would disintegrate.The Cabinet then considered a draft message to the Greek and turkish Governments, agreeing that further discussions might usefully take place between them and that, when sufficient progress had been made in defining the institutional arrangements to protect the interests of the Cypriot communities under the new proposals,there should be consultations between the two Governments and ourselves on the arrangements for securing co-operation betweenthe local communities in a new form of government and on theinternational aspects of the proposals, including the necessarysafeguards for our rights in respect of our bases in the Island.Certain drafting amendments to this message were suggested, inorder to emphasise in particular the importance which we attachedto enjoying unrestricted communications between our bases andother parts of the island.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that after this message had been despatched we should begin to make preparations for the possibility of an eventual tripartite conference.For this purpose officials should examine urgently the international and strategic interests which we should wish to safeguard.arranging for the reply to contain a full refutation of the distortedhistorical context in which the Soviet note had presented the issue.  !Thereafter it should emphasise that the Western Powers wereprepared to discuss not merely the future of Berlin but all aspectsof the German problem.The Cabinet    -(2) Took note, with approval, of this statement.
aircraft industry.(previous reference *C.C. (58) 38thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Supply (C. (58) 257) on the aircraft industry.The Minister of Supply said that this industry faced an uncertainfuture. Unemployment had risen and would rise still further; andsome of the smaller companies would find increasing difficulty insurviving as independent entities. The prospects for recovery were largely dependent on the extent to which civil demand offset the progressive decline in military demand. But civil expansion itself would require a more positive policy on the part of the Government.The domestic market for civil aircraft was small and uneconomic;and it was confined to three customers the two Airline corporations and RAT. Transport Command whose individual interests werenot easily reconciled with a national policy for the industry as a whole.Our objective, therefore, should be to establish a new relationship between these three customers and the industry. If it was possible,for example, to arrange for orders by Transport Command toprecede orders for comparable aircraft by the Corporations and forthe proving of such aircraft to be carried out by Transport Command,we should avoid much of the public comment on their initialdeficiencies which was unavoidable if the Corporations undertooktheir proving. Moreover, there would, be greater hope of stimulating,exports of aircraft if the Corporations were authorised to undertake the proving of new aircraft even if they did not themselves require them. Finally, we needed to return, at least to some extent, to theearlier practice whereby the Government encouraged the developmentof selected types of aircraft even though, at the outset, no domesticrequirement for them could be foreseen. A combination of measureson these lines, designed to enlist more active support of the aircraftmanufacturers by their customers, should do much to enable theindustry to recover.In discussion there was general agreement with these views. Thefollowing main points were made:  (a) There was little prospect of any significant expansion, ofinternational.demand in the near future. In deciding to concentrate on the development of a turbo-prop, rather than a turbo-jet aircraft,the British airline operators had been at fault. The turbo-jet aircraft had proved: the more appropriate instrument, and sufficient aircraft of this kind had now been ordered by the major international airlineoperators to meet foreseeable requirements until about 1963. Ourwisest course, therefore, might now be to exploit such opportunitiesas occurred for the development of, e.g., an aircraft to replace theD.C.3.54550-cc. (87) 58The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the Greek and turkish Governments; in the terms approved in thediscussion, that we agreed that there would be advantagef in their continuing discussions on the possibility ofv. devising a. fresh solution to the^ problem of Cyprus.(2) Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrange for acommittee of officials under his chairmanship to prepare,for their consideration at an &quot;early date, a report on theinternational and strategic safeguards which we should require to incorporate in any settlement of Cyprus ofthe kind now contemplated by the Greek and turkish governments.
(A) The measures proposed by the Minister of Supply would demand, as their counterpart, a more positive effort by the industry itself to rationalise its structure by the elimination of the smaller andmore uneconomic units.(c) The future of the industry would not be assured withoutvery substantial expenditure on research into the application of suchnew principles as vertical takeroff and landing.(d) We should take all possible steps to ensure the continuedpre-eminence of Rolls Royce Limited in the development of aero-engines. But in terms of air-frame manufacture our domestic market was too small to enable us to face international competition; and weshould therefore seek to promote a closer association between ourown airline operators and the operators in other countries of theCommonwealth and of Europe. If, by this means, we could enlargethe market for our own industry we should be better able to face thecompetition of the United States.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theimportant issues outlined in C. (58) 257 merited more detailed consideration. For this purpose he proposed that the ministerial committee on Civil Aviation, under the chairmanship of the Ministerof Power, should be given new and wider terms of reference. Hewould himself preside over the initial meetings of the reconstitutedCommittee.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C. (58) 257.(2) Took note, with approval, that the Prime Minister would arrange for the Ministerial Committee on Civil Aviation,under the Chairmanship of the Minister of Power, to be reconstituted in order that it might examine in greater detail the issues discussed in C. (58) 257.Civil Aviation.(previous reference :CC. (58) 66thConclusions,Minute 8.)ScottishAviationLimited.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland (C. (58) 263) on the affairs of ScottishAviation Limited.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that this Companymanufactured a short-range light aircraft at Prestwick Airport, wherethey provided employment for about 2,000 men. The finance corporation for Industry (F.C.I.) had lent the Company some  3 millions but had decided that they could make no further advances.As a result the Company would be unable to meet their commitmentsafter the first week in January. The unemployment which wouldresult from the closure of the only firm in Scotland making air-frameswould provoke considerable political criticism; and the Chancellorof the Exchequer had, therefore, agreed that the Ministry of supply should be authorised exceptionally to make a special payment of 50,000 to the Company in respect of four aircraft which were atpresent being constructed for the Royal Air Force, on condition that.C.I. v/ould contribute an equal sum. The Corporation, however,had refused to do so, on the ground that the Ministry of Supply couldthemselves provide additional support for the Company byreassessing a contract price which had been originally under-estimated and by accelerating payment of an ex gratia grant incompensation for a reduction in the scale of their original order forthe Company&apos;s aircraft. These measures might result in the paymentof some  225,000 to the Company; but they would involve detailedenquiries which could not be completed in time to save the company from bankruptcy in January.  Alternatively, the Ministry of Supply
C.C. (87) 58might make a further advance against certain spare parts whichhad been manufactured for aircraft already&apos; delivered to the RoyalAir Force. If the solvency of the Company could be assured duringthe next few weeks by one or other of these means, it would bepossible to expedite negotiations for the projected merger betweenthe Company and the English Electric Company, which appeared tooffer the only prospect of maintaining employment in the area.The Minister of Supply said that he had already acceleratednormal progress payments to the maximum possible extent. these payments &quot;had probably taken full account of the Governmenfsliability in respect of aircraft spares; and any additional advance ofthis kind, which would be contrary to all normal practice, couldonly be defended to the Public Accounts Committee on the basis ofan express direction by Ministers. It might, however, be possibleto make some payment on account of the Company&apos;s claim for a revision of the contract price and for compensation in respect of thereduction of the initial order.In discussion there was general agreement that, if possible, theCompany should be enabled to meet their liabilities for a furthershort period but that they should be made clearly aware that theGovernment could not accept an indefinite commitment to support them and that, unless they could secure additional finance from commercial sources, their interests clearly lay in pressing to a conclusion as rapidly as possible the projected merger with the english electric Company.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Supply to ascertain whether theprogress payments already made to Scottish AviationLimited had taken full account of the Governmenfsliability in respect of certain aircraft spares attributable to aircraft already delivered, or in process of delivery,to the Royal Air Force.(2) Invited the Minister of Supply to consider whether it wouldbe possible to make the Company some payment onaccount of their claim for a reassessment of the originalcontract price of certain aircraft ordered by his Depart-ment and for ex gratia compensation in respect of areduction in the initial order.(3) Agreed that the Company should, if possible, be enabled tomeet their liabilities in the immediate future by either ofthe methods indicated in Conclusions (1) and (2) above,but that they should be encouraged, in the interests ofemployment in the Prestwick area, to merge theirenterprise with the English Electric Company as rapidly as possible.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (58) 255) on the investment programme in the public sector in the years 1959-60 and 1960-61.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the total of  1,585millions proposed for public investment in 1959-60 was substantially higher than the figure which had been provisionally agreed by theCabinet in the previous summer. It reflected the substantial bodyof additional measures which had recently been authorised to promoteemployment; and it represented a maximum commitment whichcould not safely be exceeded. For 1960-61 he proposed a total of  1,595-  1,600 millions which it might be appropriate to increase
Pensions.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 83rdConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (58) 259) on the possibility of improving pensionincrements under the new pensions scheme.The Home Secretary said that the Ministerial Committee on pensions had considered a proposal to reduce the period for which an individual who deferred retirement had to work in order to earnan increment on his basic pension and, in addition, to improve therates of increment so earned. They recommended an arrangement whereby a increment of Is. would be provided in return for everytwelve contributions paid after the contributor had reached theminimum retirement age, in place of tile present arrangement underwhich twenty-five contributions in deferred retirement earned anincrement of Is. 6d. This proposal had the political advantage thatit would offer some improvement to those earning less than  9 aweek, who would otherwise derive no benefit from the new pensions scheme apart from a reduction in their contributions. Moreover, itwas the logical complement to the concession, already approved bythe Cabinet, whereby the amount which a retired person was allowedto earn without abatement of his pension was to be raised from50s. to 60s.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he did not share thisview.   The cost of the proposal, although relatively small at the at a later stage by allowing higher allocations for housing and educational minor works as a further measure of reflation.   A v/decision on this point should, however, be deferred until the summer of 1959.In discussion the following main points were made:  (a) The successive reductions, imposed upon investment by thePost Office were severe the more so because the definition of&quot; capital investment &quot; included such items as the repair of telephoneinstallations, for which the Post Office were reimbursed. In recentyears, however, the Post Office had enjoyed a generous allocation;and there was no scope for increasing their share of the programme in the immediate future.(b) Discussions with local education authorities since thepublication of the White Paper on Secondary Education had shownthat the  14 millions which had been agreed for educational minorworks in 1959-60 would be insufficient. The allocation to education,however, had already been substantially increased; and no further expansion could be contemplated.(c) If it proved possible to make rapid progress on the roads programme during the following year, it might be difficult to concealthe fact that in the later part of the current year the programme hadto some extent been deliberately retarded. In these circumstances itmight be necessary to consider a revision of the investment allocation to roads.(d) Certain issues were outstanding as regards the provision for housing,. both in England and Wales and in Scotland, which theMinisters concerned would pursue further with the Chancellor of theExchequer.(e) The Secretary of State for Scotland would also discuss withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer the allocation for educationalinvestment in Scotland.The Cabinet-Approved, subject to the points made in their discussion,the investment programmes in the public sector in 1959-60and 1960-61, as proposed in C. (58) 255.
SECRET 9       550CC. (87) 58outset, would rise gradually to about  20 millions a year in twenty years&apos; time. Moreover, it would probably be necessary during thenext Parliament to raise the minimum age of retirement tosixty-seven; and the concession on pension increments, if made atthat point, would be a valuable offset to this unwelcome change.Discussion showed that the balance of opinion in the cabinet was in favour of the proposal. Deferred retirement was advantageous,to the finances of the scheme and would remain so even if the proposedimprovement in increments was conceded. The Government Actuaryhad now recalculated the estimated surpluses and deficits of the new.scheme and, even if the proposal were adopted, both would be morefavourable than the original estimates contained in the White paper on Provision for Old Age.In further discussion the Chancellor of the Exchequer said thatthe draft National Insurance Bill provided that deficits on the new scheme should be financed by Exchequer borrowing and thatsurpluses should be lent to the Exchequer. It would be preferable that, when a surplus or deficit was in prospect, the contributions ofboth the contributors and the Exchequer should be increased or reduced by an appropriate amount in order to preserve the relationship between the contributors and the Exchequer which theCabinet had already approved.In discussion it was suggested that it would be difficult to makeso fundamental a change in the method of financing the new schemewhen the draft legislation was at an advanced stage and that, if itwas subsequently decided that the modification proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer should be made, amending legislation should be introduced in a later session.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that provision should be made in the forthcomingNational Insurance Bill for an improved scheme ofpension increments on the lines indicated in C. (58) 259.(2) Agreed that no change should be made in the provisions inthe draft Bill governing the treatment of surpluses anddeficits in the new pensions scheme.Civil Aviation. 7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theJet Aircraft. Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation (C. (58) 260) about the use(Previous       of London Airport by jet aircraft.Reference *CC. (58) 66th The Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation said that conclusions, satisfactory conditions had now been agreed with the BritishMinute 8.) Overseas Airways Corporation (B.O.A.C.) and Pan-american airways for the reduction of the noise created by Comet and Boeing707 jet aircraft using London Airport. It had not yet been possible toobtain the agreement of the Soviet authorities to the imposition of similar conditions on the Soviet jet aircraft TU-104. We had nowbeen informed, however, that new operating procedures would reduce the noise level of this aircraft to that of the Comet and the boeing 707. It was not possible to verify this claim unless the aircraft was made available for noise tests in London. But the soviet authorities had refused to agree to arrangements for this purpose and we should find it impracticable to carry out such tests aroundairports on the Continent. So long as the present deadlock continuedBritish European Airways were unable to inaugurate a service to moscow and were at a disadvantage in relation to their Dutch,French and Belgian competitors who already operated Moscow
services. In addition, B.O.A.C. were precluded from startingnegotiations with the Soviet authorities for a service across russia to Tokyo. The wisest course; therefore, might be to allow the TU-104to operate a regular service to London Airport for a trial period of -thirty days. If, at the end of this period, the noise level of the aircraft was found to be acceptable, scheduled operations could continueunder appropriate conditions. If, on the other hand, the noise levelproved higher than that of the Boeing 707, stricter conditions would need to be imposed on the Soviet operations.In discussion, there was general agreement that, provided thatthe operating conditions were interpreted with reasonable flexibility,it would be to our advantage to seek to reach agreement with theSoviet authorities on this basis.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in C. (58) 260.BritishAluminiumCompany.(previous reference:CC. (58) 83rdConclusions,Minute 4.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theEconomic Secretary, Treasury (C. (58) 253) on recent developments in the affairs of the British Aluminium Company (B.A.C.).The Economic Secretary, Treasury said that the Chairman of.A.C. had addressed a letter to the shareholders explaining thereasons for the proposed association of the Company with the aluminium Company of America and the Board&apos;s objections to theproposal of Tube Investments (T.I.) to buy a majority of B.A.C.shares. Meanwhile T.I. had made an offer to the B.A.C. shareholdersequivalent to about 78s. for each share; and B.A.C. had now madea counter-offer of a dividend increase which would provideshareholders with approximately the same benefit.In discussion it was suggested that, if the Government continuedto refrain from expressing any view until the attitude of the share-holders was known and thereafter decided, on grounds of the national interest, to exercise their statutory right of sanction in a manner whichwould frustrate the shareholders&apos; own preference, they might invitecriticism for not having announced their decision at an earlier stage.On the other hand they had made no statement which could justifythe assumption that their decision would necessarily coincide withthe preference of the shareholders, and any public announcementbefore the views of the shareholders were known might be regardedas a prejudicial intervention in the affairs of the Company.Meanwhile, the Government would remain free to attach to their final sanction such conditions as they might see fit to impose, e.g.,for the protection of British shipping interests.The Cabinet Took note of C. (58) 253.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23rd December, 1958.
