Malta.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 84thConclusions,Minute 10.)In discussion it was suggested that, in the light of the publicattitude which Mr. Mintoff had recently adopted towards her majesty&apos;s Government, we might be better advised to maintain thatthe recent resolution of the Maltese Legislative Assembly justifiedus in abandoning the project for the integration of Malta with theUnited Kingdom. On the other hand, the Government were pledged to give effect to integration and, if this constitutional project was to fail, it was preferable that its failure should be seen to be attributable to Mr. Mintoff rather than to ourselves. The government&apos;s supporters were, however, deeply divided on the question of Malteseintegration, and it now seemed certain that legislation for this purposecould be enacted only with the support of the Opposition. A bill of this nature would form a very unacceptable element in thelegislative programme of the final Session of the Parliament. Forthese reasons it would be preferable that, without appearing at thisstage to break our earlier pledge on integration, we should seek toavoid its becoming an issue in the current discussions withMr. Mintoff.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that weshould endeavour so to conduct the negotiations with Mr. Mintoffthat the concept of integration would not appear to founder on a mere difference of opinion about the relatively small reduction inour subvention to the Maltese budget which we found it necessaryto make. It should be our aim rather to convince Mr. Mintoff that recent events, particularly the resolution of the Maltese LegislativeAssembly, had shaken the confidence of the Government in hisintentions and that it was for him to restore that confidence. For thispurpose, if he desired to go forward towards integration, he shouldbe asked for a written statement of the manner in which he was prepared to co-operate with the United Kingdom Government inthe economic and constitutional development of the Island. In thelight of his response to this invitation the Cabinet could then considerwhether it should remain the policy of the Government to promote the integration of the Island with the United Kingdom.1. The Colonial Secretary said that he was discussing with thePrime Minister of Malta the scale of the United Kingdom contributionto Malta&apos;s budget in 1958-59. Mr. Mintoff was likely to ask, during these discussions, whether it was still the policy of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to promote the integration of Malta with the UnitedKingdom. He was also likely to seek to make integration dependenton our granting financial assistance to Malta on a scale which wecould not accept. If we rejected this approach he would probablyask for a dissolution of the Maltese Parliament and would base hisappeal to the electorate on the theme of independence for Malta.An independent Malta would constitute a serious threat to our strategic interests in the Mediterranean; and, if Mr. Mintoff won theelection on that programme, we should probably be obliged to suspend the Constitution.Alternatively, however, Mr. Mintoff might adopt a moreconciliatory attitude. He might be prepared to meet our stipulationthat the Maltese Legislative Assembly should withdraw their recentresolution repudiating any obligation towards the United KingdomGovernment unless a guarantee of alternative employment was givento workers discharged from the dockyard. He might also be willingto accept the reduction in our contribution to the Maltese budgeton which we felt obliged to insist. In that event could Mr. Mintoffbe assured that integration remained the policy of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, either in the relatively near future or after a moratorium?
Northern 2.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeIreland. Secretary (C. (58) 59) on the state of unemployment in NorthernRelief of        Ireland.Unemployment. fjome Secretary said that the number of unemployed in(Previous Northern Ireland had now risen to more than 10 per cent, of the reference: working population. This level was nearly three times as high asCM. (55) 2nd that in Wales and Scotland and more than five times as high as that conclusions, in England. The Government of Northern Ireland were taking allMinute 1.) the measures open to them to improve the situation, and they had asked for further help from the United Kingdom Government. Theyhad, in particular, proposed that the maximum rate of grant for new industries establishing themselves in Northern Ireland should beraised from 25 per cent, to 33-J per cent. This higher rate of grant,which would be paid by the Northern Ireland Government, wouldhave the effect of decreasing the amount of their imperial contribution. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had assented to this.They had also suggested that a programme of public works shouldbe undertaken in Northern Ireland. This also might affect theImperial contribution, but he proposed that the Government should offer to consider any specific proposals which might be put forward.Thirdly, they had suggested that further Government orders shouldbe placed with ship-building, aircraft and textile industries inNorthern Ireland. This could be considered; but meanwhile an assurance could be given that Northern Ireland would continue toreceive the same favourable treatment as in the past.A General Election was now in progress in Northern Irelandand the Prime Minister wished to be able, in a speech to the UlsterUnionist Council on 14th March, to give a public assurance that assistance from the United Kingdom Government would be forthcoming towards the relief of unemployment. The HomeSecretary sought the authority of the Cabinet to send him a letter,to be read in the course of that speech, conveying the assurancessummarised above. The text of this letter was annexed to C. (58) 59.In discussion it was pointed out that, if these concessions weremade to Northern Ireland, corresponding facilities would soon be demanded in respect of development areas in Great Britain.Similarly, if it were decided to build a dry-dock at Belfast, theproposed curtailment of the dockyard at Malta would be the more strongly resisted. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that his acceptance of the Home Secretary&apos;s proposals in respect of NorthernIreland should not be taken to imply that similar concessions would necessarily be made elsewhere. There was general agreement inthe Cabinet that there were in Northern Ireland special circumstances which justified these exceptional measures.The Cabinet-(1) Took note with approval of the measures proposed inC. (58) 59 for the relief of unemployment in NorthernIreland; and authorised the Home Secretary to send aletter to the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland in theterms of the draft annexed to C. (58) 59.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to ask Lord Chandos, who had assumed the Chairmanship of a Committee to attractnew industries to Northern Ireland, to furnish him withan appreciation of the progress so far achieved by his committee and of its future prospects.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary, in his forthcoming negotiations with Mr. Mintoff, to be guided by the considerations which had emerged in their discussion.
SECRET 5C.C. 21 (58)Territorial 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the waters. Attorney-General (C. (58) 58) discussing the attitude to be adopted(Previous        by the United Kingdom delegation at the International ConferenceReference:      on the Law of the Sea in the further discussions on the breadth ofC.C. (58) 19th territorial waters and the limit of exclusive fishing rights.Conclusions,Minute 3.) The   Attorney-General   said   that   the   proposals   in   thismemorandum, which were designed to prevent the Conference fromadopting a recommendation extending territorial waters to twelvemiles, were based on the assumption that it would be impossibleto retain the present three-mile limit. It was however suggested,in a recent appreciation by our delegation, that it would be less toour disadvantage if the Conference failed to reach any decisions on either the breadth of territorial waters or the limit of exclusive fishing rights than if it adopted unsatisfactory recommendations on these subjects. Moreover, there now appeared to be a reasonable chanceof obtaining the minimum voting support required to prevent theadoption of any proposal for an extension of territorial waters to twelve miles. In these circumstances our policy should be to advocatefor as long as possible the retention of the three-mile limit forterritorial waters and to oppose any proposal for exclusive fishing rights beyond the limit of territorial waters. At the same time weshould encourage discussion of measures to promote fishingconservation and should attempt to secure sufficient support fromother delegations for this alternative approach to the problem toprevent any extension of territorial waters to twelve miles. It wouldbe important to persuade the United States Government not to putforward, at this stage, their compromise proposal for a three-mile limit for territorial waters with a contiguous zone of nine miles inwhich the coastal States would have exclusive fishing rights. Thisproposal was unlikely to satisfy the claims of many of the countries concerned with the protection of their coastal fisheries and wouldprobably result in the Conference adopting a twelve-mile breadth of territorial waters for all purposes. Our own proposal for anextension of territorial waters to six miles, subject to a right of passage for warships without prior authorisation and for aircraftoutside the three miles, should be reserved for use as a last resort.Though this proposal might not be accepted by the Conference, itwould at least be an indication of our willingness to accept a compromise solution and should thus help us to obtain the necessaryvoting support to prevent the adoption of any proposal for anextension of territorial waters beyond the present limit.Since the discussion about fishery rights was likely to precedeany further debate on the breadth of territorial waters, we shouldmake it clear in that discussion that we were firmly opposed to any extension of exclusive fishery rights beyond the limit of territorial waters. A categorical statement on these lines should deter theUnited States from putting forward prematurely their alternativecompromise solution; but it would also be desirable to re-emphasisedirectly to the United States Government our objections to thatsolution.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.An extension of exclusive fishery rights to twelve miles would resultin serious losses for our deep sea fishing fleets. It would thereforebe preferable to seek, as an alternative, some agreement on the promotion of fishing conservation. The Cabinet would also need to consider carefully the terms in which any proposal for an extensionof territorial waters to six miles might be put forward, since a six-mile limit without adequate safeguards for rights of passage forwarships and aircraft would preclude access by sea and air to theMediterranean and to Aden, Singapore and Hong Kong.
The Cabinet (1) Approved the Attorney-Generafs proposals about theattitude to be adopted by the United Kingdom delegation at the International Conference on the Law of the Sea in further discussions on the breadth of territorial waters and the limit of exclusive fishing rights.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would send a further message to President Eisenhower explaining Her Majesty&apos;s government&apos;s concern about any extension of exclusive fishing rights beyond the limit of territorial waters.&apos;(3) Invited the Attorney-General to report further to the cabinet before any proposal for extending the limit of territorial waters to six miles was submitted to the international conference on the Law of the Sea.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,11th March, 1958.
