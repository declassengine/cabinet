Iraq.(previous references:C.C. (58) 24thConclusions,Minute 3 andC.C. (57) 12thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that it might become necessaryfor the Governments of the United States and the United kingdom to provide further financial assistance to Iraq in support of the ArabUnion. He had therefore suggested to the Prime Minister in washington that he should discuss this issue with president eisenhower on the hypothesis that the major share of any assistanceof this kind would need to be provided by the United States.In discussion there was general agreement on the importance ofsecuring a commitment by the United States to sustain the ArabUnion. It would be important, however, to ensure, if possible, thatthe terms of any joint communication to the Government of Iraqshould not prejudice the subsequent detailed negotiations about theamount and form of the United Kingdom contribution to any offer of financial assistance for this purpose. It would also be desirablethat, in return for such assistance, the Iraqi Government should agreeto abate their pressure for a settlement with Kuwait on their ownterms.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to inform the Prime minister in Washington of the terms in which the Cabinet consideredthat the United Kingdom might offer, jointly with the UnitedStates, to provide further financial assistance to Iraq insupport of the Arab Union.Cyprus.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 43rdConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that the internal security situationin Cyprus had deteriorated in the last few days and the TurkishCypriots appeared to be deliberately attempting to create theimpression that it was impossible for the two communities in cyprus to live together harmoniously. Urgent representations had beenmade to the Turkish Government about the importance of avoiding any fresh outbreaks of violence at this stage. Meanwhile, in response to a request by the Greek Government, the North Atlantic Councilproposed to consider the situation of Cyprus that afternoon.Despite these developments, Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atAnkara would proceed that day to disclose to the TurkishGovernment our proposals for the future constitutional developmentof Cyprus in accordance with the authority already given bythe Cabinet. It would then be desirable that our permanent representative on the North Atlantic Council should state thatapproaches were being made to the Greek and Turkish Governmentsabout our new proposals, which would be reported to the Councilin due course. It had originally been intended that the council should be informed of these proposals on 16th June; but in the lightof recent developments and of the favourable reaction of theSecretary-General to our plan, there would be advantage in advancingthis date to 13th June.In discussion it was agreed that, subject to the results of thediscussion in the North Atlantic Council that afternoon, the revisedprocedure proposed should be adopted.53690-3B 2Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the   ^-x.Colonial Secretary, to arrange, if it appeared desirable,   \J*&apos;for the North Atlantic Council to be informed of our proposals for the constitutional development of Cypruson 13th June.(2) Agreed that, in that event, the announcement of theseproposals in Parliament might need to be made on16th June.Coal.(previous reference:CC. (57) 2ndConclusions,Minute 5.)Decontrol.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Power (E.A. (58) 42) on the decontrol of house coal.The Minister of Power said that it had been inadvisable to end the allocation system for house coal until it was possible to dispense with imports of coal. Imports had now been limited, however, to the residual amounts still being obtained under existing contracts, and thelatest assessment of the efforts of the National Coal Board to increasedomestic supplies made it reasonable to decontrol house coal in thenear future. In the light of the recent report of the Committee ofEnquiry into Coal Distribution Costs, which made it clear that therewas no justification for any significant increase in the price of coal,it would be desirable to end the control over prices at the same time.Consultations would be needed with the National Coal Board, the merchants, the Domestic Coal Consumers&apos; Council and localauthorities to ensure that the transfer from control to free competitionwas effected smoothly. Although these consultations could not be guaranteed to prevent some increases in prices or some local shortagesnext winter if the weather was severe, the present level of supply was unlikely to fall seriously short of unrestricted demand and, if genuinecompetition between merchants was restored, no major problem should arise. Moreover, the Defence Regulations on which theexisting control was based would remain in force throughout thewinter and, if experience during that period showed that it wasnecessary to retain a system of allocation and price control, it wouldbe possible to amend for this purpose the Bill which it was proposedto introduce in the next session of Parliament for the permanentretention of certain economic controls.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.The text of a draft announcement of the Governments intentions was approved, subject to certain textual amendments.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in E.A. (58) 42.(2) Authorised the Minister of Power to announce that day thatthe Government proposed to bring to an end about themiddle of July the statutory control over supplies and prices of house coal.5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (58) 119)proposing that the Departmental Committee to be appointed to (58) 18th   investigate artificial insemination should be given the following termsConclusions,    of reference &quot; To enquire into the existing practice of humanMinute 3.) &apos;    artificial insemination and its legal consequences; and to considerwhether, taking account of the interests of individuals involved andof society as a whole, any change in the law is necessary or desirable.&quot;The Home Secretary recalled that at their previous discussion on this subject the Cabinet had been doubtful .about the expediency of instituting an official enquiry into the moral and social aspects of artificial insemination of women and had concluded that any enquiryArtificialInsemination(previous reference:
285Civil Aviation.BritanniaAircraft.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 77thConclusions,Minute 4)should be limited to a review of its legal consequences. The debate in the House of Lords in February had, however, demonstrated thatthe legal consequences could not be considered in isolation from the wider aspects of the question and must, indeed, depend to a largeextent on an assessment of the implications of the practice for theindividual and for society.In discussion there was general agreement with this view. Thereport of an enquiry on the lines now proposed would be controversial and potentially embarrassing to the Government; but public opinion was already critical of the Government for taking no action in thismatter and would expect a review of the practice of human artificial insemination to comprise more than an investigation of its purelylegal consequences.The Cabinet Agreed that the Departmental Committee to be appointedto enquire into the existing practice of human artificial insemination should be given the terms of reference proposedin C. (58) 119.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Power (C. (58) 118) constituting a further report by the Committeeof Ministers which had been appointed under his Chairmanship toensure the satisfactory development of the Britannia aircraft.The Minister of Power said that, in the light of the substantial progress which had been made in the development of modifications to the air intake of the engines of the Britannia aircraft, a final solutionof the icing problems of this aircraft should now be achieved at a costwithin the authorised expenditure of  750,000. Moreover, as a resultof the financial measures taken by the Government and the british overseas Airways Corporation, the Bristol Aeroplane Company hadbeen able to keep within their overdraft limit of  18 millions. Thetechnical difficulties which his Committee had been set up to considernow appeared to have been overcome; and he proposed that theCommittee should stand down, while remaining formally in being incase any new problems arose in connection with the development ofthe Britannia aircraft.The Minister of Supply said that it now seemed unlikely thatthe United States North East Airlines would confirm their provisional order for five Britannia aircraft and that, since there were no alternative customers for these aircraft in prospect, the financialposition of the Bristol Aeroplane Company would remain precarious.A similar situation would also confront Messrs. Vickers Limited inrespect of the Vanguard aircraft, for which insufficient orders had yet been placed to enable the Company to recover their development expenditure. These difficulties were to a large extent the result ofthe unrealistic policy adopted by the International Air TransportAssociation (I.A.T.A.) in fixing international airline fares. Thispolicy, by precluding differential fares, did not allow airlines to takeadvantage of the lower operating costs of turbo-propeller aircraftcompared with jet aircraft. The Government should therefore consider whether, despite the opposition to be expected from the airlines of the United States, the two British Airways Corporationsshould be encouraged to put forward proposals for differential faresat the next meeting of TATA, in the autumn.In discussion there was general agreement that this pToblemshould be further considered by the Committee of Ministers underthe Chairmanship of the Minister of Power.
The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of C. (58) 118.(2) Invited the Committee of Ministers under the Chairmanship *of the Minister of Power to examine urgently thedesirability of proposing changes in the present structure of international airline fares.industrial disputes.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 46thConclusions,Minute 1)*7. The Minister of Labour said that the Governments policy towards the London bus strike had been reinforced by the refusal of the National Union of Railwaymen to give official countenanceto any extension of strike action to the London underground railways.The situation in the London docks was, however, increasingly serious:This unofficial strike derived from a strike of transport drivers atSmithfield and could only be satisfactorily settled if the Smithfielddispute was brought to an end. But there were reasons for believing that, although the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union (T.G.W.U.)were anxious to give the appearance of seeking a solution of thesedisputes, they would in fact refuse to co-operate in any attempt to resolve them until a settlement had been reached in the London busdispute. In these circumstances it was difficult for the Governmentto take any positive action to bring the strikes to an end. But, in theabsence of any initiative by the Government, the T.G.W.U. mightshortly take more vigorous steps to extend the strike to the oil tankerdrivers and possibly-the power-station workers, and public opinion would become increasingly critical of the Governments apparentinactivity. It was therefore for consideration whether, despite theopposition of the unions, the Government should appoint a committeeof investigation into the Smithfield dispute and should also authorisethe use of troops to move at least the perishable foodstuffs at presentlying idle in the docks.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that there was unlikely to be any serious shortage of meat until the following week and that discussions were proceeding between the employers and the unions on the possibility of clearing cargoes of butter and cheese as anemergency operation. In these circumstances it would be premature to reach a decision on the use of troops in the docks. But steps shouldbe taken to let it be known that, notwithstanding their apparentwillingness to use their good offices, the T.G.W.U. were making no serious attempt to promote a settlement of the disputes at Smithfieldand in the docks.In the meantime, the People&apos;s League for the Defence of Freedomhad applied for a public service vehicle licence for a substantial number of buses which they proposed to operate as a private venture.Their application had been made in proper form and satisfied thestatutory requirements concerned. Despite the friction which might result from the operation of these buses there were no grounds onwhich the Government could seek to prevent the issue of a licence.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Minister of Labour should indicate, in replyto a Private Notice Question in the House of commons that day, that the Government could still see no grounds on which they would be justified in intervening in theLondon bus dispute.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour, in consultation with theMinister of Transport, to consider the means by whichthe general public might best be made aware that the previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
Transport and General Workers&apos; Union were making nogenuine efforts to resolve the disputes at Smithfield andin the London docks.(3) Took note that the Home Secretary would arrange for thecurrent industrial disputes to be kept under continuous review and for the Cabinet to be invited to give furtherconsideration, at the appropriate moment, to thedesirability of using troops in the docks.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,10th June, 1958.
