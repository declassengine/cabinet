ForeignAffairs.Meeting of heads of governments.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 31stConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the Soviet Government werebeing pressed to agree that, in the diplomatic discussions which wereto precede the meeting of Foreign Ministers, the Ambassadors of thethree Western Powers should deal jointly, rather than separately, withthe Soviet Foreign Minister. The Soviet Government were likely, fortheir part, to revive their earlier proposal that certain Soviet satellitecountries, such as Poland and Czechoslovakia, should be represented at any meeting of Heads of Governments. It would be necessary toconsider, in concert with the United States Government, what responsewe should make to such a proposal.British Forces The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that agreement had nowin Europe. been reached with the Federal German Government about the level(Previous of their contribution to the costs of maintaining British troops in reference : Germany. In the current year this contribution would consist of aC.C. (58) 19th cash payment of  12 millions together with a sum of  22t millions,Conclusions, representing an advance repayment of those instalments of the minute 2.)       German post-war debt which would fall due in the years 1962-64.In addition, the German Government would deposit in London asum of  50 millions as an advance payment for defence equipment.In the two subsequent years the German Government would continuethe annual contribution of  12 millions.The German Government agreed that, as part of this settlement,the strength of our forces would be reduced from 55,000 to 45,000during 1959. But this reduction still required the approval of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Western European Union,which would not easily be obtained. In particular the United StatesGovernment and the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, would be reluctant to accept this further withdrawal of British troops from europe. For budgetary purposes, however, we had assumed thatour forces in Germany would be reduced to 45,000 during 1959; andalthough we should seek to reduce to a minimum the area of disagree-ment with our Allies, we must continue to rest on this hypothesis.In discussion it was suggested that it would be desirable, beforeseeking the approval of the Western European Union to our agree-ment with the German Government, to ascertain whether the membersof the North Atlantic Alliance were prepared to provide an additionalfinancial contribution which might make it possible for us to maintain in Germany a rather larger number of troops than 45,000 for one moreyear and so to extend the run-down of British forces over a ratherlonger period. The forthcoming meeting of the North atlantic council at Copenhagen would provide a convenient opportunity of ascertaining the attitude of the United States Government to anarrangement of this kind.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Defence,to consider the best means of securing United States support in the North Atlantic Council for our agreement with theFederal German Government on the costs of maintainingBritish forces in Germany.53440-1b 2Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Health (C. (58) 84) to which was annexed a minute by the Secretaryof the Medical Research Council (M.R.C.), and a memorandum by theLord President (C. (58) 85) on the problem of vaccination againstpoliomyelitis during the summer of 1958.The demand for vaccination had proved greater and the supply ofvaccine (both British and Salk) less than had been expected with theresult that, if the present system of testing Salk vaccine were maintained, 2J million people registered for vaccination would nothave been vaccinated by the end of June. The only way to avoid that situation was to cut down or to suspend the testing of Salk vaccine b)the M.R.C., but the M.R.C. had themselves advised against eitherreducing or suspending the tests. The Minister of Health proposed,nevertheless, that the M.R.C. tests should be abridged by the omission of the second of the three safety tests (a tissue culture test) or,alternatively, that both this and the third test (on live monkeys) shouldbe omitted. The Lord President, in his memorandum, presented thecase for maintaining in full the present testing by the M.R.C. Heconcluded that, if any departure was to be made from the presentsystem, it would be preferable to suspend the M.R.C. tests altogetherrather than reduce them.Discussion showed that opinion in the Cabinet was divided onthis issue. On the one hand it was pointed out that, if the presentsystem were maintained, the vaccination of the 2f million peopleconcerned could not begin until late in July nor be completed untilthe end of September, which was the end of the normal poliomyelitisseason; and in an average year there would occur among them 300cases of paralytic poliomyelitis, about 200 of which would have been saved by the injection of Salk vaccine untested by the M.R.C. If thisturned out to be a bad year there might be as many as 600 paralyticcases. If testing by the M.R.C. were suspended, it would be possible tovaccinate by the end of June all those who had registered. In that caseabout 100 paralytic cases could be expected to occur among themin an average year, but there would be some risk of a &quot; Cutter &quot;incident caused by mutation of the virus, which might produce somehundreds of paralytic cases in addition. Unless a &quot; Cutter &quot; incidentwere to occur it was certain that there would be more paralyticpoliomyelitis among children if the M.R.C. tests were retained in fullthan if they were abridged or suspended. The Government wouldbe attacked for failing to fulfil their undertaking to provide vaccinefor all those in the priority classes who registered before the onset ofthe poliomyelitis season, and it would be difficult to defend a refusal touse available vaccine which had been used on a large scale throughoutthe United States and Canada and other parts of the world. Parentswould be denied the opportunity to choose between vaccination oftheir children with vaccine tested only by the Americans or Canadiansand no vaccination at all. While a serious mishap might shake public confidence in any type of poliomyelitis vaccine in the future, no sampletesting, even as carried out by the M.R.C., could guarantee the safety of any particular batch. The tissue culture test which the Ministerof Health wished to dispense with during the period of emergencywas the least important of the three safety tests and had, indeed,recently failed to detect live virus in a batch of Salk vaccine.On the other side it was argued that the Government would beassuming a heavy responsibility if they overrode the advice given bythe M.R.C. on this question. There was no method by which to evaluate the risk of another incident of the &quot; Cutter &quot; type. Even ifthe full facts and the advice given by the M.R.C. were put before thepublic the reaction of individual parents and general practitioners tothe risk would vary and they would find it difficult to reach a fully informed decision. The time actually saved by abridging the M.R.C.tests was open to question and there were obvious objections torequiring the M.R.C. to carry out tests which they regarded asunsatisfactory. Moreover, it could be inferred from informationprovided by the M.R.C. that some time could be saved even with theVaccines:Poliomyelitis.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 13thConclusions,Minute 5.)
British 4.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that, together with transport       the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Transport, heCommission.    had   discussed   with   representatives   of   the   British  Transport(Previous        Commission and the railway unions the situation which had arisen as reference:      a result of the rejection by the Railway Arbitration Tribunal of theC.C. (58) 31st  railwaymen&apos;s claim for an increase in wages.   He had consideredConclusions,    carefully whether this situation called for an intervention by the minute 6.)       Government at this juncture. But the extent of the Exchequer interestin the railways had, in his judgment, justified the meeting; and hewas satisfied that he had succeeded in making it clear to the union representatives that the Government were not prepared to increase thepresent scale of their financial assistance to the Commission in relationto its current expenditure but were ready to take part, with theCommission and the unions, in a tripartite effort to increase efficiency and productivity on the railways. For this purpose he had indicated that, if the Commission and the unions were prepared to secure themaximum economies in operation and to join in ensuring the most efficient use of man-power, the Government would be willing tore-examine the programme of railway modernisation and to supportreductions in uneconomic services and such other measures of rationalisation as the Commission might propose.In discussion it was agreed that it now lay with the Commissionand the unions to indicate how far they were willing to respond to this initiative. Meanwhile, the Government should make as little furthercomment as possible, although they should discreetly let it be known that it did not represent the beginning of a new phase of negotiation inwhich the unions might extract further concessions.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of these statements.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,24th April, 1958.retention of the present tests if 5,000 litres of Salk vaccine were orderedinstead of the 4,000 litres authorised by the Home Affairs Committee.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that whatever decision was taken on the question of testing it was desirablethan an additional 1,000 litres of Salk vaccine should be purchased.On the main issue the crucial question was whether a child would be at greater risk this summer if he were vaccinated with Salk vaccineuntested by the M.R.C. or if he were not vaccinated at all. TheM.R.C. should be invited to express a view on this. They should alsobe asked to elaborate and explain some of the arguments used in theirreport. For these purposes representatives of the M.R.C. might beinvited to meet the Prime Minister and the other Ministers principally concerned before the next meeting of the Cabinet.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Health to purchase 1,000 litres ofSalk vaccine in addition to the 4,000 litres already authorised.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister, Secretary of State forScotland, Lord President, Minister of Education,Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister ofHealth would meet representatives of the medical research Council to discuss certain questions on which further information was required.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a meeting early in thefollowing week.
