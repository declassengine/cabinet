CC. 49 (58)The Lebanon.        * 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Secretary-General of the(Previous        United Nations, while willing to increase the number of united reference:      Nations observers in the Lebanon, seemed reluctant to establish aCC. (58) 48th   United Nations force in the area.   Meanwhile the situation in theConclusions,    Lebanon remained ambiguous, and there was a growing risk that allMinute 3.)      parties would allow events to take their course until the critical dateof 24th July when the Presidential Election would take place.  If theauthority of the Lebanese Government was not re-established by then, the prestige of the Western Powers in the Arab world mightsuffer serious damage.In discussion it was agreed that in these circumstances it mightsoon become necessary to consider how the United Nations could beimpelled to take some more positive action in relation to the Lebanon.It might be expedient to ask for a special meeting of the general assembly, and to demonstrate the incapacity of the United Nations,as at present organised, to prevent the subversion of sovereign States.It was agreed that, in answer to any public enquiries about thepurpose of the increased concentration of British troops in Cyprus,it should be emphasised that it was necessary, at the present juncture,to take additional steps to ensure the maintenance of internal security in the Island without drawing on the strategic reserve of troopsnormally maintained in the Middle East.Pensions.(previous reference:CC. (58) 29thConclusions,Minute 2.)2.   The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by the Home Secretary (C. (58) 123)summarising the results of confidential discussions with certain outside interests on the respective merits of the August and September plans and discussing the courses of action now open to the Government;(ii) a note by the Home Secretary (C. (58) 124) covering the fullrecord of the discussions with outside interests;(hi) a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C. (58) 128) indicating the reasons for which he recommended theadoption of the August Plan;(iv) a memorandum by the Minister of Pensions and national insurance (C. (58) 130) summarising the arguments in favour of the september Plan.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet should seek to decide,in the light of the results of the recent confidential discussions, whetherthey felt compelled to abandon the whole project of a graduated pensions scheme or whether they were now prepared to reach adecision as between the August and September Plans or whether they thought it right, before attempting to reach a final decision, to publish a White Paper on future pensions policy in a further attempt to elicitan informed and constructive public reaction to the issues involved.It was desirable that the Government should, if possible, reach a decision of policy in the very near future and give legislative effectto it in the next session.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while both the august and the September Plans would substantially assist the Exchequer to remedy the emerging deficit on the National Insurance Fund, he regarded the former as the sounder scheme. It would redress theemerging deficit without creating any serious new deficit of its own,whereas the September Plan, by using the income from the new scheme to support the finances of the old, left the new scheme itselfwithout the resources to meet its own emerging costs and re-created in the longer term the problem which it was intended to solve.Moreover,   the   August   Plan  was   more   consistent   with   the
Governmenfs political philosophy. It was based on the principlethat the State should restrict its role to the relief of basic need, assessed by reference to an enlightened standard, and should trespass nofurther than was necessary for this purpose on the occupational schemes provided by private enterprise. Within these limits the august Plan varied the contribution charge according to the ability of employees to pay and shared the Exchequer subsidy among them&quot; according to their need. It could therefore be represented as ameasure which combined financial reform with social justice. Finally,since it was confined to the concept of basic need and omitted any provision for contracting out, it was less directly competitive than the september Plan with the proposals published by the Labour Party;and for this reason it was politically the more advantageous of thetwo Plans.The Minister of Pensions maintained that in terms of the relief which it should provide to the Exchequer the September Plan was atlittle, if any, disadvantage by comparison with the August Plan duringthe next two decades, particularly since the recent consultations with industry had shown that contracting out was likely to be adopted ona rather smaller scale than had originally been assumed. In anycase the difference between the two Plans from the point of view ofthe Exchequer was marginal, and such advantage as the August Planmight entail in the remoter future might be offset by the reductionin private saving and investment which it might provoke. Thedecision could, therefore, be based mainly on social and political considerations. The recent consultations had established that theorganisation^ representative of sectors of industry as a whole, e.g., theBritish Employers&apos; Confederation and the Trades Union Congress,were in favour of the principle of contracting out and that this principle also commended itself to private industry in so far asindividual firms had expressed any clear view on the point. nor could it be claimed, in the light of the modest scale of benefits whichit would provide, that the September Plan was based on asignificantly more generous approach to the problem than was impliedin the concept of basic need. On the other hand, it recognised the undoubted preference of certain industries to maintain their ownoccupational schemes and, in the case of self-employed persons,allowed them to retain the right, which the August Plan would denythem, to decide for themselves the extent to which they wished to supplement the existing National Insurance provision. Finally, thepolitical advantage of the September scheme was greater than hadbeen suggested. There was reason to believe that the Labour party had now realised that their proposals would be impracticable if theyretained a provision for contracting out and that they would prefer,if possible, to omit such a provision from their scheme. If theGovernment abandoned contracting out in their own proposals, theycould not reasonably criticise the Labour Party for deleting it fromtheir plan; and, if they put forward proposals which did not provide an opportunity for contracting out, they would be encouraging thenew pensions scheme to develop on lines which their political opponents would welcome and they themselves would find it difficult,if not impossible, to amend at a later stage. For these reasons the september Plan was preferable to the August Plan on both social andpolitical grounds; and, since it would not provide significantly lessrelief to the Exchequer in the foreseeable future, it was a scheme whichthe Government could also recommend on grounds of financial policy.In discussion, it was recognised that there were strong arguments in favour of the September Plan. If it was regarded as essential, inthe light of the Governmenfs political principles, that the state should confine itself to relieving basic need, it appeared to followlogically that any new pensions scheme should both permitcontracting out and allow freedom to self-employed persons to decide for themselves how far, and by what means, they wished to supplement the State provision.    Moreover, the burden of the
additional contribution which the August Plan would entail wouldweigh so heavily on individual members of certain occupational schemes that it would be necessary to provide some abatement of those schemes, in terms of benefit as well as of contribution. The legislativeimplications of this course might be formidable, and the occupational schemes themselves would inevitably suffer severe damage. Indeed,if future Governments found it necessary to increase the contributions under the August Plan, it would gradually become impossible formany occupational schemes to survive at all, and with theirdisappearance a valuable factor making for stability in industrial relations would also disappear.On the other hand, it could be argued that such elements ofpublic opinion as favoured contracting out did so merely becausethey had failed to appreciate that a State scheme need not includeprevision for this purpose unless it trespassed on a field which privateenterprise could claim to reserve to itself. It was only if this trespasswas conceded to an extent which might be held to be inconsistent with the Governments principles that contracting out became necessary. This consideration was reinforced by the preferencewhich the Life Offices Association themselves had expressed for the august Plan. Moreover, contracting out, if not wholly impracticable,would involve substantial and progressively increasing administrativecomplications, particularly in the case of short-service employees whochanged their employment frequently; and the State should not accept a responsibility which it might find it impossible to dischargesatisfactorily. Finally, the August Plan was devised to dealfundamentally with the faulty finances of the existing national insurance Scheme; and, given a continued expansion of the economy and a progressive increase in real earnings, it should succeed in doing so. It was open to question whether the September Plan would satisfy this criterion, at least in the longer term; and the government might be ill-advised to publish proposals which would be seen, byinformed opinion, to contain the seeds of their own insolvency.The Home Secretary said that the Government would be in a difficult position if they were not seen, by the time of the next Budget,to be taking or proposing some action to remedy the emerging deficit on the National Insurance Fund. It would be equally unwise to postpone disclosure of their intentions until the approach of theGeneral Election, since it was undesirable that this issue should become the subject of political competition between the Parties andthat the Governments proposals should be discussed, in comparisonwith the plan published by the Opposition, in the atmosphere of animpending appeal to the electorate. These considerations made itimpossible to adopt the course, which might otherwise have beenpolitically preferable, of abandoning the whole project of a graduated pensions scheme. But, on the assumption that one of theGovernments main objectives must be to solve the problem of theemerging deficit under the existing arrangements, it would appearthat the August Plan was the sounder scheme and that, if the finaldecision was given in favour of the September Plan, it would be sogiven mainly for social and political reasons. It might therefore bedesirable to consider whether it would be feasible, possibly by some modification of the September Plan, to devise a scheme which, whileincorporating the principle of contracting out, would also satisfy the requirements of the Exchequer in relation to the finances of theNational Insurance Scheme without creating a new deficit of its own.It would be necessary, in formulating such a scheme, to take accountof the fact that, as the recent consultations had shown, the interestrate to be assumed would need to be at least 4 per cent, if the schemewas to be commercially competitive and that this assumption mightitself affect to some extent the scale on which contracting out was likely to take place.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet should reflect further on the issues which had emerged andon the suggestion which the Home Secretary had made. They shouldresume their discussion in the near future with the intention to reach a final decision.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider whetherit would be possible to devise some variation of the graduated pensions plans under consideration which,while incorporating the principle of contracting out,would provide a satisfactory and permanent remedy forthe defective finances of the existing National InsuranceScheme.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a future meeting.Education.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 73rdConclusions,Minute 5.)Salaries ofScottishTeachers.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Education(C. (58) 125) on the claim for a 7 per cent, salary increase for teachers in Scotland.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that this claim was basedmainly on the rise in the cost of living since the last settlement inNovember 1956. For this reason it should, in principle, be rejected as inconsistent with the Governmenfs wages policy. But he was represented only by an assessor on the Management side of theNational Joint Council which negotiated increases in the salaries of scottish teachers and he was debarred by tradition from interveningdirectly in the negotiations. He was, however, able to control their final outcome since any agreement or, in the absence of agreement,any arbitration award had to be submitted for his approval,modification or rejection. Since he was obliged to write to the two sides of the National Joint Council informing them that the cost ofa 7 per cent, increase could in fact be met from the Education(Scotland) Fund he would have an opportunity to indicate his attitude to any agreement which might result from the claim.In discussion it was emphasised that a more substantial claimhad been submitted on behalf of the teachers in England and Wales.The local authorities concerned with that claim were thought to be willing to refuse any increase before the expiration of three years from the date of the last settlement in the autumn of 1956; but their position would be made more difficult if an increase were conceded in Scotland. It would therefore be desirable that both sides of theNational Joint Council for Scotland should be reminded that thecurrent salary scales had been approved in 1956 on the understandingthat they would remain unchanged until 31st March, 1960, unless there was a major change in circumstances and should be informedthat, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, no major change in circumstances had in fact arisen. The draft letter in Appendix B ofC. (58) 125 would suffice for this purpose, subject to the omission ofthe fourth paragraph.The Cabinet -Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to write to thetwo sides of the National Joint Council as in the draft letter in Appendix B of C. (58) 125, subject to the omission ofparagraph 4.
