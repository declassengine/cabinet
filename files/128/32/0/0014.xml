Baghdad Pact(previous reference:C.C. (58) 8thConclusions,Minute 6.)Cyprus.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 12thConclusions.)1. The Foreign Secretary said that the recent meeting of the ministerial Council of the Baghdad Pact at Ankara had been very satisfactory. The Pakistan Prime Minister had made only a passingreference to the problem of Kashmir, and the Iraqi representative had not pressed for any early initiative to resolve the Arab-Israeldispute. General satisfaction had been expressed with the UnitedStates offer of an additional $10 millions of economic assistance andno request had been made for further financial support from thiscountry. During the meeting the union of Egypt and Syria hadbeen announced. The Council had accepted his view that the western countries, while refraining from any public condemnation of this action by two Arab States, should seek to foster closer co-operationbetween Iraq, Jordan and Saudi Arabia in order to provide analternative focal point for the political aspirations of the people of Syria, who were probably concerned at the prospect of Egyptiandomination.The most encouraging feature of the meeting had been the unanimous agreement of all the member countries that the nextMinisterial meeting of the Council should be held in London in July.This decision was a welcome indication of improvement in thestanding of the United Kingdom in the Middle East.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.*2. The Foreign Secretary said that, during his recent discussions in Ankara, the Turkish Government had sought to make their acceptance of our proposed statement of policy conditional on three stipulations first, that the Turkish community in Cyprus shouldbe given a right of veto on the interim constitutional developmentof the Island; second, that we should incorporate in a formal agreement our undertaking that the right of self-determination wouldbe accorded to the Turkish, equally with the Greek, cypriot community; and, third, that Turkey (and Greece, if necessary) shouldbe granted a military base in Cyprus forthwith. He had endeavoured,with the Cabinefs approval, to meet these stipulations as far aspossible, particularly by offering to convene a tripartite conference to consider the strategic requirements of the Turkish and GreekGovernments in Cyprus. As a result, although we had not securedTurkish endorsement of our proposals, we had avoided a breach withthe Turkish Government, and it was important, particularly in viewof the extent to which the Governor of Cyprus was dependent on theTurkish Cypriot security police for the maintenance of law andorder in the Island, that we should not now appear to withdraw fromthe position which he had established in Ankara. This consideration should govern the next stage in the negotiations, in which it wouldbe necessary to present our new proposals to the Greek Government.On balance, it would be advisable that he should himself visit Athensfor this purpose and, while making it clear that we could not acceptEnosis and were prepared to contemplate partition only in the last resort, should emphasise that our proposals had been devised as a means of preserving the unity of the Island and providing for itsconstitutional development under British rule for a period of yearsand that there was a reasonable hope that a settlement of this kind would not necessarily result in the eventual partition of the Islandprovided that the Turkish Government could be given satisfactoryguarantees of their strategic requirements.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that H.M. Ambassadorsat Athens and Ankara felt unable to entertain any great hope thata visit by the Foreign Secretary to Athens would prove fruitful.

Greek Government were unlikely to accept our new proposals, whilethe Turkish Government would be liable to suspect that we were now preparing to retract to some extent the assurances which they regarded the Foreign Secretary as having provided during his recent discussions in Ankara. The Governor of Cyprus, who had originally been willing to accompany the Foreign Secretary on his projectedvisit to Athens, had now expressed doubts about the wisdom of thiscourse on the ground that the latest reports from Ankara indicated that a fresh outbreak of Turkish violence might be expected in cyprus. He felt that the Government were now compelled toabandon the initiative and that, if it was impossible to revert simply to the maintenance of the existing position, we should at leastconcede no more than discussions on the possible establishment ofmilitary bases in Cyprus with the intention of resisting the Turkishclaims as far as possible during those discussions.It was agreed, however, that, in spite of the uncertainty that anymission to Athens would be successful and the risk that discussions with the Greek Government would provoke a fresh outburst of turkish violence in Cyprus, it was desirable, for both domestic and international political reasons, that we should be seen to offer to theGreek Government the same opportunity of personal discussion ofour proposals with the Foreign Secretary as had recently beenafforded to the Turkish Government in Ankara. On a balance of the considerations, therefore, the Foreign Secretary should proceed to athens, where he might be joined by the Governor of Cyprus. Itwould be desirable, however, that he should first inform the TurkishPrime Minister, in a personal message, that his visit to Athenswould be undertaken for the sole purpose of informing the GreekGovernment of our proposals and should not be interpreted as implying that we were in any way seeking to retract any of the assurances which he had recently given to the Turkish Government.In further discussion it was suggested that, if the GreekGovernment appeared to acquiesce, however reluctantly, in our proposals, these might then be announced in Parliament forthwith.But, if the Greek attitude remained completely intransigent, it would clearly be impossible to proceed with those elements in our plan which provided for the termination of the state of emergency in cyprus and the institution of discussions on constitutional development. Inthat case we should be compelled to insist that an interval must elapse, during which tranquillity must be restored in the Island, before we could contemplate any further progress towards a solution of theproblem. At the same time we might well publish our proposals asan indication of the basis on which we should have been preparedto collaborate with the Greek and Turkish communities in thedevelopment of the Island if their co-operation had been forthcoming.Thereafter it would be necessary for us to continue to enforce ourauthority in Cyprus and, in particular, to be prepared to deal with a revival of terrorism by Eoka. The military forces in the Island should suffice for this purpose, provided that the authorities could continueto rely on the co-operation of the Turkish security police.The Cabinet &apos;(1) Agreed, in principle, that the Foreign Secretary, possiblyaccompanied by the Governor of Cyprus, should visitAthens in the near future in order to inform the GreekGovernment of our new proposals for dealing with thesituation in Cyprus.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, before his departure, to informthe Turkish Prime Minister that his visit to Athens shouldnot be interpreted as implying that we were.seeking in anyway to retract the assurances which he had given to theTurkish Government during the recent discussions inAnkara.
Soviet Union.Letter to Headsof Government.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 10thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet had before them a further draft of the reply from the Prime Minister to Mr. Bulganin&apos;s letter of 9th January whichthe Foreign Secretary had prepared in the light of his discussions withthe United States Secretary of State in Ankara (C.R.O. telegrams toAustralia, Track Nos. 234 and 235) and of the Prime Minister^comments on this draft (C.R.O. telegram from Australia, TrackNo. 136).In discussion some concern was expressed lest the western countries, by undue insistence on the need for adequate preparationsbefore a meeting of Heads of Government was held, might allow theSoviet leaders to obtain the propaganda advantage of havingvolunteered an initiative which the free world was seeking to rebuff.In view of the growing volume of public opinion throughout the world in favour of a meeting of Heads of Government, it might be inadvisable to reiterate conditions which might eventually have to be abandoned. An early meeting, even if it did not produce immediateresults, might be preferable to an indefinite delay. On the other hand it was not unreasonable that the Western countries should initiallyspecify the conditions which, in their view, must be satisfied if such ameeting was to produce positive results. Moreover, we must seek to ensure a continuing unity of purpose with the United StatesGovernment, who were reluctant to commit themselves to a meetingof Heads of Government unless its success could be assured. the text of the draft reply might, however, be made slightly moreconciliatory in tone, and certain amendments were approved for thispurpose.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to submit to the Prime minister the proposed further amendments to the draft reply toMr. Bulganin which had been suggested in their discussion and to arrange for the United States Secretary of State tobe informed simultaneously of these amendments.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, subject to the approval of thePrime Minister and the concurrence of the United states secretary of State, to arrange for the draft reply, asamended in their discussion, to be circulated to the north atlantic Council.government expenditure.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 8thConclusions,Minute 2.)*4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (58) 29) about the National health service.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had discussed with the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance and theMinister of Health the detailed arrangements for giving effect to the cabinet&apos;s recent decision to increase the National Health service contribution by 8d. In agreement with his colleagues he now recommended that the contribution in respect of women and juvenilesshould be increased by 6d. and Ad. respectively; that the adult maleemployee&apos;s contribution should be increased by 6d., the woman&apos;contribution by 4d., and the juvenile&apos;s by 2d., the employeescontribution being increased by 2d. in each case; and that thecontributions of self-employed and non-employed persons should beincreased by the same amount as the contribution of the employee.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.It was suggested that, if the increase in the contribution of self-employed and non-employed persons was limited to the increase inthe contribution of the employee, this would represent a departure from earlier practice whereby individuals in these categories had been required to pay the contribution in full.  On the other hand the case* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
Economic 5.   The Cabinet were informed that, in January, the gold andSituation. dollar reserves had risen by $131 millions, accompanied by a United(Previous Kingdom surplus of  10-$- millions with the European PaymentsReference: Union; that the visible trade deficit was not expected to exceed someC.C. (57) 73rd  35 millions; and that the number of unemployed persons had risenConclusions,      by 60,000.Minute 3.) In discussion it was pointed out that, while this was a favourableseason for sterling, the increase in the reserves gave grounds for someencouragement. Although the increase in unemployment might be interpreted as an indication of a slight reduction in the inflationary pressure, the total number of unemployed persons still constitutedonly 1 - 8 per cent, of the employed population.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Commercial 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePolicy. Paymaster-General (C. (58) 27) on the progress of the negotiations for european Free   the establishment of a European Free Trade Area.Trade Area.(Previous The Paymaster-General said that several major problems had reference:      still to be solved.   First, it would be necessary to devise someC.C. (58) 5th     arrangements for trade in agricultural products which would be conclusions,    compatible  both  with  the  Governmenfs  commitments  to  the minute 5.)       Commonwealth and to the domestic farming industry and with thedesire of European countries to secure increased opportunities in theUnited Kingdom market for their exports of foodstuffs in return forthe opening of their own markets to United Kingdom industrialgoods.   Second, we should need to find some means of reconcilingour insistence that members of the Free Trade Area should not be obliged to accept a common external tariff and a common commercial policy with the fact that the Treaty of Rome imposed such obligationson the members of the European Economic Community.  Third, thehostile attitude of all sections of French opinion to the Free trade area as an economic concept had still to be surmounted.He was not unhopeful of securing agreement to our original proposals, since all the countries concerned had a strong politicalincentive to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion.Moreover, it would be dangerous to underestimate the potentialfor a moderate concession to these classes had already been conceded in principle in respect of the increases in the contribution under theNational Insurance Acts, 1954 and 1957. On balance, therefore, itwas appropriate that the increase to be imposed on self-employed and non-employed persons should be limited to the increase imposed onemployed contributors.The Cabinet were informed that, if the increase in the contribution was to take effect on 1st July, it would be necessary forthe administrative preparations to be begun without delay, in anticipation of the enactment of the legislation involved.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (58) 29.(2) Invited the Minister of Health to arrange forthwith for the drafting of the necessary legislation, on the assumptionthat the Ways and Means Resolution on which the bill would be founded would be tabled concurrently with thepublication of the Vote on Account.(3) Invited the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance toput in hand forthwith the necessary administrative arrangements for giving effect to the increase in theNational Health Service contribution.
C.C. 14 (58)damage to our interests if the negotiations were allowed to fail. Butthe difficulties were substantial, and we should be subjected to strong pressure to make concessions in order to overcome them.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Governments commitments to the domestic farming industry would probably preclude any substantial concessions on agricultural policy. If it eventually proved necessary to contemplatesome relatively minor modifications in this respect, it would be important to allow adequate time for the interests concerned, bothin this country and in the Commonwealth, to be informed of our intentions.(b) In particular, we must be prepared to decide how far wewould yield to the combined pressure which the Commonwealth and european Governments might exert for some curtailment of ourdomestic agricultural price support system.(c) The most effective means of securing some abatement of theFrench opposition to the Free Trade Area might be to bring pressure to bear on France through her partners in the European economic community, whose interests in securing a generally low tariff level,particularly on basic materials, coincided with our own.The Home Secretary, summing up the discussion, said that, inview of the impact of the Free Trade Area negotiations on certainsensitive aspects of domestic policy, the Paymaster-General should keep the Cabinet fully informed of developments and of his proposalsfor solving the main outstanding problems.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C. (58) 27.(2) Invited the Paymaster-General to make a further report,within the next few weeks, on the nature and timing of the concessions which might be required if the currentdifficulties in the negotiations for the establishment of a european Free Trade Area were to be overcome.agricultural policy.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 77thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture(C. (58) 28) on the proposal to introduce legislation amending the agriculture Acts and the Agricultural Holdings Acts.The Minister of Agriculture said that the announcement of theGovernments decision to amend these Acts had excited a considerableamount of criticism. But there was evidence that the farming community as a whole was less hostile to the proposals than might appear from the attitude of the principal organisations concerned.Moreover, he was examining the possibility of forestalling the criticism that the Bill would favour the landlord as against the tenantfarmer by incorporating in it certain provisions designed to benefit the tenant. In these circumstances he recommended that theGovernment should proceed with the proposed legislation,particularly since the recommendations of the Committee on administrative Tribunals and Enquiries regarding the functions ofthe County Agricultural Executive Committees and the jurisdiction of agricultural tribunals would in any case entail substantialamendment of Part II of the Agriculture Act, 1947.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, while he was ingeneral agreement with this conclusion, the proposal to amend thelaw governing the bequest of, and succession to, agriculturaltenancies in Scotland was being energetically resisted by Scottishfarmers.   While the present position was admittedly indefensible,
he would wish to have a further opportunity of consulting theGovernments Scottish supporters before coming to a final decisionon the best method of dealing with this matter.The Cabinet--(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to consultfurther with the Governments Scottish supportersregarding the proposal to amend the law governing thebequest of, and succession to, agricultural tenancies inScotland.(2) Agreed that, subject to Conclusion (1) above, legislation toamend the Agriculture Acts and the agricultural holdings Acts should be introduced at an early date.(3) Took note that the Home Secretary would consider further the implications for the legislative programme of theintroduction of this Bill.(4) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Scotland, to circulate, for the guidance of Government spokesmen, a memorandum explaining the contents of the Bill.Aircraft 8.

The Minister of Supply recommended that the order should beplaced with the Hawker-Bristol consortium in order to promote there organisation of the aircraft industry and that, in any event, a finaldecision should not be taken until the outcome of recent negotiations between the Hawker-Bristol consortium and Pan-American Airwayswas known.In discussion it was agreed that, in view of the important issues involved in the choice between the competing designs, a decision should be deferred until the Minister of Civil Aviation was able to be present and it was known, probably within the next fortnight,whether Pan-American Airways proposed to place an order for either of these British aircraft.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to give further consideration, at a subsequent meeting,to the B.E.A. requirement for new jet aircraft.(2) Invited the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of transport and Civil Aviation (Mr. Neave) to indicate, in reply to parliamentary Questions on the following day, that theMinister of Civil Aviation would make a statement on thissubject as soon as possible.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,4th February, 1958.
