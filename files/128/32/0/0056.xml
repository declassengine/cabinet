*MiddIe East(previous reference :C.C. (58) 55thConclusions.)The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that, since their discussion earlier that evening, he had spoken to President Eisenhowerby telephone. The United States Government appeared to havedecided to land forces in the Lebanon within the next twenty-four hours. They were prepared to conduct this operation alone, and theextent to which they would be willing to co-operate with us in restoring the position in Iraq and Jordan would not be materially affected bythe degree of our participation in the Lebanon operation. But it remained uncertain how far they would be prepared to commit themselves to any further action after the Lebanon operation was completed. He had impressed on the President that an operationconfined to the Lebanon would entail more substantial risks to ourselves than to the United States and that we should regard it ashardly justified unless it was conceived as an element in a jointendeavour by the United States and the United Kingdom to restorepolitical stability throughout the Middle East. The President had appeared to be sympathetic to this concept and had, indeed, indicated that the proposed intervention in the Lebanon might be merely thefirst stage in a larger operation. But he had also made it clear that thedecision to launch such a larger operation would exceed the limits of his constitutional authority and that, for immediate purposes, hecould not undertake to accept any commitment beyond the intervention in the Lebanon.In discussion it was agreed that the balance of advantage lay in accepting the United States offer to release us from contributing to the lebanon operation, provided that the United States Government didnot regard this as absolving them from co-operating actively with usin restoring the situation in Iraq and Jordan. It would be desirablethat, for this purpose, the Prime Minister should reinforce histelephone conversation with President Eisenhower by a telegram,emphasising once again that we regarded the problem as no longerlimited to the Lebanon but as extending throughout the whole of theMiddle East and that we looked to the United States to give us moral and material assistance in pursuing a policy which would match this situation. In particular, we must seek to obtain from the UnitedStates a firm undertaking to support us in sustaining King Hussein in jordan. The King had now asked for a specific assurance that boththe United States and the United Kingdom would provide him with military assistance if he judged that it was required in order to preserve the integrity and independence of Jordan. It would be desirable that,in concert with the United States, we should warn him forthwith thatany intervention would be simpler and more effective if it took effectwhile public order could still be maintained in Jordan and theGovernment retained control over the airfields. Moreover, on theassumption that a British contingent was not included in the operation in the Lebanon, the Government were liable to be criticised by publicopinion in this country if they were not seen to be acting as promptly toassist other friendly Governments in the Middle East. From every point of view, therefore, it would be advantageous if King Husseinwould issue without delay his formal appeal to the United States and ourselves; and we should endeavour to ensure that the United StatesGovernment would support us in recommending this course of actionto him.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would send a further message to President Eisenhower defining our policy towardsthe Lebanon in the light of the critical situation in the Middle
qjj $jEast and emphasising the importance of ensuring adequatesupport for King Hussein of Jordan as a necessarycomplement of the proposed intervention by United states forces in the Lebanon.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th July, 1958.
