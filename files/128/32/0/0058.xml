Middle East.(previous reference :CC. (58) 57thConclusions.)CC. 58 (58)*1. The Prime Minister reported to the Cabinet the reply whichhad been received from the United States Government to his request for an assurance that we could rely on their co-operation if it became necessary to send military assistance to King Hussein of Jordan.The United States Secretary of State was primarily concerned withthe situation in Iraq and was doubtful whether intervention in Jordanwould be wise until we had clarified its purpose and scope and were satisfied that its result would be to strengthen, rather than to weaken,the position of King Hussein. He would therefore welcome anopportunity to discuss these issues personally with the foreign secretary, in the hope that it would be possible to agree on the most appropriate course of action and to concert instructions for the joint planning, both military and political, of future policy in the middle east. In the meantime, the United States Government had sent an interim reply to King Hussein, assuring him of their desire to help him to preserve the independence of his country.The Chiefs of Staff had examined the feasibility of a UnitedKingdom intervention in lordan and plans had now been completedfor moving two battalion groups of the Parachute Brigade to Ammanand for reinforcing them, if necessary, with the 1st Guards Brigade.Our legal right to deploy troops in Jordan in present circumstances could not be questioned. The force which we envisaged was not sufficient to infringe the Charter of the United Nations by constituting a threat to the integrity and independence of any third State, whilethe employment of British troops to assist the Government of Jordanto maintain internal law and order was a matter wholly within the domestic jurisdiction of that Government. But we must also recognise the possibility that, before the Government of Jordan could inviteour assistance for this purpose, they might become the victims of aggression. It would be advisable therefore that their request forassistance should be based initially on the need to preserve law andorder but should also be justified by reference to the imminence of a threat to the independence and integrity of Jordan. If this threat wasnot realised, our acceptance of the invitation would not be an infringement of international law, while, if an insurrection broke outin circumstances in which the Government of Jordan were entitled touse force in self-defence, we should be similarly entitled, under the charter of the United Nations, to use force in assisting them.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be useful if the Foreign Secretary and the United States Secretary of Statecould meet to discuss the issues which confronted the twoGovernments. This should be arranged as a matter of great urgency.It was uncertain how long the Government of Jordan could withstandthe pressure to which they were subject; nor could it be assumed thatthe United States force which had landed in the Lebanon would necessarily remain there for any considerable length of time. If wewere to ensure the participation of the United States Government ina comprehensive attempt to retrieve the situation in the Middle East,we should seek to agree with them, as rapidly as possible, a favourablereply to the request of King Hussein for an assurance that our twoGovernments would provide him with military assistance if he regarded the integrity and independence of Jordan as in danger.Some doubts were expressed, however, about the legal ground of our intervention in Jordan. It was open to question how far itwould be expedient to base our action on the entitlement of aGovernment to request the military assistance of a friendly countryin order to maintain internal law and order. Public opinion wouldbe liable to pay less consideration to the formal propriety of such acourse than to the fact that, by apparent contrast with the action ofthe United States in the Lebanon, we should be intervening in the affairs of another country without the authority of the United Nations.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
Moreover an appeal for assistance based on the need to maintain lawand order in Jordan was not likely to elicit so favourable a response from the United States Government as an appeal based on the rightof self-defence against aggression. The General Assembly of theUnited Nations had adopted, in 1950, a resolution declaring thatincitement to disaffection within the territory of another Powerconstituted an act of aggression; and although, in the absence ofevidence about the extent of subversion in Jordan, it might be unwise to base our intervention solely on the need to assist the Governmentof Jordan in measures of self-defence, we must be prepared to justifyit by reference to the indirect aggression which was undoubtedly beingperpetrated against Jordan. The precise wording which King Husseinshould be advised to employ if he found it necessary to appeal forassistance from the United States and ourselves would need to be examined further in the light of these considerations; and the foreign secretary should seek to agree with the United States government formula which, while preserving the legality of our action, would allow us the maximum freedom in selecting the ground of our intervention.From the military point of view, intervention on the scaleenvisaged should be operationally feasible. The Government of israel had not yet agreed to grant us permission to over-fly their territory; but they were unlikely to offer serious objection in presentcircumstances. Thereafter the proposed force should suffice to securethe limited objectives of holding the airfield at Amman, protectingKing Hussein and his Government and possibly providing abridgehead through which a more extensive operation could, ifnecessary, be mounted. On the other hand, the safety of the troops,who would be only lightly armed, would depend on local good willand co-operation. If they encountered opposition from the armoured units of the Jordanian Army it would be useless to despatchfurther infantry reinforcements; and, although it should be possibleto arrange for their evacuation if necessary, this would be a graveblow to our prestige. It was very desirable, therefore, that the UnitedStates Government should agree to provide us with material support from the outset, particularly in the form of large troop-carryingaircraft and, if possible, heavier armaments and equipment. Until we knew how far they were prepared to commit themselves in this respectit would be unwise to give any firm or precise undertaking to king hussein about the extent of the military assistance which we could give him.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theForeign Secretary, accompanied by the Chief of the Defence Staff,should proceed forthwith to Washington for discussion with theUnited States Secretary of State. His objective should be to secure an undertaking from the United States Government that they wouldgive us, in addition to political endorsement, the maximum of materialsupport in providing military assistance to King Hussein and wouldalso collaborate with us in planning a joint policy to retrieve thesituation in the Middle East. Pending the outcome of these discussions, an interim message should be sent to King Husseinemphasising that the Foreign Secretary&apos;s visit to Washington was evidence of our desire to give him all practicable help.The Cabinet-CD Invited the Foreign Secretary, in the course of his forthcoming discussion with the United States Secretary of State, to be guided by the considerations indicated by the PrimeMinister.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for King Hussein of jordan to be informed that Her Majesty&apos;s governmenth oped that, in the light of these discussions, they wouldbe able to reply within the next 48 hours to his request for an assurance that the United Kingdom and the United
Cyprus.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 48thConclusions,Minute 2.)*2. The Colonial Secretary said that the Greek terroristorganisation in Cyprus (EOKA) was known to be planning a furthercampaign of violence. The Governor of Cyprus had requestedauthority to make widespread arrests of suspected members of this organisation and, at the same time, to proscribe the Turkishterrorist organisation (T.N.T.) and to arrest a smaller number of turkish Cypriots suspected of belonging to it. In principle it was right that Greek and Turkish terrorist organisations should receiveimpartial treatment; but it might be unwise, in view of the presentsituation in the Middle East, to take action which might alienateTurkish and Moslem sentiment or provoke further Turkish disordersin Cyprus at a time when the number of British troops available for internal security duties might have to be reduced.In discussion it was suggested that it would nevertheless be prudent to attempt to forestall further disorders by arresting thesuspected trouble-makers, especially since H.M. Ambassador atAnkara had advised that the Governors proposal was unlikely to cause widespread resentment in Turkey. The Governor might beinvited to reconsider the action which he had in mind; but, if he remained convinced of its necessity, the proposed arrest of the TurkishCypriots, which did not depend on the proscription of T.N.T., shouldbe carried out in addition to the arrest of the Greek Cypriot suspects.The proscription of T.N.T. might be more offensive to Turkishsentiment and should be deferred for the time being.The Cabinet Agreed that the Colonial Secretary should have discretion,if he judged it necessary, to authorise the Governor of cyprus to arrest suspected members of the Greek and turkish terrorist organisations in Cyprus on the under-standing that the proposed proscription of the Turkishorganisation would be deferred for a time.Cabinet Office, SWA,16th July, 1958.States would provide him with military assistance to preserve the integrity and independence of Jordan if heappealed to them for that purpose.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the attorney-General, to inform H.M. Ambassador atAmman of the terms in which King Hussein would most appropriately frame a request for such assistance shouldhe find it necessary to do so before the forthcoming discussions between the Foreign Secretary and the UnitedStates Secretary of State were complete.
