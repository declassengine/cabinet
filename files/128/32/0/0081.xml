IT-commercial policy.Free trade area.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 80thConclusions,Minute 8.)The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Germany.Situation inBerlin.(previous reference :C.C. (57) 60thConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that it was not certain how far the Soviet Government intended to implement the recent statement by Mr. Khrushchev, the Soviet Prime Minister, that they were considering the possibility of evacuating the Soviet sector of berlin and transferring responsibility for its administration to the east german Government. If they in fact adopted this policy, we shouldbe faced with a choice between abandoning Berlin or instituting an air lift in order to maintain supplies to the Western sectors or coming to some arrangement with the East German Government which would permit transport by road and rail to continue. The last course wouldbe the most realistic; but our best chance of achieving a solution onthese lines would lie in making it clear that we should maintain our right of access to the Western sectors of Berlin and were prepared, ifnecessary, to institute an air lift for this purpose.In discussion, it was suggested that the objective of Soviet policy was to undermine the position of the Western Powers by subjectingthem to pressure at various strategic areas of the world in turn. Wehad recently encountered, and resisted, such pressure in the middle east and the Far East. We should not now yield to it by regardingthe threatened action by the Soviet Government as compelling us torecognise the East German regime; nor should we create theimpression, by prematurely organising an air lift to Berlin, that wewere ready to surrender our right to convey supplies to the western sectors by normal means.i. The Paymaster-General said that the French Governmenthad now made it clear that they were not prepared to participate ina Free Trade Area on the basis which we had proposed. our objective henceforward must, therefore, be twofold. Our immediatepurpose must be to seek to prevent the emergence of a newdiscriminatory bloc in Europe on 1st January, 1959, when theprovisions of the Treaty of Rome would take effect. Thereafter, wemust seek to devise some means of establishing a Free Trade area which would be acceptable to the other members of the Six Powersand would provide, for a period, a measure of special protection for french interests. As a first step, formal representations would bemade to the Six Powers, through the machinery of&quot; the organisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.), in an endeavourto secure their agreement to extend to all members of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade the tariff concessions which theywere due to make to one another on 1st January, 1959, and to enablethe other countries represented on the Inter-governmental Committeeto benefit from the relaxation of quotas which was also envisagedfor that date. If the French Government were prepared to endorseaction of this kind, we should succeed in preventing the establishmentof a new area of discrimination within Europe; we should have somehope of saving the other members of the Inter-governmental committee from being gradually drawn into the Common Marketestablished by the Six Powers; and we should gain an interval inwhich to examine the best means of providing such special treatment for France as might enable the French Government subsequently toparticipate in a Free Trade Area. If, however, the FrenchGovernment refused to endorse an interim arrangement of the kind which he had described, they would be in formal breach of theO.E.E.C. Convention and a new and serious situation would arise.
Disarmament.Nuclear Tests.(previous reference:CC. (58) 80thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that, in the conference betweenthe United States, the Soviet Union and ourselves about thepossibility of suspending nuclear tests, the United States delegation were anxious to ensure that any agreement on the suspension of testswould be conditional both on the establishment of an organisation to control the execution of the agreement itself and on the adoptionof measures for progressive disarmament in general. Public opinion in this country would be unlikely to endorse a stipulation that the suspension of tests should be dependent upon progress towardsdisarmament as a whole; but the connection between a suspension of tests and a system of supervision would be understood and accepted.We were therefore seeking to concentrate discussion primarily onthis latter point and to compel the Soviet delegation to declarewhether they shared our view that the validity of an agreement forthe suspension of nuclear tests should be dependent on theestablishment of an organisation of inspection and control. It was unlikely, on balance, that they would be prepared to accept thisstipulation.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement.Twiddle East.Sudan.(previous reference :CC (58) 80thConclusions,Minute 7.)4. The Foreign Secretary said that, as a result of a coup d&apos;etatin the Sudan on the previous day, the existing regime had beenoverthrown and a military administration had assumed power. Itwas unlikely that this action had been initially inspired by the united arab Republic (U.A.R.). But there was some risk that some of theofficers concerned might be disposed to seek the support of theU.A.R., and it was therefore desirable that we should consider as rapidly as possible our policy towards the new Government and our attitude to any request for assistance which they might make to us.In discussion, it was emphasised that the continuance of ourstaging and over-flying rights in the Sudan was essential. Arrange-ments had been made to enable flights to continue for the next fewdays; but, in order to preserve our rights, it would probably benecessary to recognise the new Government in the very nearfuture. The precise form of such recognition would need furtherconsideration in the light of the fact that the coup d&apos;etat had not onlyOverthrown the previous Government but had also suspended theConstitution.On the other hand, it would be relatively easy for the east german Government to disorganise road and rail transport, whereasan air lift would be immune from interruption except by act of warand therefore constituted our best means of compelling the east german authorities to come to terms with us. It would be important,however, that, in any measures of this kind that we mightadopt, we should not allow the Federal Government to evade their responsibilities. Western Germany was now a strong and prosperouscommunity; and, although the Federal Government had no legalrights of access to Berlin, they must be prepared to contribute toany action taken by the Western Powers to secure the maintenanceof supplies to the city.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to resume their discussion on a subsequent occasion.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theForeign Secretary, to arrange for an examination of alternative means of maintaining supplies to the &quot;western sectors of Berlin if the existing arrangements wereinterrupted.
The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to give further considerationto the manner in which we should recognise the new regime in the Sudan in order to preserve our staging andoverflying rights in Sudanese territory.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary and the President of the Board ofTrade, to arrange for consideration to be given, as amatter of urgency, to the attitude which should be adopted towards any request for assistance which the new regimemight address to us.Parliament. 5.   jhe Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Home Secretary said that it would be convenient if a debate could be held on 24th November on the Central African FederationConstitution and the Rhodesia and Nyasaland Federation Order. Itmight be desirable, however, to consider deferring this debate until27th November in the light of the discussions which the Common-wealth Secretary and the Colonial Secretary were to have with thePrime Minister of the Federation.There was also to be a debate on a Motion to take note of theReport of the Committee on Homosexual Offences andProstitution. It would be necessary to oppose any proposal that the recommendations in Part II of the Report, dealing withhomosexuality, should be accepted; but consideration might begiven, in the light of the debate, to the introduction of a Bill to makestreet prostitution an offence and to increase the penalties forprostitution and for living on the immoral earnings of women.There was to be a debate in the House of Lords on the immigration of coloured citizens of the Commonwealth and alliedsubjects. No indication should be given that the Governmentfavoured a Bill empowering the Courts to order the deportation of commonwealth citizens until the Cabinet had had an opportunityto discuss this question in more detail.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of these statements.LocalGovernmentReform.General Grant.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 44thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Minister of Housing said that he had arranged to present to the House of Commons early in the following week an Orderprescribing the aggregate amount, and the formula for distribution,of the general grant payable to local authorities under the LocalGovernment Act, 1958. The detailed provisions of the Order hadbeen negotiated with the local authorities and approved by theChancellor of the Exchequer. The Act required that a White paper should be laid before Parliament, discussing the factors involved inthe determination contained in the Order. He therefore proposed,subject to the approval of the Cabinet, to circulate forthwith a draftof the White Paper, for any comment which his colleagues might wish to offer.The Secretary of Stale for Scotland proposed a similar arrangement as regards the White Paper on the general grant to scottish local authorities.
international court of.Justice.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 54thConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (58) 233) proposing the withdrawal of a reservationwhich we had attached to our acceptance of the compulsoryjurisdiction of the International Court of Justice excepting &quot; disputesrelating to any question which in the opinion of the Government ofthe United Kingdom affected the national, security of the UnitedKingdom or of any of its dependent territories.&quot;The Foreign Secretary said that this reservation had been enteredin April, 1957, in order to anticipate an expected attempt by japan to challenge us before the International Court on the charge that the holding of nuclear tests in the central Pacific amounted to a violation of the principle of the freedom of the seas. It was probable, however,that the Court would shortly declare such reservations to be invalid.Moreover, the United States were thought to be about to withdrawa similar reservation excepting from the jurisdiction of the Courtmatters which were within the domestic jurisdiction of the UnitedStates &quot; as determined by the United States.&quot; This would thereforebe an appropriate moment at which to withdraw our own reservation.By doing so we should be in a stronger position to oppose, before theCourt, attempts by other nations (e.g., Iceland, in the current disputeabout fishery limits) to act as judges in their own cause.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) If the reservation was withdrawn, we could hardlycontemplate the resumption of nuclear tests without entering afurther reservation, which would need to relate specifically to suchtests. This could be done at any time and at short notice. It wouldbe politically impracticable to substitute a specific reservation at thepresent time, even if it was limited by reference to circumstances inwhich there was no international agreement on the suspension of tests. If it subsequently became necessary to enter such a reservation,we should have to disregard the objections which we ourselves had raised to the practice of other countries in arbitrarily amending fromtime to time the limits within which they were prepared to accept thejurisdiction of the International Court.(b) The withdrawal of the existing reservation was not likely to embarrass us in relation to outstanding disputes about sovereignty in certain colonial territories. The island of Kamaran was a possible exception; but the Government of the Yemen would not be able to challenge us on this issue before the Court without accepting theCourfs jurisdiction and therefore exposing themselves to a counter-action in connection with the frontier between the Yemen and the aden Protectorates.The Cabinet Approved the proposal in C. (58) 233.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Housing:  (i) to circulate the draft White Papers on the general grant to local authorities in Scotland and in England andWales respectively; and(ii) to submit the final versions of these White Papers tothe Home Secretary, for approval on behalf of theCabinet.
The Prime Minister, in summing up the discussion, said that theFederation could make a very important contribution to themaintenance of our position in central Africa and that we should seek to avoid, as far as possible, any action which might seriously prejudice its interests. If it proved impossible to persuade Sir roy welensky to acquiesce in the course proposed in C. (58) 231, it mightbe necessary for the Cabinet to reconsider the issues involved.1      Federation of rhodesia and(previous reference:C.C. (58) 7thConclusions,Minute 2.)NorthernRhodesiaConstitution.8. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the colonial secretary (C. (58) 231) and the Commonwealth Secretary (C. (58) 232)regarding the forthcoming discussions with the Prime Minister ofthe Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Sir Roy Welensky, on our proposals for changes in the Constitution of Northern Rhodesia.The Colonial Secretary said that these proposals, which had been published in a White Paper (Cmnd. 530) in September, had been communicated to the Federal Government, who had expresseddissatisfaction with them in various respects. It could be assumed that the purpose of Sir Roy Welensky&apos;s impending visit was to urgeeither that no change should be made in the Northern RhodesiaConstitution before the review of the Federal Constitution which wasto take place in 1960 or that the present proposals should be significantly amended in a manner disadvantageous to Africans. but unless Sir Roy Welensky could advance some compelling newargument in support of his contention, it would be desirable to resist any substantial amendment to our proposals, which held a fair balance between the various interests involved in Northern Rhodesia.We might, however, offer to publish a supplementary despatchclarifying our views on certain matters raised by the Federal Partyin Northern Rhodesia; and we might consider withdrawing ourstipulation that candidates for the Legislative Council in certain special constituencies must obtain the approval of two-thirds of theChiefs in their constituency before they could stand for election. Thelatter provision, however, offered a valuable means of easing the transition from traditional African habits to the novel procedures of democracy; and it also provided some safeguard against the election of unsatisfactory African representatives. We should not acquiesce in a change which might diminish the authority of the Chiefs unless we were satisfied that it had the approval of the authorities inNorthern Rhodesia who were responsible for maintaining law andorder.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, while he supported theseproposals for the immediate purpose of the forthcoming discussions with Sir Roy Welensky, it would shortly be necessary to re-examinethe whole question of the future of the Federation, with particular reference to the review of the Constitution which was to take placein 1960. It would not be easy, in this wider context, to reconcile thedischarge of our responsibilities to the Africans in the northern territories with the policy of promoting the constitutional advance ofthe Federation to a point at which it could attain sovereign status and full membership of the Commonwealth.In discussion it was suggested that Sir Roy Welensky mightexpress strong dissatisfaction with our unwillingness either to delegatea greater measure of responsibility to Northern Rhodesia, or to create a post of Chief Minister in the Northern Rhodesia Government. Ingeneral, he might well urge us to modify our proposals more radicallythan we should consider desirable.
5HThe Cabinet-CD Approved the proposals in C. (58) 231 and 232.(2) Took note that the Commonwealth Secretary would submit to the. Colonial Policy Committee in due course proposals regarding our future policy towards the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland.9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (58) 235) on relations between ghana and Guinea.The Commonwealth Secretary said that there was reason tobelieve that the Prime Minister of Ghana, Dr. Nkrumah, wasdiscussing with the Prime Minister of Guinea, M. Sekou Toure, some form of close association between Ghana and Guinea. The precisenature of this association was not known; but it might take theform of a federation of the two States or even the complete absorption of Guinea within Ghana. Any proposal of this nature would be liable to raise serious issues of principle as regards Ghana&apos;s membership of the Commonwealth; and Dr. Nkrumah had therefore been warned that the other members of the Commonwealth mightreact adversely to Ghana&apos;s association with a foreign country whichhad no historical or cultural connections with the United kingdom or any other Commonwealth country.In discussion it was emphasised that any association betweenGhana and Guinea at a time when the latter country had elected tobecome independent of France would be viewed with suspicion by theFrench Government and would be liable to embarrass us in ourrelations with them. Moreover, Guinea was economically a poor andbackward country; and we should not allow M. Sekou Toure to suppose that, by association with Ghana, he could obtain from us theeconomic assistance which he had probably forfeited from France.Nor should we encourage Dr. Nkrumah in his ambition to create a federation of West African States which, under his leadership, mightconstitute a counterpoise to Nigeria after that country attainedindependence in 1960. Other African territories were alreadyshowing signs of alarm and resentment at this project.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that dr. Nkrumah would probably adhere to his intention to declareGhana, in due course, a republic within the Commonwealth. If he wished thereafter to develop the concept of a closer association between Ghana and Guinea, the matter could be further considered at that juncture. But in terms of Commonwealth membership itwould be inappropriate that this project should be pursued whileGhana maintained its present form of allegiance to the Crown. Itmight be helpful if he sent a personal message to Dr. Nkrumah,advising him to weigh the possible consequences of his proposal withcare before carrying the matter any further.The Cabinet Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to submit to the PrimeMinister the draft of a personal message to the PrimeMinister of Ghana about the implications, in terms of ghana&apos;s membership of the Commonwealth, of his proposalto promote some form of close association between ghana and Guinea.Ghana.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 12thConclusions,Minute 3.)
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,18th November, 1958.Empire Day. 10.   The Commonwealth Secretary said that it now appeared to change of be generally accepted by public opinion that Empire Day would moreName. appropriately be renamed Commonwealth Day.In discussion there was general agreement that this change should be made, without prejudice to the preference of certainColonial territories to retain the title of Empire Day.The Cabinet Approved the proposal that- Empire Day should hence-forward be known as Commonwealth Day.
