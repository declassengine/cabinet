(previous reference :C.C. (58) 28thConclusions,Minute 3)C.C. 36 (58)Cyprus *The Cabinet had before them:  (i) A note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (C. (58) 86) covering a study by officials of a plan for the establishment of a tridominiumin Cyprus, together with the retention of military enclaves by theUnited Kingdom.(ii) A note by the Deputy Secretary of the Cabinet (C. (58) 89)covering a study by officials of an alternative plan, based upon the cession of the Island to Greece following a plebiscite, together withthe retention of military enclaves by both the United Kingdom and turkey.The Cabinet reviewed all the main courses of action which hadbeen suggested as possible solutions of the problem of Cyprus. these were as follows:  (1) We could abandon Cyprus, which was of declining strategic importance. But our prestige throughout the Middle East would be gravely affected if we withdrew from the Island at this criticaljuncture.(2) We could retain our sovereignty over the Island and continueour attempts to eradicate local terrorism by force. This course was recommended, on balance, by the Chiefs of Staff. But there couldbe no certainty that, in the absence of a political settlement, such apolicy would succeed; it would become more difficult to sustain asthe strength of the Army was progressively reduced; and it would place an increasing strain on our relations with Turkey.(3) We could adopt the proposal of the Governor of Cypruswhereby we would retain our sovereignty over the Island for a definedperiod but would also introduce a liberal constitution providing a generous measure of communal autonomy. This proposal mightdeserve further study; but it was unlikely to be acceptable to theGreek and Turkish Governments.(4) We could seek to establish a tridominium on the lines indicated in the memoranda annexed to C. (58) 86. This would bea bold and imaginative gesture; and, even if it failed, it shoulddemonstrate to world opinion our genuine desire to establish peace and order in the Island. But it assumed the wholeheartedco-operation of the Greek and Turkish Governments; and, in theabsence of such co-operation, it might well break down on the criticalissue of internal security.(5) We could adopt the modified form of partition described inthe memoranda annexed to C. (58) 89. This plan, which would assignthe greater part of Cyprus to Greece, might command Greekacquiescence. But it might provoke a strong reaction both from theTurkish community in the Island and from the Turkish Government,who were unlikely to be prepared to abandon their objective of a radical partition of the Island even if they were granted a largerenclave than was suggested in C. (58) 89 and were also guaranteedthe reversion of our own enclaves if we withdrew from the Islandentirely. Moreover, the plan would be likely to be interpreted bythe Governments supporters as a surrender of sovereignty to Greece;and it was open to the grave objection that it would expose ourenclaves, particularly in the Dhekelia-Famagusta area, to pressureand infiltration from terrorist organisations based on adjacent Greekterritory over which we should no longer have any control.(6) Finally we could enforce a radical partition of the Island.This policy would be more acceptable to the Turkish Government;and it would interpose a friendly Turkish population between ourDhekelia-Famagusta enclave and Greek territory. On the otherhand the Greek Government would probably retaliate by withdrawing from the North Atlantic Alliance; and the communal disorderswhich would break out in the Island itself would not only be* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
discreditable to our reputation but might also make it more difficult for us to maintain our position in the enclaves which we should retain.In discussion it was generally agreed that we should now launch a new initiative based on the conception of tridominium. It wasadmittedly doubtful whether this plan would, in the event, prove tobe practicable. It could be argued that the plan for modified partitionwas more realistic, in that it recognised the fact that Cyprus was largely a Greek Island and that, in the view of the Governmenfsmilitary advisers, no negotiated settlement could be expected toendure so long as the Greek terrorist organisation in Cyprus retainedits power. On the other hand the plan for trjdominium offered thegreater prospect of political advantage in that it was the more likely tosecure the support of world opinion. Provided that it incorporatedpracticable arrangements for the maintenance of internal security and assigned to us sole responsibility for the external defence of the island, it represented, on balance, the least objectionable of thevarious courses of action which were open to us.If, however, it proved unacceptable to the Greek and turkish governments it might be necessary to adopt one of the two forms of partition of the Island. On a balance of the considerations involved the modified form of partition might be thought to fail to satisfyeither Turkish aspirations or our own strategic interests; and forthese reasons a radical partition of the Island might be preferable.But no solution by way of partition was likely to commend itselfto public opinion in this country, which might consider that, indefault of an agreed settlement, the Government should continue to administer the Island as a unity and redouble their efforts to crushthe terrorist movement.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, if wewere to adopt the policy of tridominium which the Cabinet clearlyendorsed, we must put forward our proposals with enthusiasm andconviction. We should not allow them to be regarded merely as a tactical manoeuvre but should present them to the world as animaginative scheme based on our desire to give genuine effect to theprinciple of international co-operation. We should seek to mobilisethe maximum international support for the plan and to prevent its being rejected by either the Greek or the Turkish Government before it had been sufficiently debated by world opinion to enable itsadvantages to be clearly seen. For this purpose we should leavethe details of the plan sufficiently flexible to permit the Greek and turkish Governments to make a contribution to its formulation, but its main features should be sufficiently clearly established to convincepublic opinion that it represented a realistic approach based on closestudy of the practical issues involved and genuine concern for the welfare of the inhabitants of Cyprus. Further thought should begiven to the elaboration of the plan from this point of view.Thereafter it should be presented simultaneously to the Greek and turkish Governments and should be published, possibly in the formof a White Paper, very shortly afterwards. At the same time weshould state that we were prepared to discuss it in greater detail withthe other two Governments at a conference to be held in due course.It would be unwise to invite doubts about our sincerity in advocatingtridominium by referring, at this stage, to the alternative policies.But it was for consideration whether we should indicate to the greek and Turkish Governments that, if they were not prepared toco-operate in giving effect to tridominium, we might be compelledto adopt a course of action which they might find even less acceptable.He would consider whether our approach to the Greek and turkish governments should be reinforced, at the appropriate moment, by a personal message from himself to the two Prime Ministers concerned.Meanwhile, the Governor of Cyprus should be recalled for consultation. The Foreign Secretary might also take advantage ofthe presence of the United States Secretary of State at the forthcoming
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,2nd May, 1958.meeting of the Ministerial Council of the North Atlantic Allianceto inform him of our intentions; and he should also indicate tothe Turkish Foreign Minister that, in the light of the latest exchangesabout the possibility of establishing a Turkish base in Cyprus, we now regarded ourselves as free to consider some other form ofsolution of the Cyprus problem.The Cabinet-(1) Approved, in principle, the plan for the establishment of atridominium in Cyprus on the lines indicated in C. (58) 86.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theColonial Secretary, the Minister of Defence and theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to arrange for officials to elaborate this plan in greater detail, withparticular reference to the problems of internal security and external defence, and to examine the questionsof presentation and timing involved.(3) Invited the Colonial Secretary to recall the Governor of cyprus for consultation.(4) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to inform the United states secretary of State of our intentions.
