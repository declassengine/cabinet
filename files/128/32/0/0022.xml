Farm price review.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 16thConclusions,Minute 3.)The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (58) 57) on the Farm Price Review.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that all the economic considerations involved in the price determination would entitle theGovernment to make the maximum reduction in the guarantees whichwas permissible in accordance with the long-term assurancescontained in the Agriculture Act, 1957. This reduction would be 21 millions. If, in these circumstances, the Government did not reduce the guarantees by the maximum possible amount, they would find it increasingly difficult to do so in later years. Moreover, asettlement on this basis could be justified to the farmers on the groundthat, in the absence of the long-term assurances, it would have beenpossible for the Government to insist on an even greater reduction.Since it was clear that an agreed settlement with the National Farmers&apos;Unions (N.F.U.S) was unlikely, there would be no advantage inoffering them a marginal concession of the order of  2 millions.The Minister of Agriculture, while agreeing that economic criteriapointed to the maximum reduction in the guarantees, suggested thata relatively small concession would be of psychological value indemonstrating to moderate farming opinion that the Government didnot intend to subordinate every other consideration to the objective of extracting the maximum of advantage for the Exchequer from thesystem of long-term assurances. Moreover, milk, pigs and eggs thethree commodities on which the proposed price reductions would be concentrated were of particular importance to the small farmer;and some concession in respect of these commodities would provideevidence of the Governments concern for this section of the farming community. With the same object in view he was investigating thepossibility of helping some 25,000 selected small farmers by providing an advisory service and assistance towards capital expenditure, andhe proposed that a general reference to these measures, on the linesof the paragraph appended to C. (58) 57, should be made in theforthcoming White Paper on the Annual Review.In discussion there was general agreement that the balance ofadvantage lay in reducing the total value of the guarantees by only 19 millions. This concession should be directed, so far as possible,to assisting the small farmer, and the reduction in the guaranteed price for milk should therefore be Id. per gallon rather than \\d. per gallon.The difference should not significantly affect the disincentive to milk production. While it could be argued that a smaller reduction in the guaranteed prices for pigs and eggs than that proposed in C. (58) 57would be of benefit to the farmers in Northern Ireland, a differentialsubsidy was administratively impossible and both the present level of subsidy on these commodities and the need to discourage their production made it necessary to impose as substantial a reduction aspossible.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) The N.F.U.S were having considerable success inrepresenting that farmers&apos; incomes had increased less than those ofthe rest of the community in real terms. The statistics which theyused for this purpose were, however, selective and steps should betaken to enable the general public to understand more clearly theeconomics of the farming industry.(b) It was desirable to discourage the output of dairy products inthis country and to stimulate the production of livestock. A gradual reduction in the imports of Argentine beef might contribute to this objective. This could be effected without serious injury to our exporttrade and could be defended on the ground that a substantial proportion of the foot and mouth disease in this country had its originin the Argentine.
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the total value of the guarantees under the agriculture Act, 1957, should be reduced by  19 millions.(2) Agreed that the guaranteed price of milk should be reducedby Id. per gallon and that the other price modificationsproposed in Appendix I to C. (58) 57 should be made.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to report to theCabinet the outcome of further discussions with theNational Farmers&apos; Unions.(4) Agreed to the inclusion in the White Paper on the annual review of a paragraph on the lines of Appendix II toC. (58) 57, amended to indicate that the Government hadtaken the initiative in formulating proposals to assist thesmall farmer.(5) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to prepare a memorandum,for the information of the Governments supporters, onthe economics of the farming industry and the case for theproposed reductions in guaranteed prices.(6) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe President of the Board of Trade and the Minister ofAgriculture, to examine the possibility of reducing importsof beef from the Argentine.Cabinet Office, S.W.L12th March, 1958.
