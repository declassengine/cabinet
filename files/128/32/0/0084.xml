Defence.Integration of nato air defence.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 82ndConclusions,Minute 3.)The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct the UnitedKingdom Permanent Representative on the North atlantic council to seek to secure that the Resolution on the integration of air defence in Europe, to be submitted to theforthcoming Ministerial meeting of the Council, should bein the form indicated in the Annex to C. (58) 248.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Defence (C. (58) 248) about the integration of air defence in the area of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).The Minister of Defence said that, in the light of the cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion, he had given further consideration to the means whereby the proposals which the Supreme Allied Commander,Europe (SACEUR) had put forward for this purpose could be so &apos;amended as to avoid exposing the Government to political embarrassment if they became publicly known. He suggested thatfor this purpose a revised Resolution should be submitted to theforthcoming Ministerial meeting of the North Atlantic Council on thelines of the draft annexed to C. (58) 248. This Resolution would invite the Council to approve the establishment of an integratedsystem of air defence under the command and control of SACEURon the general lines recommended by the Military Committee in their memorandum M.C. 54/1, and would request the Governmentsconcerned to assign their air defence forces in Europe to SACEURsubject to:  (a) approval by the Council of the rules of engagement governing the operation of the assigned forces;(b) the provisions for safeguarding national interests set out inparagraph 11 of M.C. 54/1.If the Council endorsed a Resolution of this nature we should stillbe committed to assign our air defence forces to SACEUR and toplace them under his operational command and control in peace and war. But we should remain free to specify such restrictions as we might see fit to impose on the manner in which he would exercisethis command. In particular, we should be entitled to stipulate thatour air defence forces should continue to be confined to thedefence of the deterrent; and we should be able to withdraw them from the NATO area if they were required to meet our commitmentselsewhere. Moreover, although the formal assignment of our air defence forces to SACEUR would enable him to bring greaterpressure to bear on us to make changes in their equipment anddisposition, we should retain our right to decide for ourselves their size and shape. The integration of air defences in Europe would be advantageous from our point of view in that it would enable us to benefit operationally from the closer links which would be established between the early-warning systems on the Continent and in thiscountry; and, in the light of the political safeguards implicit in thedraft Resolution, the new arrangement should now be defensible to public opinion in this country.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals,which, it had been ascertained, would be acceptable to SACEUR.
Obscene 3.   The Home Secretary said that a Private Member&apos;s Bill hadPublications been introduced on the subject of obscene publications. It might beBill. , desirable that the Government should provide time for its discussion(Previous        in the House of Commons in order to show that they were not reference:       unsympathetic with the body of opinion which favoured amendmentCC. (57) 25th   of the law on this subject.   On the other hand, the Bill was not likelyConclusions,    to receive a Second Reading in the normal course of business and minute 3.)       there would be obvious objection to any attempt by the Governmentto ensure it priority over other Bills promoted by Private Members:Moreover, the problems involved were at present being examined bya committee under the chairmanship of the Lord Chancellor and itwould be premature to give any indication of the governments intentions until the report of this committee was available forconsideration by the Cabinet.   The wisest course might therefore beto indicate, possibly during the business statement in the following week, that the Government hoped that an opportunity might occur in the near future for the discussion of the issues raised by the Bill.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement.nationalised industries.(previous reference :CC. (57) 38thConclusions,Minute 6.)borrowing powers.4. The Minister of Power said that it was proposed to introduce a Bill extending the borrowing powers of the gas and electricity industries. In the case of the Gas Council, the existing powers werenot likely to be exhausted until 1961; but it would be convenient tofollow the precedent of the corresponding legislation introduced in1954 and to deal simultaneously with the capital needs of bothindustries so far as they could be foreseen.In discussion it was suggested that it would be preferable to observe the normal principle that Parliament should not be invitedto sanction an extension of powers until the need for it was relativelyimminent. The Governmenfs supporters would be liable to be critical if this principle were breached merely for the sake of convenience.The Cabinet Agreed that this legislation should be confined to authorisingan extension of the borrowing powers of the electricity industry.Foreign 5.   The Cabinet were informed of the arrangements which itAffairs. was proposed to make in connection with the forthcoming meetingsEurope. of the Ministerial Councils of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(NATO) and the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation(O.E.E.C.).In discussion it was suggested that we should take theopportunity provided by these meetings to discuss with theGovernments of the United States, France and Western germany the measures which it might be necessary to adopt for the relief of berlin if the Soviet proposal to bring the military occupation of thecity to an end compelled the Western sectors to withstand a blockade.On the other hand, there might be advantage in abstaining from any immediate initiative in relation to Berlin and allowing the other powers concerned to make the first move. In particular, it might be unwise to encourage the expectation that we would be prepared to relieve the Federal German Government of their proper share ofthe responsibility for maintaining the position of the Western sectors of the city. The strength of the West German economy, togetherwith the fact that the Federal Government had supported France inobstructing our proposals for the creation of a European Free trade area, gave them even less grounds for expecting us to take the lead
Defence. 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theManpov/er Minister of Defence (C. (58) 234) on the prospective supply ofPolicy. manpower to the Armed Forces.(Previous The Minister of Defence said that the trend of regular recruitingReference: continued to be more favourable than had been expected when theC.C. (58) 75th decision was taken to bring National Service to an end by DecemberConclusions, 1962. There was therefore every reason to be confident of ourMinute 3.) ability to implement the declared policy of the Government to rely on all-regular forces from 1963 onwards.The Prime Minister said that, if there had been any reasonabledoubt on this issue, the Government would have been obliged toconsider introducing, before the end of the present Parliament,legislation extending National Service in some form. The facts setout in C. (58) 234 made it clear that the Government would not have failed in their duty if they now decided to take no action of this kind.The question of the commitments to be faced from 1963 onwardsand of the additional numbers of regular recruits who might been gaged, above the total at present authorised, would be consideredby the Defence Committee in the course of their current review of future defence expenditure.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of C. (58) 234.Malta. 7.   The Cabinet were informed of the course of the current(Previous       discussions between the Colonial Secretary and representatives ofReference :      the political parties in Malta.   It was unlikely that an agreed formC.C. (58) 80th   of Constitution for the Island could be evolved at this stage and our conclusions,    interest, for the immediate future, would probably lie in making the minute 5.)       best possible arrangements for a period of direct rule.   It would,however, be helpful if some understanding could be reached duringthe present discussions with Dr. Borg Olivier, the leader of the maltese Nationalist Party, on the status which might be accorded to Malta if the Island should at a later date become financially self-supporting and no longer needed for British defence purposes.Dr. Borg Olivier might be attracted by a statement that in those circumstances Malta would be regarded as a &quot; Dominion.&quot;In discussion it was pointed out that the concept of some new form of Dominion status for certain smaller communities within theCommonwealth would call for very careful consideration and consultation with other members of the Commonwealth. It mightbe preferable to consider the possibility of suggesting some otherformula such as the prospect of &quot; self-government within theCommonwealth.&quot; The two conditions on which it had beensuggested that some new status might be accorded to Malta werein proposing measures which might impose on us a heavy additionalliability.It would be necessary, in any event, to reconsider the project for a European Free Trade Area after the forthcoming meeting ofthe Ministerial Council of O.E.E.C. We must seek, if possible, toreach a decision on our future policy in time to enable us to enlist the support of the United States Government, during the subsequentMinisterial meeting of the North Atlantic Council, for such freshproposals as we might put forward for the organisation of Europeantrade. In this way we might gradually, and without jeopardising ourown essential interests, work towards a new attempt to reach agreement between the great Powers on a political and economicsettlement in Europe.
Cotton. 8.   The President of the Board of Trade said that in the currentImports. negotiations between the Cotton Board and the Hong Kong industry(Previous for a voluntary limitation of exports of cotton textiles from HongR reference: Kong, the Hong Kong industry continued to insist on the principleCC. (58) 83rd of annual escalation within the agreed total figure of 345 millionConclusions, square yards over the following three years and to demand a separateMinute 7.)       and additional allocation for exports of yarn cloth and towelling.It was now urgently necessary to resolve these issues, since theopportunity to ratify the corresponding agreements which had been provisionally reached with the Indian and Pakistani industries wouldlapse at the end of the year.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the Cotton board had agreed in principle that, if the annual allocation of 115 million square yards was not fully taken up in each year, the balance mightbe carried over to the following year. It might be possible to adaptthis principle in a manner which would, in effect, give the HongKong industry the substance of escalation.The Prime Minister said that, if a suitable formula could be devised for this purpose, he would be prepared to ascertain, duringthe discussion which he was to have with representatives of theCotton Board on the following day, whether it would be acceptable to the Board. If so, it might still be possible to bring the negotiationswith Hong Kong to a successful conclusion. But the Cabinet would need to consider in the very near future whether, if agreement proved impossible, they would sacrifice the interests of the British industryto the maintenance of our traditional policy as regards Colonial trade or whether, in order to provide the necessary protection for our ownproducers, they were prepared, notwithstanding the undesirableprecedent which would be created, to impose on Hong Kong asettlement acceptable to the Cotton Board.The Cabinet (1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to consider, asa matter of urgency, whether a formula could be devised which would in effect permit a limited degree of escalationwithin the agreed total of cotton textile exports from hong Kong over the next three years by allowing theunused portion of each year&apos;s allocation to be carried over, to a limited and defined extent, to the following year.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would ascertain, during his discussion with the Cotton Board on the following day, whether such a formula would be acceptable tothe Board.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion on the policy to be adopted towards cotton textile exports from Hong Kong at a subsequent meeting.unlikely to materialise in the foreseeable future; and care should betaken to avoid any fresh undertaking which we might be pressed to honour before those conditions were realised.The Cabinet &apos;Invited the Colonial Secretary, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary, to give further consideration, inthe light of their discussion, to the form of a possiblestatement on the future status of Malta and, if it appeareddesirable to make such a statement to refer the draft to thePrime Minister before making any such communication tothe leader of the Malta Nationalist Party.
