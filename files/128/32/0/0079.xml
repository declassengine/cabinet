Egypt.(previous references:C.C. (58) 67thConclusions,Minute 3 andC.C. (57) 51stConclusions,Minute 1.)BritishEvacuees.1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (58) 224) proposing measures offurther assistance to British evacuees from Egypt.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as no financial settlement with the Egyptian Government had yet been reached and ministers were being strongly pressed to afford further assistance toBritish subjects whose assets in that country had been sequestrated,it was desirable that the existing scheme for making ex-gratia advancesshould be extended. He therefore proposed that a revised scheme should be introduced which would include business, as well aspersonal, assets of private individuals in the list of assets qualifying for compensation; would increase the scale of payment for all except those in the lowest categories, who had already been paid 70 per cent,of their claims; and would include other minor but importantimprovements, particularly a payment of  100,000 to the british officials dismissed by the Egyptian Government in 1951. these arrangements, which would cost  3 millions, represented themaximum concession which the^ Government could offer without prejudicing the prospects of a financial settlement with Egypt orimplying that the claimants were entitled to full compensation fromthe Exchequer.In discussion there was general support for these proposals.They might weaken our bargaining position in negotiating asettlement with the Egyptian Government. But Ministers werepublicly committed to extending the scope of assistance to theseBritish refugees in the absence of such a settlement; and it was not certain that even the new arrangements described in C. (58) 224 wouldwholly satisfy the growing public pressure on their behalf.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (58) 224.(2) Took note that these proposals would be announced in bothHouses of Parliament later in the day.ForeignAffairs.Cyprus.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 77thConclusions,Minute 2.)european free trade area.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 71stConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Prime Minister said that, despite the efforts which hadbeen made in the North Atlantic Council, the Greek Governmenthad now rejected the proposal for a conference on Cyprus. But wehad at least been able to demonstrate to the other members of the alliance that our own attitude was reasonable; and the publicationof the relevant documents should improve our position in the eyes of world opinion. Meanwhile, we need not express any strong criticism of the Greek Government: the facts could be allowed to speak for themselves.The Prime Minister said that it now seemed unlikely that agreement would be reached in the current round of discussions inParis on the proposals for a European Free Trade Area. The timemight be approaching when a political settlement of this problem should be sought. He hoped to have an opportunity of discussingthis with the Ministers most directly concerned as soon as the paymaster-General returned to London.Parliament. 3.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Prime Minister said that the Leader of the House ofCommons and the Chief Whip were to be congratulated on havingcompleted the business of the previous session before the summer
Employment.(previous reference:CC. (58) 78thConclusions.)4. The Cabinet were informed that Ministers were being askedto receive deputations from areas in which the level of unemployment was above the national average. It was desirable that ministers should take a common line in dealing with these requests.The Cabinet agreed that, for the time being, these requests shouldnot be rejected. The duty of receiving the deputations could be divided among the various Ministers concerned with this problem.The position could be reviewed later if the number of the deputationssignificantly increased.international labour organisation.(previous reference:CC. (58) 60thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Labour C. (58) 220) seeking authority to denounce InternationalLabour Convention No. 43, which was concerned with the regulationof hours of work in automatic sheet-glass works.The Cabinet were informed that this Convention applied to onlyone firm in the United Kingdom, and that it would be impracticable for them to comply with its provisions regarding the working of overtime. Moreover, under the new Factories Bill power was to betaken to relax, in particular cases, the provisions relating to hoursof employment in a number of Acts, including the Hours ofEmployment (Conventions) Act, 1936; and the introduction of this bill would indicate that we no longer aimed at full compliance withour obligations under Convention No. 43.The Cabinet Agreed that the United Kingdom Government shoulddenounce International Labour Convention No. 43; and authorised the Minister of Labour to communicate thisdenunciation to the International Labour Organisationwhen the forthcoming Factories Bill was introduced into parliament.Housing 6.   The Minister of Housing reported that, after the CabinetsPolicy. discussion on 22nd October, he had discussed with representatives(Previous of the Surrey County Council and the Egham Urban District CouncilReference: the action which was being taken to expel caravan-dwellers from an c.c. (58) 77th unauthorised site at Egham. He had urged on them the importanceConclusions, of finding either an alternative site on which they could live in their minute 5.) caravans or a site on which the caravans could be parked while theCaravan occupants themselves were provided with living accommodationSites. elsewhere.   The Egham Council had made it clear that they werenot prepared to grant planning permission in respect of the disputedsite. But they had also stated publicly that they did not intend totake any action before 5th November to enforce the High Courtsinjunction requiring the caravan company concerned, Modern TrailerHomes Limited, to evacuate the site; and they had assured himprivately that they did not intend to act immediately after that date.They could not, in any event, enforce the injunction without theconsent of the Attorney-General. It was important, however, thatthe Government should not appear to connive at defiance of the law,and it was for this reason that, after his meeting with the localauthorities, he had issued a statement to the effect that the law mustrecess. The fact that the new session had been opened immediatelyafter Parliament reassembled after the recess, without any spill-over of business from the preceding session, had noticeably increased the impact which the Governments programme for the new session had made on the public.
be obeyed and the site must be cleared. Meanwhile, the most hopefulapproach to the problem might lie in holding a local enquiry into thepossibility of finding an alternative site for the caravans.In discussion it was emphasised that the High Court&apos;s injunctionhad been suspended only until 5th October. The caravan company and the owner and lessee of the site had therefore already been incontempt of court for some time, and the Attorney-General, in whosename the proceedings had been instituted, could not acquiesceindefinitely in non-compliance with the injunction or refuse anapplication from the Egham Council for his consent to enforce it.Modern Trailer Homes Limited had obtained eviction orders fromthe County Court against the occupiers of the caravans, and the HighCourt might accept this action as constituting a sufficient defence ifapplication were made to commit the directors of the company andthe owner and the lessee of the site for contempt of court. On theother hand the execution of the eviction orders would be difficult and embarrassing. The bailiffs would be liable to writ of mandamusif they failed to enforce them; but they could not be expected toaccept the risk of bodily injury to which they would be exposed inany attempt to do so, and the methods which they would be compelledto adopt in the face of opposition from the occupants would becondemned by public opinion.In further discussion it was pointed out that the High Court had expressed doubt whether it had been necessary for the company toobtain eviction orders against the occupiers, who appeared to betrespassers; and it would be preferable that any further action whichthe Government might take should, if possible, be directed topersuading the occupants, if necessary at the expense of the caravancompany, to evacuate the site. The welfare officers of the localauthorities could visit the occupants individually and could seek to convince them that it was to their own advantage to avoid the threat of legal action by accepting any alternative site for their caravanswhich could be found. At the same time it might be possible to compel the caravan company, as an alternative to attachment forcontempt of court, to make some monetary offer to the occupiers to induce them to leave the site.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that everyeffort should be made to find an alternative site for the occupants ofthese caravans in order to expose them to as little hardship as possible.The Home Affairs Committee should keep the situation under review and endeavour to find an early solution of the problem.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government to explore, whether by way of a local enquiry or otherwise,the possibility of finding an alternative site for thesecaravans.(2) Agreed that, failing a solution on the lines indicated inConclusion (1), the Home Affairs Committee should consider urgently what other steps could be taken to dealwith this situation.
