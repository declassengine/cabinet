rent restriction.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 26thConclusions,Minute 2.)* Previously recorded in a Most Confidential Record.*1. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposals of theMinister of Housing (C. (58) 64) for the mitigation of hardship arising under the Rent Act, 1957.In this discussion it was assumed that a Bill could be draftedwhich would relieve cases of genuine hardship without undermining the principles and operation of the main Act. On that assumption thefollowing points were made:  (a) Consideration had been given to various forms of administrative action as alternatives to legislation, e.g., encourage-ment of local authorities to buy houses from which the landlordintended to evict the tenant in order to sell; enabling local authoritiesto borrow money for this purpose at specially low rates; andempowering local authorities to make loans to tenants wishing to buytheir houses, up to the full amount of the purchase price. None ofthese expedients seemed, however, to be feasible.(b) If legislation on the lines proposed were not enacted, large-scale evictions in the last months of the year were inescapable. TheGovernment would then have to choose between two alternatives legislation at short notice and under heavy pressure or the stigma ofan inhuman refusal to relieve hardship. Neither of these could beregarded as tolerable.(c) Further consideration should be given to the possibility of restricting the scope of the proposed Bill by:  (i) specifying as precisely as possible the classes of tenant in whose favour the courts would be empowered to grant a stay ofeviction;(ii) modifying the present proposal on the level of rent payableduring the period of stay;(iii) delimiting more precisely the period of stay which the courtswould be empowered to grant.(d) Further consideration should also be given to the presentation of the problem and its solution to the Governments supporters.Summing up the discussion The Prime Minister said that thebalance of the discussion appeared to suggest that in principle theGovernment should legislate on the lines proposed, by the Minister of housing. But, before a final decision was taken, further thought should be given to the details in particular, the extent to which thescope of the Bill could be restricted. Careful thought would also berequired on the presentation- of the proposals, both to government supporters and to the general public. If the Government were toproceed with legislation on these lines, it seemed on balance to be preferable that an announcement should be made before Easter ratherthan later in the year.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Housing to submit to them, at ameeting early in the following week, proposals for themitigation of hardship arising under the Rent Act, 1957,revised in accordance with the points raised in their discussion, together with a draft of an announcement of theGovernments intentions.
Commercial 3.   The   Cabinet   had   before   them   memoranda   by   thePolicy. Paymaster-General (C. (58) 65 and 67) about the course of theFree Trade     negotiations for the establishment of a Free Trade Area.Area&apos;. The Paymaster-General said that the attitude of the French(Previous Government remained one of the greatest obstacles to progress. TheyReference: na(j produced alternative proposals which, if approved by the SixC.C. (58) 14th powers jn April, would be formally put forward for discussion by theConclusions, Committee which was co-ordinating the negotiations on the FreeMinute 6.) Trade Area. These proposals would probably be designed toenable the Six Powers to share the preferences which we ourselvesenjoyed in Commonwealth markets. Hitherto we had counteredsuggestions of this kind by emphasising that the Commonwealthconstituted a balanced system of duties as well as rights which did not benefit the United Kingdom alone. But we must recognise that theFrench proposals might have attractions for some members of theCommonwealth, particularly Australia and New Zealand, who were increasingly concerned at the prospect of losing their Continentalmarkets as a result of the Treaty of Rome and might be tempted to seek to secure an enlargement of those markets by reaching agreementwith the Six Powers on preference margins at our expense. although we had repeatedly emphasised to the Six Powers that, if they sought to compel us to choose between Europe and the Commonwealth, theywould destroy all hope of establishing the closer relations between theUnited Kingdom and Europe embodied in the concept of the free trade Area, we must nevertheless remain on our guard against therisk of being gradually subjected to a combination of pressure fromthe Six and from certain members of the Commonwealth.In discussion it was emphasised that the extension of the area of discriminatory preferences which appeared to be the French objectivewould be contrary to the principles of the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade. It would also constitute a concession which noother member of the Commonwealth should feel able to make without our consent. We should, therefore, take steps to ensure that theother members of the Commonwealth realised that a modification ofthe preferences which they granted to the United Kingdom was not a concession which they could make unilaterally. It might also become necessary to consider whether we should warn them that we might be compelled to reconsider both the system of duty-free entry of commonwealth goods into this country and the scale on which wecould afford to invest in Commonwealth territories. On the otherhand, it was unlikely that the Six Powers would ever be able to offer a market for Commonwealth products comparable with that whichthey commanded in this country; and there were some indications that the other members of the Commonwealth, although interested inthe French proposals, were adopting a cautious attitude towards them.For these reasons it would perhaps be premature to reject the french proposals publicly at this stage and thus to jeopardise the possibilityof achieving the Free Trade Area. We could not prevent the SixPowers and the other members of the Commonwealth from conductingdiscussions between themselves; and for the time being we should be content to keep developments under close review. But we should seekMeeting of 2.   The Cabinet were informed that the North Atlantic CouncilHeads of        had now endorsed, subject to some minor amendments, the proposedGovernments,   statement on the attitude of the Western Powers towards a meeting of(Previous        Heads of Governments. The draft had been referred to GovernmentsReference:      for final approval, and it was hoped that it could be communicated toC.C. (58) 26th the Soviet Government (by the Governments of the United States, theConclusions,     United Kingdom and France) and published before Easter.   Mean-Minute 5.)       while there was reason to believe that the Soviet Government would shortly announce a unilateral suspension of nuclear tests.    if ministers were pressed for an early statement on their attitude to suchan announcement, it would be necessary to give a temporising reply.
to prevent the French Government from achieving a negotiating position in which they could divide the United Kingdom from the restof the Commonwealth by persuading certain Commonwealthmembers to seek our consent to a reduction of our preferences in commonwealth markets as the price of securing the establishment ofthe Free Trade Area; and we should avoid allowing ourselves to bemanoeuvred into a position in which we might forfeit both ourpreferences in Commonwealth markets and the possibility of creatingthe Free Trade Area. It might be necessary to reach a decision onthese issues at very short notice in the near future. It might also be advisable to consider the policy which we should adopt if it seemed likely that the Free Trade Area project would fail.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of C. (58) 65 and 67.(2) Invited the Paymaster-General to be guided, in theforthcoming negotiations on the establishment of a european Free Trade Area, by the considerations whichhad emerged in their discussion.(3) Invited the Paymaster-General to circulate a further report onthe progress of those negotiations in the near future.Cabinet Office, S.28th March,W.1,1958.
