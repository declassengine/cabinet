Cyprus.(previous reference:CC. (58) 68thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Prime Minister said that it had now become clear thatthe Greek Government would not accept any plan for the future administration of Cyprus which involved their sharing the govern-ment of the Island with Turkey or acquiescing in the physicalpresence in Cyprus of any symbol of Turkish authority. In thesecircumstances the Cabinet faced two major decisions first, whether we should nevertheless pursue the plan which we had published;second, whether, if we sought to put it into effect, we should allowArchbishop Makarios and the other political exiles to return to the island.On the first issue the balance of advantage appeared to lie in continuing to promote our plan. We were committed to the TurkishGovernment to bring it into force; and, in view of our success in persuading them to abandon their more extreme demands for apartition of Cyprus or for the creation of a major Turkish base in the island, it would be unwise, by abandoning our plan at this late stage,to compel them to revert to their former intransigence. Moreover,it was impossible to devise any effective alternative to the plan whichwe had published. It was no longer feasible to seek to introduce the radcliffe Constitution; the Greek Government were powerless tosuggest on their own initiative any constitutional scheme which wouldbe likely to be accepted by the Turkish Government; and the indefinitecontinuance of British rule in an atmosphere of increasing communalstrife could not be contemplated. The only realistic hope of achieving a solution lay in adhering to our plan but in implementing it asunobtrusively as possible. We should therefore abstain from anyfurther declaration of policy and should allow the new arrangements to be seen to come gradually into operation, in the hope that theGreek-Cypriot community and the Greek Government would eventually appreciate the folly of refusing to accept the opportunityto play the major part in the government of Cyprus and of deliberatelythwarting a plan which offered them their only safeguard against apartition of the Island.On this hypothesis the desirability of allowing Archbishop Makarios and the other exiles to return to Cyprus would need to bereassessed. It would no longer be possible to argue, as in ourpublished plan, that, if violence ceased, we should be preparedgradually to bring the state of emergency to an end and to allow theexiles to return, since we could not maintain that violence had ceasedor that we were putting the plan into effect on the basis of the partnership between the Greek and Turkish communities which wehad originally envisaged. The return of the Archbishop, if it was permitted, would therefore have to be justified by reference to ourbelief that, in the circumstances in which the plan would now comeinto operation, he would be less dangerous in Cyprus than he was atpresent in Athens, even though he would not be required to abjureviolence or to co-operate in restoring peace and order in the Island.The Cabinet would need to consider whether this was in fact likelyto be the case.CC. 69 (58)Sir Winston 1.   The Prime Minister said that on Friday, 12th September,Churchill. gjr Winston and Lady Churchill would celebrate the 50th anniversary of their marriage. The Cabinet would no doubt think it appropriate that he should send to Sir Winston, on their behalf, a message of congratulation and good wishes on this occasion.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ proposal.
The Governor of Cyprus said that, in his opinion, a fresh outbreakof violence and terrorism was likely to occur in the period immediately ahead, in which the initial stages of our plan would be put intooperation. The establishment of the Municipal Commission, the arrival of the representative of the Turkish Government, and the holding of the first elections would represent critical points duringthis period. Nevertheless, there was some hope that the Greek-Cypriot community and the Greek Government, when faced with thenew situation which would thereafter exist, would hesitate finally to forgo the opportunity to play their part in the government&apos; of the island. We must be ready to take advantage of any change of attitude on their part. We could not indefinitely govern the island in collaboration with a minority amounting to no more than one-fifth of its population and in the face of complete absence of co-operation from the remaining four-fifths. Some means must be found ofresuming contact with this majority element; and, as Archbishop Makarios was the only spokesman whom the Greek-cypriot community would accept, it would be to our advantage to offer him the opportunity to return to the Island. He might well reject this offer; and in that case his prestige, which had grown, rather thandiminished, during his exile, should suffer a serious reverse. But ifhe agreed to return he would forfeit the position of power withoutresponsibility which he at present enjoyed in Athens and wouldbecome subject to the growing pressure of the Greek community in cyprus who were anxious, for both political and economic reasons,that the state of emergency should be brought to an end as rapidly as possible. On balance, it was to our advantage that the Archbishopshould be compelled in this way to face his responsibilities ratherthan be allowed to continue to exert his dangerous influence over theGreek Government in Athens.In discussion some doubt was expressed about the wisdom of allowing the Archbishop to return to Cyprus. In present circum-stances it would not be possible to release the detainees or to terminate the state of emergency as rapidly as we had originallyhoped. These measures would now have to be deferred until peacefulconditions had been restored. But there was little chance that the archbishop would co-operate in establishing such conditions; he was more likely to launch a campaign for the immediate release of thedetainees and to provoke bitter resistance to the introduction of our plan. It would be necessary, therefore, to make it clear that, if he returned to Cyprus, he would not be entitled to regard himself as above the ordinary law of Cyprus and beyond the scope of theEmergency Regulations and that, if he reverted to behaviour whichwas liable to disturb the peace and to subvert public order, he wouldbe arrested or deported for a second time. On the other hand, itwould not necessarily be easy to secure evidence which would justifyhis arrest; nor would it be politically possible to detain him withina short period after his return to Cyprus without provoking the suspicion that our consent to his return had been merely a device toenable us to imprison him again.The timing of the Archbishop&apos;s re-entry into Cyprus would also need to be considered. If we were to gain the maximum of advantage from such a concession, it would be desirable that he should return tothe Island in the near future, soon sfter the representative of theTurkish Government had arrived on 1st October. On the other hand it was doubtful whether public opinion was yet prepared for such achange in our attitude towards the Archbishop. Moreover, therewas risk of confusion among the Cypriots about his status and functions if he was allowed to re-enter the Island shortly after the arrival of the representative of the Turkish Government. For these reasons it might be wiser to defer his return until the safeguards forthe Turkish-Cypriot community which our plan incorporated hadbeen fully established, i.e., until a date early in 1959.

RacialDisturbances.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 31stConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Home Secretary said that the police were confident thatthey could control the racial disturbances which had recently occurred in Nottingham and in the Notting Hill area of London. It would benecessary, however, to give further consideration to the circumstances which provoked these outbreaks of violence between white and coloured people. They appeared to originate largely in competition for housing and casual employment; and they were aggravated in somecases by disputes about women. It would be desirable to seek toestablish some form of control over the emigration of coloured people from their countries of origin, similar to the measures which we had recently persuaded the Governments of India and Pakistan tointroduce; and it might be appropriate, as an initial step, to discuss this possibility with the Federal Government of the West Indies. Inaddition it would be desirable to reconsider the possibility of takingstatutory powers to deport undesirable immigrants from othercountries of the Commonwealth and of implementing certain of therecommendations of the Committee on Homosexual Offences andProstitution.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Unemployment was tending to rise; and, as coloured workers were usually among the first to be discharged, the incidence ofunemployment among coloured immigrants, which was already 8 percent, compared with the national average of about 2 per cent., wouldbecome increasingly heavy. This fact should reinforce our approach to the Federal Government.(b) On the other hand the remittances which the immigrantsdespatched from this country were of substantial benefit to theirrelatives and friends in their countries of origin. Any drasticcurtailment of these remittances would be liable to provoke demands from the West Indian Governments for further financial assistance for social relief.(c) It would be desirable to make it clear that, in the view of theGovernment, law and order must be maintained irrespective of theracial characteristics of individuals. It would also be important toavoid, if possible, any major pronouncement of policy about theprinciple of Commonwealth immigration. We should continue todeal with this problem empirically and should base our action on thepractical considerations of the availability of housing and the capacityof the labour market.C.C. 69 (58)The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwould be premature to seek to reach a decision on these issues without consulting the Turkish Government. It was unlikely that they wouldformally consent to the return of the Archbishop to Cyprus; but itmight be possible to persuade them reluctantly to acquiesce in a concession which appeared to offer the only chance of enabling us tore-establish contact with the Greek-Cypriot community and to overcome Greek resistance to our plan. He had asked H.M. ChargedAffaires in Ankara for his personal assessment of the probableTurkish reaction to a proposal on our part to allow the Archbishopto return to Cyprus; and in the light of the reply to this enquiry hewould consider what further action should be taken.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would give furtherconsideration to the desirability of consulting the Govern-ment of Turkey about the proposal that Archbishop Makarios and the other political exiles should be allowed toreturn to Cyprus.
The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the Colonial secretary, the Minister of Labour and the Minister of housing and Local Government, to consider an approach to the Federal Government of the West Indies on thecontrol of emigration from West Indian territories on thelines which he had proposed.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the LordChancellor, to give further consideration to the desirabilityof taking statutory powers to deport undesirableimmigrants from other countries of the commonwealth and of introducing legislation to implement certain of therecommendations of the Committee on HomosexualOffences and Prostitution.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th September, 1958.
