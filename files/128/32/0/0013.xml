It might be possible, however, to ensure that the issue receivedadequate attention in the course of the forthcoming debate if theadditional Motion was so worded as to condemn the abuse ofParliamentary privilege in principle without imputing blame to anyparticular individual.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chief Whip to consider whether it would bepossible to arrange, in connection with the forthcoming debate on the Report of the Tribunal of Enquiry into the alleged premature disclosure of the decision to increaseBank Rate, for a Motion to be tabled by government supporters condemning the abuse of parliamentary privilege by Members of the House of Commons.The Home Secretary said that, on further consideration, he had reached the conclusion that, while the Government should maintainduring the debate that the terms of reference of the Committee onMonetary Policy were sufficiently wide to enable them to review thestatus and functions of the part-time Directors of the Bank ofEngland, it would be desirable to indicate that the Government had invited the Committee to give special consideration to this subject in their report.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for aletter to be sent to the Chairman of the Committee onMonetary Policy, before the forthcoming debate,requesting the Committee to give special consideration intheir report to the problem of the status and functionsof the part-time Directors of the Bank of England.52960-151. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Home Secretary said that the House of Commons would consider on the following day a Motion, tabled by a private Member,for the constitution of a Select Committee to examine parliamentary procedure. There were no grounds on which the Government could resonably invite the House of Commons to reject this Motion; -andit would be necessary to accept the proposal in principle.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement.
East-West 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theTrade. President of the Board of Trade (C. (58) 18) on trade with the Soviet(Previous       Union.Reference: The President of the Board of Trade said that a generalC.C. (57) 16th expansion of trade with the Soviet Union would be of benefit to our conclusions, own economy and to the advantage of the West in the politicalMinute 3). struggle with Communism. The Soviet economy would continue to expand, irrespective of any restrictions on its imports; and the objective of the Western countries should therefore be to organisethemselves to meet Soviet competition effectively and so to demonstrate to the uncommitted countries the advantages of theWestern economic systems over the controlled Soviet economy. the leadership in this task lay with the United States; and it was unfortunate that the United States Government had so far adopted a negative approach towards any expansion of trade with the soviet union. Although they appeared to agree that the strategic requirements which had originally justified the existing controls on exports to the Soviet Union were no longer a valid criterion in thelight of the development of thermo-nuciear weapons, they werenevertheless anxious to enlarge the scope of these controls to includegoods which, by broadening the Soviet industrial base, would increasethe ability of the Soviet Union to wage economic war. But this approach to the problem would imply the control of almost all exports to the Soviet bloc on a scale which would be whollyimpracticable in peace-time. Moreover, the United States proposal was not supported by the majority of the other members of theCo-ordinating Committee (COCOM) in Paris, who shared our viewthat the controls should be based solely on strategic requirements and that in present circumstances the existing lists of controlleditems could be considerably reduced. H.M. Ambassador in washington had advised against any attempt to press the UnitedStates Government at this juncture to reconsider their policy, since this might prejudice Congressional approval of the amendment ofthe McMahon Act. The Congressional debate on this subject was,however, unlikely to end before May; and unless in the meantime the United States Government could be persuaded to change theirpresent attitude, there would be an embarrassing deadlock betweenthe United States and the other members of COCOM in theforthcoming discussions. We should therefore make an earlyattempt to resolve the present difference of opinion by a freshapproach to the United States Government, emphasising in particular the political importance of countering the Soviet economic offensive.In discussion there was general support for the view that the controls on exports to the Soviet Union should be confined to thoseitems which would still need to be restricted on strategic grounds and that, for the rest, it would not be to our long-term advantage to acquiesce in a policy which would ensure that the inevitableexpansion of Soviet trade would be directed primarily to theuncommitted countries. It would remain important, however, toavoid any action which might jeopardise Congressional approval ofthe amendment of the McMahon Act; and further consideration ofthe issues raised in C. (58) 18 should therefore await the return of theForeign Secretary from Ankara, where he had taken the opportunityto discuss them with the United States Secretary of State.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed, in principle, the conclusions in C. (58) 18.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider, in the light of had discussions with the United States Secretary of State,whether it would be appropriate to make a further approach to the United States Government on thequestion of trade with the Soviet Union and, if so, whatwould be the most suitable form and timing of such an initiative.
Wages Policy :National health service.(previous references :C.C. (57) 85thConclusions,Minute and 82ndConclusions,Minute 5).4.   The Cabinet had before them :  (i) a memorandum by the Minister of Health (C. (58) 25) aboutthe introduction of a revised grading structure and assocated payscales for the clerical and lower administrative staff in the national health Service;(ii) memoranda by the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister of Health (C. (58) 23) and by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C. (58) 24) on the pay claim made on behalf ofradiographers in the National Health Service.Clerical and The Minister of Health said that, in withholding his approval,Administrative during the previous autumn, to a 3 per cent, increase in salaries forGrades. these staff, he had undertaken to review their claim after an appropriate interval. More recently the Staff Side of the whitley council concerned had submitted a new claim for a 5 per cent,increase but had been persuaded to defer it for a short time on the understanding that negotiations would be started on therecommendations in the recent report by Sir Noel Hail about theGrading Structure of Administrative and Clerical Staff in theHospital Service and on the new pay scales appropriate to thisreorganisation. The scales set out in the appendix to his memorandum represented reductions on the proposals originally putforward by the non-Departmental members of the Management side and could be regarded as reasonable levels of pay for the new grades.Although they represented increases, at the maxima, of upwards of10 per cent., it would be possible, for purposes of public presentation,to distinguish them from a normal increase in remuneration byemphasising that they would constitute only one element in a comprehensive reorganisation of the grading structure of the Service,by referring as far as possible the date on which they would become effective and by insisting on stringent terms of assimilation.In discussion it was agreed that the Government were largelycommitted in principle to the introduction of new scales of salaryas part of the reorganisation of the grading structure of the serviceconcerned. But the Governments disinflationary policy would be adversely affected if, by an over-simplification of the issues involved,the Government now seemed ready to concede an increase of 10 percent, to the same staff to whom an increase of 3 per cent, had alreadybeen refused. It would be particularly desirable, therefore, to ensure,if possible, that the initial benefit derived by an individual from thenew salary scales should not exceed 3 per cent.; and the precise termsof assimilation should be devised to this end.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that negotiations should begin in the Whitley Councilconcerned on the introduction of a revised gradingstructure and associated pay scales for the clerical and lower administrative staff in the National Health service on the lines proposed in (C. (58) 25).(2) Invited the Minister of Health to circulate, in due course, his proposals on the precise terms of assimilation to the new scales.Radiographers. The Minister of Health said that, if the present deficiency ofradiographers in the National Health Service was to be remedied,it would be necessary to concede an increase in pay of between 5 and10 per cent. Current rates of pay, which had been awarded by theIndustrial Court, had proved ineffective in arresting the wastage ofstaff, and the efficient operation of the Service was now threatened.
In discussion it was emphasised that the Government must beseen to be consistent in their application of their disinflationarypolicy. Other services, as well as the National Health Service, were suffering from a shortage of staff, and to attempt to justify increases in pay on this ground would be incompatible with the Governmentswages policy as a whole. The Management and Staff Sides of the whitley Council concerned should therefore be informed that, if they recommended an increase in pay for radiographers, the Governmentwould be unable to approve it. If, as a result, the claim was submittedto arbitration, the Government would have to accept the award; butthis would be less embarrassing than a settlement based on an offer by the Management Side.The Cabinet-(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Health to inform the Management and Staff Sides ofthe Whitley Council concerned that the Governmentwould be unable to approve any increase which theymight recommend in the remuneration of radiographersin the National Health Service.Vaccines.Poliomyelitis.(previous reference :C.C.   (57)  66thConclusions,Minute 1).5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Health (C. (58) 26)proposing (i) the purchase of a further 2,500 litres of Salk poliomyelitisvaccine together with any additional quantity which might be needed to make good the deficiency in supplies of the British vaccine and(ii) the adoption of a provisional purchasing programme, at an approximate cost of  2 millions, to permit an extension of the scale of vaccination, with the possibility that the programme might need to be still further expanded at a later stage.It discussion it was agreed that an additional 2,500 litres of Salkvaccine should be purchased. The proposal to extend the scale ofvaccination, however, derived from assumptions which required more detailed examination.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister of Health to make an immediate purchase of2,500 litres of Salk poliomyelitis vaccine.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Health to arrange for their further proposals inconnection with the supply of poliomyelitis vaccine to beconsidered by the Home Affairs Committee.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.30th January, 1958.
