Parliament. 2.   The   Cabinet   were   informed   that   the   Governmentsspokesmen in the Budget debate would be the President of the Boardof Trade, the Paymaster-General and the Financial Secretary,Treasury. The Chancellor of the Exchequer would wind up the debate on 21st April.The Cabinet were also informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the remainder of the following week.ForeignAffairs.Tunisia.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 20thConclusions,Minute 4.)Cyprus.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 28thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet were informed that the French Governmenthad now accepted the proposals for a settlement with Tunisia whichhad been put forward through the good offices of the United Statesand the United Kingdom. If they succeeded in obtainingParliamentary support for this plan, progress might be made towards a settlement.The Foreign Secretary said that, in pursuance of the Cabinetsdecision of 1st April, his latest proposal on the Cyprus problem hadbeen explained to the Turkish Ambassador in London. The turksh foreign Minister was, however, about to carry out a series of visitsoverseas, and there seemed to be no prospect of making further progress for some weeks in negotiations on this question with either the Turkish or the Greek Government.The Prime Minister said that this was unfortunate, as theinternal situation in Cyprus seemed to be deteriorating. The position should be discussed at an early meeting of the Colonial Policy-Committee.C.C. 31 (58)Meeting of 1.   The Cabinet reviewed the latest exchanges regarding the heads of        proposed meeting of Heads of Governments.   In reply to theGovernments,    statement defining the attitude of the Western Powers towards this(Previous        proposal the Soviet Government had suggested that initial discussionsReference:      between Ambassadors should be opened in Moscow on 17th April.C.C. (58) 27th  There was still, however, an unresolved difference on the questionConclusions,     whether the holding of a meeting of Heads of Governments should minute 1.)       depend on the progress made in the preliminary preparations.   TheSoviet Government maintained their view that such a meeting shouldbe held in any event, since it might be possible to resolve at a higher level differences which could not be reconciled by Foreign Ministers.The United States Government, on the other hand, still consideredthat Heads of Governments should not meet unless the preliminaryexchanges had shown a reasonable prospect that fruitful results would flow from their meeting. They were insisting, with the supportof the French Government, that this point should again be stressedin the reply to the latest Soviet note.The Cabinet considered the terms of the draft reply proposed bythe United States Government. They agreed that, while it could properly be said that the success of a meeting of Heads of governments would depend on the adequacy of the preliminarypreparations, it would be inexpedient to stress this to the point at which it might provide the Soviet Government with a pretext for abandoning the project for a meeting. Changes in the wording of this part of the draft reply were suggested with this in view.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to suggest to the United StatesGovernment amendments of the draft reply to the latestSoviet note designed to meet the point raised in the cabinets discussion.
The Yemen.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 81stConclusions,Minute 7.)4.   The Cabinet had before them:  (i) A memorandum by the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs(C. (58) 79) on the question of retaliation against guns firing at targets in the Aden Protectorafe from inhabited villages in the Yemen, witha note on the legal position of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the aden Protectorate;(ii) A note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (C. (58) 80) covering draft instructions to the local Commander defining the nature and scope of such retaliatory action; and(iii) A note by the Foreign Secretary (C. (58) 81) on the legalimplications of counter-battery action against the Yemen.The Prime Minister said that our forces in the Aden Protectoratealready had authority to retaliate by gun fire or air attack againstYemeni guns sited in the open. It was for consideration whetherthis should now be extended to include retaliatory action againstguns sited in inhabited localities. The Yemenis had recently acquireda number of field guns and anti-aircraft guns from the Soviet bloc and the scale of their attacks was likely to increase. If we seemedunable to protect the local levies and tribesmen against these attacksour authority in the area would be undermined, and there was alsoa growing risk to our aircraft on flights over Protectorate territory.On the other hand, if we attacked guns sited in villages there was likely to be a public outcry, especially if civilian casualties were caused. The Defence Committee had therefore considered limitingany retaliatory attacks to precision fire with cannons and rockets.It was, however, for consideration whether we should also invokethe assistance of the United Nations in preserving order on thisfrontier or should at least report to the Security Council any actionwhich we took in exercise of the right of self-defence under Article 51of the Charter.In discussion there was general agreement that, although therehad so far been only a limited number of casualties to our forces as a result of these attacks, we could not allow the present situation to continue without seriously undermining our position in thefrontier areas. On the other hand we should be well-advised toavoid challenge in the United Nations for an apparent breach ofthe Charter. Our legal position vis-a-vis the Yemen about thefrontier would stand up to international examination, and it mightbe to our advantage that a further demarcation of the frontier shouldbe made under international supervision. Moreover, since the Yemenwas now working in association with the United Arab Republic,our disputes with the Yemen could no longer be regarded as minorfrontier incidents but must be considered against the widerbackground of the conflict between the rival Arab States in theKuwait The Foreign Secretary said that the Kuwait National AirlineAirline. wished to expand their activities, in association with some establishedairline. Negotiations which they had been conducting with B.O.A.C.seemed to have broken down. We had a strong political interestin preventing any foreign airline from gaining a foothold in Kuwait;and, if B.O.A..C. could not come to terms with the Kuwaitis, it was desirable that some other British operator should be persuaded togo into this venture.The Minister of Transport said that, while he saw the political importance of this, its commercial advantages were more doubtful.It was a relevant consideration that in the financial year which had just ended B.O.A.C. had incurred a net loss of about  2 millions.The Prime Minister asked that the Foreign Secretary and theMinister of Transport should jointly review this situation and submit their recommendations to him.
Territorial 5.   The Cabinet had before them telegrams from the Attorney-Waters. General and the Minister of Defence on the latest developments at(Previous        the International Conference on the Law of the Sea (GenevaReference:       telegram No. 173 and United Kingdom Permanent Delegation, Paris,C.C. (58) 28th telegram No. 231).  The United States Government had now decidedConclusions,     to put forward a compromise proposal under which the maximumMinute 8.)       breadth of territorial sea would be six miles, with an additionalsix miles for exclusive fishing, provided that nationals of any state which had fished in the outer six miles continuously during the past five years would have the right to continue to do so and that anydisagreement with respect to fisheries should be subject to arbitration.While this proposal did not reserve the right of unrestricted passagefor warships and aircraft between the three and six-mile limits,the United States Government hoped to secure amendment of theprovisions in the draft Convention relating to innocent passagewhich would preserve those rights through international straits.Unless these amendments could be secured it was possible that theUnited States proposal might restrict access by warships and military aircraft to certain strategically important areas, including gibraltar and Singapore.In discussion it was argued that, on military grounds, theGovernment could not support this United States proposal withoutfurther information on a number of legal questions. In particular,it was necessary to know:  (i) What construction was likely to be placed on the right of&quot; innocent passage &quot;;(ii) Whether or not warships, merchant ships and aircraft wouldhave the right to pass from one area of high seas to another throughor over international straits which would fall within territorial waters, with or without prior authorisation from the coastal states concerned;C.C. 31 (58)Middle East. In the circumstances it would seem advisable tobring the matter before the United Nations. A recent incidentin which one of our frontier patrols had been shelled would providesuitable grounds for a formal complaint to the Security Council,which should also include a report of the retaliatory action we hadbeen obliged to take in self-defence on that occasion. In recent discussions the Secretary-General of the United Nations had shownthat he was aware of the risks involved in any further encroachmentsby the United Arab Republic in the Middle East. He should beasked to advise how our complaint could best be brought beforethe United Nations. In the meantime no extension of the authorityfor retaliatory counter-battery action should be given to our forcesin the area and every effort should be made to avoid any incidentswhich might prejudice our case before the United Nations.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the LordChancellor and the Colonial Secretary, to prepare a formal protest, on the lines proposed in discussion, for submission to the United Nations.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the Secretary-General of the United Nations to be consulted on themost appropriate method of submitting this formal protest.(3) Agreed that, pending the outcome of this approach to theUnited Nations, there should be no extension of thepresent authority given to our forces in the aden protectorate to retaliate against Yemeni guns.
British 6.   The Minister of Labour said that, in reply to a ParliamentaryTransport Question on the following day, he proposed to make it clear that heCommission. could not intervene in the London bus dispute now that the Industrial(Previous Court had made its award. The statement would, however, be soReference: worded as not to preclude the action which he proposed to take inC.C. (58) 23rd the railways dispute.Conclusions, On this, the Minister said that representatives of the trade unionsMinute 8.) concerned were to meet the Chairman of the British transport commission on the following day. After that meeting the Chairmanwould discuss with the Minister of Transport the possibility of accelerating the railways&apos; modernisation programme and, by thismeans, of offering to the unions some hope of improved conditions.At a later stage the Prime Minister might meet representatives ofthe unions.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements by the Minister of Labour.Wilton Park. 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Foreign(Previous Secretary (C. (58) 72) proposing that Wilton Park should be retained,Reference: at least until the end of the financial year 1959-60, as an InstitutionC.C. (57) 34th for enabling visitors from West European countries to study theConclusions,     British way of life and British policies.Minute o.) jn rjiscussion it was suggested that the benefits obtained fromretaining Wilton Park, which would cost the Government about 25,000 a year, should be weighed against the advantages of othercultural and information services, or at least the possibility of achieving compensating reductions in other services should beconsidered if this expenditure was to continue.The Cabinet (1) Approved, in principle, the proposal in C. (58) 72.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, to consider whether compensatingreductions could be made in other British culturaland information services to cover the cost of retainingWilton Park.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th April, 1958.(iii) What right of access there would be through 01 overterritorial waters to territory controlled by the State to which theships or aircraft belonged.From the point of view of fisheries, the proposed exemption from the twelve-mile limit for States which had fished within it for five years appeared to safeguard our interests, although there mightbe some danger, if twelve miles&apos; exclusive fishing rights were accepted in principle, that the safeguards might subsequently be eroded.The Cabinet Decided to resume their discussion of this question at ameeting later in the day.
