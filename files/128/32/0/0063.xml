Land:compulsory acquisition.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 28thConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Housing and Local Government (C. (58) 151) proposing that legislation should be introduced in the 1958-59 session toprovide that the basis of compensation for compulsory acquisition ofland should be market value. They also had before them amemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (58) 154)questioning the political wisdom of legislating in this sense at thepresent time.The Minister of Housing recalled that, at an earlier meeting, theCabinet had authorised the drafting of a Bill for this purpose but had reserved for later consideration the question whether it wouldbe appropriate to include the Bill in the programme for theforthcoming session. After further examining the issues involvedhe remained convinced that legislation was unavoidable. It was nolonger possible to defend a system under which, in certaincircumstances, an owner received from a public authority whichcompulsorily acquired his land only a fraction of the amount whichhe would receive in a free sale to a private purchaser; and thisdisparity became intolerably acute when a single area was being developed for both local authority and private enterprise housing.It was clear from the debate on the Private Member&apos;s Bill recently introduced, and subsequently withdrawn, by Captain Corfield, M.P.,that the Governments supporters would be unwilling to acquiesceindefinitely in a&apos; refusal by the Government to remedy the patentinjustice of the existing law.In discussion some doubt was expressed whether this was asuitable subject for legislation in the last full session of the present parliament. Moreover, it would not be easy to justify payingcompensation at market value without making any provision forthe recovery of betterment; and a Bill on the lines proposed wouldbe liable to provoke the Opposition to declare that, at the first opportunity, they would introduce legislation imposing either a charge on betterment or a capital gains tax.On the other hand, the most extreme instances of bettermentusually arose on the outskirts of the New Towns; and the Bill wouldprovide that the principle of market value compensation should notapply to land purchased by the Development Corporations in areasalready designated as New Towns. In general, local authorities, whowere at present deterred from acquiring land which they needed bytheir reluctance to incur the odium of paying an artificially lowprice, would welcome the Bill. Nor should the proposal significantlyimpede the process of slum clearance, since the values on which theBill would operate were those of undeveloped, rather than developed,land.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that,although there were certain objections to legislation on this subject at the present time, the balance of political advantage appeared to lie in proceeding with the proposed Bill.The Cabinet Agreed that legislation should be introduced in the 1958-59session providing that the basis of compensation for compulsory acquisition of land should be market value,on the lines proposed in (C. (58) 151);
legislative programme :1958-59Session.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 29thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the HomeSecretary and the Minister of Housing and Local Government(C. (58) 155 and 163) about the legislative programme for the 1958-59session.The Home Secretary said that, after a further review of theprogramme, the Future Legislation Committee were satisfied thatall the Bills indicated in List A.1 in the Annex to C. (58) 155 were likely to remain essential and should be included in the programme.The list of contingent Bills indicated in List A.2 might need to be expanded to include first, the Reserve Forces Bill, in substitution for the proposed Bill extending the Army, Navy and Air ForceReserves Act, 1955, and, second, a Bill to extend diplomatic privileges and immunities to a representative of Euratom in this country.Since the Cabinet had now approved in principle the introduction ofan Emergency Laws (Repeal) Bill together with legislation dealingwith Compensation for the Compulsory Acquisition of Land, allthe five main Bills indicated in List B.1 could also be regarded as requiring a firm place in the programme.A programme constituted on this basis would probably exhaustvirtually all the legislative time likely to be available in theforthcoming session. It was therefore uncertain how far it wouldbe desirable to promote legislation on any of the minor programmeBills indicated in List B.2. But it would be reasonable, at this stage,to make provisional allowance for Bills dealing with the following subjects:  (i) New Towns;(ii) Wages Councils;(Hi) Assistance to small farmers;(iv) Assistance towards house purchase;(v) An increase in grant-aid to denominational schools;(vi) The licensing and insurance of nuclear reactors.In addition, it should be possible to accommodate Scottish Billsdealing with deer and building legislation, provided that it could beassumed that the debates on these Bills would be conducted at all stages in the Scottish Grand Committee.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Although it no longer appeared necessary to provide for aBill to effect the integration of Malta with the United Kingdom,legislation to suspend the Maltese Constitution might become necessary; and the list of contingent Bills in List A.2 should be interpreted accordingly.(b) It would probably became necessary to enact a very short bill postponing for two years the revaluation due to take effect inEngland and Wales in 1961. Provision should be made for thispurpose among the Bills likely to become essential.(c) Before a firm decision was taken to introduce the Deer(Scotland) Bill the views of the Forestry Commission should be ascertained.(d) In addition to the Bills which the Future legislation committee had selected from List B.2 for provisional inclusion inthe programme, favourable consideration should be given to a bill dealing with Matrimonial Proceedings in Magistrates&apos; Courts anda Bill on Family Allowances and National Insurance, designed togive effect to certain recommendations of the Committee on tribunals and Enquiries. It might also be necessary to contemplate adding tothis category a combined Bill dealing with Criminal Justice andMagistrates&apos; Courts and a Bill implementing some of therecommendations of the Committee on Homosexual Offences andProstitution.
commercial policy.Free trade area.(previous reference :CC. (58) 45thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Paymaster-General said that the negotiations for theestablishment of a European Free Trade Area had made little progress for several months, mainly as a result of the intransigenceof the French Governments. Our own position had therefore beengradually undermined, since other European countries had beencanvassing solutions to meet the French difficulties at our expense.There were some indications, however, that the Prime Minister^recent discussions with General de Gaulle had encouraged the FrenchGovernment to adopt a more co-operative attitude; and if, as aresult, the Six Powers were able to concert a more positive policy,it would be to our advantage to seize the opportunity provided bythe forthcoming meeting of the Inter-Governmental Committee on24th and 25th July to resume negotiations and to press them forward as rapidly as possible. If, on the other hand, the Six Powers were unable to offer any concessions on such important issues as theproblems of origin and institutions, we should decide, while not finally breaking off the negotiations, to suspend discussions and tomake it known in Europe that we should need to reconsider our policy. It would also be necessary to inform the Ministerial Councilof the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.)at their meeting on 28th and 29th July, that the Inter-governmental committee had been unable to reach agreement or to achieve any significant progress.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be undesirable for the United Kingdom to take any precipitate step which might be interpreted as a rupture of negotiations. Such action would be liable to have a damaging effect on European political unity and might compel the Scandinavian countries to accede to theCommon Market. On the other hand, it would be equally unwise,in the absence of any improvement in the attitude of the Six Powers,that we should agree to consider, even on a non-committal basis, any proposals which might be put forward for the conclusion of a provisional agreement involving an interim reduction in tariffs. Suchan agreement, unless it could be guaranteed to be the first step towards a genuine Free Trade Area, would be contrary to theinterests of this country and the Commonwealth and would beunfavourably received by the United States.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwould he unwise for the Government to commit themselves to a heavy programme of legislation in the last full session of the present parliament; and it would therefore be desirable that, at this stage,they should merely endorse the provisional programme which theHome Secretary had outlined. But in view of the political merits of certain of the Bills selected from List B.2 by the Future legislation committee, further consideration should be given to the possibilityof ensuring their inclusion in the programme e.g., by their introduction in the House of Lords, if possible.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (58) 155, as amended in their discussion.(2) Invited the Ministers responsible for the Bills provisionallyselected for inclusion in the 1958-59 legislative programme to seek policy clearance, where necessary,for those Bills and to issue drafting instructions as rapidly as possible.
government expenditure.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 44thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (58) 152) on government expenditure.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the latestDepartmental forecasts suggested that expenditure in 1959-60 was likely to be about  240 millions higher than the Estimates for thecurrent year and that it would rise by a further  140 millions in1960-61. These figures took no account either of possible increases in wages and prices or of a number of additional items of increased expenditure which could not, as yet, be assessed with any certainty.Revenue should remain reasonably buoyant during the current, year;but it would be unwise to assume that the yield of taxation at present rates would increase at a rate comparable with the threatened rateof increase in expenditure. Moreover, the expansion of investment in the public sector which would be desirable in principle, would be liable to exceed the probable growth in the national income and,if it was not to exert an inflationary effect, the other demands on thenation&apos;s resources, including the Governmenfs own expenditure,would need to be kept under control. It would therefore be necessaryto subject the whole range of civil and defence expenditure to a vigorous scrutiny in order to secure substantial economies. It wouldbe even more important to minimise, and if possible to avoid, any additional commitments beyond those already included in presentDepartmental forecasts.In discussion the following points were made:-(a) If unemployment proved to be higher than had been assumed in C. (58) 152, the need for a substantial surplus &quot; abovethe line &quot; would be reduced.(b) It would also be important that the rate of increase inGovernment expenditure should be considered in the perspectiveof the probable rate of growth of the national income.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that beforethe meeting of the Ministerial Council of O.E.E.C. took place the paymaster-General should endeavour to agree, with the ministers primarily concerned, the attitude which the United kingdom representative should adopt at that meeting in the light of the outcome of the discussions at the Inter-Governmental Committee. While itmight be undesirable that we should react too sharply to continuedintransigence on the part of the Six Powers, we might well bejustified in seeking to secure a temporary pause in the negotiations,particularly in view of the imminence of the commonwealth economic Conference at Montreal. It would be desirable that the paymaster-General should make a Parliamentary statement on theprogress of the negotiations before the summer recess.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Paymaster-General to be guided, during theforthcoming meeting of the Inter-governmental committee for the European Free Trade Area, by the considerations which had emerged during their discussion.(2) Invited the Paymaster-General to report the outcome of themeeting of the Inter-Governmental Committee to theMinisters primarily concerned, with a view to formulatingthe attitude which the United Kingdom representatives should adopt at the forthcoming meeting of the ministerial Council of the Organisation for european economic Co-operation.
industrial disputes.Docks.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 53rdConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Minister of Labour informed the Cabinet that the dockemployers and the trade unions concerned had now agreed to theestablishment of a Court of Inquiry into the dispute arising fromthe current wage claim by the dock workers. The fact that both parties had accepted this procedure represented an encouragingadvance.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement.(c) If, as was possible, no significant cost increases, other thanin wages, occurred in agriculture, some reduction in Governmentoutlay might be achieved at the next annual review of agricultural prices.(d) Any proposal to expand revenue by, e.g., further increases in the National Insurance and National Health Service contributions,would be unwelcome to the Governments supporters.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, ifit became necessary for the Government to adopt a reflationarypolicy, they would find it difficult to implement the appropriate measures without stimulating a recurrence of inflation if the economy was already burdened by an unduly high level of government expenditure. It would, therefore, be desirable that the cabinet should give early consideration to the problems implicit in the risinglevel of Government expenditure. It would be helpful if, as a first step, the Chancellor of the Exchequer would undertake a comprehensive review of civil expenditure in an endeavour to identifythose categories in which significant economies might be achieved.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C. (58) 152 and of the points made in discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give furtherconsideration to the possibility of securing economies in Government expenditure on the lines indicated bythe Prime Minister.
