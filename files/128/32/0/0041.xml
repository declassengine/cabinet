CC. 41 (58)Meedng of.Heads of governments.(previous reference :CC. (58) 34thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C. (58) 96) analysing the arguments for and againstconceding the principle of parity of representation at a meetingof Heads of Governments and at all preparatory meetings, apart from individual meetings between the Soviet Minister of Foreign affairs and the Ambassadors of the Western Powers.The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Governmentremained opposed to any concession of this principle on the groundthat it would constitute a dangerous precedent in other connections.We had already agreed, however, that, if countries other than thethree Western Powers and the Soviet Union were to take part in ameeting of Heads of Governments, we would support the claim of theItalian Government to be represented. Moreover, it would notnecessarily be wholly to our disadvantage if Soviet satellites, such asPoland and Czechoslovakia, were also represented at the meeting.This question would need further consideration in due course.The Cabinet Took note of C. (58) 96.Antarctica. 2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous Foreign Secretary, the Commonwealth Secretary and the ColonialReference: Secretary (C. (58) 97) recommending that we should endorse aCM (55) 42nd proposal by the United States Government to convene a conference ofMinuteS15 )S&apos; a^ tne countl&quot;ies which had conducted scientific research in Antarcticaduring the International Geophysical Year in order to secure acceptance of an international regime in. the continent which would secure the non-militarisation of Antarctica, the promotion of scientificactivities in the area, and the perpetuation of the legal status quo asregards disputes about territorial sovereignty.The Foreign Secretary said that he had already thought it right toindicate, in reply to Questions in Parliament, that the Governmentwere giving sympathetic consideration to this proposal. It would beto our advantage to secure the establishment of an internationalregime of the kind which the United States had in mind; and the termsof reference of the conference should not prejudice the desire of theAustralian Government to retain the exclusive right to exploit mineral resources in the Antarctic areas over which they claimed sovereignty.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (58) 97.Security inthe Colonies.(previous reference :CM. (55) 26thConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord Chancellor(C. (58) 92) covering a report by the Committee on Security in the colonies the Lord Chancellor said that this report completed the workwhich the Committee had been charged to undertake in implementing the recommendations made by Sir Gerald Templer in 1955. TheCommittee might now be disbanded; but it was desirable that furtherinter-departmental consideration should be given to the only main issue on which agreement had not been reached, i.e., the question of a united Kingdom contribution to the cost of improved housing for colonial police forces.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of C. (58) 92.(2) Agreed that the Ministerial Committee on Security in theColonies should now be disbanded.
S4[ 084. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (58) 99) proposing that if, in defiance of the pressure which was being brought to bear upon them, the Icelandic Govern-ment made a unilateral claim to extended fishery rights, we shoulddeclare not only that we did not recognise their claim or accept anydiminution of our rights on the high seas, but also that we shouldprotect British fishing vessels within the area of the high seas over which the Icelandic Government had claimed exclusive rights.The Foreign Secretary said that the Icelandic Government were now reported to be considering a proposal that the baselines fromwhich territorial waters were measured should be amended in iceland&apos;s favour; that they should immediately claim exclusive fishing rights in a twelve-mile zone measured from the amended baselines; butthat, subject to the amendment of the baselines, there should be some limited preservation of historic fishing rights enjoyed by other nationsoutside the four-mile limit at present claimed. It was, however,uncertain whether the Icelandic Government would in fact adopt theseproposals.In discussion there was general agreement that, while an amendment of baselines in Iceland&apos;s favour would require detailed study before we could determine our attitude towards it, v/we should declare that we did not recognise any unilateral claim byIceland to extended fishery rights. But a declaration of non-recognition would not suffice; and it was only by providing effective protection for British fishing vessels within the disputed area that wecould avoid prejudicing our position at the next international conference on Territorial Waters. Economic sanctions would be largely valueless for this purpose, especially since a boycott onIcelandic fish would injure our own interests more than those of iceland.In order that Iceland should incur the responsibility of being thefirst to resort to force, the protection provided by the Royal Navy toBritish trawlers should be non-aggressive. But our ships should fishonly in those areas which could be kept under naval surveillance and,if ordered to put into an Icelandic port, should refuse to do so. Ifforce was used against them, we should need either to retaliate or torefer the incident to the United Nations or the International Court ofJustice.There were, however, practical difficulties in providing a sufficient number of fishery protection vessels. Moreover, before a finaldecision was taken, it would be desirable to ascertain the views of theUnited States Government, whose air base and radar installations in iceland formed an important element in the Western defence system.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Government should not commit themselves to protecting british vessels without first being sure that adequate measures for thispurpose could in fact be adopted. It would also be necessary toconsider, without delay, the political and legal implications of thevarious possible courses of action.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Agriculture and the First Lord of theAdmiralty, to circulate, as a matter of urgency,  a1 erntorialWaters.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 35thConclusions,Minute 5.)(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Colonial Secretary, to arrange that the question of a united Kingdom contribution to the cost of improvedhousing for Colonial police forces should be re-examinedlater in the year, with a view to providing in the financialyear 1959-60 any additional expenditure which might beagreed.
Wages Policy. 5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterNational Health of Health (C. (58) 101) on the latest developments in the negotiationsService.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 26thConclusions,Minute 3.)on a new grading structure and pay scales for the administrative andclerical staff of the National Health Service.The Minister of Health said that, after agreement had beenreached on the pay scales and grading structure, the negotiations had broken down on the assimilation terms offered by the ManagementSide with the concurrence of the Government and on the date of operation of the new scales. The Staff Side had proposed that thesetwo issues should be submitted to arbitration, but the ManagementSide had been persuaded to accept arbitration only on the basis thatit would comprise also the proposals relating to grading and pay-scales. The Staff Side were not likely to accept this counter-proposalunless they were allowed to refer, during the arbitration, to theprevious negotiations, including the agreement on revised pay scales.They could not in fact be prevented from doing so.In discussion it was suggested that it might be embarrassing if it became known that the Government had concurred in a pay settlement which, considered without reference to the assimilationterms, awarded to certain grades increases of remuneration of theorder of 10-15 per cent, at the maximum. On the other hand there appeared to be no practical alternative to the course proposed. TheManagement Side should, however, emphasise the statements made onbehalf of the Government during the negotiations that the method of implementing such new salary scales as might be agreed must bedetermined with full regard to the current economic situation.The Cabinet-Approved the proposal in C. (58) 101.commercial policy.Butter.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 39thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Commonwealth Secretary said that, after further discussion with the Ministers concerned, he proposed that the deputy prime Minister of New Zealand, Mr. Skinner, should be informedthat the Government were prepared to reduce imports of butter intothe United Kingdom by approximately 40,000 tons. This figure wouldbe achieved by reducing imports from the Irish Republic, Sweden and finland by 15,000 tons in aggregate and imports from Poland by17,000 (or possibly 15,000) tons. Imports from the Argentine were expected to fall by 8,300 tons in 1958 without action on our part. Itshould be made clear to Mr. Skinner that this represented a decision by the Government which was not open to further negotiation andthat if, as a result of the action proposed, supplies of butter in theUnited Kingdom were either smaller or dearer, the Government wouldbe compelled to reconsider their policy.Discussion showed that, in principle, there was general agree-ment with this proposal.The following points were made :  (a) It was desirable for political reasons not to curtail imports of polish butter by more than was strictly necessary. Poland had alreadyexported 11,000 tons of butter to the United Kingdom during 1958C.C. 41 (58)memorandum on the protection of British vessels fishingwithin any area of the high seas over which the icelandic government might unilaterally claim exclusive fisheryrights.(2) Invited the Attorney-General to circulate a memorandum onour legal grounds for resisting such a claim, if necessary bythe use of force.
and a further 9,000 tons were expected before the end of the year. ThePolish Government should therefore be informed that for the next twelve months we would accept imports only at the rate of 3,000 to5,000 tons, the actual figures to be determined later.(b) Although British production of butter was increasing, thecurrent rise in consumption suggested that, if imports were reducedby 40,000 tons a year, a shortage might develop by the end of the year.We should not, therefore, enter into any commitment to maintain apermanent reduction in imports on this scale.(c) A rise in the price of butter to 2s. 9d. per pound would meanan increase of 0-16 in the cost-of-living index.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to inform the deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand that, subject to thepoints made in their discussion, Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment were prepared to reduce imports of butter into theUnited Kingdom by an amount of the order of 40,000 tonsa year.(2) Invited the Minister of State, Board of Trade to inform theGovernments of the Irish Republic, Sweden, Finland and poland that their exports of butter to the United kingdom would be reduced by the amounts agreed in the discussion.agricultural policy.Assistance to small Farmers.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 22ndConclusions.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture (C. (58) 98) and a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (58) 100) discussing proposals for increasing the scale of financial assistance to small farmers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that these proposals, whichhad been examined by the Ministerial Committee on the Farm price review, comprised first, a small farmer scheme, designed to assistthose small farm businesses which were fundamentally sound economic propositions; and, second, a supplementary and temporaryscheme, designed both to replace the existing marginal productionschemes in assisting those businesses which were not sufficiently largeto be viable in the foreseeable future and to provide interim assistance for small farmers who had viable businesses but were not yet able toundertake a programme of comprehensive improvements. While thesmall farmer scheme was economically defensible, the supplementary scheme was more open to question, and the scale of the assistance which it envisaged would need to be carefully examined. Moreover,the Exchequer expenditure implied by the proposals as a whole might amount, in the initial years, to about  15 millions a year. It was not certain how far it would be possible to recover this outlay by priceadjustments in future Farm Price Reviews; and the operation ofschemes on the scale proposed would place a considerable strain onthe administrative resources of the Ministry of Agriculture. It was forconsideration, therefore, whether the proposals should be launched ona rather more modest scale than the Minister of Agriculture had suggested.The Minister of Agriculture said that, since the supplementary scheme would replace the existing marginal production schemes, itshould not entail additional expenditure of more than about 1^ millions. Moreover, the expenditure implied in both schemes should be largely recoverable in the annual Price Reviews; and the netadditional outlay of the Exchequer, possibly some  5 millions, wouldbe attributable to production grants designed to increase the productivity of the industry. The administrative implications of theproposals would need to be further studied; but it was desirable that,in initiating discussions with the National Farmers&apos; Unions that day,he should be able to indicate that, in the light of the criteria which itwas proposed to adopt, some 130,000 small farm businesses would be
8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof State for Foreign Affairs (C. (58) 95) about the financial negotiationswith the Egyptian Government.The Foreign Secretary said that it now seemed probable that theEgyptian Government would propose a lump sum settlement of all outstanding claims for compensation. While this would have certain advantages it would leave with us the responsibility for distributing the lump sum among individual claimants. He therefore proposed that,pending a resumption of the negotiations, he should institute a preliminary study of possible methods of distribution.In discussion it was recognised that political pressure for the satisfaction of the claimant was increasing and that, if the egyptian government were not prepared to resume negotiations in the nearfuture, it might become necessary to consider whether any furtherpayment should be made to the claimants from the Exchequer.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C. (58) 95.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, tc arrange for an examina-tion of the means by which any lump sum payment by theEgyptian Government would best be distributed amongindividual claimants to compensation.Egypt.financial negotiations.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 20thConclusions,Minute 3.)eligible for assistance, of whom 30,000 would be entitled to benefit under the small farmer scheme while 100,000 would receivesupplementary assistance.In discussion, it was suggested that until it was possible to judgemore clearly the implications of these proposals from both thefinancial and the administrative points of view, it would be wise that discussions with the National Farmers&apos; Unions should be conducted in general terms and that the Government should not be committed to any formula purporting to define precisely the qualifications forassistance or the number of small businesses likely to be entitled to benefit.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals in C. (58) 98.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to discuss those proposals in general terms with the National Farmers&apos;Unions and to report the results of these discussions in due course to, the Ministerial Committee on the Farm price review.
