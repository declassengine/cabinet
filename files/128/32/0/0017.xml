ForeignAffairs.Tunisia.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 81stConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the situation in Tunisia hadeased since the end of the previous week. It now seemed probablethat, although the Tunisian Government would still insist on raising the matter in the Security Council, they would be content that theproceedings should be formal and should be adjourned withoutdiscussion. This should enable direct negotiations to be initiatedbetween the French and Tunisian Governments, and he was working to this end in close consultation with the United States Government.52960-19b 2Prime J.   The Prime Minister expressed his gratitude to the HomeMinisters Secretary and other members of the Cabinet for their handling of theCommonwealth political and Parliamentary problems which had arisen during hisTour. Commonwealth tour.   At the time of his departure it had been hard to know whether it was wise to undertake this journey, but the eventhad amply proved that it had been right to carry out the programmeoriginally planned. The Government had overcome the immediate difficulties which had then confronted them at home; and his mission.,which had everywhere been proclaimed a success, had helped toemphasise the strength and unity of the new Commonwealth. In the asian countries of the Commonwealth, and especially in India, hehad been impressed by the respect in which the British people were now held and by the balanced view which was taken by leaders ofopinion on the value of their connection, past and present, with britain. In Australia and New Zealand he had everywhere foundevidence of strong loyalty to the United Kingdom, based on commonorigins and common allegiance to the Crown; and the keen desire thatthe economic development of those countries should be based on british manpower and British capital reflected the strong emotionalurge that these countries should preserve their British character. Itwas natural therefore that people in Australia and New Zealandshould at first have felt some misgivings about the admission of Asianand African members to the Commonwealth; and even now theyshowed less interest in them than they should. The United kingdom had a duty to interpret the new members of the Commonwealth tothe old; to emphasise the significance of a Commonwealth associationwhose members were united by their common belief in the principlesof Parliamentary democracy and individual freedom; and to indicate the importance of the role which this unique association could play in the world struggle between the forces of tyranny and of freedom.This presented a challenge to Commonwealth statesmanship andmight well prove to be an inspiration, not only to the new membersof the Commonwealth, but to people in this country as well.In the United Kingdom people were passing through a period ofdisillusionment which was comparable with that of the early 1930&apos;s.Political success would come to the Party which could offer somepractical prospect of relief from the growing sense of frustration, in both foreign and domestic affairs. This was the task to which ministers must address themselves in the months ahead.The Home Secretary expressed to the Prime Minister, on the cabinet&apos;s behalf, their sincere appreciation of the success of his mission. He had, by undertaking it, rendered great service to thiscountry and to the Commonwealth as a whole.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the success andsignificance of the Prime Ministers journey were amply confirmed bythe reports which he had received from all the countries visited.The Cabinet-Took   note   of   the   Prime   Minister^   report   on   hisCommonwealth tour and expressed their appreciation ofthe outstanding success which he had achieved.
ballisticMissiles,(previous reference:&apos;C.C. (58) 16thConclusions,, Minute 5.)3. The Prime Minister said that, after considering the draft agreement with the United States Government for the deployment of intermediate range ballistic missiles in this country, he had invitedPresident Eisenhower to accept amendment of the draft text at three points in order to forestall political criticism in this country. As aresult, the United States Government no longer wished to stipulate that, if the training of Royal Air Force personnel had not beencompleted by the date when the first squadron was operationallydeployed, the site would be manned by the United States Air Force;and it was now envisaged that the Royal Air Force would man thefirst site from the outset, on the understanding that, if enough trained personnel were not available in time, the position would bere considered. It had also been agreed that the wording ofparagraph 7 of the draft Memorandum of Agreement, which couldbe read as implying that the missiles would be launched automaticallyif any member of the North Atlantic Alliance was attacked, shouldbe amended in order to emphasise that the decision to launch themissiles would be a matter for joint decision by the United Kingdomand United States Governments, although the two Governments, in reaching their decision, would have regard to the undertaking whichthey had assumed under Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty.Finally, it had been agreed that paragraph 10 of the draft memorandum of Agreement, which prescribed that the agreement should remain in force indefinitely subject to revision or terminationat five-yearly intervals, should be redrafted to provide that theAgreement would remain in force for not less than five years fromits initial date but might thereafter be terminated by either government upon six months&apos; notice.The Cabinet (1) Approved the draft Agreement with the United States&quot; Government for the deployment of intermediate rangeballistic units in this country, subject to the amendmentsindicated by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct H.M. ambassador in Washington to arrange, if possible, for the documentscomprising this Agreement to be signed on 24th February.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence to announce the conclusionof the Agreement in Parliament on 24th February and toarrange for the simultaneous publication of a White Papercomprising such parts of it as need not remain secret.*4.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the foreign secretary (C.(58) 43 and 44) about Cyprus.C.C. (58) 14th The Foreign Secretary said that, as a result of his recentConclusions,     discussions with the Turkish and Greek Governments, he believed Minute 2.)       although the Governor of Cyprus did not share his view that theformer would accept a solution of the problem of Cyprus which provided them with a strategic base in the Island and adequateCyprus.(previous reference:Sudan.(previous references:CM. (55) 29thConclusions,Minute and 40thConclusions.-Minute 5.)The Foreign Secretary said that the Egyptian claim that thefrontier between Egypt and the Sudan should be adjusted in favour gmof Egypt might prove, on examination, to be well founded. We Wshould be wise to avoid intervening in the dispute at this stage,particularly since it was liable to become an issue in the forthcomingelections in the Sudan. We had no specific obligation to defend theterritory of the Sudan.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.
safeguards for the Turkish minority, while the latter might be induced to acquiesce in a compromise of this kind provided that the Islandremained a unity and that any suggestion of its ultimate partition washenceforward abandoned. On this hypothesis, it would be premature to make any Parliamentary announcement of the governments intentions in detail or to hold out any hope that the emergency mightbe terminated in the near future. But further discussions with theTurkish Government should be initiated forthwith, in order to explore the possibility of their accepting a settlement on the lines which hehad indicated and to clarify their conception of the scope of a Turkishbase in Cyprus. We should also put in hand urgently our ownexamination of the implications of granting military bases in the island to Turkey, and possibly to Greece, and should prepare a plan for the constitutional development of that area of Cyprus which wouldnot be comprised in the strategic bases which the United Kingdom,.Greece and Turkey would enjoy.In discussion it was suggested that, if we conceded that greek and Turkish military bases might be established in Cyprus at anytime during the period in which we remained responsible for thegovernment of the Island and for the maintenance of internal security,we should merely provide the Greek and Turkish Governments with additional facilities for introducing arms into the Island and soprovoking communal strike on an unprecedented scale. It was forconsideration, therefore, whether we should at least seek to confineour concession to the creation of a Turkish zone in the Island whichthe Turkish Government would not be entitled to transform into amilitary base until the date on which self-determination took effect.On the other hand it was unlikely that the Turkish Government would now be prepared to defer their acquisition of a strategic base in cyprus for so long a period as the seven years which had hitherto been regarded as the necessary prelude to the exercise ofself-determination. Nor was it, in fact, realistic to suppose that afinal settlement could be postponed for as long as seven years. Thelatest discussions with the Greek and Turkish Governments had revealed that we must now achieve a solution of this problem in thenear future. Only two courses of action were open to us. We coulddecide to continue to govern the Island under British sovereignty,provided that we were prepared to face the revival of terrorism andto retain large numbers of British troops in the Island for an indefinite period. Alternatively, we could take account of the new situationwhich had arisen as the result of Turkey&apos;s recent assertion of herinterest in Cyprus and could seek to persuade the Turks to abandon their previous insistence on partition in return for a compromise-settlement on the lines indicated by the Foreign Secretary. The latter course was clearly the wiser, particularly if it proved possible to attachsuch conditions to the establishment of a Turkish base in the Islandas would enable us to prevent the base from being used as a centre for the distribution of arms and the incitement of communal strife.If these arrangements could be embodied in a formal treaty, whichmight be guaranteed by the United States or the North Atlantic treaty organisation, there was some hope that the Greek and turkish governments would accept them as providing a durable basis ofco-existence in the Island. At the same time we should explore, as amatter of urgency, the best method of promoting constitutional development in the remainder of the Island, including the possibilityof establishing a condominium of the three Powers on the lines whichhad been contemplated at an earlier stage.The Cabinet-(1) Approved, in principle, the proposals in C. (58) 44.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to make a short statement inthe House of Commons that afternoon, referring to our
intention to continue to discuss with the Greek and turkish Governments the possibility of a solution of the cyprus problem and reaffirming our resolve to maintain   \J:law and order in the Island.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to initiate further discussions with the Turkish Government in order to ascertain whether they would accept a compromise solution on thelines indicated in the discussion and to clarify theirconception of a Turkish base in Cyprus.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would instruct theSecretary of the Cabinet to arrange for officials to examineurgently the implications of granting military bases in cyprus to the Greek and Turkish Governments and toprepare a plan for the constitutional development of those parts of the Island which would not be comprised in the strategic bases to be maintained under United Kingdom,Greek and Turkish sovereignty.territorial waters.(PreviousR reference:C.C. (53) 75thConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (58) 37) discussing the policy in respect of the breadth of territorial waters which the United Kingdom delegation should support at an International Conference on the Law of the Sea whichwas to begin at Geneva on 24th February. Although it remained in our interest to maintain our traditional support of a three-mile limit on territorial waters, the Soviet Government and their satelliteswere unlikely to accept any limit less than twelve miles. Twocompromise proposals had been put forward, the first extending thethree-mile limit to six miles, the second maintaining the limit of territorial waters at three miles but allowing coastal States to enjoyexclusive fishing rights up to twelve miles. The former was open to serious strategic objections, particularly in respect of access to suchbases as Gibraltar, Singapore and Hong Kong. The latter wouldhave a most damaging effect on the British fishing industry.The Attorney-General said that our position had already beenweakened by the declaration of the International Law commission that international law did not permit the extension of the territorial sea beyond twelve miles. Tn the light of this implicit admission thatterritorial waters could properly extend to twelve miles from the shore, he had little hope that it would be possible to persuade theConference to retain the three-mile limit. It would be necessary,therefore, to seek to ascertain, by discussion with other delegationsat the Conference, which of the other possible courses of action was most likely to command support, bearing in mind that, although themajority view of the Conference would not in itself be binding on thenations represented, it would be liable to determine the ruling of theInternational Court of Justice in the first test case which arose.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The proposal that coastal States should enjoy exclusive fishing rights up to twelve miles from the shore would deprive ourown distant-water trawlers of at least 20 per cent, of their catch andwould inevitably provoke them to demand substantial financialassistance from the Government. If this proposal was formally-adopted by the Conference, there was little hope that we could makebilateral agreements with individual coastal States modifying the twelve-mile limit.(b) A six-mile limit for all purposes might, therefore, be preferable.The Chiefs of Staff regarded this alternative as acceptable only if itwas combined with a reservation of all air and sea passage rights asthey existed at present. There could be no certainty, however, thatwe should succeed in securing such a reservation. Moreover, if wesupported a six-mile limit for territorial waters proper, the Conference,
while endorsing this proposal, might also adopt a twelve-mile limit for exclusive fishing rights; and we should then have beenout-manoeuvred at every point.(c) On the other hand, it could be argued that there was no legalvalidity in an assertion of exclusive fishing rights beyond the limits of territorial waters; and our right course, therefore, would be to seek to persuade the other major maritime nations to agree on theminimum extension of the breadth of territorial waters for all purposes.The Prime Minister summing up the discussion, said that our aim must be to promote a majority decision by the Conference whichwould inflict the least damage on our own interests, both strategic and economic. Our delegation should be guided primarily by this&apos;consideration; and the Cabinet should be given an opportunity toconsider the issues further in the light of developments&apos; at the.Conference.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Attorney-General to.be guided, during theforthcoming International Conference on the Law of theSea, by the points made in their discussion and to report further to the Cabinet before finally committing theGovernment to the support of any particular policy.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the commonwealth secretary to seek to enlist the support of the foreign and Commonwealth Governments concerned for thearguments which the United Kingdom delegation wouldadvance at the Conference.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,18th February, 1958.
