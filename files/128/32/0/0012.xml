Cyprus.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 8thConclusions,Minute 5.)*The Cabinet had before them Ankara telegram No. 193 of28th January from the Foreign Secretary, reporting the result of hisdiscussion of the Cyprus problem with the Turkish Government.The Home Secretary said that this discussion had revealed thatthe Turkish Government were seeking to insist on three stipulations first, that the Turkish Cypriot community should be given a rightof veto on constitutional development during the interim period before the exercise of self-determination; second, that our existingundertaking that the right of self-determination would be accorded to the Turkish equally with the Greek Cypriot community should be embodied in a formal agreement between the United Kingdom and turkish Governments; and, third, that Turkey (and Greece, ifnecessary) should be granted a military base on the Island forthwith.The first stipulation might be satisfied by amending the draft parliamentary statement so as to make it clear that the form of representative institutions to be established in Cyprus during the interim period would be a matter for discussion between theGovernor and representative leaders of the two communities in the island. Moreover, although the statement should not include any reference to a formal agreement guaranteeing the Turkish right to optfor partition of the Island, we could inform the Turkish Governmentthat we should be prepared to give favourable consideration to thepossibility of such an agreement. The statement could also indicatethat we proposed to convene a tripartite conference to consider the strategic future of Cyprus and the possibility of establishing Turkishand Greek bases in the Island. In Ankara telegram No. 196 theGovernor of Cyprus, who had taken part in the Foreign Secretary&apos;discussions with the Turkish Government, had expressed his conviction that, in the absence of some indication of our willingness to conciliate the Turkish desire for a base in Cyprus, the TurkishGovernment would maintain their complete opposition to our proposals. While the possibility of Greek acquiescence in those proposals v/ould be reduced if the Parliamentary statement were amended on the lines suggested, the Greek Government could not reasonably object to a tripartite conference of strategic problemsbetween.allies and, in any case, it would be better to accept the risksimplied in launching our new initiative rather than invite a freshoutbreak of violence in Cyprus by failing to take any positive action.In discussion it was suggested that the grant to the turkish cypriot community of a veto on constitutional development wouldbe liable to arrest any progress in this respect during the interim period and that our undertaking to consider a treaty guaranteeingTurkish rights to partition would make it less likely that the problemof Cyprus would be insulated from party political controversy.Moreover, while it might have been reasonable to envisage a Turkishbase in Cyprus as a concession which we should be prepared tomake, at a later stage in the negotiations, in return for theabandonment of the Turkish demand for partition, it would beimplicit in any acceptance of the establishment of a Turkish baseforthwith that we should forfeit all prospect of securing Greekacquiescence in our proposals. We must not appear to be yieldingto the recent outbreak of Turkish violence in Cyprus; and it mightbe wiser, therefore, to publish our proposals in their present form inan endeavour to mobilise moderate opinion in support of this attemptto bring to an end the present strife in the Island.On the other hand it would not, in fact, be possible to achieve anygenuine constitutional advance without Turkish co-operation.Moreover, the proposals for a formal agreement with the TurkishGovernment recognising their right to insist on partition and for theestablishment of a Turkish base in Cyprus represented relatively little* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
advance on the course of action which the Cabinet had already approved in their earlier discussion of the draft parliamentary statement in its original form. But although, on a balance of considerations, there seemed to be no alternative to proceeding on thelines proposed by the Foreign Secretary if our initiative was to bemaintained, we should seek to secure the maximum room for manoeuvre in subsequent discussions with the Greek Government byomitting from the draft statement any explicit reference to the possibleestablishment of a Turkish (or Greek) base in Cyprus and by confiningourselves to undertaking to hold a conference as soon as possible toconsider the strategic needs of our Allies during the seven-yearinterim period. This conference could, if necessary, include representatives of the United States Government and the north atlantic Alliance. It would also be necessary to reconsider, in thelight of the latest outbreak of violence in Cyprus, the passages in thedraft statement which indicated that the state of emergency in the island would be declared at an end forthwith.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State for Foregin Affairs(Mr. Ormsby-Gore) to arrange for the despatch of atelegram to the Foreign Secretary in Ankara on the lines indicated in their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th January, 1958.
