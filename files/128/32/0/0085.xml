CC. 85 (58)Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the week following the Christmas recess.GovernmentInformationServices.(previous reference :CC. (58) 76thConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary and the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster (C. (58) 252) on possible methods of promoting theCommonwealth ideal in the United Kingdom.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the general public in this country had insufficient knowledge and unstanding of the Commonwealth and that there was scope for a modestprogramme of publicity designed to attract the support of the manyvoluntary organisations which were interested in various aspects ofthe Commonwealth. The work done in schools by the CommonwealthInstitute might usefully be expanded; an up-to-date and well-prepared popular booklet on the Commonwealth should be published and steps should be taken to encourage the sale of the variouspublications on the Commonwealth by the Central Office ofInformation; a travelling Commonwealth exhibition should beprepared for display in leading cities and towns, which should also be encouraged to organise a series of &quot;Commonwealth weeks&quot;, and greater interest in the Commonwealth by the Press and televisionservices should be stimulated. In addition, the Government should support the efforts of the Nuffield Foundation to sponsor preparations for holding, preferably in the autumn of 1959, a conference of voluntary organisations with Commonwealth interests and associa-tions. The cost of measures of this kind need not exceed some 80,000 a year.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals;and the Cabinet were informed that the Chancellor of the exchequer would not raise objection to the expenditure involved. The voluntary organisations concerned tended, however, to be jealous of one another, and the most effective means of enlisting their co-operationmight be to launch some project to which they could all contributewithout sacrifice of their respective identities. A CommonwealthYouth Service might constitute such a project, and it could be developed in collaboration with the various youth serviceorganisations in this country. In addition, special attention shouldcontinue to be given to the arrangements for welcoming Common-wealth students and visitors to the United Kingdom.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (58) 252.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Commonwealth Secretary, colonial secretary, Secretary of State for Scotland and Minister ofEducation, to give further consideration to the desirabilityof launching a project for a Commonwealth Youth service in the context of the proposed conference of voluntary organisations concerned to promote the Commonwealthideal.PrisonReform.(previous reference :CC. (58) 52ndConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (58) 251) to which was annexed a draft White Paper onPenal Reform.The Home Secretary said that this White Paper had beenprepared in accordance with the Cabinefs suggestion that it would be
timely and appropriate to publish in the near future a statement of the government&apos;s intentions on penal reform. It discussed possible improvements in existing penal methods and proposed a series of measures, including a programme of new prison building, whichshould ensure that the unsatisfactory state of many prisons would be remedied within a reasonable period and that conditions of life and work in the prisons would be better adapted to provide treatmentappropriate to different categories of criminal. Some of theseproposals would require legislation and the White Paper representedan attempt to promote, as a preliminary step, informed discussion ofthe complex issues involved.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The increase in the number of young offenders was strikingevidence of a decline in spiritual values among the younger section ofthe adult population. It was for consideration whether, when theWhite Paper was published, the Government should convene an informal conference, to be attended by representatives of the churches,the educational authorities and the youth services, in an endeavour topromote a greater concern for the moral and physical well-being of young people.(b) A fresh attempt was needed, in collaboration with employersand trade unions, to provide greater scope for constructive work inprisons and detention centres. The trade unions had hitherto been reluctant to accept, or to co-operate in, measures for this purpose; butthe White Paper might emphasise the importance of overcomingobstruction of this kind and indicate the action which had alreadybeen taken, including the appointment of a special adviser in the HomeOffice, to enlarge the opportunities for useful employment in prisons.(c) The new programme of prison building was one of the most effective steps which could be taken to promote penal reform; andit was for consideration whether the paragraphs dealing with thissubject should be brought forward to an earlier and more prominentsection of the White Paper.(d) There was no need at present for a corresponding white paper in relation to Scotland. But steps should be taken to indicate,at the appropriate moment, the Governmenfs policy for penal reform in Scotland.The Cabinet (1) Approved, in principle, the draft White Paper on PenalReform annexed to C. (58) 251.(2) Invited Ministers to communicate to the Home Secretarysuch detailed amendments of drafting and presentation asthey wished to propose.(3) Invited the Home Secretary to publish the White Paper earlyin 1959.(4) Invited the Home Secretary to convene, at an appropriate time in relation to the publication of the White Paper, an informal conference of the churches and other organisa-tions concerned with the moral and physical welfare of young people.(5) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to arrange to give,in answer to a Parliamentary Question at the time whenthe White Paper was published, an indication of theGovernments policy for penal reform in Scotland.
StreetOffencesBill.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 63rdConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (58) 249) to which was annexed a draft Bill onStreet Offences.The Home Secretary said that, in accordance with the recom-mendations of the Committee on Homosexual Offences andProstitution (the Wolf end en Committee), the Bill contained a newdefinition of &quot; street offences &quot; which omitted any reference to the element of annoyance. It substantially increased the penalties both forstreet offences and for certain offences, connected with all-night cafeswhere prostitutes were allowed to congregate. In accordance with a minority recommendation of the Wolfenden Committee, it also increased the penalty for living on the immoral earnings of a prostitute.A Bill on these lines would accord with the general feeling of theHouse of Commons, as expressed in the recent debate on theCommittee&apos;s Report, and he proposed that it should be introduced before the recess.Discussion showed that there was general agreement with theseproposals. It was unfortunately impossible to avoid the use of the term &quot; common prostitute &quot; in the Bill, since any definition of streetoffences which required the police to produce elaborate evidencewould make the Bill unenforceable and the use of the term would initself provide some protection to respectable women against wrongfularrest. It would, on the other hand, provoke opposition fromwomen&apos;s organisations, who would also object to the fact that the bill would not penalise the male customers of prostitutes. But although itwas not possible to re-enact in the Bill Section 32 of the SexualOffences Act, 1956 (which dealt with soliciting by men) withoutwidening the scope of the Bill to include homosexual practices, theproposal to increase the maximum penalty for living on the immoralearnings of a prostitute should help to placate criticism of this kind.The Cabinet Approved the draft Bill on Street Offences annexed toC. (58) 249, subject to any drafting amendments whichmight be found necessary, and authorised its introduction inthe House of Commons before the Christmas recess.ObscenePublicationsBill.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 84thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet had before them a report by a Sub-Committee ofthe Home Affairs Committee on the Obscene Publications Bill(C. (58) 250).The Home Secretary said that arrangements had been made for a debate to be held that day in the House of Commons on a motion totake note of the report, made during the previous session, of the SelectCommittee on Obscene Publications. The two main amendments ofthe present law which had been recommended by the Select Committeewere first, that, where a work was alleged to be obscene, its effect asa whole should be considered and, second, that a defence of literaryor artistic merit should be afforded. On the first of these proposals the Sub-Committee had formulated a revised definition of obscenitywhich, by prescribing that the obscenity of any published matter should be judged in relation to its context, would give effect to thesubstance of the Select Committee&apos;s recommendation and should provide a practical basis of judgment. On the other hand, to afford a defence of literary merit would make the law virtually unenforceablesince no jury could be expected to decide so essentially subjective an issue. It might be possible, however, to go some way towards meetinginformed opinion on this point by permitting &quot; the public good &quot; or&quot; the public interest &quot; to be adduced as a special defence against a
charge of obscenity. It might therefore be desirable to indicate duringthe debate that the Government would be prepared to consider asuggestion on these lines and would welcome an expression of theviews of the House of Commons. The other proposals in the report ofthe Select Committee were discussed in Annex B to C. (58) 250 and,subject to certain modifications, were acceptable. If Mr. RoyJenkins, M.P., the sponsor of the Obscene Publications Bill, was prepared to move or to support in Committee amendments to the Billin the form now proposed, it was possible, though not yet certain, thatthe Bill might make progress.In discussion there was general agreement with the new definition of obscenity proposed by the Lord Chancellors Sub-Committee. Itwas, however, suggested that this definition was in itself sufficient toensure that serious works would not be prosecuted and that to allow&quot; the public good &quot; or &quot; the public interest &quot; to be advanced as aspecial defence would be to introduce a new concept into the criminal law and seriously to reduce the possibility of securing a convictioneven in obvious cases of pornography. There would be similar difficulties in permitting a defence of &quot; good faith,&quot; despite the possibleprecedent in the defence of privilege afforded in a charge of criminallibel. On the other hand, there was considerable political pressure infavour of a special defence of some kind; and the balance ofadvantage appeared to lie in adopting the course which the HomeSecretary had proposed.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the report of the Sub-Committee of theHome Affairs Committee on the Obscene Publications Bill.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to indicate, during the debate onthe report of the Select Committee on Obscene Publica-tions later that day, that the Government would welcome the views of the House of Commons on the desirability ofpermitting &quot; the public interest&quot; to be put forward as aspecial defence against a charge of obscenity.Kenya.(previous reference :CC. (57) 80thConclusions,Minute 6.)Kenyatta Trial.6. The Colonial Secretary said that one of the principalwitnesses for the prosecution in the trial of Jomo Kenyatta in 1952had now come forward with circumstantial allegations about themethods employed to induce him to give evidence. The matter was likely to be raised in the House of Commons on the following day andhe proposed to undertake to institute an enquiry into these allegations.In discussion considerable doubt was expressed about the wisdom of this course. Full particulars of the allegations had only beenreceived very recently; and the Government would need to consider them carefully before deciding whether they justified an officialenquiry.The Cabinet Agreed that, if the question of the alleged improprieties inconnection with evidence given in the trial of Jomo Kenyattawas raised in the House of Commons before the recess, theGovernment spokesman should indicate that it would benecessary for the Government to examine the allegations indetail before they could make any statement on the subject.
