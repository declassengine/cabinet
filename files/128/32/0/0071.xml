RacialDisturbances.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 69thConclusions,Minute 3.)Education. 2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the salaries of Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (58) 186) to which were annexedScottish certain documents relating to the recent arbitration on the salariesTeachers.        of Scottjsh teachers.(previous reference: The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the wording of theC.C. (58) 70th findings of the arbitration tribunal made it clear that the purposeConclusions, of arbitration in this particular case had been, not to determine the minute 4.) amount of the proposed increase in the salaries of Scottish teachers,but to enable the two parties on the National Joint Council to submit to the Secretary of State an agreed recommendation on this subject.The Secretary of State remained free, therefore, to exercise hisstatutory fight to modify or to reject this recommendation, if he saw fit to do so. At the present juncture, when it was provingincreasingly difficult for the Government to sustain their policy of wage restraint, it would be particularly inappropriate to concede to scottish teachers an increase in salary of as much as 5 per cent.Such a concession would encourage the practice of claiming interimawards and would undermine the convention, which had hitherto been accepted by many grades in the public service, that salariesshould only be reviewed at prescribed intervals of several years.Moreover, if it became clear that the Government were prepared to acquiesce in interim awards, there would no longer be an incentive to arbitrators to adopt a strict attitude towards inflated claims whichwere submitted to them.In discussion there was considerable support for this point ofview. If the Secretary of State must be regarded as committed toendorsing any recommendation of the National Joint Council whichwas based on the findings of an arbitral panel, he would in effectbe abandoning his  statutory  right  to  determine  the  level  ofSECRET54010-11 b 21. 77te Home Secretary said that, as the result of discussions which, together with the Colonial Secretary, he had held with west indian Ministers, it should now be possible to formulate an approach to the Federal Government of the West Indies designed to enlisttheir co-operation in controlling the flow of emigration from the territories within the Federation, while reserving to the UnitedKingdom Government the right to take statutory powers, ifnecessary, to deport undesirable immigrants from the Common-wealth. In the light of the further consultations with the West indian governments which should result from this approach, it would bepossible for the Cabinet to reach a decision on this issue of policy.The Minister of Labour said that it was important that, as partof any new arrangements to strengthen the control over emigrationfrom the West Indies, it should be made more explicit than at presentthat a passport would not be issued to an emigrant unless he couldfurnish satisfactory evidence that he had an assured prospect ofemployment in this country. This would be the most effective meansof ensuring that coloured immigration into the United Kingdom didnot merely increase the level of unemployment. On the other hand it would be the stipulation which the West Indian governments would be most likely to resist.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theColonial Secretary and the Minister of Labour, to initiateformal discussions with the Federal Government of theWest Indies on the possibility of establishing a more satisfactory control over emigration from the West Indianterritories to the United Kingdom.
remuneration of teachers in Scotland. Moreover, he would beadmitting, by implication, that he had been wrong in advising theJoint Council, before the arbitration, that he could not find that any major change in circumstances had taken place to justify a revisionof the salaries introduced in November 1956. It would be wise,therefore, to challenge the contention of the National Joint council that this statement was irrelevant to the issue referred to arbitration;and it was indefensible that, in an issue of this kind, the Secretaryof State should have no opportunity to state his own case to thearbitral panel.On the other hand, there was little doubt that public opinion would regard the procedure adopted in the present instance as constituting an arbitration in the normal sense of the term, particularly since the letter in which the National Joint Council had referred theissue to the tribunal had defined the purpose of the reference asbeing &quot; to determine a dispute which has arisen in relation to.....&quot;This was the conventional formula for the constitution of arbitraltribunals, and public opinion would be unable to distinguish betweenthe panel which had been set up in the present case and the procedure of normal arbitration. If the findings of the panel were now rejected,confidence in the Governments declared acceptance of the principleof arbitration would be seriously shaken. Moreover, a salaryincrease of 5 per cent, was not unreasonable in the light of the factthat the existing salaries had been determined nearly two years ago.In all other cases which might be thought to be liable to be affectedby the present proposal increases of salary had been granted since1956. The attitude of the local education authorities in England andWales indicated that they too might find it necessary to negotiate an interim award of 5 per cent, as from April 1959.In further discussion it was agreed that the balance of advantage lay in maintaining the formal integrity of the Governments wages policy by accepting the award of the arbitral panel. Itsimplementation should, however, be deferred for as long as possible;and further consideration should be given to the possibility ofrevising, in the context of the next review of the constitution and functions of the National Joint Council, a procedure which made it possible for salaries to be increased without permitting the responsible Minister to state the case against an excessive award.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a salary increase of 5 per cent, should be grantedto teachers in Scotland.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to defer theannouncement of this decision until the end of October,in order that the award should not begin to take effect until 1st November.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Minister of Labour and other Ministers affected,to consider further the possibility of securing a revisionof the system of arbitration in those cases in which theMinister responsible for financing, in whole or in part,the cost of any award was given no opportunity to make representations to the arbitral tribunal.Cyprus. 3.   The Prime Minister said that the latest reports from H.M.(Previous        Charge dAffaires at Ankara suggested that the Turkish government reference:      might be prepared to consider, however reluctantly, the return ofC.C.

(58) 183)examining the problem of agricultural policy in relation to those negotiations.The Paymaster-General said that at the Montreal Conferencewe should need to take the other members of the Commonwealthinto our confidence about our attitude towards the negotiations forthe establishment of a European Free Trade Area. The next stage in those negotiations would follow closely upon the Conference andhe would therefore welcome guidance from the Cabinet on the three main issues which were now outstanding.Financial Assistance to the Under-developed CountriesIt was clear that, if a Free Trade Area Convention was to beadopted by the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation,it would be necessary for additional finance to be made availablefor the development of the Irish Republic, Greece, Iceland and turkey (the peripheral countries) in order that they might be able,at the end of an extended transitional period, to play their full partin the Free Trade Area.  We had hitherto resisted any proposal of free trade area.(previous reference :C.C. 71 (58)in announcing that the Archbishop and the other political exileswould be free to return to Cyprus in the near future. In ourview this would be a challenge to the Archbishop to face the responsibilities of his position. If he refused this challenge, hisprestige would fall. If he accepted it, he would be subject, after his return, to great pressure from those elements in Cyprus who wishedto see peace restored, and his presence might also increase the chance that the Greek community would eventually acquiesce in our new plan for Cyprus. We should no longer make the Archbishop&apos;s returndependent on his giving any assurances about his future behaviour;but it would be made clear to him that he would remain subject tothe law and emergency regulations in force in Cyprus, and that therewould be no question of our consenting to release the politicaldetainees in the Island until he had shown that he was prepared toco-operate with us in establishing peaceful conditions and restoringlaw and order.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be wise to ascertain the reaction of the Turkish Government to an approach on these lines. If they did not reject it outright, it would thereafter be necessary for the Cabinet, before reaching a final decision, toconsider the probable attitude of public opinion, both in this countryand abroad, to the return of the Archbishop.The Cabinet -Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct H.M. Charged&apos;Affaires at Ankara to ascertain, on the lines indicated bythe Prime Minister, the reaction of the Turkish Governmentto the proposal that Archbishop Makarios should beallowed to return to Cyprus.

The next stage in those negotiations would follow closely upon the Conference andhe would therefore welcome guidance from the Cabinet on the three main issues which were now outstanding.Financial Assistance to the Under-developed CountriesIt was clear that, if a Free Trade Area Convention was to beadopted by the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation,it would be necessary for additional finance to be made availablefor the development of the Irish Republic, Greece, Iceland and turkey (the peripheral countries) in order that they might be able,at the end of an extended transitional period, to play their full partin the Free Trade Area.   We had hitherto resisted any proposal ofC.C. 71 (58)in announcing that the Archbishop and the other political exileswould be free to return to Cyprus in the near future. In ourview this would be a challenge to the Archbishop to face the responsibilities of his position. If he refused this challenge, hisprestige would fall. If he accepted it, he would be subject, after his return, to great pressure from those elements in Cyprus who wishedto see peace restored, and his presence might also increase the chance that the Greek community would eventually acquiesce in our new plan for Cyprus.

this kind. But we could no longer refuse to discuss with other european countries the possibility of an arrangement on these lines;and we must be prepared to indicate at the Montreal conference that some concession of this nature would probably be necessary if we were to secure the establishment of a Free Trade Area.f In discussion it was suggested that, at a time when we were finding great difficulty in making adequate finance available for commonwealth development, we should invite considerable political criticism if we undertook to provide finance for the developmentof four European countries which had shown themselves to be actively hostile to our interests in other respects. It would thereforebe very desirable that&apos; we should not contract any commitment inthis respect unless it was essential to secure the successful completionof the negotiations and the arrangement could be represented asonly one element in a final settlement which was otherwise acceptable to us. In particular, we should avoid, if possible, the creation of a european Development Agency, which would be liable to provoke a critical reaction from the other members of the commonwealth in the light of our inability to promote a corresponding agency forthe Commonwealth itself.TextilesIn the course of the Free Trade Area negotiations we had proposed the extension to textiles of the general rule proposed forall other products, viz., that, if not less than half the value of the finished product had been added within the Area, this should suffice to establish origin within the Free Trade Area for tariff purposes.This proposal had provoked strong opposition both from our owntextile industry and from certain European Governments, mainly on the ground that cheap textiles of Asian origin, particularly greycloth, would be entitled to benefit under the proposed principle afterprocessing in Europe and that the European textile industries,particularly spinning and weaving, would, as a result, suffer serious damage. The industry had accordingly proposed that a highlyrestrictive definition of origin should be adopted. Such a definitionwould, however, encounter strong opposition from Switzerland andother more liberally-minded countries in Europe. Moreover, those members of the Commonwealth which exported textiles had aconsiderable interest in ensuring that the origin rules for textileswere as liberal as possible, in order that the Free Trade Area as awhole, and the United Kingdom in particular, should provide a large and expanding market for their semi-finished products.Two possible compromises had been devised in order to overcome these difficulties. The first (Formula &quot; A &quot;) was a relativelyrestrictive formula, which should do much to meet the views of theUnited Kingdom industry and might prove acceptable to the other parties to the Free Trade Area negotiations. The second (Formula&quot; B &quot;), while identical with Formula &quot; A &quot; as regards yarn, grey clothand finished cloth, would permit more liberal treatment for made-upgoods. The essential difference between the two formulae lay inthe fact that, under Formula &quot; B,&quot; nearly all garments would beregarded as originating in the Free Trade Area if they were made from grey cloth not originating in the Area, whereas, under Formula&quot; A,&quot; all made-up goods would have to be woven within the Area.It would be inadvisable to seek to make a final choice between these alternative formulae without ascertaining the views of theother members of the Commonwealth and of the United kingdom industry. For tactical reasons, it would be desirable to indicate atthe Montreal Conference that the Free Trade Area negotiations were unlikely to yield any proposal more liberal than Formula &quot; A &quot;but to suggest to the industry that even this formula would be liableto encounter considerable opposition from the other members of theCommonwealth, although Formula &quot; B &quot; might be more acceptable to them. Our final decision should then be taken in the light ofthe results of these separate consultations.
In discussion there was general agreement that we confrontedan acute dilemma in this matter. It was unlikely that Formula &quot; B &quot;would be accepted by the other members of the Free Trade Area or that any European country would be prepared to regard goodsincorporating Asian grey cloth as originating within the Free trade area. On the other hand, the adoption of Formula &quot; A &quot; would almost certainly prevent the achievement of any agreement betweenthe United Kingdom industry and the industry in Hong Kong forthe voluntary limitation of exports of Hong Kong textiles to thiscountry. In these circumstances a decision must necessarily be deferred until we had ascertained the views of the other membersof the Commonwealth and of the United Kingdom industry on thelines proposed in C. (58) 184.AgricultureWe were publicly committed to rejecting any agreement which sought to incorporate agriculture in a Free Trade Area. Underpressure, however, we had conceded that, simultaneously with theestablishment of the Free Trade Area, an Agricultural agreement should be negotiated with the object of promoting trade in Europeby concerting national agricultural policies. We had made it clear thatsuch an agreement would be acceptable to us only if it was consistent with our commitments to support home agriculture and our commitments to the Commonwealth.As regards support for agricultural production, it might bepossible to achieve a solution of the problem by suggesting that the contracting Parties to the Agricultural Agreement should undertakethat they would not, as a deliberate act of policy, increase guaranteed prices or similar means of price or income support for the purposeof raising the real or effective value of the total of producers&apos; subsidiesor producing in their respective countries a larger proportion of their total requirements for agricultural products. In terms of tariff policy, however, the issue was likely to prove more difficult, since we must seek to honour both our undertaking to our own producersthat we would maintain adequate protection for those commoditiesfor which the tariff constituted the equivalent of the price guaranteesystem and our undertaking to the other members of theCommonwealth that we would maintain free entry for their products and their existing preferential margins. It was far from certain whether these commitments could be reconciled with the tariff concessions which we should be expected to make in the context of the Free Trade Area negotiations.The latest proposals which had been put forward by the SixPowers represented some modification of their original attitudetowards the treatment of agriculture in a Free Trade Area. Butthey incorporated certain objectionable features:  (i) A proposal that progress from the first to the second stage of the industrial Free Trade Area should be conditional uponagreement on progress to the second stage of the AgriculturalAgreement.(ii) A proposal that, during the first stage of the Agreement,specific obligations on tariffs should be accepted (involving, among other things, a standstill on tariffs on agricultural products for thisperiod) and that new rules should be proposed to govern the subsequent period.(iii) An implicit proposal that the objective of the later stages of the Agreement should be the complete abolition of tariffs, quotasand production subsidies.It would be difficult wholly to reject the concept of a standstill on agricultural tariffs. If food exporting countries were to accepta firm commitment to abolish their tariffs on industrial goods, we
could not reasonably expect to retain complete freedom to increase our own tariffs on foodstuffs. A possible compromise would beto offer an undertaking that we would not increase our aggregatetariff protection in respect of agricultural commodities. On the otherhand, we could not accept any suggestion that progress from thefirst to the second stage of the industrial Free Trade Area shouldbe contingent upon the negotiation during the first stage of anadequate long-term Agricultural Agreement. This would destroy the confidence both of our own producers and of the other membersof the Commonwealth that we intended to honour our commitments to them; and it would invite formidable pressure from the othercountries in the Free Trade Area to modify our agricultural policies.A decision on these issues could not be taken until we had ascertained the views of the National Farmers&apos; Unions and the othermembers of the Commonwealth. The former should therefore beinformed of the undertakings which we proposed to offer on production and subsidy policy and on the level of aggregate tariff protection. The other members of the Commonwealth, however,should merely be told, at the Montreal Conference, that we proposedto adhere to our present policy as regards agriculture in the context of the Free Trade Area. Since we did not propose to disclose tothem the undertaking which we would be prepared to accept inrespect of production and subsidy policy, it would be unwise to mention the possibility that we might also offer an undertaking onaggregate tariff protection.In discussion it was suggested that the proposed undertakingon production and subsidy policy was unlikely to be accepted bythe National Farmers&apos; Unions unless it incorporated a specificproviso that it must not be construed as precluding the productionin the United Kingdom of a larger proportion of our total requirements for agricultural products as a result of an increase infarming efficiency. If amended in this way, the formula might beaccepted in principle. Any concession on tariffs, however, includingthe proposed offer of an undertaking not to increase our aggregatetariff protection, would cause more serious difficulties. Forhorticultural products tariffs constituted the equivalent of theproduction subsidies for agriculture; and any formula which limitedour freedom to raise those tariffs would imply a diminution of theprotection which horticulture at present enjoyed against increases in production costs. No other means of providing protection for horticulture could be devised. The imposition of quotas would beinadmissible under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,while a system of planned marketing was impracticable for perishablecommodities. Freedom to adjust the tariff was therefore essential if we were not be accused by the industry of breaking our explicitand repeated pledges that agriculture would not be jeopardised bythe Free Trade Area.In further discussion it was agreed that, in the light of these considerations, we should endeavour, during the next stage of theFree Trade Area negotiations, to secure agreement on the basis ofthe proposed undertaking about production subsidies alone. If,however, this proved insufficient, it might be possible, whilepreserving our right to increase the aggregate of agricultural tariff protection to some extent, to offer to accept some limit on the extentof such an increase. An offer of this kind, if coupled with anundertaking to bind nil tariffs on certain foodstuffs, might suffice to secure a satisfactory Agricultural Agreement which would not conflict with our public assurances to the United Kingdom industry.The Cabinet (1) Approved, in principle, the proposals in C. (58) 181, 182,183 and 184, subject to the points made in their discussion.
Nigsria, 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous Colonial Secretary (C. (58) 171) on the Nigeria ConstitutionalReference: Conference which was due to reassemble in London onCC. (57) 42nd 29th September.Conclusions,Minute 4.) The Colonial Secretary said that at the Conference in theprevious year it had been agreed that the Eastern and WesternRegions of Nigeria should be granted regional self-government. Therepresentatives of the Northern Region had now informed him thatthey wished to be given a similar status with effect from 15th March,1959. In accordance with his predecessor^ undertaking, he was bound to accede to this request. As regards independence forNigeria as a whole, an undertaking had been given during the 1957Conference that, if at the beginning of 1960, the new NigerianParliament asked the United Kingdom Government to agree to full self-government within the Commonwealth by a specified date inthat year, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would consider it withsympathy and would be prepared to fix a date when they wouldaccede to the request. It now seemed doubtful, however, whether he would be able to rest on that undertaking at the forthcoming conference. The Governor-General had represented strongly thatwe should be prepared to announce during the Conference a date in 1960 on which we would agree to full self-government for theFederation as a whole. Public opinion in Nigeria was conspicuouslyloyal to the Crown and the Commonwealth connection, and it wouldbe unwise to alienate this sentiment by reluctance to prescribe a date for the achievement of Federal self-government. A concession inthis respect must, however, be dependent on our being satisfied thatthe administration of the Regions would continue on satisfactorylines in the interim and that, when Federal self-government was introduced, adequate arrangements would be made to maintain the unity of the country, to preserve the integrity of the police forceand to assure us of the continuance of such defence facilities as weshould need to retain. These included staging and overflying rights for our aircraft, together with the right to use the harbours at Lagosand Port Harcourt in war. It had been suggested that, in addition,we should reserve sovereignty in perpetuity over a small enclave ofNigerian territory which would provide a secure and permanent base for our forces. This proposal would need further examination; andits advantages would need to be weighed against the risk that itwould appear to imply that we doubted whether we could rely on the continuing loyalty of Nigeria. For their part the Nigerians would need our help in building up their defence forces, particularly byseconding British officers on suitable terms.The Minister of Defence emphasised the importance of avoiding any uncertainty about the defence facilities which we should need to retain in Nigeria as an essential part of our means of reinforcingthe Middle Eastern and Far Eastern theatres. The defence agreement should, if possible, constitute an integral element in theconstitutional instrument establishing self-government rather than a(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Paymaster-General to be guided by these memoranda, amended as necessary to meet the points made in discussion, duringthe forthcoming Commonwealth Economic Conferenceat Montreal and the resumed negotiations on theestablishment of a European Free Trade Area.(3) Invited the Paymaster-General to ensure that no commit-ment would be accepted by the United Kingdom inrespect of any of the issues discussed in these memorandawithout further reference to the Cabinet.
Tin. 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (C. (58) 187)about the International Tin Agreement, which the Chancellor of theExchequer had circulated on behalf of the President of the Boardof Trade.The President of the Board of Trade said that the InternationalTin Agreement faced an imminent crisis. The financial resourcesof the Buffer Stock, which already held over 25,000 tons of tin,would be exhausted within the next few days; and if the Stock wasthen compelled to withdraw from the market, the price would fallsharply and the main producers of tin, including Malaya and Nigeria,would sustain severe damage. On the other hand, the agreement was fundamentally an unsound one and the Buffer Stock had invitedits present embarrassment by deliberately supporting an excessivelyhigh price at the expense of the consumer. A reduction in international output on a scale which would solve the problem wouldbe unacceptable to the Soviet Union. Nor could we contemplateaccepting an indefinite commitment to provide the finance requiredto enable the Buffer Stock to continue to buy indefinitely all tinoffered to it at the current price of  730 a ton. Moreover, a loan to Malaya, which would perhaps constitute the least objectionablemeans of making such additional finance available, could not nowbe negotiated in time to save the position. If it was regarded as essential to protect Malaya from the consequences of a sharp fallin the price, the simplest course would be to acquire the tin ourselves.But, if so, we must be prepared to buy on a very substantial scale it might be necessary to purchase at least 5,000 tons at a cost of between  3 millions and  4 millions, if disaster in Malaya was to be avoided.In discussion there was general agreement that, in the light ofthe increasing surplus in the world supply of tin, it would be unwise,both on the merits of this particular case and in terms of the separate agreement to be concluded with Nigeria after the grant of independence. Moreover, the strategic importance of Nigeria was sufficiently great to justify us in making every effort to retain anenclave of territory under our own sovereignty.In discussion there was general agreement that we should adhere to the policy, to which we were committed, of granting full self-government to Nigeria, subject to being satisfied as regards theessential constitutional and military safeguards. It would bedesirable, however, that further consideration should be given to the timing of the proposed Defence Agreement. It was arguable thatthis Agreement might well prove more reliable and command greaterinternational respect if, on the Malayan precedent, it was signed,or at least ratified, by the Nigerian Government in the exercise oftheir full powers after they had attained independence.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Colonial Secretary to be guided, at theforthcoming Conference on Nigeria, by the considerations which had emerged during their discussion.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to circulate periodical reports on the progress of the Conference and to seek furtherauthority from the Cabinet if he found it desirable to prescribe, during the proceedings, a specific date in 1960for the independence of Nigeria.(3) Invited the Colonial Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Defence, to arrange for a further examinationof the best means of securing our future strategic requirements in Nigeria and of the most appropriatetiming of the conclusion of a Defence Agreement.

The Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister ofState for Foreign Affairs (C. (58) 185) covering a memorandum onthe policy to be adopted in the discussion, at the forthcoming sessionof the United Nations General Assembly, of the proposed secondConference on the Law of the Sea.In discussion it was agreed that the United Kingdom spokesmanat the General Assembly should advocate the policy outlined inC. (58) 185, subject to confirmation that it would have the supportof the United States Government. It was suggested, however, thatit would be to our advantage to offer, before the discussion in theGeneral Assembly, to submit to some form of arbitration the legalissues involved in our fishery disputes with the Icelandic Government.Alternatively, such an offer might be made during the proceedings at the General Assembly.The Cabinet considered the arrangements to be made fordisposing of the Icelanders held in the Fishery Protection VesselEastbourne. It was agreed that it would be preferable to avoid the publicity involved in bringing these men to the United Kingdom.It would be wiser to return them to their own country, either byembarking them in a small boat near the shore or, preferably landingthem on a beach. If this course proved, on further examination,to be impracticable, it would be necessary to consider alternative arrangements.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange that, subject trconfirmation that the policy outlined in C. (58) 185 would. CC. 71 (58)precedent which might be established for other internationalcommodities, to attempt to support a speculative market at an artificial price level. A decision to this effect would, admittedly,be an unfortunate prelude to the forthcoming commonwealth economic Conference at Montreal, since the other members of theCommonwealth, who had always criticised us for lack of co-operation in supporting international commodity schemes, would condemnour acquiescence in the collapse of the International Tin Agreement.But it might also serve as a salutary reminder to them that we could &apos;not undertake to guarantee the solvency of such schemes regardless of the circumstances.On the other hand, if we allowed the economy of Malaya to be gravely damaged and a commodity scheme promoted by the western powers to be frustrated by Soviet economic pressure, our prestige in the Far East would suffer a reverse and the peoples of that area would be given further encouragement to turn towards Communism.The amount of additional finance required to enable the agreement to continue in the short-term, while alternative arrangements were examined, was relatively small in relation to the political issues at stake; and, although we could not ourselves undertake to financean indefinite continuation of the existing Agreement, we should consider urgently the possibility of reconstructing it in co-operationwith the United States.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Government should not intervene in supportof the International Tin Agreement.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Commonwealth Secretary, toconsider, as a matter of urgency, the possibility of negotiating, in conjunction with the United States, areconstruction of the Agreement which would place thescheme on a more sound and economic basis.
