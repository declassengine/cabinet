2.   The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by the Prime Minister (C. (58) 71) discussing the merits of the August and September Plans for a new scheme of retirement pensions, with particular reference to the practicability ofa provision for contracting out, and proposing that steps should betaken to ascertain the reaction of the interests affected to such aprovision either by means of a White Paper, or through confidential discussions;(ii) a note by the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance(C. (58) 73) covering a draft White Paper and a draft memorandum for use in confidential discussions;(iii) a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C. (58) 74) reporting the result of his consultation with the ministers concerned on the probable reactions to contracting out of those responsible for occupational schemes in the public sector.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet should seek to resolvetwo issues. First, would it be wiser to refrain from embarking on any new pensions policy or was it desirable, in principle, that the legislative programme for the 1958-59 session should include a measure designedPensions.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 78thConclusions,Minute 2)Employment.. 1.   The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor of(Previous        the Exchequer (C.  (58) 69 and 75) on the problem of localReference:      unemployment.C.C. (56) 41stConclusions, The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the current slackeningMinute 3) of demand for labour was being reflected most sharply in areas where local unemployment had for a long time been substantially above theUnemployment average national level. Where these were within development areas,Departments already had powers to take remedial action. TheEconomic Policy Committee recommended that these powers should now be supplemented by legislation enabling the Treasury to lendmoney to firms willing to establish new factories, or to extendexisting factories, in places outside development areas where therewas a substantial level of local unemployment.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) Would the introduction of this legislation appear consistent with the Government^ persistence in measures designed to checkinflation? In reply it was argued that, by emphasising the localcharacter of the current unemployment, it should strengthen theGovernments hand in resisting pressure for the prematureintroduction of measures designed to stimulate demand generally.(b) The Parliamentary programme was already overloaded, andit would be difficult to find time for this legislation. As against this,it was argued that the Bill was unlikely to prove controversial: indeed,the Opposition might be willing to support it.(c) It would be convenient if the Chancellor of the exchequer in his analysis of the economic situation in the Budget speech, couldrefer in general terms to the measures which the government proposed to take to remedy local unemployment.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to arrangefor legislation to be prepared on the lines proposed inC. (58) 69.(2) Agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in introducinghis Budget, should refer in general terms to the steps which the Government proposed to take with a view toremedying local unemployment.(3) Agreed that a final decision on the timing of the introductionof this legislation should be reserved until it became moreclear whether there was a reasonable prospect of its beingenacted without political controversy.
to modify and improve the existing National Insurance scheme?Second, on the latter assumption, the choice between the August and september Plans must depend largely on the extent of the demandfor contracting out and the practicability of operating a provision forthis purpose. It appeared from C. (58) 74 that the great majorityof employees in the public sector would probably wish to contract out of a new State pensions scheme. But this conclusion washypothetical, and it was desirable that the Cabinet, before reaching a final decision, should be more accurately advised about the probablereaction of both the public and the private sectors to a contracting-outprovision. For this purpose the Government must be prepared eitherto publish a White Paper describing the August and September plans and the administrative implications of contracting out, or to embark on confidential discussions with the interests primarily concerned.In discussion it was suggested that it might no longer be aspolitically important for the Government to produce an alternative to the Labour Party&apos;s pensions plan as it had originally appeared tobe. The attraction of that plan would be liable to diminish as the inflationary pressure in the economy was gradually reduced; and itmight be wiser in the long-term to refrain from any attempt to compete with it than to introduce either of two schemes whichwould, in effect, increase the level of taxation and might proveunwelcome to the Governments supporters. On the other hand, the deficit which was now emerging on the existing National Insurancescheme was imposing on the Exchequer a burden which would becomeinsupportable in later years, and it would be neither economicallysound nor politically wise for the Government to be seen to be making no attempt to deal with this problem.Discussion then turned to the respective merits of the august and September Plans. It was suggested that the value of the option to contract out which the latter would provide was questionable,particularly since it could be exercised only on a corporate, not an individual, basis. If the private sector took relatively little advantageof this option, the Government would not be justified in imposing onthe interests affected the complex administrative arrangements whichit would entail. Alternatively, if contracting out was extensivelyadopted, the hypothetical calculation in C. (58) 74 illustrated thatthe relief to the Exchequer which the September Plan would providewould be seriously reduced. By contrast, the August Plan would leave the private sector unaffected and would therefore allow no lessscope for individual initiative and enterprise than existed at present.For this reason the insurance companies had already indicatedconfidentially that they regarded it as preferable to the SeptemberPlan, which could be interpreted as an attempt by the Governmentto compete with occupational schemes. The August Plan might need to be amended in certain respects, particularly as regards the levelof the contribution to be paid by the lowest-paid worker and possibly also by some re-adjustment of its weighting as between the youngand the old. On merits, however, it could be argued that it wouldprovide greater relief for the Exchequer than the September plan and, by involving less interference with the private sector, would be politically more consistent with the Governments general principles.On the other hand, the August scheme was not an insurancescheme in the true sense. It was basically similar to the LabourParty&apos;s proposals but provided less attractive benefits. And, by itsinability to accommodate a provision for contracting out, it mightcompel many occupational schemes to be brought to an end againstthe wishes of the participants. For these reasons the September Planmight well prove more acceptable to the Governments supporters,who would be disposed in * principle to support proposals whichrecognised the value of occupational schemes in promoting goodindustrial relations. Moreover, the hypothetical calculation of thefinancial effect on the Exchequer of contracting out in the public sector which was contained in C. (58) 74 rested upon assumptions
ye 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Lordme: Privy Seal (C. (58) 68) containing a provisional classification of the session.material from which the final selection for the legislative programme for the 1958-59 session would nfed to be made.   The relevant Billswere divided into five categories which were themselves open to question. It would be reasonable toassume that about one-third of the total number of occupational schemes would take advantage of a provision for ^contracting out;and on this hypothesis there was only a marginal difference, for some considerable time ahead, between the degrees of relief afforded tothe Exchequer by the August and September Plans respectively. Inaddition, the September Plan would have the advantage that it would maintain the flow of funds for investment through institutionalchannels, which was becoming increasingly important.In further discussion it was agreed that this conflict of considerations could be resolved only by an attempt to ascertain moreaccurately the probable reaction of the interests concerned to thetwo Plans under consideration. As between the alternative methodsof testing informed opinion, a White Paper would have the advantageof enabling the Government to indicate publicly the progress whichthey had made in their consideration of future pensions policy and thenature of the problem which remained to be solved. But it wouldbe liable to precipitate a premature comparison between theGovernments proposals and the plan published by the Labour Partyat a time when the Government themselves had not finally decidedtheir own policy. On a balance of advantage, therefore, it appearedwiser to seek to test opinion by means of confidential discussions.For this purpose the draft working document in Annex B of C. (58) 73should be amended to include an appropriate description of the Augustscheme.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for the august Plan to be amended in respect of the level of contribution to be paid by the lowest-paid workers andpossibly also in respect of its weighting as between youngand old.(2) Invited the Minister of Pensions, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to arrange for the draftworking document at Annex B of C. (58) 73 to be redraftedwith a view to testing informed opinion on both the august and the September Plans, a suitable summary ofthe August Plan (as amended under Conclusion (1) above)being incorporated in the document for this purpose.(3) Invited the Minister of Pensions and the Financial Secretary,Treasury, to arrange, in consultation with the Minister ofLabour, for discussions to be conducted with the interests concerned as rapidly as possible, on the basis of the draftworking document appended to C. (58) 73 as amended inpursuance of Conclusion (2) above, in order to ascertaintheir reactions.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Pensions, to prepare a revised estimate ofthe probable effect of contracting out on the Exchequer,in the light of a re-examination of the calculations inC. (58) 74 and of the result of the enquiries to be conductedunder Conclusion (3) above.(5) Agreed to resume their discussion as soon as the results of theaction to be taken under Conclusions (3) and (4) above were known.(6) Agreed that they should seek to reach a final decision on future pensions policy during May.
Bills known to be essential.Bills which might becomecircumstances.Main programme Bills.Other programme Bills.Other Bills.essential in particularList Al:List A2:List Bl:List B2:List C:The Home Secretary said that it was important that the legislative programme for the 1958-59 session should not be overloaded. the bills in List Al and at least, some of those in List A2 would beinescapable, and these, together with the Bills in List B1 would occupynearly all the time likely to be available for legislation. It might,however, be possible to supplement these Bills with a small numberselected from List B2. Meanwhile, it was important that all the Billsfinally selected for List Bl and at least some of those in Lists Al andA2 should be ready for introduction at the beginning of the new session.In discussion there was general agreement that, subject to any necessary decisions of policy, the Bills in List Bl should be adopted as the main items in the 1958-59 legislative programme.It was agreed also that (a) It might become necessary to advance the Reserve ForcesBill from List C to List A2, possibly in substitution of the Bill to extend the Navy, Army and Air Force Reserve Act, 1954.(b) The New Towns Bill and the Wages Councils Bill, whichwould be welcomed by Government supporters, should be regardedas having priority within List B2.(c) The Bill for the Registration and Control of Hire Purchase,together with the Bill to amend the Visiting Forces Act, might need to be advanced from List C to List B2.(d) It might also become necessary, in the light of the progressof the negotiations for the establishment of a European Free trade area, to advance the International Road Transport Bill from List Cto List B2.(e) Pending further consideration of the policy issues involved,a place should be reserved in List B2 for legislation to assist the small farmer, to increase the scope of grant-aid to denominational schools and to facilitate house purchase.The Home Secretary, summing up the discussion, said that theMinisters concerned should now seek the necessary policy approval,where this had not already been obtained, for the Bills in Lists Al,A2 (where appropriate) and Bl, and should thereafter arrange for the bills to be drafted as rapidly as possible. Ministers should alsoproceed to seek policy clearance for such of the Bills in List B2 asthey regarded as sufficiently important to be considered for inclusion in the final programme. A decision on the drafting of these bills would need to be taken subsequently in the light of a further reviewof the programme.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Ministers concerned to seek, where appropriate,policy approval for the Bills in Lists Al, A2 and Blannexed to C. (58) 68 and to arrange for these Bills to beprepared as rapidly as possible.(2) Invited the Ministers concerned to seek policy approval ofthe Bills in List B2 on the lines indicated by the HomeSecretary, pending further consideration of the extent towhich it would be desirable that any of these Bills shouldbe included in the programme and that instructions fortheir preparation should be given to parliamentary counsel.(3) Agreed to resume at a later meeting their consideration ofthe legislative programme for the forthcoming session.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.3rd April, 1958.
