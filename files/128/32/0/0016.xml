cabinet business.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 83rdConclusions,Minute 4.)Circulation of memoranda.1. The Home Secretary said that memoranda submitted forconsideration by the Cabinet had recently tended to be circulated too late for Ministers to give them adequate consideration. In theinterests of the efficient despatch of the business of government,Ministers should take steps to ensure observance of the standing rule that, except in conditions of emergency, memoranda should be circulated not less than forty-eight hours before the meeting of theCabinet at which they were due to be considered.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of this statement.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.Farm Price 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the review. Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (58) 36) on the forthcoming annual review of the economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the estimated net income of the industry for 1957-58 was about  360 millions, thehighest level ever achieved. Moreover, net output had risen, whilethe net cost increase of  11^ millions on review commodities was the smallest since 1954 and less than a third of the corresponding increasein the previous year. On the other hand the Exchequer liability,which reflected falling commodity prices, had risen to some  290millions in 1957-58. These circumstances would clearly justify aminimum determination of the price guarantees. Moreover,concessions to the home industry at this juncture would be likely tohave adverse reactions both on Commonwealth opinion and on our negotiations for the establishment of a European Free Trade Area.He therefore proposed that the Government should seek to secure areduction of  201- millions in the total value of the guarantees, themaximum reduction consonant with the long-term assurances underthe Agriculture Act, 1957.The Minister of Agriculture said that, in principle, he agreed that discussions should be started with the farmers&apos; Unions on this basis.It would not be wise, however, for the Government to refuse to contemplate any improvement on this minimum before consideringthe arguments which the farmers would be likely to advance-namely,that the increase in their money incomes was not a fair measure of theincrease in their real incomes and that the Government were seeking to secure for the Exchequer, through the system of price guarantees,virtually the whole of the improvement in the industry&apos;s efficiency.Moreover, while the over-production of milk, pigs and eggs made it inevitable that the price reductions should be concentrated on these commodities, the impact of reductions on the scale proposed wouldbe particularly severe on the small farmer. He was thereforeconsidering whether it might be possible to announce, simultaneously with the new price determinations, that the Government contemplatedspecial measures, outside the ambit of the price review, to assist thesmall farmer. It might also be possible to present the pricedeterminations in a rather less unattractive light by making some small adjustment in the quality premium on cattle and possibly some reduction in the guaranteed price for wheat, which was mainly grownby large farmers.52960-18
The Secretary of State for Scotland indicated his agreement withthese views.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The farmers did not consider that 1957-58 had been aprofitable year and believed that their real income for that year hadbeen exceeded in several years since 1951. But, although they wouldbe unlikely to accept a settlement on the basis proposed in C. (58) 36,concessions on the scale which would be necessary to secure an agreed settlement could not be justified in the light of the Governmenfsgeneral economic policy. It would, however, be important to considerthe timing and presentation of the Governmenfs decision in relationto the introduction of the forthcoming legislation to amend the agriculture and Agricultural Holdings Acts, which was also likely tobe unwelcome to the industry.(b) The farmers would be particularly critical of the proposed reduction of l^d. a gallon in the guaranteed price for milk. But theirreaction must be considered in the light of the important Common-wealth interest in dairy produce and of the fact that %d. of thereduction should be absorbed by the fall in the prices of feedingstuffsand the remaining \d. by the increase in efficiency.(c) In general, we must expect growing pressure from othercountries to reduce our agricultural guarantees. A reduction in the guaranteed price for wheat might be appropriate. Moreover,Denmark and Poland were particularly affected by the level of the guaranteed prices for pigs.(d) Although there were indications that both the small and thelarge farmer had benefited from the higher net income of 1957-58, it seemed probable that the greater part of this prosperity had accruedto the latter class. This tendency was likely to be accentuated by the alterations in the guaranteed prices now proposed. Although this might represent a sound development from the economic point ofview, it would be neither socially nor politically desirable that thesmall farmer should be seen to be discouraged by Government action.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that discussions should be begun with the national farmers&apos; Unions on the basis outlined in C. (58) 36.(2) Agreed that further consideration should be given in due course to possible adjustments both in the total value ofthe guarantees and in the prices for individual commodities in the light of the views advanced on behalfof the industry during these discussions.4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the First Lord of theAdmiralty (C. (58) 38), covering the text of a Parliamentaryannouncement which he proposed to make on 18th February on thesubject of naval shore reorganisation, together with the relevantsection of the Explanatory Statement on the Navy Estimates whichwould be published on the same afternoon.A-&quot;-&quot;Conclusions, The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the measures which he Minute 4.) proposed to announce, involving the closure of Portland and Sheernessdockyards, the abolition of the Nore Command and the concentration of the Home Air Command at a smaller number of bases, had beenapproved by the Defence Committee. From the point of view of thepublic presentation of proposals which would create additionalunemployment the balance of advantage lay in announcing all these measures simultaneously in a manner which would demonstrate theimportance which the Government attached to the sympathetictreatment of the problems which would ensue.defence policy.Naval Re-organisation.(previous reference:
BallisticMissiles.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 84thConclusions.Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence (C. (58) 40) to which were annexed drafts of the documentsconstituting the proposed Agreement with the United StatesGovernment for the deployment of intermediate-range ballisticmissile units in this country.52960-18b 3C.C. 16 (58)In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The proposed statement that the dockyard at Chatham wouldhe retained might be interpreted as implying that the Government had decided to close the dockyard at Malta. It might, therefore, be wisermerely to indicate that work would be concentrated at the homedockyards of Portsmouth, Devonport, Chatham and Pvosyth, leaving the issue open until it was possible to estimate with greater certaintythe extent to which commercial interests might be prepared to provide employment in the Malta dockyard.(b) In the light of the probable impact on Scottish opinion it was undesirable to emphasise, at the beginning of the announcement, thatthe aircraft repair yard at Donibristle would be closed and that thetorpedo experimental establishment would be transferred fromGreenock to Portland. The indication of the Governments intentions in respect of these establishments which was contained in subsequentparagraphs of the announcement should suffice.(c) It would also be desirable to secure consistency in the references to Greenock and Donibristle in paragraphs 10 and 12respectively of the Explanatory Statement on the Navy Estimates by making it clear that at both places the reduction in unestablishedemployees would be effected by normal wastage as well as bydischarge.(d) The draft announcement indicated that all possible steps would be taken to bring the redundant facilities at Sheerness,Donibristle and Greenock to the notice of suitable industrial interests.It was for consideration whether the same undertaking should bevolunteered in respect of the Royal Naval air stations at Eglinton andBrawdy, where the additional unemployment resulting from the closure of these stations would be liable to provoke discontent in ares which were already politically sensitive. It might be desirable,therefore, to indicate that the Government would take all steps in their power to alleviate, in respect of all the establishments comprised inthe announcement, the industrial dislocation which would result fromthe proposed closures.In further discussion it was agreed that the government&apos;s decision on a matter of such political importance would most appropriately be announced by means of an oral statement inParliament. The timing of this statement would, however, need further consideration, since it would be desirable to avoid itscoinciding with an important announcement of Government policywhich the Chancellor of the Exchequer was due to make on18th February.The Cabinet (1) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty, in consultation withthe Ministers concerned, to revise the text of the draft parliamentary announcement in the light of their discussion.(2) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty, in consultation withthe Chief Whip, to give further consideration to the timing of this announcement and to submit his proposals to theHome Secretary.
The Minister of Defence said that the Agreement would giveeffect to the understanding reached between the Prime Minister and president Eisenhower at their meeting in Bermuda in 1957. TheUnited States Government would provide the missiles and specialisedequipment free of cost, while we should be responsible for theconstruction of the sites. The proposed^ Agreement would take theform of an exchange of letters between Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atWashington and the United States Secretary of State, covering aMemorandum of Agreement. These three documents would bepublished. A second exchange of secret letters would contain those parts of the Agreement which, for security reasons, could not be made public.The United States Government had originally proposed that, inaddition to the four ballistic missile squadrons to be manned by theRoyal Air Force, a similar number of United States squadrons shouldbe stationed in this country. They had now agreed to abandon thisproposal; but the secret letters provided that, if the United StatesGovernment should at any time in the future propose the deployment of additional squadrons in the United Kingdom, to be manned either by the United States Air Force or the Royal Air Force, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would give such proposals prompt and sympathetic consideration. The United States Government had, however, made it clear that they had no such proposals in mind at present.The existing text of paragraph 7 of the draft Memorandum ofAgreement was based on discussions between the Foreign secretary and the United States Secretary of State at Ankara. The wording ofthe latter part of this paragraph, particularly the reference to Article 5of the North Atlantic Treaty, might give the impression that the twoGovernments had already agreed that the missiles deployed in theUnited Kingdom under the Agreement would be used automaticallyin the event of an attack on any member of the North atlantic alliance. He proposed to consider with the Foreign Secretarywhether a further attempt should be made to seek United Statesagreement to the substitution of some purely general reference to our obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty.The Minister sought authority to continue negotiations with theUnited States authorities on the basis of the present draft documents,with a view to their publication either in the following week orimmediately before the debate on Defence in the House of commons on 26th and 27th February. He proposed to make an appropriatestatement in Parliament about the Agreement at the same time.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Paragraph 3 of the draft Memorandum of agreement provided that ownership of the missiles would pass to the UnitedKingdom Government as soon as the Royal Air Force were able toman and operate them. The United States authorities hoped that sufficient equipment and missiles would be available for the firstsquadron to be deployed operationally by the end of the year; andit had been agreed that, if the training of the Royal Air force personnel had not been completed by that date, the first site wouldbe manned by the United States Air Force, although the Royal AirForce would retain physical control of the site and missiles. It would,however, be desirable from the political point of view that the RoyalAir Force should man the first site from the outset. The UnitedStates assessment of the availability of the missiles and equipmentmight well be optimistic; and it would also be important to securethat the training of the Royal Air Force personnel would be asintensive as possible.(b) Paragraph 8 of the draft Memorandum of agreement provided that the nuclear warheads for missiles transferred to theUnited Kingdom Government would remain under full United Statescustody and control in accordance with the United States law. Thisprovision reflected the present provisions of the McMahon Act.
Although it was hoped that Congress would approve the amendmentof this Act in order to facilitate closer co-operation between theUnited States and this country in the future development of nuclear weapons, it was unlikely that the United States Government wouldever be prepared to supply nuclear weapons to any country withoutretaining some measure of control over their use. In any event, itwould be difficult for them to make a concession on this point to theUnited Kingdom in view of the fact that squadrons of these missileswould also be deployed in other European countries.(c) The United States Government had agreed to omit any reference in the draft Memorandum of Agreement to the position ofthe Supreme Allied Commander, Europe (SACEUR), in relation tothe operational control of these missiles. SACEUR, however, wasalso the Commander-in-Chief of the United States Forces in Europe ;and it was not unlikely that, in this capacity, he would be givendelegated authority by the United States Government to authoriseon their behalf the use of the missiles stationed in this country.(d) The reference, in paragraph 10 of the draft Memorandum ofAgreement, to the duration of the proposed arrangements would belikely to provoke political controversy. The agreement reached bythe Labour Government in 1948 about the stationing of United Statesbomber aircraft in this country had been for an indefinite period.There might well be a case for a similar provision in this Agreement.On the other hand, the Opposition might raise objections to thearrangement at present envisaged whereby, although the agreement would remain in force indefinitely, it would be subject to revision byagreement and to termination by either Government at the end of successive five-yearly periods. The United States Government were entitled to expect some measure of security for the considerable expenditure involved in the provision of the missiles and equipment;but in the circumstances it might be preferable to provide that theAgreement should operate for five years, subject to extension byagreement between the two Governments.(e) Under paragraph 6 of the draft secret letters at Annex IV theUnited States Government undertook to supply any modificationequipment required to ensure that the missiles were operationallysatisfactory. Our position in this respect was safeguarded by theprovision that the two Governments had to agree on an operationallysatisfactory level of performance. In these circumstances it was not unreasonable to provide that any completely new weapons should bethe subject of separate negotiations.(/) The cost to the United Kingdom Government of providing the sites for these ballistic missile squadrons would amount to about 10 millions. We had already informed the United StatesGovernment that we could not agree to meet the costs of providingsimilar sites on the Continent as part of any infrastructureprogrammes under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).Our position would be adequately safeguarded by the fact that any decision in NATO required the unanimous agreement of all members.(g) The location of the missile sites in this country would be easily ascertainable. It would probably be advisable, therefore, toindicate in the Parliamentary statement the general areas in which the sites would be located. Detailed proposals would be submitted to theHome Affairs Committee later in the week.(h) The Minister of Defence should consider with the foreign secretary whether this Agreement would need to be registered withthe United Nations.
British Forces 6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thein Europe. Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (58) 35) on the financing of the local(Previous        expenditure involved in retaining British forces in Germany.I\C1CI CilCC .C.C. (58) llth The  Chancellor of  the Exchequer said  that the  GermanConclusions, Government, while rejecting our request for a contribution of minute 2.)  47 mjnjons towards the cost of maintaining British troops inGermany in 1958-59, had offered to deposit  100 millions, interestfree, in London against future payments for arms. This proposal was wholly unacceptable first, because it represented a loan, whereas ourrequirement was for a cash payment; second, because we could not afford, in our present circumstances, to indulge in further borrowingin order to meet non-productive current expenditure ; and third,because we should in any event expect to obtain a large proportion ofthe export orders against which the proposed German deposit of 1.00 millions would be advanced. But, while it was clear that weshould reject the German counter-offer, it was no less essential that,if we were not to jeopardise the goodwill towards our case which wehad created in the North Atlantic Council, we should devise as rapidly as possible a fresh approach to the long-term problem of the financing of our troops in Europe. It must be accepted that the GermanGovernment would refuse to make any further contribution towards this expenditure after 1958-59 ; and, while it was important to achieve a settlement with them in respect of that year, it was even moreimportant to secure a satisfactory agreement about the commitments in this respect which we could sustain in subsequent years.In discussion there was general agreement with this view. an enquiry was already in progress into the physical limitations on therate at which we could, if necessary, withdraw troops from Germanyand the political implications of any large-scale withdrawal of our forces; and this enquiry should be supplemented by parallelconsideration of the extent to which it would be financially possible,in the light of our prospective resources of foreign exchange, tomaintain troops on the Continent.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Ormsby-Gore), to arrange for the United Kingdom permanent representative on the North Atlantic Council to be instructed to reject the German counter-proposal todeposit  100 millions, interest-free, in London against future payments for arms.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Defence, toarrange for officials to consider, as a matter of urgency,the possible courses of action open to us in the longer termin the light of the prospective demands on our resourcesof foreign exchange.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Defence, subject to furtherconsideration of the points made in discussion, to continuenegotiations with the United States authorities on thebasis of the draft documents attached to C. (58) 40.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to submit the final draft ofthe Agreement to the Prime Minister for his approval.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence to circulate to the Cabinet thedraft of his proposed Parliamentary statement about theAgreement, together with details of any further amend-ments of substance to the text of the Agreement which he might find it necessary to propose.
aircraft industry.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 14thConclusions,Minute 8.)7. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister ofTransport and Civil Aviation (C. (58) 42) to which was annexed aletter from the Attorney-General discussing both the statutory authority of the Minister to withhold permission for the placing of an individual order for aircraft by British European Airways (B.E.A.) andthe legal entitlement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to withholdapproval for the borrowing of any money needed for this purpose.The A attorney-General said that, in the light solely of the relevant provisions of the Air Corporation Act, 1949, he had reached theconclusion that the Minister of Civil Aviation could, if he thought itdesirable in the public interest, make a statutory instrument requiringB.E.A. not to buy any aircraft except in accordance with a general or special authority given by himself. By subsequently giving authorityonly for specific purchases, the Minister would be able to control theorders placed by the Corporation. It was also clear that there was no statutory limit on the exercise by the Treasury of their discretion togrant or to withhold consent to the borrowing of money for thepurposes mentioned in the Act. But since he had formulated this opinion he had had the opportunity to acquaint himself with thepractical issue which was in question, and he did not think that, if.E.A. were able to finance their proposed order of aircraft from thede Havilland group from their own resources, they were under any statutory obligation to seek consent to this course.The Minister of Civil A aviation said that hitherto he had contrivedto restrain B.E.A. from negotiating with the de Havilland group onthe ground that Treasury consent to the financial implications of theproposed contract had not yet been granted. But he could not sustainthis position indefinitely ; and, if the Government were to avoid apublic and unseemly dispute with B.E.A., there was no alternative butto allow the Corporation to embark on negotiations with the deHavilland group on the basis that it would be some time before these negotiations were likely to reach the point at which a formal contractwould need to be signed.In discussion there was general agreement with this view. Itwould be important, however, to avoid prejudicing the potentialexport orders for the type of aircraft produced to meet the B.E.A.requirement; and the prospects in this respect might be clarified if,during the negotiations between B.E.A. and the de Havilland group,the result of the negotiations between the Hawker/Bristol consortiumand Pan American Airways became known. Export orders would depend largely on the price of the aircraft; and there was as yet no indication of the price which the de Havilland group would charge for the manufacture of their design on the basis that the project was undertaken entirely as a private venture. While, therefore, B.E.A.should now be allowed to enter into negotiations with the de Havillandgroup, it should be clearly understood that these negotiations wouldbe conducted as unobtrusively as possible and that, if it emerged thatthe price to be charged by the company was unsatisfactory, theGovernment would be in no way committed to grant any consentwhich might be required before a formal contract could be signed.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation toinform the British European Airways Corporation that theymight now enter into negotiations with the de Havillandgroup about the production of a new jet aircraft, on theunderstanding that these negotiations would be conducted with the minimum of publicity and that the Governmenfsattitude towards their financial implications would depend,among other things, on the price which the companyproposed to charge.
United states forces in theUnited King-dom.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 100thConclusions,Minute 6.)Duty-FreePetrol.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (58) 33) on the provision of duty-free petrol for membersof the United States armed forces stationed in this country.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that, in accordancewith Article XI of the Status of Forces Agreement in the north atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), a number of other member countries provided the United States forces stationed in their territories with a ration of duty-free petrol. Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment had refused the original request by the United states authorities in 1948 for a similar concession, which had included petrolfor private motoring. After protracted discussion, however, a scheme had now been prepared to provide United States servicemen stationed in the United Kingdom with a ration of duty-free petrol for use intheir private cars on duty journeys. The ration was less generous thanthat provided in other countries, but the approximate cost to therevenue would be  l-2- millions a year. The scheme incorporatedreasonable safeguards against abuse. Despite the prevalent feeling in this country against any extension of privileges to foreigners, thebalance of advantage appeared to lie in approving this arrangement.In discussion it was agreed that it would be difficult for thiscountry to withhold a concession already granted by other membersof the North Atlantic Alliance. Moreover, this arrangement wouldentitle United Kingdom military personnel in the United States toreciprocal advantages. It would be unnecessary for the Governmentto make any special announcement about the new scheme, althoughit would inevitably become known.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (58) 33 but agreed that no formal Government announcement should be made on thissubject.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,12th February, 1958.
