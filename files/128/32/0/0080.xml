The Commonwealth Secretary said that there was to be a debate in the House of Lords on the following day on the positionof the British nationals whose assets in Egypt had been expropriated.The improvements which the Government had recently authorised inthe scheme of ex gratia advances to these individuals were likely tobe criticised as inadequate and there was some risk that theGovernment would sustain a defeat on a division.   It was for1. The Prime Minister said that he was disposed to comply withthe request from the Opposition for an early statement of the government&apos;s attitude on Cyprus. It would be necessary, however,to defer for as long as possible any general debate on this subject,having regard to the forthcoming discussion on Cyprus in theGeneral Assembly of the United Nations. Moreover, the security measures in the Island were in process of being intensified and itwas desirable that this process should be completed before anyParliamentary debate took place.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theColonial Secretary and the Minister of Defence, to submit to the Prime Minister the draft of a statement on thesituation in Cyprus, to be made in the House of commons on the following day.(2) Agreed that any demand for a general debate on Cyprusshould be resisted for the time being.The Prime Minister said that he proposed to appoint aCommittee, under the Chairmanship of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office, to co-ordinate and expedite action required in this country to assist the Governor of Cyprus in measures against terrorism.The Cabinet (3) Took note, with approval, of this statement.The Foreign Secretary recalled that the Cabinet had agreed to reconsider, in the light of developments in connection with the projected conference on Cyprus under the auspices of the north atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), the question whether weshould accept or oppose the proposal by the Sub-Commission of the human Rights Commission to take oral evidence on a number of outstanding cases of alleged ill-treatment by the Security Forces in cyprus.In discussion it was agreed that, since the NATO conference hadbeen abandoned, it was no longer relevant to consider the possible effect on that conference of the examination of witnesses by theSub-Commission. But in the light of the renewed outbreak of terrorism in the Island it was no less important to avoid any actionwhich might undermine the morale of the Security Forces; and theSub-Commission should therefore be informed that, while we wishedto comply with our obligations under the Human Rights Convention,it would be impracticable to make witnesses available for oralexamination at the present time.The Cabinet (4) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the UnitedKingdom spokesman before the Sub-Commission of the human Rights Commission to be guided by the points made in their discussion.
consideration whether the Government spokesmen should beauthorised to offer any further concession to the refugees.In discussion there was general agreement that the scheme of ex gratia advances, as recently amended, was generously conceivedand that it should be possible to demonstrate that criticism ofit was ill-founded. Nevertheless, it might be wise to indicate thatthe Government would be prepared, in addition, to consider some further extension of the scale of advances in cases in which exceptionalhardship could be shown to exist.The Cabinet Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, to arrange for government spokesmen in the forthcoming debate in the House of lords on British refugees from Egypt to indicate that theGovernment would be prepared to consider accordingspecial treatment to cases of exceptional hardship.armed forces.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 77thConclusions,Minute 7.)Officers&apos;Retired Pay.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 27thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Commonwealth Secretary said that a motion had been tabled for debate in the House of Lords on 13th November proposingan increase in the pensions of Service officers who retired before3rd September, 1939. There was some risk that, if the Governmentrejected this motion, they would be defeated on a division.In discussion there was general agreement that it would bedesirable to avoid any concession in respect of these pensions. Theyhad been increased within the last few years, and it would not bepossible to offer to reconsider them afresh without provoking claims for corresponding increases in the pensions of public servantsgenerally.The Cabinet Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to give furtherconsideration, in the light of their discussion, to the mannerin which the Government spokesmen would best invite theHouse of Lords to reject the motion proposing an increasein the pensions of Service officers who retired before3rd September, 1939.Disarmament.Nuclear Tests.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 28thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that little progress had so far been achieved in the conference between theUnited States, the Soviet Union and ourselves about the suspension of nuclear tests. The Soviet delegation had refused to consider thepossibility of establishing an organisation to supervise the executionof an agreement for this purpose until the agreement itself had been signed. We could not afford, however, to compromise on the connection  between these two issues and we must continue tomaintain that we could only agree to suspend the tests if it was also accepted that an effective organisation to supervise their suspensionwould be created.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of this statement.
Malta.Dockyard.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 64thConclusions,Minute 6.)The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that furtherconsideration should be given to the best method of resolving theissue. If it proved impossible to devise any means of helping theCompany which could be defended against the charge of impropriety,it would be better to allow events to take their course, even if theCompany were rendered insolvent and the negotiations for thetransfer of the dockyard at Malta to Messrs. Bailey&apos;s were imperilledas a result.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the FirstLord of the Admiralty (C. (58) 230) regarding the financial positionof the Atlantic Shipbuilding Company Limited.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that this company, whichwas managed and partly owned by Messrs. C. H. Bailey and CompanyLimited, had encountered serious financial difficulties in connectionwith a contract to build four ships for a Cuban purchaser. one ship had been delivered and was operating satisfactorily. But theCompany had been able to discount only seven of the ten bills ofexchange which they had received in respect of this ship; and, unless they were enabled to discount the remaining three bills, togetherwith the bills which they would receive in respect of the remainingthree ships, they would be unable to finance the balance of the contract and would become bankrupt. Messrs. Bailey&apos;s were in negotiation with the Admiralty in connection with the transfer of the dockyard at Malta; and the failure of a firm with which they wereconnected would be liable, by impairing their commercial reputation,to jeopardise those negotiations. He had therefore discussed withMartin&apos;s Bank, the Atlantic Shipbuilding Company&apos;s bankers, thepossibility of providing the Company with additional finance. TheBank would now be willing to allow the Company an overdraft of 300,000 while certain of the Company&apos;s creditors would be willing totake up debentures to the value of  350,000. These arrangements were dependent, however, on some means being found of discountingthe outstanding bills of exchange. Martin&apos;s Bank were notprepared to discount these bills unless the Export Credits guarantee department (E.C.G.D.) modified the standard repudiation clause intheir guarantee in such a manner as to eliminate the risk that the cuban purchaser might repudiate any of the bills issued in respect ofthe first ship if any of the remaining ships proved technicallyunsatisfactory. While the Bank were prepared to take the risk ofdiscounting the bills provided that the E.C.G.D. cover was altered to relate to each ship separately, they were not prepared to discount billsunder the present arrangement by which the contract and theguarantee related to the four ships collectively.In discussion it was suggested that, since there was no reasonto doubt the technical competence of the Company, E.C.G.D. shouldbe pressed either to modify their standard repudiation clause in thisparticular case or to re-issue the guarantee in four separate parts,each part relating to one ship. Alternatively, the Government mightinvoke the powers of exceptional finance available under Section iii of the Export Guarantee Act, 1949, by purchasing the bills of exchangeas a charge to the exchequer.On the other hand it was urged that it would be improper, andunprecedented, for E.C.G.D. to modify their guarantee in order tocover failure in performance by the supplier as distinct from failure by the foreign purchaser to honour her financial obligations. Therewere also considerable objections of principle, which were particularlycogent in the present case, to the use of public money to save acommercial firm from an embarrassment which it had invited by accepting a major contract with insufficient capital to finance workin progress.
The Cabinet Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with thePresident of the Board of Trade, the Minister of Power, theFirst Lord of the Admiralty, the Minister of State for colonial Affairs and the Economic Secretary, Treasury, toexamine, as a matter of urgency, the issues described inC. (58) 230 and to report their conclusions as rapidly aspossible.6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a claim had beenreceived for a further interim increase in the remuneration of doctors and dentists in the National Health Service. Early in 1957 the doctors had been granted, without prejudice to the recommendationsof the Royal Commission on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration,an interim increase of 5 per cent, for general medical practitionersand 10 per cent, for junior hospital medical staff. Apart from thisadjustment they had received no increase in remuneration since 1952.The Committee on Wages Policy had agreed that, in the light of the changes in remuneration of other occupations since that year and ofthe interval which still remained before the recommendations of theRoyal Commission could be received and considered, the case for afurther interim increase had been made out. They had considered,however, that it should be limited to 4 per cent, since, if both the doctors and the teachers received an increase of 5 per cent, publicopinion might regard the Government as accepting a general pattern of wage increases of this order. It was open to question whether theincrease should be granted at once or deferred for a few months.On the one hand,, it was desirable that it should have taken effectbefore the next cycle of wage claims began. On the other hand, itshould be so timed, if possible, as not to embarrass the Governmentin dealing with the demand for a central settlement for the CivilService or to intensify the impression that the Government were less concerned to secure economy in public expenditure. On balance, theCommittee had concluded that the increase to the doctors should begranted as from an early date.The Minister of Health said that a further increase in remuneration for doctors and dentists could be distinguished fromother pay increases since it would be, and could be presented as, an interim settlement pending the report of the Royal Commission,whose Chairman had stated that he would endorse it. The quarterlymeeting of the Council of the British Medical Association was to beheld during that week; it was desirable that the reply to their claim should be sent before the meeting, although they should be asked notto make it public without the agreement of the Government.In discussion there was general agreement that an interim increase of 4 per cent, should be offered to the doctors and dentistsin the National Health Service. The increase, which should bejustified primarily by reference to the length of time which wouldelapse before the Royal Commission were able to report, should take effect from 1st January, 1959. Further consideration should, however,be given to the date on which it should be publicly announced, inthe light of the decision on the comparable claim by the teaching profession.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Health to offer a 4 per cent,interim increase in the remuneration of doctors and dentists in the National Health Service, to take effect from 1st January, 1959.remuneration of doctors and Dentists.(previous reference:CC. (57) 34thConclusions,Minute 8.)
Middle East.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 73rdConclusions,Minute 2.)Kuwait.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 62ndConclusion,Minute 1.)7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (58) 228) about the form in which Kuwait should adhere to certain international maritime conventions and to the International.Telecommunications Union.The Foreign Secretary said that Kuwait wished to acquire fulland independent membership of these institutions. There was some danger that, if we acceded to this request, we should be regarded asadmitting that Kuwait was fully responsible for the conduct of its international relations and our position in the Persian Gulf might, asa result, be weakened. On the other hand the Ruler of Kuwait had for some time been assuming progressively greater responsibility forthe internal administration of his country, and it would not necessarily be to our disadvantage that he should take a more direct and personalinterest in its international relations as well. If we opposed this tendency we should risk forfeiting his goodwill and should appearto be attempting to impose our authority on a country which waslegally independent, although it enjoyed our protection. But if weallowed the Ruler to develop an international personality of his own,we could hope to retain his confidence without modifying the substance of our relationship with him. The balance of advantage appeared,therefore, to lie in agreeing that Kuwait should apply for full membership of these international institutions, provided that the ruler was clearly warned of the possible implications of this action.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal.It was suggested that the decision should not be given undue publicitybut that, in so far as it provoked comment, it should be represented as a natural step in the development of Kuwait, which the Ruler hadtaken after consultation, and in agreement, with ourselves.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C.r&apos; (58) 228.commercial policy.Free trade area.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 79thConclusions,Minute 2.)8. The Paymaster-General said that it was now clear that theFrench Government were not prepared to accept the fundamental principles of a European Free Trade Area and that the other membersof the Six Powers, though they supported the concept, were notprepared to force the issue with France. The negotiations should,however, be continued in the hope that the French government might modify their attitude to some extent. They might be prepared,for example, to extend to the other members of the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation the tariff reductions which theywere due to concede to the rest of the Six Powers on 1st January, 1959.Such an offer would enable them to maintain that, despite their inability to accept a Free Trade Area, they were anxious to avoid creating a fresh area of discrimination in Europe. We might find itdifficult to object to a proposal of this kind. On the other hand, inso far as it would postpone still further the creation of the Free trade area, it would be to our disadvantage since it would provide the SixPowers with an interval in which to increase their competitiveefficiency in relation to the rest of Europe. It was for consideration,therefore, whether we should ourselves propose an arrangement whereby a Free Trade Area would be established but France would receive special treatment for the first few years of its life. It wouldbe possible, for example, to arrange for France to be entitled to allthe benefits of membership of the Free Trade Area but not to beC.C. 80 (58)(2) Invited the Minister of Health to consider, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the date on whichthis increase should be publicly announced.
required to extend to the other members, apart from the Six Powers,the tariff concessions which she was due to make to the Six Powersthemselves. Our own interests should not suffer unduly from anarrangement of this kind; but our negotiating position might be strengthened by offering it.In discussion there was general agreement that it might bedesirable to put forward a proposal of this kind at the appropriate moment. It should, however, be held in reserve until the french prime Minister had replied to the latest message from the PrimeMinister about the Free Trade Area. Thereafter it would benecessary to consider the timing of the proposal, having regard to theforthcoming general election in France and to the importance ofgiving advance warning to the other members of the Commonwealthof an arrangement which would give France a preferential positionwithin a European Free Trade Area. It might also be advantageous to consider how far we could enlist the active support of the UnitedStates Government for the Free Trade Area project, in the light ofthe negotiating powers which they possessed under the ReciprocalTrade Agreements legislation.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.Privileges ofinternationalOrganisations.InternationalSugar Council.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 45thConclusions,Minute 10.)9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (58) 225) reporting that the United Kingdom delegation to the International Sugar Conference had been authorised, as amatter of urgency, to accept an amendment to the InternationalSugar Agreement, 1953, the effect of which would be to confer on theInternational Sugar Council partial exemption from municipal ratessimilar to that already accorded to other international organisations.A new Order in Council would be required to give effect to thisprovision.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the amendment of the International sugar agreement, 1953, extending to the International SugarCouncil a partial exemption from municipal rates.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to submit the necessary Orderin Council for Parliamentary approval in due course.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,11th November, 1958.
