SECRET3CC. 74 (58)Q- territorial waters.IcelandicFisheryLimits.(previous reference :CC. (58) 71stConclusions,Minute 7.)Oil Supplies.(previous reference :CC. (57) 40thConclusions,Minute 4.)1. The Foreign Secretary said that there had as yet been noresponse from the Icelandic Government to our suggestion that thedispute over the Icelandic fishery limits should be referred to theInternational Court of Justice. The situation might, however,deteriorate if the Icelandic Government sought to give effect to theirlatest declaration that they would arrest British trawlers on the high seas on their way home from the fishing grounds; and we should consider how we should react to any threat of this kind. Meanwhile,no agreement had been reached with the Danish Government on theFaroese claim to a twelve-mile limit for exclusive fishing rights; but our relations with the Danes remained cordial and there was noreason to fear that they would take unilateral action against us.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for an examination of the measures which might need to be adoptedif the Icelandic Government attempted to arrest British trawlers on the high seas.2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Power (C. (58) 198 and 199) on oil supplies. Civil stocks of oil inthis country at present amounted to about fourteen weeks&apos; supply;and it was proposed that, in view of the precarious situation in theMiddle East, they should be increased by the equivalent of a furtherone month&apos;s supply, or 2\ million tons, as an insurance againstinterruption of oil imported from that area. This reinforcement ofour oil reserves should enable us, in an emergency, to meet therequirements of consumption, on a restricted basis, for approximatelytwice as long as existing stocks would permit.The Minister of Power said that, if his proposal were approved in principle by the Cabinet, J million tons of the additional reservecould be constituted by filling surplus Government oil storage, as it became available, at a cost of some  10 millions. The Ministry&apos;sunderground potash brine storage capacity was to be increased by1 million tons, at a cost of about  1^ millions, and the remainingJ million tons capacity might be obtained by building new government storage on land owned by the oil companies. If theseproposals were approved, he would enter into negotiations with the oil companies about the filling of the extended potash brine capacity and the erection of Government storage on their land, and would report further to the Cabinet.Discussion showed that there was general agreement that oil stocks in this country should be increased by 2\ million tons. Thisdecision should be regarded, however, as an insurance against aparticular risk which might develop in peacetime and not as implyingthe adoption of a policy of stockpiling strategic reserves generally.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was in the interest of the oil companies that all reasonablesteps should be taken to safeguard the level of consumption if middle east supplies were interrupted. They should therefore be pressed to meet some part of the cost of the additional provision to be made.(b) It was to the advantage of the United States that supplies of oil to Europe should not be unduly dislocated, and it might bepossible to secure some financial aid from the United StatesGovernment towards building up stocks in this country.(c) It would in any case be convenient that the Cabinet should consider, in the near future, the whole issue of the relations between this country and North America, particularly Canada, in regard tooil supplies.
british transport commission.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 35thConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Transport (C. (58) 202) on the financial position of theBritish Transport Commission, together with a memorandum bythe Minister of Power (C. (58) 203) on the effect of the recession on the fuel and steel industries.The Minister of Transport said that, in accordance with thedisinflationary policy adopted by the Cabinet in the previous autumn,the British Transport Commission had been informed that theGovernment would finance a deficit in 1958 only up to the level ofthe deficit of  63^ millions which they had incurred in 1957. It now appeared that the 1958 deficit would be of the order of  85 millions.The Commission had honoured their undertaking to introduce majoreconomies in the operation of the railways, and the increase in the deficit was due solely to a reduction in the freights of coal, minerals and steel as a result of the recession in those industries. He therefore proposed to authorise the Commission to seek accommodation fromthe banks to meet their need for finance in the immediate future and thereafter to take power, in the Bill extending their borrowing powers which would in any event be required during the 1958-59session, to increase the  250 millions authorised by the RailwayFinances Act, 1957 for meeting deficits until the modernisation planmatured. The extent of the deficit was not publicly known: but itcould not be concealed indefinitely and it would be preferable thatthe Chairman of the Commission should be authorised to make some public reference to the financial position of the Commission, ingeneral terms, in the near future.In discussion it was suggested that, while action must clearly betaken to provide for the current deficit, it. might be preferable thatthe Commission should borrow for this purpose direct from theGovernment rather than from the banks. This point should befurther considered. Meanwhile any public statement by theChairman of the Commission should make it clear that theCommission^ difficulties should be only temporary.The effect of the recession on the railways, however, brought inquestion the future of the modernisation programme. While the recession in the steel industry might be expected to be only short-lived, the decline in coal freights, which reflected the increasing useof oil, was probably permanent. It might therefore be argued thatthe railway modernisation programme was related to a more elaboraterailway system than would be required for the traffic which it was likely to handle in future. The programme should be reconsideredin the light of the effect of the recession. It must be recognised,however, that, if it was abandoned or drastically curtailed, therailways could be operated only on the basis of a substantial annualsubsidy.In further discussion it was suggested that the issues underconsideration indicated the importance of making a fresh assessment of the probable future course of the economy. The recession appearedto be uneven in incidence; and its immediate causes were not clear.In some areas order books were still relatively full; in other areasthey were disconcertingly low. In the steel industry, it was uncertain whether the fall in demand was primarily attributable to a reductionasThe Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that oil stocks in this country should beincreased by 2\ million tons.(2) Agreed that existing Government oil storage should be filled,as it became available, to the extent of   million tons.(3) Invited the Minister of Power, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to open negotiations withthe oil companies, on the lines proposed in their discussion, about the financial basis on which the balanceof the additional reserves should be procured.
The Qneen&apos;s 4.   The Cabinet had before them notes by the Lord ChancellorSpeeches.        (c (58) 2Q0 and 201) covering initial drafts of The Queen&apos;s speeches on the Prorogation and Opening of Parliament.In discussion various textual amendments were suggested and approved. The following points of substance were also considered :  Prorogation (a) Paragraph 6.   The reference to the withdrawal of BritishSpeech. forces from Jordan might need reconsideration in the light of developments in the next two weeks.(b) Paragraph 7. It would be necessary to reconsider, at a later stage, the precise wording of the reference to our dispute with the icelandic Government about fishery limits.(c) Paragraph 26. It might also be desirable to review the wording of the reference to the Landlord and Tenant (temporary provisions) Act after its provisions had come into effect on 6th October.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Committee on The Queen&apos;s Speeches to prepare,in the light of their discussion, a revised draft of the queen&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament, forthe Cabinefs consideration at a subsequent meeting.C.C. 74 (58)in the investment programme of the heavy industries or to de-stockingby manufacturers of steel products. Moreover, the statistics ofemployment had momentarily ceased to provide reliable guidance.The September return, which was due to be published in the following week, would indicate that unemployment had risen by 30,000 to a level of 2-2 per cent. This was greater than the normal seasonalincrease; but at the same time, the number of unfilled vacancies wasalso higher than normal. Ministers should consider whether it wouldbe appropriate to modify further the disinflationary policy whichhad been enforced during the previous twelve months.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theEconomic Policy Committee should undertake forthwith a reviewof the current position and forward prospects of the economy as awhole, bearing in mind the recent increase in the gold and dollar reserves and the rise in unemployment. This review, which mightlegitimately reflect differing opinions about the causes and probableconsequences of the current recession, should thereafter be submittedto the Cabinet as rapidly as possible; and in the light of its conclusions the Cabinet might wish to reconsider their policy on social and productive investment.The Cabinet -(1) &quot;Invited the Minister of Transport to discuss with theChancellor of the Exchequer the method by which theBritish Transport Commission should be enabled to meet their deficit in the current year.(2) Agreed that the Chairman of the Commission should beauthorised to give a public indication, in general terms,of the Commission^ present financial position.(3) Invited the Minister of Transport to reconsider theprogramme of railway modernisation in the light of their discussion.(4) Invited the Financial Secretary, Treasury, to prepare, forconsideration initially by the Economic Policy Committee,a memorandum on the current position and forwardprospects of the economy as a whole.(5) Invited the Minister of Labour to prepare a similar review ofthe probable course of employment.
Opening (d) It was agreed that, in the light of The Queen&apos;s forthcomingSpeech. tour Gf Canada, it would be appropriate that the traditional orderof presentation should be varied and that the paragraphs dealingwith the Commonwealth should precede those discussing foreignaffairs.(e) It would also be appropriate that a reference should bemade to Her Majesty&apos;s prospective stay in Ghana.(/) Paragraph 6. The second sentence, referring to the promotion of a just and enduring settlement in the Middle East,should be reconsidered in the light of its possible political impact onthe countries in that area.(g) Paragraph 12. The reference to a Second World Conferenceon the Law of the Sea and to the current dispute about fishery limitsshould be reviewed again in due course.(h) Paragraph 13. The reference to legislation to repeal the catering Wages Act should stand.(/) Paragraph 14. The announcement of new plans designed toimprove secondary school education was dependent on an adequateallocation being made for education within the forward investment programme.(/) Paragraph 16. The Governments proposals for areconstruction of the National Insurance system should be described in more positive and attractive terms; and the paragraph should begiven a more prominent place in the section dealing with socialreform.The Lord Chancellor recalled that, at their last discussion of thelegislative programme, the Cabinet had given only a provisionalplace in the programme to five of the Bills mentioned in The GraciousSpeech (dealing respectively with assistance to small farmers, wages councils, denominational schools, New Towns and house purchase)on the ground that the other Bills mentioned in the Speech, togetherwith those which, though not mentioned, were known to be essential,would probably exhaust the time likely to be available for legislation.It was agreed that this issue would need to be further considered inthe near future and that there might be advantage in omittingreference to some of these Bills.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Committee on The Queen&apos;s Speeches to prepare a revised draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening ofParliament, for consideration by the Cabinet at a subsequent meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,3rd October, 1958.
