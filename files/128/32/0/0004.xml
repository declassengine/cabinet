The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that theChancellor of the Exchequer, after considering the course of theprevious day&apos;s discussion on the level of Government expenditure in1958-59, had now felt obliged to tender his resignation. TheFinancial and Economic Secretaries to the Treasury had alsoresigned their offices.It would be right that, despite this, the Government shouldcontinue to discharge the responsibilities of office and to pursue thefinancial and economic policies on which they had embarked. Itwould be desirable that, in his reply to the Chancellor^ letter of resignation, he should make it plain that the Cabinet remained inunanimous agreement on their fundamental policies.In discussion, there was general agreement with this view. TheCabinet expressed their appreciation of the efforts which the Prime-Minister had made to persuade the Chancellor of the Exchequer toaccept the views which were held by all his Cabinet colleagues onthe extent to which Government expenditure could properly belimited in the coming year.*2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (C. (58) 4) covering a draft parliamentary statement of policy on Cyprus, together with an outline of measuresto be announced simultaneously by the Governor.The Colonial Secretary said that a new initiative by theGovernment was necessary if the situation in Cyprus was not seriously to deteriorate once again. The draft statement in Annex Ato C. (58) 4, which had been approved by the Colonial PolicyCommittee and was intended to be made to Parliament on itsreassembly, reaffirmed the Governments intention to achieve asettlement of the problem of Cyprus on the basis of the principle ofself-determination seven years after the ending of the present emergency, provided that (i) questions affecting the Turkish community in Cyprus wouldbe fairly settled and the Turkish-Cypriots no less than the Greek -Cypriots would be given the right of self-determination as a community;(ii) such bases and installations as might be required to meet the strategic needs of Her Majesty&apos;s Government and their Allies wouldbe retained under British sovereignty;(iii) the people of Cyprus showed during the seven-year periodthat they were ready to co-operate in working and maintaining arepresentative Constitution, the details of which would be fordiscussion, in the first instance, with the Governor of Cyprus in the island.At the same time measures would be announced in Cyprus bythe Governor to bring the state of emergency to an end in a periodof three months. These measures, which were outlined in provisionalform in Annex B to C. (58) 4, would involve the progressive releaseof individuals detained under the emergency regulations and the revocation of the regulations themselves at the end of the period,after which Archbishop Makarios would be free to return to the island on his assurance that he would use all his influence for themaintenance of peaceful conditions.Proposals on these lines would not prejudice the final solutionof the problem, while they would also make clear our readiness toPreviously recorded in a Confidential Annex.52960-6b 2
accept at any time dispositions for the future of the Island which hadthe approval of the Greek and Turkish Governments and of bothcommunities in Cyprus, provided that our requirement in respect ofmilitary bases was satisfied. They would also preserve the basicassurance to the Turkish community to which the TurkishGovernment attached such great importance. There were grounds for hoping, therefore, that they would enlist the support of moderate opinion in Cyprus and would create a new and calmer atmospherein which genuine progress might be made towards an ultimatelysatisfactory solution.The Foreign Secretary said that an initiative of this nature wasnot likely to be welcomed by the Turkish Government, for whomCyprus has now become a major issue m domestic politics. At bestwe could hope to secure no more than their grudging acquiescence.To this end they should be given adequate time in which to considerthe proposals, and these should therefore be communicated to themin the first instance by H.M. Ambassador in Ankara as soon aspossible. Thereafter the Governor of Cyprus should visit Ankarafor consultation with H.M. Ambassador and for discussion, as necessary, with the Turkish Government about the new proposals.He should then make a similar visit to Athens, when he would takethe opportunity to meet Archbishop Makarios. The GreekGovernment would probably reject the proposals outright, unless theywere influenced by the Archbishop, who might fear that his ownstanding in Cyprus would be jeopardised if he rejected a plan which involved the end of the emergency in the Island. If so, it wasmarginally possible that the Greek-Cypriots would be given a genuineopportunity to seek a solution which was neither Enosis nor partition.On the other hand, if both the Turkish and Greek Governmentsreacted strongly against the proposals, it would be necessary to reconsider them. In any event it was essential that they should, ifpossible, remain strictly secret until it become clear whether it wouldbe realistic for the Government to announce them.In discussion there was general agreement that these proposals and the procedures for implementing them should, in principle, be endorsed.  The following points were made (a) It might be pointed out to the Turkish Government that their interests would best be served by a settlement which might command a measure of bipartisan support in this country. It was forconsideration whether they might also be offered a base in Cyprus.(b) Any suggestion of negotiation with Archbishop Makariosmust be avoided. His return to Cyprus at the end of the emergency should not, therefore, be made conditional upon his giving an assurance that he would use all his influence for the maintenance of peaceful conditions, and we should confine ourselves to providing that those individuals who had been excluded from Cyprus duringthe emergency, including the Archbishop, would be free to returnwhen it was declared at an end. If, however, the Archbishopvolunteered a statement of his readiness to work for peace in Cyprus,we should be free to use it as we saw fit.(c) It was desirable that we should not commit ourselves evenby implication, to continue to enforce law and order in Cyprusregardless of developments; and it might be politic explicitly to reserve our freedom of action if, during the seven-year period, theinhabitants of Cyprus made the orderly administration of the Islandimpossible. On the other hand any suggestion that we might beprepared to abandon our sovereignty over the Island would be politically damaging and might provoke the Turkish Governmentto renew intercommunal strife in Cyprus in the hope of forcing theissue of partition without further delay.(d) It would be desirable to make it clear that the detainees tobe released would be individuals who had not been legally convicted
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,7th January, 1958.of any offence, that the least dangerous of them would be releasedfirst and that the process could be suspended if peaceful conditions were not maintained. Indeed, it was for consideration whether freshpowers should be taken to retain the most dangerous of the detaineesafter the end of the emergency, if the situation so required. Inpractice, however, it might prove difficult to single out theseindividuals; and all but a very small number of the present detaineescould, in any case, be rearrested if the situation deteriorated againafter their release. The balance of advantage, therefore, wouldprobably lie in releasing all those now detained by the date when theemergency was declared at an end.(e) The cases of those convicted during the emergency would fall to be reviewed by the Governor in Executive Council. But therewould be no automatic amnesty for persons who had committedcriminal offences during that period and were arrested after its end.It would, however, be desirable to maintain the previous Governor^offer of a safe conduct out of the Island for the leader of the terroristforces if he surrendered when the new proposals were announced.The Cabinet (1) Approved, in principle, the proposals in C. (58) 4.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theColonial Secretary, to arrange for these proposals to becommunicated to the Turkish and Greek Governments.(3) Invited the Colonial Secretary, in revising the draft parliamentary statement and in giving furtherconsideration to the measures to bring the state ofemergency to an end, to have regard to the points madein their discussion.
