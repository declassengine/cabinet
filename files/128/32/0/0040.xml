ContentsIndustrial Disputes.
Industrial * The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the railway wagesDisputes.        dispute.(previous reference: The Minister of Labour said that on 8th May the Executive of theC.C. (58) 39th National Union of Railwaymen had adopted, by a small majority, a conclusions, motion calling for strike action on Whit Sunday, 25th May, if the minute 3). British Transport Commission would not grant a wage increase withimmediate effect. His own discussion with representatives of thethree unions on the following day had confirmed that they would notbe content with the Commission^ offer of an increase taking effect from October. It was, however, possible that they could be induced to accept an increase of 3 per cent, with effect from July. in considering whether such an offer should be made to the railwaymen,the Cabinet should bear two further points in mind first that thecost-of-living index figure, which would be published on 23rd May,would show an increase of two points over the previous month; and secondly, that the arbitrator was due to make towards the end of themonth an award on the current wage claim in the coal-miningindustry. If it were seen that the cost-of-living index figure had risenand if some wage increase had been awarded to the miners, public sympathy with the claims of the railwaymen might be enhanced.The Minister of Transport said that further examination had shown that it should be possible, by an intensification of the measuresto increase productivity on the railways which had been agreed at an earlier stage between the Government, the Transport Commissionand the railway unions, to increase the probable savings from 10 millions to  12+ millions in a full year. But the Chairman of theCommission still adhered to his view that he would not be able beforethe autumn to judge with confidence the extent to which theseeconomies would be realised; and, as  12^ millions represented the equivalent of a 4 per cent, increase in wages, he would prefer to deferany award until October but to concede it at that point at the rate of4 per cent. Alternatively, he would be prepared to contemplate anincrease of 3 per cent, in July rising to 4 per cent, in October, paymentbeing deferred, if possible, until October and the increase in the initialthree months being regarded as an anticipation of the economies which should be realised from October onwards. In either event, hewould wish the wage award to be linked with an offer by theGovernment to institute a comprehensive review, by an independent body, of the wages structure in the railway industry.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be undesirable to introduce a figure of 4 per cent, into the negotiations.This would set a dangerous precedent for other industries in whichwage claims were still pending; and it could not be assumed at thisstage that the economies which would justify it would be realised infull. On the other hand a wage increase of 3 per cent., with effect from July, would be fully justified by the prospect of economies ofthe order of  12J millions a year from October onwards; and asettlement on this basis could be more easily defended to theGovernment^ supporters both in the House of Commons and in thecountry. It would however be necessary to satisfy public opinion thatthe substitution of July for October as the effective date of the award,so far from representing a concession by the Government to theunions, had been made possible only by the Government^ insistencethat the economies which justified the award should be increased.It would be difficult to demonstrate this fact before any settlement was reached, since the unions would be liable to claim that theincrease in economies from  10 millions to  12^ millions would justify an increase in the wage award from 3 per cent, to 4 per cent. Butif agreement was reached on an award of 3 per cent, with effect from july, it would be necessary thereafter to devise some means of
acquainting the Governments supporters with the details of this settlement and the successive stages by which it had been reached, inorder that they might be assured that, in sanctioning it, theGovernment had not infringed the fundamental principles of their economic policy.In further discussion it was suggested that the offer of anindependent enquiry into the wages structure of the railway industry might also be interpreted by public opinion as a weakening on thepart of the Government and an invitation to the unions to press forfurther wage increases. On the other hand, the Chairman of theTransport Commission regarded this proposal as an important element in any settlement with the unions; and it could be held to bejustified by the fact that, in the recent arbitration, the Railway StaffsNational Tribunal had pointed out that railway wages contrastedunfavourably with the wages paid for comparable work in otherindustries. If possible, this enquiry should be dealt with as a separateissue, after the wage dispute had been settled. But if the Chairmanof the Commission regarded it as an indispensable element in thesettlement, he should be given discretion to offer it at the appropriatepoint.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it was desirable that the Government should be seen to adhere resolutely tothe disinflationary policy which they had launched in the previousautumn. But, provided that this policy was not jeopardised in anyfundamental respect, it would be prudent to seek to deal separatelywith the various industrial disputes which were threatening to develop and to avoid a conflict with organised labour on a wide front. there could be no certainty that, in such a conflict, the Government would retain the support of public opinion unless it was clear that the tradeunions were deliberately organising a conspiracy against the life ofthe community. On balance, therefore, it would be desirable that theChairman of the Transport Commission should be authorised to seek a settlement with the railway unions on the basis of a wage increase of3 per cent., either with effect from October but retrospective to Julyor, if necessary, with effect from July. He might also have discretion to incorporate in the settlement the offer of an independent enquiry into the wages structure of the railway industry.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theMinister of Labour and the Minister of Transport, wouldgive further consideration to the manner in which theChairman of the British Transport Commission should beinvited to seek to achieve a settlement of the current railwaydispute on the lines indicated in their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,13th May, 1958.
