commercial policy.Free trade area.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 81stConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinet considered what arrangements should be madefor Ministerial meetings with Dr. Erhard, the Economic Minister forFederal Germany, who had come to London to discuss the state of thenegotiations on the proposals for a European Free Trade Area.They agreed that, so long as the Organisation for European economic co-operation was handling this problem on behalf of all its members,the United Kingdom Government should not appear to benegotiating separately with a representative of the Six Powers..Dr. Erhard would be seeing the Paymaster-General in the firstinstance. But, if he subsequently wished to see the Prime Minister,the Foreign Secretary or the Chancellor of the Exchequer, it mightbe preferable that they should see him separately rather than jointly.Indonesia. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that deliveries of major itemsSupply of of war-like equipment from this country to Indonesia had recentlyArms. been held up in deference to the views of the Netherlands and australian Governments, who feared that they might be used for anattack on Dutch New Guinea. It would be difficult on this account to justify further delay in executing an Indonesian order for Gannetaircraft, since these were not suited to an aggressive role. he therefore proposed that deliveries of these aircraft to Indonesiashould now go forward.In discussion there was general support for the foreign secretary&apos;s proposal. It was suggested that the existing ban onthe export of ships to Indonesia should also be reconsidered. Nouniform policy was now being followed, even among the western powers, in respect of the export of arms to Indonesia; and we shouldneedlessly damage our economic interests by continuing to withholdsupplies if the only result of our withholding them was that theywere obtained from elsewhere.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to remove the ban on the delivery of Gannet aircraft to Indonesia.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the strategic exports (Official) Committee to review the existing banon the supply of ships to Indonesia.Parliament. 3.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Parliament would be adjourned for the Christmas recess on18th December. An announcement to this effect would be made that afternoon. It was proposed that Parliament should reassemble on20th January.British 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the aluminium Economic Secretary, Treasury (C. (58) 247) on the future of theCompany. British Aluminium Company (B.A.C.). The company had soughtTreasury consent, under the relevant exchange control and capitalissues regulations, to issue the whole of their authorised but unissuedstock, consisting of A\ million  1 shares, to the Aluminium company of America (Alcoa) at a price of 60s. a share and, without consultingexisting shareholders, had entered into a contract with Alcoa for thispurpose which would be legally binding as soon as Treasury consentwas given. In addition Alcoa proposed to offer to buy about1 million shares in B.A.C. at present held by Reynolds Tube
Investments Aluminium (R.T.I.A.), a United Kingdom company which Tube Investments Limited (T.I.) had formed jointly withReynolds Metals Company, a United States concern. Alcoa had publicly stated that they had no desire to gain control of B.A.C.;but as a result of the proposed transaction they would in fact acquire the largest single holding in the company and de facto control over it.Simultaneously, however, Treasury consent had been sought by TubeInvestments to acquire the whole of the existing equity of B.A.C. ata price of about 78s. a share, in order that it might be transferred toR.T.I.A. on the basis that T.I. themselves would retain 51 per cent,of the shares and voting rights and Reynolds the remaining 49 percent. In this event the majority holding of T.I. would ensure that control of B.A.C. would remain in the United Kingdom.Capital issues consent had been recommended in each case bythe Capital Issues Committee. From the point of view of exchange control, the Alcoa proposal would result in an addition to our gold and dollar reserves of some  4^ millions immediately, together witha further  9 millions over the next three years, as compared with animmediate payment of about  15^ millions under the R.T.I.A.proposal. Moreover, it would have the result that control of thecompany would pass into the hands of United States interestswhereas the R.T.I.A. scheme would retain control of B.A.C. in theUnited Kingdom. On the other hand, the Board of B.A.C. werefirmly of the view that an association with Alcoa would be of greateradvantage to the company in the long term. In particular, althoughT.I. had given an undertaking that, in association with Reynolds, theywould produce the capital necessary for present and futured development, their purchase of the B.A.C. shares would not in itselfincrease the capital of the company whereas the Alcoa proposal would provide an immediate reinforcement of the company&apos;s capital resources and would also provide the company with access to asubstantial source of further capital in the future.It was suggested in the memorandum that in these circumstances the wisest course might be to indicate, in a Parliamentary statement,that the Government thought it preferable that effective control of.A.C. should remain in this country; that they proposed, therefore,to withhold their consent to the Alcoa proposal pending a decision by the shareholders whether they would prefer to accept the T.I.offer; and that, if the shareholders accepted this offer, theGovernment would make that choice effective by refusing consent tothe Alcoa proposal.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as he held shares inone of the companies concerned, he proposed to take no part in the cabinet&apos;s discussion or in the final decision on this matter.In discussion it was suggested that the Government might beheld to be failing in their duty if by proceeding at once to exercise their powers under the Exchange Control Act they deprived the shareholders of B.A.C. of the opportunity to take account of thealternative bid for the existing shares at the higher price of 78s. pershare. On the other hand it must be assumed that the Board of.A.C. had acted, in relation to the shareholders, in conformity withthe company&apos;s Articles of Association; and it would be unwise forthe Government to use their statutory powers in an attempt to influence the company&apos;s policy in this respect unless some overridingnational interest was involved. Moreover, the Chairman of T.I. was likely to ask for a special meeting of shareholders of B.A.C. in orderto contest the action of the Board in entering into the contract withAlcoa. At the same time, the Chairman of BAG. had prepared a letter for issue to the company&apos;s shareholders setting out, with considerable force, the arguments in support of the course favoured by the Board. In these circumstances it seemed preferable thatGovernment action should be deferred for a time in order that the true interests of the company and of the shareholders might be
CC. 83 (58)established by public discussion and that the Governments decision,when finally given, should be seen to be confined to the issues ofpublic policy which were involved.It could be argued that such public discussion would be to someextent unreal so long as the Governments own intentions remainedunknown. Moreover, its outcome would not necessarily assist theGovernment in reaching their own ultimate decision on the main issue of the future control of the company. On the other hand, thecase was in some respects similar to the disposal of TrinidadLeaseholds Limited; and the Governments decision would be liableto provoke the same type of political controversy. The two casesdiffered, however, in that on the earlier occasion there had been no effective alternative to the course which the Government had finally approved whereas the present case offered the possibility of a genuinechoice between the immediate attractions of the R.T.I.A. proposal and the longer-term advantages of the Alcoa scheme. this consideration reinforced the argument that it would be desirable thatthe respective merits of these two courses from the point of view ofthe company and the shareholders should be ventilated in public discussion before the Government sought to reach their decision.In the meantime no Parliamentary statement about the governments intentions should be made.The Cabinet &apos;-(1) Invited the Economic Secretary, Treasury, to arrange forthe interests concerned to be informed that on theinformation at present before them the Government werenot ready to reach a decision on the issues involved inthe applications for their consent to certain changes inthe capital structure of the British Aluminium Company.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a later meeting.*5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet thatthe stand-by credit of $739 millions, which we had obtained from theInternational Monetary Fund (I.M.F.) in December 1956, wouldlapse at the end of the year. It would be to our advantage to secure its renewal for a further year; but we might find some difficulty in doing so, in view of the recent increases in our reserves of gold and dollars, unless we were prepared to indicate that we hoped to be able,during 1959, to make a further move towards the full convertibility of sterling and the elimination of dollar discrimination. In addition wewere due to repay in 1960 and 1961 the amounts which we had drawn from the Fund under arrangements made at the time when the stand-by credit had been established. Our case for a renewal of the creditwould be strengthened if we offered to repay $200 millions next april and to repay the balance by monthly instalments during 1960 and1961.In discussion it was suggested that, if we accepted an implicitcommitment to advance to full convertibility of sterling during 1959,we might be inviting serious risks on the one hand, the additionalliability of a progressive removal of dollar discrimination if theoperation succeeded; on the other hand, a fresh shock to international confidence in sterling if it failed. Was our need to renew the stand-by credit so great that we must expose ourselves tothis dilemma? Or might it be preferable to dispense with an extensionof the credit and to avoid any further commitments in respect ofconvertibility? Moreover, we had undertaken to make a significant contribution to an increase in the capital of the I.M.F. during 1959.InternationalMonetaryFund.(previous reference :CC. (56) 68thConclusions,Minute 9.)
1 qPensions. 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Home(Previous Secretary (C. (58) 244) setting out the recommendations of the references: Ministerial Committee on Pensions on a number of suggestions forCC. (58) 75th improving the scheme proposed in the recent White Paper on Pensions.Conclusions, j-^e fjome Secretary said that these suggestions,  and the minute 5 and  Committee&apos;s recommendations, were as follows :  CC. (58) 72ndConclusions: (i) It was arguable whether the Exchequer contribution to the minute 1.) new scheme should be permanently fixed at  170 millions a year, asproposed in the White Paper, or whether it should be increasedquinquennially at the same time as the contributions of employersand employees. The Committee proposed a compromise whereby the Exchequer contribution would remain at  170 millions a yearuntil such time as that figure fell below a quarter of the income fromminimum contributions and would then be increased to bear thatproportionate relationship. By this means the principle of a tripartitepartnership would be preserved without imposing an unreasonableaditional liability on the Exchequer.(ii) The scheme had been criticised on the ground that workersearning less than  9 a week would be excluded from its graduatedelement and would thus have no opportunity to qualify for a betterpension than at present. The Committee had felt, however, that,although it would be possible to increase the pension of such workersby abandoning the proposed reduction in their contributions, suchan increase would be less popular than the reduction in contributionsitself. Moreover it would be prudent to leave some scope foradjusting the financial structure of the scheme at the time when anincrease in the basic rate of benefit would become inevitable. Forthese reasons tfie Committee recommended that the scheme shouldnot be changed in this respect.If we could undertake this additional liability and at the same timeaccelerate our repayment of drawings from the Fund, could we Hpconvincingly maintain that we needed a renewal of the stand-bycredit? On the other hand, an extension of the credit was the leastonerous means of strengthening our reserves in order to meet suchliabilities; and a failure to seek its renewal would be regardedinternationally as implying that we had taken a definite decision notto proceed to full convertibility. This would be more damaging to sterling than a declaration of intention which would still leave in ourown hands the final decision on the pace at which we would move toconvertibility. And, if our economic circumstances deteriorated, weshould not in any event be expected to make sterling fully convertible.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, whilethe balance of advantage appeared to lie in seeking a renewal of the stand-by credit, the precise form of our undertakings about theadoption of convertibility and the removal of dollar discriminationshould be carefully considered. We should seek to avoid committing ourselves on both issues any further than we were already committed by the communique issued at the end of the recent commonwealth economic Conference at Montreal; and it might be preferable ifpossible, to omit any reference to our intentions as regards theremoval of dollar discrimination.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that application should be made for a renewal of ourstand-by credit from the International Monetary Fund.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to submit to thePrime Minister the draft of the statement of our intentions, which we should need to make in thisconnection, as regards the convertibility of sterling andthe removal of dollar discrimination.
Discussion showed that there was general agreement with therecommendations of the Ministerial Committee. It was suggested,however, that the possibility of improving pension increments shouldbe further considered. A concession on this point would be popularand could be regarded as a necessary complement to the proposedadjustment of the earnings rule. On the other hand it would impose on the Exchequer an additional liability which would rise in due course to the level of  20 millions a year.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the possibility ofan improvement in pension increments to be further considered by the Ministerial Committee on Pensions.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, approved the proposals inC. (58) 244.Cotton.Imports.(previous reference :CC. (58) 53rdConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (58) 245) on the present state ofthe negotiations between the United Kingdom Cotton Board and thecotton textile industry of Hong Kong.The President of the Board of Trade said that the Cotton board had been able to secure agreement in principle to the imposition of an aggregate limit of 345 million square yards on Hong Kong exports ofcotton textiles over the following three years. The Hong Kongindustry were, however, seeking to insist on a system of escalationwithin this total, whereby the three annual limits would be 110, 115and 120 million square yards respectively. The Cotton Board were opposed to this suggestion and regarded it as essential that the annuallimit should remain the same in each of the three years, partly toensure a period of stability in which the British industry could beCC. 83 (58)(iii) The Committee proposed that no concession should bemade to pressure for an improvement in the rates for existingpensioners. Although the retail price index was likely to rise tosome extent during the period in which the legislation based on theWhite Paper would be under discussion in Parliament, this tendencyshould be substantially reversed by the summer of 1959.(iv) The forthcoming Bill would re-enact the existing provisionfor quinquennial reviews of rates of benefit and contribution. TheCommittee recommended that the Government should resist pressure for more frequent reviews; but they recognised that government spokesmen would need to be given considerable latitude on this point,subject to the final decision being reserved to the Cabinet.(v) The Committee recommended a concession in respect of the earnings rule, whereby the upper limit on earnings disregarded for pension purposes would be raised from 50s. to 60s. for retirement andwidow pensioners and from 60s. to 80s. for widowed mothers.(vi) The Committee also saw merit in a further concession inrespect of the increments on basic pensions which could be earnedby continued work and contribution after the minimum retirementage. At present an increment of Is. 6d. could be earned for every25 such contributions paid; but it was for consideration whether anincrement of Is. should be offered in return for every 12 contributions.(vii) The Committee had considered a number of other minorsuggestions, including a proposal that a statutory obligation shouldbe imposed on employers to ascertain the views of their work-peopleby poll before exercising their right to contract out of the scheme.They recommended that none of these proposals should be pursued.
reorganised and partly because, if a system of escalation was conceded for Hong Kong, it would be demanded also by the industries in India and Pakistan. The Indian industry had already indicated that the aggregate limit of 345 million square yards was unacceptable to them and that, if it was confirmed, their own conditional agreementwith the Cotton Board would lapse. It was unrealistic to expectHong Kong to accept a limit no higher than their actual exports in1957; and the Indian industry should be reminded that, from theirown point of view, any reasonable limit on Hong Kong exportswas preferable to none. But it would probably be impossible tosecure Indian acceptance of the aggregate limit on Hong Kongexports if we conceded the principle of escalation to Hong Kong.In discussion it was suggested that it might become necessary to remind the Hong Kong industry that the competition of communist china was a more serious threat to their interests than thecompetition of the United Kingdom, and that, if they refused toco-operate in our attempts to reach a reasonable arrangement, we might be compelled to reconsider our policy.The Cabinet (1) Took note of this statement by the President of the Board ofTrade.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion on a subsequent occasion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,4th December, 1958.
