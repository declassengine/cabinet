Cyprus.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 67thConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Prime Minister said that it seemed likely that the TurkishGovernment would acquiesce in our decision to adhere to the modified plan for the future of Cyprus which had been announced on16th August. The reaction of the Greek Government was less favourable and there was a serious risk of an early revival of terrorismin the Island. In these circumstances we should adopt asunprovocative a policy as possible towards Greece by giving effect tothe plan unobtrusively and laying the maximum emphasis on measuresto restore order in Cyprus and to bring violence to an end. TheGovernor of Cyprus had suggested that, for this purpose, we should announce forthwith that, subject to the maintenance of peace in the island, Archbishop Makarios would be permitted to return within thethe next six weeks and that, if violence completely ceased thereafter,the state of emergency would be terminated by the end of the year.In discussion doubt was expressed about the wisdom of allowing the Archbishop to return to Cyprus during the early stages of the implementation of the modified plan, when the representative of theTurkish Government would assume his duties and the first electionswould be held. It would be impossible to allow him to return to the island without also releasing many of the detainees who had been arrested during the recent intensification of security measures; andpublic opinion might well regard such action as both inopportune forthe launching of the new plan and unfair to the security forces in cyprus. Moreover, a decision to allow the Archbishop to return to cyprus would be regarded as a change of policy and a concession tothe Greek Government, especially since there could be no certainty that on his return he would not incite a fresh outburst of terrorism.Although it could be argued that in those circumstances publicopinion would sympathise with any fresh action which we were compelled to take against him, it would be difficult to resort toextreme measures for a second time. The balance of advantagetherefore seemed to lie in refraining, at the present juncture, from tooprecise a commitment about the extent to which we should beprepared to relax the emergency regulations or the date on which weshould be ready to begin this process. It might be wiser to confineany announcement to an offer that, if order and tranquillity were maintained in the Island for a defined period, we should thereafter be prepared to consider a progressive relaxation of the regulations andthe return of Archbishop Makarios. Alternatively we could retain the initiative even more firmly in our own hands by omitting any reference to a specific date and indicating merely that, subject to themaintenance of peaceful conditions in the Island, it was our intentionto bring the state of emergency to an end in due course.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewould be advantage in discussing these issues with the Governor of cyprus before any decision was reached or any public announcement was made. The Governor should therefore be invited to return tothis country for consultation and should be given an advanceindication of the various possible courses of action which the cabinet had discussed.The Cabinet Invited the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for theColonies to arrange for the Governor of Cyprus to returnto this country for consultation on the extent and timing ofany relaxation of the state of emergency in the Island whichmight accompany the introduction of the Governmentsmodified plan for its future.
territorial waters.IcelandicFishery Limits.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 62ndConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof State for Foreign Affairs (C. (58) 174) on Icelandic fishery limits.Attached to the memorandum (Annex A) was the draft of anAgreement which had emerged from the current discussions of thissubject in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), togetherwith the draft of a public statement which might be made by her majesty&apos;s Government if the negotiations for the Agreement ended in failure (Annex B).The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that, under thedraft Agreement, the Icelandic Government would claim a 12-mile limit, but would in practice be content with six miles. In addition,however, they would claim three new base lines and, possibly, an area closed to all fishing. We could not accept the adjustment of the base lines; but in other respects the draft Agreement, subject tocertain modifications, offered a reasonable prospect of an interimsolution. The Foreign Minister of Iceland was ready to accept an invitation to visit London for further discussions.In discussion of the text of the draft Agreement it was agreedthat it would be important to ensure, first, that it did not prejudice our full rights; second, that it applied only to fishery limits and not tothe limits of territorial waters; and, third, that it did not implyacceptance of the proposed new base lines. The Cabinet approved,for these purposes, certain amendments of Articles I; II and IV ofthe draft Agreement. Article III, which reserved the position of the signatories as regards their views on the limits, in international law,of territorial waters or of exclusive, jurisdiction in fishing matters, was unacceptable to the Government of Iceland on the ground that thedraft preamble to the Agreement constituted an adequate safeguardin this respect. Our position in any future international conferenceon the Law of the Sea might, however, be weakened if the Agreementdid not contain an explicit reservation on these points; It was there-fore agreed that our representatives in the NATO discussions should seek to secure agreement, first, to a revised draft of Article III whichwould fully satisfy our requirements; failing this, to the insertion ofan additional clause in the preamble on broadly similar lines; and,failing this, to an arrangement whereby the contracting Governments,when signing the Agreement, would exchange and publish letterscovering the point. If it proved impossible to secure agreement onany of these three courses, our representatives should be authorised in the last resort to accept the existing clause in the preamble togetherwith the omission of Article III, provided that this was acceptable to all the other parties to the negotiations. If the other countriesexpressed doubts on this point, our representatives should refer back for further instructions;In further discussion it was agreed that the draft public statement should be re-drafted in more positive terms. In particular, it should set out the main features of the draft Agreement and should emphasise that we for our part would have been, and remained, prepared toaccept an interim arrangement on this basis. It should, however,make it clear that in default of agreement we were unable to acquiesce in unilateral action by the Icelandic Government and were accordingly arranging to afford appropriate protection to our fishing vessels.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it wasto the political advantage of NATO as well as to the benefit of ourown. fishing industry that the present deadlock should be resolved.Our representatives in NATO should therefore make every effort tosecure general acceptance of an Agreement on the lines approved in discussion. If, however, the Icelandic Government provedintransigent, we should have in readiness measures to protect British
CC. 68 (58)vessels fishing in defined areas off Iceland; and it might well be appropriate that these areas should continue to be based on a four-mile, rather than a six-mile, limit. The position should bere considered when the outcome of the discussions in NATO was known.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, inconsultation with the Attorney-General, to instruct theUnited Kingdom representatives in the discussions onIcelandic fishery limits in the North Atlantic Council tobe guided by the considerations set out in C. (58) 174, as modified in the Cabinets discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, inconsultation with the Attorney-General, to revise, on thelines agreed in discussion, the draft public statement tobe issued if the discussions in the North Atlantic Councilbroke down.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,27th August, 1958.
