Meeting of heads ofGovernment.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 15thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the views whichhe had exchanged with the United States Government on the reply which they proposed to send to the latest note from the SovietGovernment about the proposed meeting of Heads of Government.The first draft of this reply had been rather negative anduncompromising in tone, reflecting the unwillingness of the UnitedStates Government to take part in a meeting of Heads of government at which certain subjects would be arbitrarily excluded from theagenda. He was, however, seeking to persuade the United StatesGovernment so to modify the reply that it would not justify the SovietGovernment in claiming that they had been compelled by theintransigence of the Western Powers to abandon the proposal for ameeting of Heads of Government. It might be possible to reach agreement with the United States on a suggestion that the initialmeeting of Foreign Secretaries, while not confined wholly to merelyprocedural questions, should discuss matters of substance to the extent necessary to determine their order of priority on the agenda for themeeting of Heads of Government. For this purpose the unification of Germany, which the United States would insist on including in theagenda, should have as low a priority as possible.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith these views. The attitude of the United States Government was largely determined by the opposition of Congress to the proposed meeting of Heads of Government. But public opinion in this country was tending to move in the opposite direction and was increasinglyconcentrating on the possibility that a meeting of this kind would achieve genuine progress towards disarmament. A fresh attempt should be made to assist the general public to form a balanced view ofthe Governments proposals and to appreciate the dangers involvedin a policy of mere pacifism. At the same time it would be necessaryto try to secure that disarmament would be the main topic fordiscussion at a meeting of Heads of Government. In order to reconcile the views of the United States Government and ourselvesit might be wise to suggest that the agenda for the meeting shouldnot, in principle, exclude any topic which any of the participantswished to discuss but that disarmament should constitute its first itemand that, in so far as time could not be found for the discussion ofother items they should be deferred for a subsequent meeting.The Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister, in his further discussions withthe United States Government on their reply to the latestSoviet note about the proposed meeting of Heads ofGovernment, to be guided by the points made in thediscussion.Egypt.financial negotiations.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 80thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (58) 55) about the progress of thefinancial negotiations with the Egyptian Government.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the discussions in rome had been adjourned to enable the Egyptian representatives to seek instructions from their Government on the proposals which theUnited Kingdom delegation had submitted without commitment.These proposals provided that:  (a) The Egyptian Government would deposit about  25 millions in sterling in respect of compensation for Egyptianised property. Incases of dispute the value of the property would be assessed by aC.C. 20 (58)Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
neutral assessor if the difference between the British and Egyptianestimates exceeded an agreed percentage.(b) The Egyptian Government would restore the property whichthey had sequestrated and would deposit an additional sum of theorder of  10 millions against claims in respect of damage suffered bythat property.(c) Owners of sequestrated property who did not wish to returnto Egypt would be entitled to dispose of their assets and to transferinto sterling the equivalent of at least  5,000 of the proceeds.(d)  23 millions would be released to the Egyptian government from the blocked Egyptian No. 1 account, from which they would pay about  6 millions to United Kingdom firms in respect of contractsentered into before the Anglo-French intervention.(e) Further releases of sterling would be made to the egyptian government when the compensation for Egyptianised property hadbeen assessed and paid, or possibly at an earlier stage if substantial progress was made in the assessment of that compensation.(/) The Inter-Governmental claims in respect of damage to united Kingdom property in the Suez Canal base and &quot; war damage &quot;to Egyptian assets would be postponed for discussion at a later stage.(g) The claims by the Shell Oil Company Limited in respect oftheir assets in Egypt would be negotiated separately between theCompany and the Egyptian Government and this fact would berecognised in any inter-Governmental Agreement.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be to our advantage to achieve a settlement on these lines. Its terms were not unreasonable in themselves; it would allow normal trade between thetwo countries to be resumed; and, although the Egyptian Governmentwould undoubtedly seek to represent it for propaganda purposes, asa victory for themselves, it should be possible so to present it to our friends in the Middle East that they would recognise the substantialadvantages which we had secured for ourselves. Moreover, thereshould be no undue risk in reserving the inter-Governmental claims for subsequent discussion, since the Egyptian Government would inany event be precluded from compelling us without our consent tosubmit these claims to arbitration by the International Court ofJustice. On the other hand, public opinion in this country wouldbe liable to regard this settlement as paying insufficient regard to theclaims of owners of sequestrated property; and the Governmentwould be subjected to increasing pressure to compensate theseindividuals for the losses which they had sustained as the result ofsequestration as distinct from any physical damage sustained by thesequestrated assets. It would remain desirable to resist this pressure,if possible, and it would be inadvisable to concede in principle thatthe owners of sequestrated property were entitled to any compensation from the United Kingdom Exchequer at least until the extent ofthe compensation which they would receive from the egyptian government in respect of damage to their assets had been ascertained.The Cabinet Took note of C. (58) 55.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,5th March, 1958.
