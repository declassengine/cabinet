territorial waters.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 32ndConclusions.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the attorney-General (C. (58) 83) reporting the latest developments atthe International Conference on the Law of the Sea.The Attorney-General said that the Canadian proposal that themaximum breadth of the territorial sea should not exceed six milesand that each State should enjoy exclusive fishing rights up to twelvemiles had been put to the vote in two parts: the first part had been defeated, the second had been carried. The Mexico-Indian proposal that each State should be free to claim a maximum breadth of territorial sea of twelve miles had received an equal number of votesfor and against and had therefore not been adopted. The UnitedStates proposal for a six-mile limit to territorial waters and anadditional six miles for exclusive fishing rights, with the reservation of fishing rights in the outer six miles to any State which had regularlyenjoyed them for five years, had been defeated by a narrow margin inspite of our support. The Canadian and Mexico-Indian proposals would probably be revived in plenary session, and in order to prevent them from attracting increasing support it would be desirable that weshould continue to endorse the United States proposal, even though ithad little chance of securing a majority.Discussion showed that there was general agreement with thisview. If, as was probable, the United States proposal was not adopted, the fact that we had supported it would not later prejudice our position before the International Court of Justice. If, on theother hand, it secured a majority, its provisions, on which the UnitedStates Government were not prepared to make any further concessions, could be regarded as reasonably satisfactory from thepoint of view of our fisheries interests. The present form of Articles 17and 15 of the draft Convention, which allowed the passage of ships,including warships, through territorial waters so long as it was notprejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal state concerned, provided a sufficient safeguard for the movement of ships especially if, as was hoped, it proved possible to delete Article 24,which entitled a coastal State to make the passage of warships throughterritorial waters subject to previous authorisation or notification. Onthe other hand, the United States proposal would seriously restrict themovement of military aircraft particularly as regards the approaches to Gibraltar, Aden, Singapore and Hong Kong. It might thereforebecome necessary to consider at a later stage whether we shouldattach some reservation on this point to our ratification of theConvention.In further discussion the following points were made :  (a) The Indian representatives appeared to have misunderstoodthe instruction, known to have been given them by their Government,that they should in committee support the United States proposal. Itwould therefore be helpful to seek the support of the indian government for that proposal in plenary session.(b) The Saudi-Arabian representatives intended to propose that,as no agreement on the breadth of territorial waters had been reached,the Secretary-General of the United Nations should be invited to study ways and means of arriving at an agreement, including the convening of a special conference; and that, pending agreement, thepresent Conference should adopt a number of principles, including adeclaration that the extension by a State of its territorial sea to twelvemiles was not a breach of international law. We should oppose thissuggestion; but, if no agreement was reached on the main issue, itmight be desirable to propose a simple amendment inviting theSecretary-General to give consideration to the best method of securing agreement about the extent of the territorial sea.(c) If the Mexico-Indian proposal secured a majority we shouldendorse a proposal by the Netherlands Government that the principal
maritime States should issue a declaration that they were not preparedto sign a Convention which departed so far from existing internationallaw or to recognise so great an extension of the rights of coastal States.Alternatively, if no agreement was reached in plenary session, we might seek to promote a declaration by the principal maritime Statesthat they adhered to the existing three-mile limit. It would be undesirable, however, that we should subscribe to declarations of this nature unless a majority of the maritime States also endorsed them.Support for a declaration in one form or the other should, therefore,be sought among the representatives of the maritime nations; but afinal decision to support it should be deferred until their reactions were known.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Attorney-General to oppose the latestCanadian and Mexico-Indian proposals at the Inter-national Conference on the Law of the Sea, and to supportthe United States proposal.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would seek the supportof the Prime Minister of India for the United states proposal.(3) Authorised the Attorney-General to propose, if no agreement on the breadth of territorial waters was reached, that theSecretary-General of the United Nations should be invitedto consider how progress might be achieved.(4) Invited the Attorney-General to seek the support of represen-tatives of the maritime States for a declaration, as appropriate, either that they would not recognise anextension of the territorial sea to twelve miles or, in theabsence of agreement, that they adhered to the existingthree-mile limit.Aden. 2.   The Colonial Secretary said that, of the three Jiffri brothers(Previous whom the Cabinet had authorised the Governor of Aden to arrest,Reference : Mohamed and Alawi had so far escaped arrest. The third brother,C.C. (58) 30th Abdullah, was in custody; but it was not proposed that he aloneConclusions.     should be deported.minute 2.) jn discussion jt was agreed that, in the changed circumstances,it would be desirable for the Cabinet to give further consideration tothe issues involved before any of the brothers was deported.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary to instruct the Governor of aden that he should seek fresh authority before any of theJiffri brothers was deported.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st April, 1958.
