Middle East.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 66thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. Since the Cabinefs last discussion on 31st July, the SovietGovernment had abandoned their support for the proposal that thesituation in the Middle East should be considered by a special meetingof the Security Council which might be attended by Heads of governments. They had instead proposed that this question shouldbe discussed at a special session of the General Assembly. Thisproposal had been accepted by the other Governments concerned,and the special session of the Assembly was to open on the following day.The Cabinet were informed - of the line which the foreign secretary was proposing to take in the discussions at the Assembly.His general objective would be to secure that the United nations should assume responsibility for preserving the independence andintegrity of Jordan and the Lebanon after the withdrawal of theBritish and United States forces. He would, in particular, work fora resolution which would empower the Secretary-General to introduceUnited Nations agencies into Jordan with the double purpose of preventing further infiltration over the Syrian border and of avertingthe overthrow of the existing regime by internal subversion. Therewas some danger that the United States Government might take theline that the new President of the Lebanon could be left to secure theindependence of his country without the assistance of United Nationsagencies. From our point of view, however, it was desirable that theUnited Nations should take parallel action in respect of both jordan and the Lebanon.In discussion reference was made to the suggestion that theUnited Nations might be asked to send observers to report on Yemeniactivities on the borders of the Aden Protectorate. The ColonialOffice had previously been doubtful about the expediency of thiscourse, for they feared that some of the Rulers in the Protectoratemight regard it as a sign of weakness on the part of the UnitedKingdom Government. The Cabinet recognised that we could not oppose such a suggestion if it were put forward in the course of discussions in the General Assembly in which we were ourselvesproposing that United Nations agencies should be established in jordan for a similar purpose. It was, however, unlikely that theSecretary-General would be willing to act on such a suggestion at atime when he was under an obligation to meet more urgent rquirements of the same kind elsewhere in the Middle East.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the general line which the Foreign Secretary was proposing to pursue in the forthcoming discussions on theMiddle East in the General Assembly of the united nations.(2) Authorised the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs toinform the Acting Governor of Aden that, if in the courseof those discussions it was suggested that United Nationsobservers should be sent to report on Yemeni activities onthe border of the Aden Protectorate, we should be obligedto assent in principle to that suggestion.New Zealand.Trade Talks.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 39thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The President of the Board of Trade said that the NewZealand Government had sought our agreement to a number ofmodifications of the Ottawa Agreement, all of which would operate against exports from the United Kingdom to New Zealand. Theyhad proposed substantial cuts in our guaranteed margins ofpreference, and on these we had been able to go a long way to meet them by agreeing to reductions of the present 20 per cent, margins to10 per cent, and even less for some commodities. They were,however, unwilling to agree to refrain from operating discriminatory
quotas against the United Kingdom. In conformity with their general policy of bilateral relations in international trade, they wishedto make an agreement with Japan which would have the effect ofdiscriminating &quot;against imports from the United Kingdom. They had therefore notified us that they proposed to denounce the ottawa agreement at a very early date. The question for decision was whether we should acquiesce in this or should try to persuade them to defer action at least until after the Commonwealth EconomicConference at Montreal.In discussion it was recognised that it was unlikely that the NewZealand Government could be dissuaded from denouncing the ottawa agreement. If they persisted in this course they would undermine the structure of Commonwealth preference arrangements and wouldimperil the success of the discussions at Montreal. Public opinion inthis country was, however, well-disposed towards New Zealand, andwe ought therefore to put ourselves in a position to show that we hadourselves done everything possible to preserve the Ottawa agreement and that, if the New Zealand Government denounced it, the fault wason their side. We had already made substantial concessions to them on preference margins, and had reduced our imports of butter from countries with whom we had important trading relations in order tohelp to preserve New Zealand&apos;s market in this country.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that the best course would be for him to make a personal appeal to the PrimeMinister of New Zealand not to denounce the agreement reached byone Commonwealth Economic Conference immediately before theopening of another. He would draw attention to the concessions wehad made on preference margins and our action to help the NewZealand butter market; and he would suggest that, given a little time,it was reasonable to hope that some form of agreement could bereached which would help New Zealand to maintain the level of hertrade without undermining the Ottawa Agreement throughout theCommonwealth. An approach on these lines should have someappeal to public opinion in both countries. If the New zealand government persisted in denouncing the Agreement, it might still bepossible to negotiate some formula to take its place during the sixmonths before the denunciation took effect.The High Commissioner in New Zealand should be instructed tomake it clear to the New Zealand Government that the Prime minister would feel free to publish his message.The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister to make a further personal appealto the Prime Minister of New Zealand, on the lines agreed in their discussion, with a view to persuading him to postpone denouncing the Ottawa Agreement at least until after the forthcoming Conference in Montreal.Egypt.financial negotiations.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 62ndConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary(C. (58) 168) covering reports by officials on the present state of thefinancial negotiations with Egypt.The Lord Chancellor said that, at the Prime Ministers request,he had held a preliminary discussion of these reports with theMinisters directly concerned. When the negotiations were dis-continued the Egyptians had declined to offer more than  20^ millions as against the  30 millions for which we had asked. There would,admittedly, be political difficulties in defending a settlement onthe basis of such a figure. For even the  30 millions fell short ofthe best estimate we could make of the real value of the claims, andit fell still further below the value which the claimants themselveshad placed on their property. Moreover, it would be assumed that,by accepting a settlement at a figure so far below the total of the
claims, we had made a substantial concession to the Egyptians inrespect of war damage and had made no countervailing claim inrespect of the loss of British property in the Canal Zone Base.  even so, there would have been much to be said for concluding thenegotiations on something like the terms suggested if we could havebeen confident that the Egyptian Government were ready to makea firm agreement on that basis.  It was doubtful whether we should get better terms than these. And it must be remembered that by sucha settlement we should regain British control over the sequestratedproperty and. assuming a favourable settlement of the separatenegotiations in respect of the Sheil Company&apos;s property in Egypt,should be recovering property valued at  171 - 5 millions out of atotal claim of  210 millions. In addition, there were strong economicand political advantages to be gained by the conclusion of anagreement which would enable us to resume commercial and diplomatic relations with  Egypt.    There  were,  however, clearindications that, even if we had been willing to accept a settlement on the  basis suggested, the Egyptian Government would not themselves have been willing to conclude a final agreement at thepresent time.   Our representative in the negotiations had formed the impression that the Egyptian representative had at the last moment received instructions from Cairo to make no concessions.This  impression   had   subsequently   been   confirmed   by  other information received in London.   And Mr. Murphy, the UnitedStates Deputy Under-Secretary of State, on returning from his recentmission to  the  Middle East  on behalf of the  United StatesGovernment, had told the Foreign Secretary that President Nasserhad given him clearly to understand that he was not at the presenttime anxious to improve Egypfs relations with the United Kingdom.If we made a compromise offer, or indicated our readiness to acceptthe Egyptian figure, at a time when the Egyptian Government werenot anxious to conclude an agreement, we should inevitably find ourselves in a worse bargaining position when negotiations were resumed.The Lord Chancellor said that, even so, any long delay in reaching a settlement would prejudice our interests. The sequestratedproperty must be deteriorating: pressure for the resumption of tradewith Egypt was increasing : and the Government would be confronted with great political difficulty in dealing with the British claimants ifa settlement were long delayed. The situation should certainly be reviewed before October.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he concurred in thestatement made by the Lord Chancellor. He hoped, however, thatthere might be an opportunity to reopen the negotiations before october possibly within the next four to six weeks.In discussion it was suggested that the Egyptian government might have purely temporary reasons for preferring not to conclude a settlement at the present time. They might well be willing to resume negotiations as soon as the General Assembly of the United nations had concluded its discussion on the Middle East.The Prime Minister said that our tactics in handling this situation should be determined by the recognition that, if we could secure asettlement, even at or near the latest figure suggested by the Egyptians,it would serve our interests by enabling us to recover possession ofthe sequestrated property and to resume normal commercial and diplomatic relations with Egypt. We should therefore lose no opportunity to re-open the negotiations, as soon as we had evidencethat the Egyptians were ready to conclude an agreement. Meanwhile,we should review the few points on the draft agreement which remained outstanding, apart from the total sum to be paid, and should consider whether it would be to our advantage to open the next round
of the negotiations by tabling a draft agreement whose detailed terms would be acceptable to the Egyptians and concentrating discussionpurely on the sum to be paid.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the United Kingdom should not for the timebeing take any fresh initiative for the resumption of thesefinancial negotiations with Egypt.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for thenegotiations to be&apos; reopened as soon as there were indications that the Egyptians would be prepared to reach a settlement.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider, in themeantime, whether the draft of the proposed agreement could be put in a form in which it could be readilyconcluded as soon as agreement on the total sum payablecould be reached.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (58) 167) regarding an application from Dr. Alan NunnMay for the grant of a British passport to enable him to go to Austriaon holiday.The Cabinet were informed that neither the Home Office nor theSecurity Service wished to raise objection to the grant of thisapplication. They had no reason to believe that May, if he wentabroad, would attempt to seek asylum in territories controlled by theSoviet Union. On the contrary, they believed that he had establishedhimself in this country and had no intention of leaving it permanently.In any event he was not now in possession of any up-to-date information on atomic matters which would be of value to theRussians.Discussion showed that opinion in the Cabinet was divided onthis question. Some Ministers felt strongly that the Governmentshould not take any risk that might be involved in allowing May toleave this country; for they would be seriously embarrassed, in relationto public opinion in this country and in the United States, if he tookthat opportunity of seeking refuge behind the Iron Curtain. other ministers argued, as against this, that it would be possible for May toleave the country without a passport if he chose to do so; and that itwould be even more embarrassing to the Government if he did thisafter they had implied, by their refusal of a passport, that it was their purpose to prevent him from doing so. From that point of view itmight be preferable to grant him a passport in the ordinary course,but to make it clear to the United States Government that this hadbeen done because he no longer had any secret information whichwould be of value to a potential enemy.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwould in any event be preferable that May should not be givenfacilities for foreign travel until further progress had been made towards the conclusion of the proposed agreements for the interchange of atomic information between this country and theUnited States. On that account it would be preferable that he shouldnot be granted a British passport until some time in 1959.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for Dr. Alan NunnMay to be informed that a British passport would not begranted to him in the course of 1958.
7Cyprus.(previous reference:CC. (58) 58thConclusions,Minute 2.)CC. 67 (58)5. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the course ofthe discussions on Cyprus which he had held with the Prime ministers of Greece and Turkey during his visit to Athens and Ankara.He had not asked either Government to approve the plan forthe future, of Cyprus which he had presented to Parliament on19th June. He &quot;had asked that they should acquiesce in it and encourage their respective communities in Cyprus to co-operate in working it.The Greek Government did not like the plan because itembodied the principle of partnership between Greece and turkey in Cyprus and recognised a Turkish right to participation in thecontrol of the Island&apos;s affairs. They were, however, prepared tosupport the plea for cessation of violence and a seven-year interval before the future status of the Island was determined. On points of detail the Greeks had argued (i) that on the Executive Council theyshould have a greater majority, since the ratio of 4 to 2 would not represent the proportions of the population; (ii) that some provision should be made for an elected assembly in which the population ofthe Island as a whole could deal with the subjects not reserved to theGovernor; (iii) that the proposed provision for dual nationality wouldconfirm the Turkish interest in Cyprus; and (iv) that representativesof the Greek and Turkish Governments should not be accredited tothe Government and, in particular, should not sit as members of the governors Council.The Prime Minister said that he had formed the impression thatthe Greek Government lacked the political strength to give active support to any plan which would solve the Cyprus problem. the communists had improved their position at the Greek elections inMay 1958 and Enosis provided &quot;them with a welcome theme fornationalistic propaganda. The Greek line was therefore to ask us to,modify the British plan in directions favourable to them.By contrast the Turks had welcomed the plan in its entirety andhad been strongly opposed to any modifications designed to meet theGreek point of view.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet were now faced with a difficult decision. There seemed to be three possible courses ofaction:  (i) To announce that, as his discussions with the Greek and turkish Governments had shown no prospect of agreement, theUnited Kingdom would not proceed further with the plan which theyhad announced on 19th June. This would leave both Greeks andTurks entrenched in extreme positions. It would forfeit theopportunity to gain their support for a cessation of violence and aseven-year period of pause before the future status of the Island was determined.  It would be a confession of failure.(ii) To say that Her Majesty&apos;s Government proposed to implement their plan as announced, without amendment. This coursewould ensure the full co-operation of the Turks, but it would arousebitter opposition from Greece. It would also involve disregardingthe views expressed in the North Atlantic Council and in the united nations.(iii) To say that we had decided to implement the policy already announced, while modifying it in certain particulars. these amendments would be designed to secure Greek acquiescence in theplan, while not making such substantial changes as would antagonisethe Turks. Sound reasons for the amendments would have to begiven in order that they should not appear to have been made solely for the purpose of meeting Greek objections.The Prime Minister explained that the modifications he had inmind were contained in the draft statement which he had preparedbefore leaving Cyprus (telegram No. 1170 of 12th August fromP.O.M.E.F. to Foreign Office). The main question was whether the suggested modifications would alienate Turkish support of the British
plan. He had therefore sought the views of H.M. Ambassadors inAnkara and Athens on the likely effect of the draft statement on those Governments, and these had just been received (Ankaratelegram No. 1284 and Athens telegram No. 620 of 12th August toForeign Office). H.M. Ambassador in Ankara had given hisconsidered opinion that the Turkish Government would not take the modifications as a pretext for withholding their support of the plan as presented in the draft statement. He had, however, suggested twochanges of detail, which were acceptable. H.M. Ambassador at athens had thought that the draft statement afforded a reasonably good basis on which to approach the Greek Government, although he did not believe that they would accept it without argument.The Prime Minister added that any of the three possible courses of action was likely to be followed by a period of increased disorder in Cyprus. But, horrible as the atrocities committed by EOKA were,they should be seen in their correct perspective: the British forces in cyprus had incurred only 90 fatal casualties over the previous fiveyears. From his personal visit to the Island he was glad to reportthat the British troops were in good heart.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were strongly in favour ofthe third of the courses outlined by the Prime Minister, namely thatwe should make known our decision to put into effect the policy forCyprus already announced to Parliament, modified on the lines ofthe Prime Ministers draft statement.On the question of procedure, the Prime Minister said that nothing was to be gained by attempting to secure the agreement ofthe Greek or Turkish Governments. He suggested therefore that heshould despatch to the Greek and Turkish Prime Ministers letters inthe terms of the drafts contained in telegrams Nos. 1171 and 1172from P.O.M.E.F. to the Foreign Office and should issue the draft statement very shortly thereafter.The Lord Chancellor expressed the Cabinefs gratitude to thePrime Minister for the mission which he had undertaken and their appreciation of the results which he had achieved. The outcome ofthese discussions had been more favourable than they had venturedto hope.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Government should proceed with the plan for the future of Cyprus which they had presented toParliament on 19th June, subject to the modificationsapproved in their discussion.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would inform the greek and Turkish Prime Ministers of this decision.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for thisdecision to be announced at the end of the week.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,12th August, 1958.
