C.C. 61 (58)Middle East.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 60thConclusions,Minute 1.)Meeting of heads of governments.*The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that, during his visit to Washington, he had discussed with the United States Governmentthe letter of 19th July from Mr. Kruschev proposing that aconference of Heads of Governments of the United States, the UnitedKingdom, the Soviet Union, France and India should be convened atGeneva on 22nd July in order to consider means of bringing to an end the military conflict in the Middle East. It was unfortunate that theFrench Government had accepted this proposal in principle. TheUnited States Government had taken strong exception to the offensivetone of Mr. Kruschev&apos;s letter and would prefer that a special meetingof the Security Council should be summoned, attended by Heads of governments, to discuss the situation in the Middle East. Thisproposal, which would be acceptable to the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations, would have the advantages that informal and privatediscussions between the Heads of Government could be arranged inthe intervals between meetings of the Council and that, under theprocedure applicable to a special session of the Council, countries,such as India, who were not members of the Council could, ifnecessary, be invited to be present. Moreover, the fact that thediscussions would take place within the framework of the united nations would enable them to be followed up, in the normal manner,after the special meeting of the Security Council was adjourned; andit would be preferable to secure this appearance of continuity ratherthan to accept the risk that a separate meeting of Heads of Govern-ments might be seen to break up after a few days without reaching any firm decisions. The United Kingdom Representative at the united nations might be instructed to support the United states representative in recommending this proposal to the Security council that afternoon. Thereafter, it would be advisable that the PrimeMinister should reply to Mr. Kruschev indicating that it constitutedour reply to his letter.In discussion there was general support for this course of action,which should retain the initiative in the hands of the West. It wassuggested that it might be desirable for the Governmenfs intentions tobe announced by a Ministerial statement before the adjournment ofthe House of Commons that night or possibly during the course of thefollowing day. Alternatively, a statement might be issued by thePrime Minister later in the evening when confirmation had beenreceived that the proposal had been made by the United StatesGovernment, and supported by ourselves, in the Security Council.On the other hand, a Parliamentary debate on foreign affairs hadalready been arranged for the following day and there would be some advantage in deferring until then a considered statement about thelines on which the Governments of the United Kingdom and theUnited States proposed to reply to Mr. Kruschev&apos;s letter. the government&apos;s spokesmen in the debate would then be able to take account of the reactions of the Security Council and of world opinion to the proposal of the United States Government. In the interimappropriate guidance could be given to the Press.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct the United kingdom permanent Representative at the United Nations tosupport the proposal, to be put forward by the UnitedStates Representative in the Security Council, that aspecial meeting of the Council should be convened in thenear future to discuss means of resolving the conflict in theMiddle East.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Foreign Secretary, to ensure that appropriate guidance was provided to the Press that evening about our reasons for supporting this proposal.
Jordan. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the Government of israel, having acquiesced in the over-flying of Israel involved in theoriginal despatch of British troops to Jordan, were now raisingobjections to the continued over-flying of their territory by british transport aircraft carrying supplies to those forces. The possibility ofestablishing an alternative supply route through Aqaba was being examined. But this would inevitably take some little time. Mean-while we were taking all possible measures to reduce the frequency ofour sorties; and, since the Government of Israel appeared to acceptthe flight of United States aircraft over their territory, we were asking the Government of the United States to implement their undertaking to afford the maximum of logistical support to our troops in Jordan.The Cabinet (3) Took note of this statement-Civil Aviation. The Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation said that theBritish Overseas Airways Corporation had been advised to avoidflying over Syria and Iraq during the last few days. But, if theycontinued to use a more circuitous route, they would lose traffic totheir competitors; and he therefore proposed to inform them that theymight now resume flights over Syria and Iraq.The Cabinet (4) Authorised the Minister of Transport to inform the british overseas Airways Corporation that their commercialflights over Syria and Iraq might now be resumed.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st July, 1958.
