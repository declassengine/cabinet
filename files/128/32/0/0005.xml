Cabinet 2.   The Home Secretary said that he proposed to state, in replyProceedings. to a forthcoming Parliamentary Question, that the Prime Minister hadnot exceeded the limits of constitutional propriety by disclosing thecourse of Cabinet discussions in his letter to the former Chancellor ofthe Exchequer on the occasion of the iatter&apos;s resignation. The PrimeMinister had informed The Queen of the terms of this letter before it was dispatched; and it was in accordance with normal practice onsuch occasions that Parliament and the public should be informed ofthe point of principle on which a Government had been divided. Itwas, however, incumbent on all members of the Cabinet to bear inmind, in any public statements which they might have occasion tomake in this connection, their duty to preserve the secrecy of cabinet discussions.The Cabinet Agreed that Ministers who found it necessary to make any public reference to the circumstances of the resignation ofthe former Chancellor of the Exchequer should submit the relevant passages to the Home Secretary and the Chancellorof the Exchequer.EconomicSituation.AllegedLeakage ofInformation.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 81stConclusions,Minute 3.)*3. The Home Secretary said that he had now received the reportof the Tribunal which had been established to enquire into the alleged premature disclosure of the decision, taken in the previousSeptember, to increase Bank Rate. He did not propose to circulatethis report at the present stage; but the Cabinet would be glad toknow that the Tribunal had found no evidence that there had been any improper disclosure of the decision to increase Bank Rate: thatthey had completely vindicated the personal honour of the Ministers,the Governor and Directors of the Bank of England and the otherindividuals who had been concerned with, or had knowledge of, thisdecision : and that their findings had confirmed the correctness of thePrime Minister^ original refusal to institute a special enquiry into the alleged disclosure. The Tribunal had not felt able, however, todiscuss in any detail the question of the conflict of loyalties to whicha part-time Director of the Bank of England might be subjected if hewas required to share the responsibility for a decision to alter bank rate while discharging his normal obligations to his partners andassociates in business. They had indicated that this problem mightmerit more detailed consideration but that, in the absence of further evidence pointing clearly to the need for some change in the traditional method of appointment of Directors of the Bank ofEngland, the present practice should not lightly be modified.Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET52960-7b 2The Prime 1.   The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet that he hadMinister.        received a personal message from the Prime Minister, thanking hiscolleagues for their loyal support in the period before his departure onhis Commonwealth tour.He proposed, in reply, to convey to the Prime Minister the cabinet&apos;s good wishes for the success of his tour and their satisfactionat the warmth of the welcome which he had received in India and pakistan.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement.
Parliament. 4.   The  Cabinet  were  informed  that  the  Opposition had requested that, on the re-assembly of Parliament, there should be animmediate debate on the economic situation, with special reference tothe recent Ministerial changes and the policy which the newChancellor of the Exchequer proposed to follow. A convenient day for this debate would be Thursday, 23rd January. It would bedesirable that the Government should table a Motion inviting theHouse of Commons to endorse the determination of the Governmentto maintain the measures necessary to sustain the currency and tostrengthen the economy.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate the draftof a Government Motion for the purpose of the forthcomingParliamentary debate on the economic situation.In discussion the following points were made (a) The report should be published as early as possible in thefollowing week, preferably a day or two in advance of the forthcomingeconomic debate.(b) A copy should be supplied to Mr. Thorneycroft immediately before publication; but no advance copy should be made available tothe Governor of the Bank of England.(c) Notwithstanding the satisfactory character of the report,public opinion would expect the Government to review the method bywhich part-time Directors of the Bank of England were recruited from financial and commercial concerns and the extent to which their proper discharge of their functions as Directors required them to be fully informed about matters of such consequence as an increase inBank Rate. It might be possible to stipulate that the Governor of theBank should henceforward restrict discussion of such matters to avery limited number of Directors. On the other hand it was arguable that the responsibility for changes in Bank Rate rested, by statute,with the Court of Directors as a whole and that any significant change in the present practice would require fresh legislation. Itmight be preferable, therefore, that the problem should be remitted to the Radcliffe Committee on Monetary Policy for further examina-tion. If, as was probable, this Committee would not report for atleast a year, it might be possible to ask Lord Radcliffe himself tosupply an interim opinion on the question. This possibility would need further consideration after the report of the Tribunal had been published and the public reaction to the TribunaPs findings was clear.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with satisfaction, of the report of the Tribunal ofenquiry into the alleged premature disclosure ofinformation about the increase in Bank Rate in theprevious autumn.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for this report to bepublished as early as possible in the following week.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider further,after the publication of the report, whether Lord Radcliffeshould be asked to examine the need for any change in thepresent method of selection of Directors of the Bank ofEngland or in the extent to which they should participate in the discussion, within the Bank, of matters of suchconsequence as changes in Bank Rate.
commercial policy.european free trade area.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 72ndConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Paymaster-General informed the Cabinet that thecurrent negotiations for the creation of a Free Trade Area in Europewere now entering a more critical phase. The French Government,in particular, appeared to be adopting a more obstructive attitude.While they might now be reconciled in principle to the concept of a free Trade Area, they were increasingly concerned at the prospect that, in the form in which we envisaged it, it would secure to us the benefit of specific tariff reductions on our industrial exports&apos; to europe without requiring us to provide comparable concessions inrespect of our imports of agricultural and horticultural products or to forego the preferences which we enjoyed within the Commonwealth.It would be difficult, therefore, to secure our objectives whilepreserving the safeguards which we had hitherto considered essential.On the other hand it was important that these negotiations should succeed, both because our own interests were intimately affected and because we should wish to avoid the smaller European Powers beingcompelled, in self-defence, to accept an association with theEuropean Common Market which would allow the economicleadership of Western Europe to pass into the hands of the federal german Republic. For this purpose we might be obliged to considergiving fresh undertakings, in respect both of agricultural and horticultural products and of the harmonisation of tariffs on rawmaterials, which would be more commensurate with the advantages which would accrue to us from participation in a Free Trade Area.In discussion it was suggested that it would be difficult to contemplate concessions, particularly in regard to agricultural and horticultural products, which would materially detract from the assurances which the Government had already given to the UnitedKingdom industries concerned. It would be important, therefore, toemphasise, in further negotiations, the extent to which our agricultural policy had already been liberalised. It would also be desirable thatthe other European countries concerned should be reminded of theprobable consequences to themselves if, as a result of their failure tosatisfy our reasonable requirements in respect of the Free Trade Area,they compelled us to reconsider the scope and nature of our association with Europe and found themselves passing graduallyunder the domination, both political and economic, of the federal german Republic.The Cabinet Invited the Paymaster-General to circulate, in due course, amemorandum reporting the results of the forthcoming negotiations for the creation of a Free Trade Area inEurope and indicating the policy which Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should pursue on the main issues involved.Cyprus.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 4thConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Foreign Secretary said that it seemed unlikely that theTurkish Government would readily accept the proposal that theGovernor of Cyprus should visit Ankara to discuss the future constitutional development of the Island, despite a message from thePresident of the United States strongly supporting this suggestion.On the other hand the Governor could not remain more than a fewdays longer in this country; and, since it would be impolitic for himto visit Athens before Ankara, there would be no alternative, in theabsence of a favourable response from the Turkish Government, tohis returning direct to Cyprus. If it appeared that no progress hadbeen achieved as a result of his consultation with the Government inLondon, there was a danger that terrorist activity in Cyprus wouldrevive. The Foreign Secretary said, however, that he would himselfbe in Ankara at the end of the following week for the meeting of the52960-7b 3
Council of the Baghdad Pact; and, if the Turkish Government hadnot by then accepted the proposed visit of the Governor, he would suggest to them that there should be discussions about Cyprus during his own stay in Turkey and that the Governor should be invited tobe present at these.The Cabinet Approved the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposals in connectionwith further discussions with the Turkish Government aboutCyprus.Muscat and 7.   The Foreign Secretary said that satisfactory progress hadthe Oman.       been made in the negotiations with the Sultan of Muscat and Oman(Previous        about the reorganisation of the Muscat Armed Forces, the improve-Reference:       ment of the local intelligence and security arrangements, the continuedC.C.

A draft of HeadsMinute 1.) &apos;     Q  Agreement covering these matters had been prepared; but before this document was submitted to the Sultan several points, includingour contribution to the expenditure involved, would need furtherconsideration.   This detailed examination might best be undertaken by the Defence Committee, who could at the same time consider thevarious  proposals  for  further  military   operations  against  thedissidents in Central Oman. The Sultan of Muscat had indicated thathe might be prepared to meet King Saud in order to discuss relationsbetween their two countries, but that he was not prepared to discusshis dispute with Pakistan over Gwadur until he visited this countryin May.   In these circumstances any agreement in principle whichmight be reached in the present negotiations about the futurerelation between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Sultan shouldbe regarded as provisional until these wider issues had been reviewedduring the Sultan&apos;s visit to this country.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Foreign Secretary&apos;sstatement.(2) Invited the Defence Committee to examine the outstanding issues in the present negotiations with the Sultan of muscat and the proposals for further military operations against the dissidents in Central Oman.Soviet Union. 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that replies were outstanding toLetters to Headsthe last two letters from Mr. Bulganin. It was proposed that the reply of Government, to the earlier letter should be relatively brief and that the specific(Previous proposals which the Soviet Government had put forward in both their reference: recent letters should be dealt with in a subsequent reply. The textC.C. (57) 72nd G^ trie interim reply had been agreed with the Prime Minister and,Conclusions, subject to clearance with the North Atlantic Council, should be minute 2.) &apos;    dispatched in the next few days.In discussion it was emphasised that the continued refusal by theWestern Powers to agree to the Soviet proposals for discussions between Heads of Government would provide the Soviet Union witha considerable propaganda advantage. While careful preparationwould be needed to ensure that such discussions would producepositive results, there might be some advantage in agreeing to a preliminary meeting between Heads of Government, provided that itwas made clear that the purpose of this meeting was confined to establishing the problems to be solved and preparing the way for their
British Forces 9.   The Foreign Secretary said that during the previous week thein Europe.      North Atlantic Council had considered the report by the three(Previous        independent experts about the strain imposed on our balance ofReference:       payments by our Treaty obligation to retain forces in Europe.  TheC.C. (57) 17th general tenor of the discussion had supported the findings of theConclusions,    experts in favour of our case, but the Council had not formallyMinute 5.)      approved the report. There would be a further meeting of the Councilon the following day, but we might have some difficulty in obtaining the necessary formal endorsement of the report by the other membersof the Alliance.   On the previous day our representative on theCouncil of the Western European Union (W.E.U.) had made astatement about our readiness to retain our forces in Europe similarto the statement which we had previously made to the North atlantic council.  The other members of W.E.U. had shown some suspicionabout our intentions. He therefore proposed that, at the next meetingof the Council of W.E.U., we should announce that we intended tomake a start with the withdrawal of a further 8,500 troops from europe thus reducing the number to 55,000 by 31st March, 1959. Weshould also state that in the absence of any early indication that satisfactory financial arrangements would be made for meeting thelocal costs involved, we should have to plan for the withdrawal offurther troops.   We had already announced that, if no adequatearrangements were made for meeting the local costs of retaining our forces in Europe, we should be compelled to reconsider the wholequestion of the number of troops allocated to the North atlantic alliance which we could locate outside the sterling area.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.Although the procedure of consultation with our allies was laboriousand protracted, we had so far been able to withdraw a considerablenumber of troops from Europe with at least the acquiescence of theother members of the Alliance and of the Supreme Allied Com-mander, Europe.   The Foreign Secretary should agree with the subsequent examination in greater detail by whatever means appearedmost appropriate. In the past, however, the United States Govern-ment had been firmly opposed to any meeting of Heads ofGovernment and had agreed only with reluctance to the suggestion ofa meeting of Foreign Ministers. It would be important to avoid anydivergence of opinion with the United States on this issue.In further discussion it was suggested that the text of theproposed reply to the earlier of the two letters from Mr. Bulganinshould be circulated to the Cabinet and that, before any further replyto his letters was prepared, the Cabinet should discuss the policywhich the Western Powers should adopt towards the proposals of theSoviet Government. In particular, further consideration should begiven to the possibility of suggesting a limited number of subjects which could usefully be discussed with the Soviet leaders forexample, certain measures of disarmament and arrangements forstabilising the situation in the Middle East.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to circulate a copy of theproposed interim reply to the recent letters from the soviet leaders.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to circulate a memorandum onthe main issues which would need to be considered in preparing a further reply to the Soviet proposals containedin these letters.
Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Defence the terms ofthe further statement to be made to the Council of W.E.U. early decisions would be required on the action to be taken if the federal german Government would not agree to pay in full the local costs of retaining our forces in Germany. Moreover, even if they agreedto provide some financial contribution to this expenditure in thecoming financial year, they were unlikely to be willing to do so infuture years. We should therefore determine what level of forces wecould afford to retain in Europe without any financial contribution from Germany and should prepare plans in readiness for reducing our forces to this level. The rapid withdrawal of a large number oftroops from Europe would, however, create serious administrative difficulties in this country. The War Office had been asked to make an urgent examination of this problem.The Cabinet (.1) Approved the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposals in connectionwith the further negotiations about the withdrawal ofBritish forces from Europe.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to agree with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the Minister of Defence the terms ofthe statement to be made at the next meeting of theCouncil of the Western European Union about thewithdrawal of British forces during the coming financialyear.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to consider what levelof British forces could be retained in Europe in theabsence of any financial contribution to the local costsinvolved.Government *10.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was not yetExpenditure. possible to define with complete precision the further economies in(Previous public expenditure which the Government must now seek to achieve.Reference: Since the Cabinets last discussion on this subject the relevantC.C. (58) 3rd statistics had changed in several respects. It had emerged, for conclusions. example, that the maximum amount of support costs which we might hope to receive from the Federal German Government in 1958-59would be some  47 millions, not  63 millions as had been originallyassumed. Later information had also revealed that the emergingdeficit on the National Insurance Fund in the coming financial year would be not  14 millions but  23 millions. If allowance was madefor these factors, together with the economies which the Cabinet had approved in earlier discussions, the excess of Government expenditurein 1958-59 over the level in the current year was likely to be some 90 millions; and further savings of  40 millions must be achieved ifthe maximum excess which was politically acceptable was of the orderof  50 millions. Moreover, if the  50 millions was to be interpreted as the equivalent of 1 per cent, of Government expenditure, that expenditure must be regarded, for this purpose, as excludingConsolidated Fund expenditure and the self-balancing expenditureattributable to the Post Office, and the comparison should be drawn between the Estimates for Supply services in 1958-59 with theEstimates (including Supplementary Estimates), not the actual expenditure, for the same services in the current year. If theseprecautions were not observed in the presentation of the problem, the residual excess would amount to substantially more than  50 millions.A further examination of the possibilities of economy in thesocial services had confirmed that the major part of the  40 millions* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
still required would best be provided by an increase in that element in the National Insurance contribution which was attributable to theNational Health Service. This increase should preferably be of theorder of lOd., apportioned between employer and employee in the ratio of 2d. and 8d. respectively. In spite of the presentationaldifficulties involved, it should be announced in February, simul-taneously with the publication of the Vote on Account, and shouldtake effect not later than July. On this hypothesis it should yield 30 millions in 1958-59 and  40 millions in a full year. This measure would admittedly appear to penalise the National Health Service at atime when the Estimate for that Service would show an increase considerably less than the new revenue which it was now proposed toobtain by means of the increase in the contribution. Nevertheless, itappeared to constitute the only economy in the field of the welfare services which did not contravene Conservative principles orinvalidate pledges already given by the Government. It was forconsideration whether it should be combined with the imposition of a ceiling on the Exchequer contribution to the cost of the national health Service or, perhaps preferably, with a fundamental review ofthe whole financial basis of the Service.The balance of  10 millions must be obtained from additional savings by other Departments. In particular, the Service departments should seek to achieve further economies of the order of  7 millions.Since the Service Estimates had already gone to print, economiesinvolving major changes of policy were probably no longerpracticable. But it should net be impossible to secure an economy ofthe order in question by some further adjustment of the provision for research and development or by some acceleration in the rate ofrun-down of the Army and the Royal Air Force or by some modifica-tion in the new scheme of Service pay and allowances. If, forexample, this scheme was announced simultaneously with thepublication of the Defence White Paper in February but itsimplementation was deferred until, say, 1st June, the further savingdesired of the Service Departments would be substantially secured without detriment to the recruiting campaign.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The adjustment which had been necessary in order to makeallowance for the lower level of support costs to be expected from theFederal German Government made it reasonable to look to theService Departments to secure, by one means or another, further savings of the order of  7 millions. On the other hand any defermentof the new scheme of pay and allowances would involve the risk of imposing on the recruiting campaign an initial check from which itmight never recover. The expenditure attributable to research anddevelopment in the Ministry of Supply Vote could, however, bere-examined; and an acceleration in the rate of run-down in the Armyand Royal Air Force might in any case become necessary if, as theresult of the failure of the Federal German Government to contributein full even the lower level of support costs now proposed for1958-59, it became necessary to withdraw troops from Germany more rapidly than we had hitherto contemplated.(b) It was debatable whether Government expenditure should be interpreted only in terms of the comparative provision for supply expenditure in the Estimates for 1957-58 and 1958-59 respectively or should be regarded as comprising, in addition, the level of capitalexpenditure in the public sector as a whole. On the latter assumption,further reductions in capital expenditure might enable the Govern-ment to maintain that they were holding public expenditure, in thiswider sense, at substantially its current level. But the terms of theletter in which the Prime Minister had accepted the resignation of theformer Chancellor of the Exchequer would be regarded by publicopinion as committing the Government to ensuring that their own
current expenditure in 1958-59, in the more limited sense of theprovision for Supply services in the Estimates, did not exceed the corresponding provision in 1957-58 by more than some 50 millions; and for this purpose further reductions in capitalexpenditure in the public sector, which was reflected to the extent of only some 10 per cent, in Departmental Estimates, would be of relatively little value.(c) It would be possible to meet the emerging deficit on theNational Insurance Fund by realising some part of the investedbalances of the Fund; and on this hypothesis the economies to besecured elsewhere would be reduced from  40 millions to  17 millions.On the other hand a measure of this kind would be inflationary in its effect and would be politically indefensible in the light of the extentto which the Government were now publicly pledged to reduce their expenditure by genuine economies. An increase in the national health Service contribution, although constituting an increase in taxation rather than a reduction in expenditure, would be politicallymore justifiable than any manipulation of the National insurance fund, which informed public opinion would regard as an evasion of,the issues involved.The Home Secretary, summing up the discussion, said that any additional reductions in capital expenditure which could be achievedwould be valuable as a means of demonstrating the governments determination to maintain a firm control over the level of public expenditure in its widest sense. But, in view of the circumstances inwhich the Government were now implicitly committed to restrict tosome  50 millions the excess of the provision in the Estimates for1958-59 over the corresponding provision for the current financialyear, it remained necessary to secure further savings of some 40 millions in Government expenditure so defined. For thispurpose a fresh attempt should be made to secure a further economy of  7 millions in defence expenditure, and further consideration should be given to the proposal to increase the National health service contribution.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence to examine, as a matter of urgency, the possibility of securing further savings of some 7 millions in the Service Estimates for .1958-59.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider, inconsultation with the Ministers primarily concerned, thepossibility of effecting further economies in the level ofcapital expenditure in the public sector in 1958-59.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th January, 1958.
