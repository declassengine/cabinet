53860-9Defence 1.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the SecretaryOrganisation.   (C. (58) 142) covering a draft of a White Paper on the central organisation for Defence.The Prime Minister recalled that, when the present Governmentwas formed, the Minister of Defence had been entrusted with thetask of reshaping the Armed Forces in accordance with currentstrategic needs and with the nation&apos;s economic capacity.   For thatpurpose he had been given increased authority to take decisions on matters   of  general  defence  policy  affecting   the   shape,  size,organisation and equipment of the Armed Forces.   The time had now come to consider whether those provisional arrangements shouldbe confirmed and whether any further adjustments should be madein the central defence organisation. Broadly, the choice lay betweengoing back towards the form of organisation which had been evolvedin the last war or making some modest move forward in the directionof integration.   In the last war Mr. Churchill had taken the title of Minister of Defence, without a Ministry or any definition of thescope of his functions, and had devoted himself to the politicaldirection of the strategic conduct of the war in close personalassociation with the three Chiefs of Staff.   Continuing contact between the Minister of Defence and the Chiefs of Staff Committeehad been maintained by a Chief Staff Officer who, though heattended all its meetings, was not himself a member of the Committee.This system had worked well because it suited the personalities andthe needs of the time, and there were some who would like to revert to it.   But he himself was doubtful whether it would serve eithercurrent or future needs.  For in peacetime no Prime Minister oouldafford to devote so large a proportion of his time to defence problems.And, if we again became involved in total war, it would be so different from the last, both in its circumstances and in its duration, that itwas most unlikely that the same pattern of organisation would be appropriate.   In any event account had now to be taken of thecreation of a separate Minister of Defence, by the Act of 1946, andof the appointment, under the previous Administration, of a chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee. Both these developrhentshad reflected pressures for progress towards integration of the three services.  And there was little room for doubt that, if changes were now to be made in the shape of our defence organisation, these must look towards a greater integration of the three Services.In the draft White Paper now before the Cabinet some further changes were proposed. Thus, it was suggested that the working ofthe Defence Committee might be made more flexible and efficientif, instead of being organised on the basis of a fixed membership, ithad a variable membership determined by the Prime Minister inaccordance with the nature of the subjects to be discussed and the ministerial responsibilities involved. It was also proposed that anew post of Chief of the Defence Staff should be created in theMinistry of Defence, in place of the existing combined posts of chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee and Chief of Staff tothe Minister of Defence. In the main, however, the purpose of theWhite Paper was to confirm on a permanent basis the arrangements which had been introduced provisionally at the beginning of 1957.It was therefore to some extent a compromise. There were somewho would have wished to move further towards integration butthat could not be done without legislation, and this was not a subject on which the Government would wish to legislate in what might bethe final session of the present Parliament. There were others whowould have preferred to revert to the earlier form of organisation under which the professional Heads of the three Services alonebore the collective responsibility for tendering professional militaryadvice to the Government. But he believed that, apart from thepolitical difficulties of appearing to reverse the current trend of
military development, this system was more appropriate to a situationin which the Prime Minister himself assumed responsibility for defence without the assistance of a separate Minister of Defence.The draft White Paper thus represented a middle course between two extremes, and on that basis the Prime Minister commended itto his colleagues.The Cabinefs discussion centred mainly on two points first,whether the changes of organisation proposed in the draft white paper would encroach on the responsibilities of the Service ministers and the Minister of Supply; and, secondly, whether the proposed appointment of a Chief of the Defence Staff would impair theresponsibility and authority of the professional Heads of the three services,The Service Ministers emphasised the importance of their role in providing political guidance for their Departments and in persuading the Services to accept the consequences of government decisions on defence policy. Decisions taken by a Minister ofDefence who could not be in such close touch with the climate ofopinion in the Services would often be unpopular, and needed the justification and interpretation which a Service Minister could provide. The Service Ministers would not, however, be in a positionto give this assistance if they were denied the opportunity to share inthe formulation of policy. Moreover, if they were denied thatopportunity, there was a risk that decisions would be taken withoutthe full benefit of the informed advice and administrative experiencewhich was available in the Service Departments. The impressionwhich they had derived from the earlier discussions, and from earlierdrafts of the proposed directive, was that they might be excludedfrom meetings of the Defence Committee at which matters directlyaffecting their Departmental interests were to be considered. Thiswas a situation which they could not accept. So long as they remained Ministerially responsible to Parliament, they should havethe right to join in the formulation of policy on all matters directlyaffecting their Ministerial responsibilities. They feared that theorganisation outlined in the draft White Paper might be so operatedas to depress the status of the Service Ministers and of the Chiefs ofStaff, and to concentrate an undue measure of power in the handsof the Minister of Defence and the Chief of the Defence Staff. Ifthis happened, morale in the Services would be seriously shaken.The Minister of Supply supported the views expressed by theService Ministers. The proposals outlined in the draft White paper were a compromise between the view, which he and the service ministers favoured, that defence policy should be jointly formulated in consultation between all the Ministers directly concerned with defence questions, and the view of the Minister of Defence that theright course was to work towards a system under which the wholeresponsibility would be vested in a single Minister of Defence assisted by a number of Ministers of State. This conflict of view had notbeen fully resolved; and there was a real danger that those who heldthese differing views would place differing interpretations on theterms of the White Paper.The Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee said that thecentral defence organisation had evolved over the years in response to changing circumstances, and the new organisation now proposed was well adapted to meet current needs. In peacetime a PrimeMinister could give only a limited amount of time to defence problems and he needed the help of a Minister of Defence with powers of decision. The Minister of Defence, in his turn, needed the assistance ofa senior military adviser who was in close touch with the professionalHeads of the three Services but was also entitled to give independentpersonal advice to the Minister. The organisation now proposed would meet the needs of the Minister of Defence without impairing
CC. 53 (58)the authority of the Chiefs of Staff. The position of the latter was fully safeguarded, for their collective right to tender professionalmilitary advice to the Government was preserved. The Chief of theDefence Staff was not to have any central staff of his own on the modelof the German Oberkommando der Wehrmacht. He would drawhis information and advice from the existing Service staffs.The First Sea Lord spoke in favour of the organisation proposedin the draft White Paper and supported the views expressed by theChairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the Chief of the AirStaff expressed a contrary opinion. In their view it had been a mistake to create the post of Chairman of the Chiefs of staff committee; and it would be an even greater mistake if his powersand authority were now enhanced on the analogy of a supreme commander. So long as there were three separate Services, the professional Heads of each should remain responsible for its efficiency and for its control in military operations. That responsibility couldnot be surrendered to, or shared with, a Chief of the Defence Staff who would have no knoweldge of any Service but his own and no direct responsibility for the lives and interests of the members of anyof the Services. It was true that the three separate Services mustpursue a single policy in strategy and operations; but this could besecured through the collective responsibility of the Chiefs of staff committee, whose duty it was to submit professional military advice to the Government. Special exception was taken to the wording ofparagraph 17 of the draft White Paper, which would enable the Chiefof the Defence Staff to undermine the authority of the professionalHeads of the three Services by going behind their backs to seekinformation and advice from members of their staff.The Minister of Defence said that the purpose of a central defence organisation was to enable informed decisions to be taken on defence policy. There were, therefore, two aspects of the problem obtainingadvice and securing decisions. On the obtaining of advice there wasin fact no real difference of opinion. He was opposed to the creationof a large Ministry of Defence or of a central military staff on the model of the&quot; German Oberkommando der Wehrmacht. This wouldinvolve duplication of effort and would divorce the responsibility forpolicy from that for its execution. The alternative must however beto ensure a free flow of information and advice from the service departments and the military staffs to the Minister of Defence andthe Chief of the Defence Staff. The channels by which this advicewould flow should not be too narrowly defined. It must be possiblefor the Minister and his principal military adviser to draw upon allthe resources of the Service Departments and their military staffs.This could, however, be done without undermining the authority ofthe Chiefs of Staff; and any request for formal advice would, ofcourse, be put forward through the Chief of Staff concerned. he also believed that there was now general agreement that the Ministerof Defence should have the power of decision. The policy decisionsof the last twelve months could not have been taken if he had not had that power by virtue of the directive issued in January 1957. In thisrespect the draft White Paper did no more than formalise thearrangements which had been in force since he took office. The realissue was whether the Minister of Defence should continue to have this power of decision or whether he should be required to refer always to higher authority whenever he failed to procure a solution byagreement. The White Paper preserved the ultimate right of service ministers to appeal to the Defence Committee or the Cabinet whenmajor differences arose on which they felt strongly. But the collectivebusiness of Government would not be carried on efficiently if service ministers made it their practice to carry to the Defence Committee53860-9
all the minor issues on which small differences of opinion might arise between them and the Minister of Defence. Nor was it necessary, inhis judgment, that Service Ministers should attend all meetings of theDefence Committee. It must be remembered that this Committeehad two separate functions. It served occasionally as a forum inwhich serious differences of view between a Service Minister and theMinister of Defence could be resolved. But the bulk of its businessconsisted of problems reflecting the inter-action of defence and oversea policy, many of which did not directly affect the Departmentalresponsibilties of Service Ministers.In further discussion the following particular points were raised:  (a) On behalf of the Service Ministers it was argued that theywere to remain responsible to Parliament for the efficiency and administration of their Services; that the Services would thereforeexpect to be represented by them in the forum where defence questions were finally settled; and that they should on this account be invitedto all meetings of the Defence Committee at which matters affectingtheir Departments were to be discussed.The Prime Minister said that it did not follow from this that theService Ministers should be permanent members of the DefenceCommittee and attend all its meetings. The fact was that theCommittee, as at present constituted, was too large and heterogeneousfor the efficient conduct of much of its business. There were manydefence questions which, though they raised political issues, affectedonly two or three Departments, and it was a waste of Ministers&apos; timefor these to be referred to the full Defence Committee. There were also occasions on which preliminary discussion of major issues could most effectively be held in a smaller and less formal gathering. if ministers insisted on retaining a Defence Committee wi*h a largefixed membership, it was inevitable that these matters should bereferred instead to smaller ad hoc groups. It would be much more efficient if ali these meetings could be held, and recorded, as meetingsof the Defence Committee attendance being determined inaccordance with the subjects under discussion on each occasion.(b) Paragraph 9 of the draft White Paper might be thought to imply that there was special need to preserve, for the Service ministers and the Minister of Supply, a right of appeal against decisions by theMinister of Defence. All Ministers in charge of Departments sharedin the collective responsibility of the Government and it should notbe necessary to state explicitly that these Ministers enjoyed theprotection which that responsibility conferred. This paragraph, takenin conjunction with paragraph 2, might also be thought to imply thatthese Ministers would have access to the Defence Committee only when exercising this formal right of appeal.(c) The use of the word &quot; decision,&quot; in paragraph 10, might bethought to imply that formal Ministerial responsibility for certainService appointments was being transferred to the Minister ofDefence.(d) The wording of paragraph 17 should be adjusted so as toavoid the impression that the Chief of the Defence Staff would seekadvice from Service staffs without the knowledge of the Chief ofStaff concerned and would thereby undermine the authority exercised by the professional Heads of the three Services over the staffs under their command.(e) The Foreign Secretary asked whether paragraph 21 was intended to affect the practice by which officials of overseaDepartments attended meetings of the Chiefs of Staff committee at which defence questions bearing on the work of those departments were discussed. This was a valuable practice which, he hoped, wouldbe continued.
Aden. 2.   The Colonial Secretary said that the Sultan of Lahej, who(Previous was at present in Italy, had been found to be in treasonableReference : correspondence with the President of the United Arab Republic. HeCC. (58) 50th had declined to abdicate. It was proposed to depose him immediatelyConclusions, and, in order to forestall disorder, to occupy a number of points in minute 6.)       the Sultanate.   To enable this military action to be taken in the protectorate without delay, the Colonial Secretary wished to haveLahej. authority to make a statement to that effect in the House of commons that afternoon.In discussion it was agreed that the situation in Lahej emphasised the need for early consideration of political and military action to counter Yemen threats to the Aden Protectorate.The Cabinet Authorised the Colonial Secretary to announce in the Houseof Commons that afternoon the Government^ decision todepose the Sultan of Lahej.It was explained that this paragraph was intended to applyprimarily to written requests for advice. There were some matters,such as disarmament, on which civil Departments should look for advice to the Ministry of Defence, rather than the Chiefs of staff committee alone.(/) Paragraphs 20 and 21 of the draft White Paper dealt with theinternal organisation of the Ministry of Defence and its relations with civil Departments. It was agreed that, while the substance of these paragraphs was approved, they were not suitable for publication andshould therefore be omitted from the White Paper.At the end of the discussion the question was raised whether itwas necessary to announce at this stage further changes in. the central organisation for defence. The existing organisation had provedadequate to the heavy tasks which had been laid upon it during thepast year, when drastic adjustments of national defence policy hadbeen carried through. It would be widely assumed that the purposeof the White Paper was to increase still further the powers and authority of the Minister of Defence and his principal military adviser.On that account it was likely to arouse suspicion and ill-will.Government supporters would be apprehensive that in different handsthis system would be open to abuse, as concentrating excessive power in the hands of one Minister and one military adviser.Against this it was argued that, if the purpose had been to conferincreased powers on the Minister of Defence, legislation would havebeen required. In fact the draft White Paper fully safeguarded the ministerial responsibilities of the Service Ministers and the Ministerof Supply and the collective duty of the Chiefs of Staff to tenderprofessional military advice to the Government. It did little morethan formalise the arrangements introduced when the present Ministerof Defence was appointed in January 1957; it was, in the main, anattempt to explain to Parliament how the existing organisationaccorded with current strategic needs. If the wording of the draftwere adjusted to meet some of the particular criticisms which hadbeen raised in the discussion, there seemed no reason why it should give rise to the suspicion that it was designed to depress the status ofthe Service Ministers or the Chiefs of Staff.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of the draft White Paperannexed to C. (58) 142 at a meeting on the following day.
Parliament. 3.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord Privy Seal said that, as a result of the recent debate onthe reports of the Committee of Privileges, he proposed to consider with the Commonwealth Secretary what advice might be given to ministers on the handling of correspondence with Members ofParliament, and to discuss with the Speaker whether, by amendmentof the procedure or practice of the House, Questions relating to the nationalised industries could be admitted.The Cabinet &apos;Took note, with approval, of the Lord Privy seal&apos;s statement.Egypt- 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theFinancial        Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (58) 144), to which was appendedNegotiations,    a draft of an agreement between the United Kingdom and the United(Previous        Arab Republic concerning financial and commercial relations betweenReference:      the two countries and British property in Egypt.   If an agreementC.C. (58) 52nd  were concluded in these terms the United Kingdom GovernmentConclusions,    would remove the existing restrictions on Egyptian Accounts and minute 4.)       would require Egypt in return to terminate its discriminatory measures against British nationals and property, to return British property andto pay over a lump sum the amount of which was to be left to negotiation in settlement of claims in respect of Egyptianisedproperty and of damage to sequestrated property.In discussion it was recognised that the two most importantelements in the agreement the size of the lump-sum compensation to be paid by the Egyptian Government and the formula by whichthe Egyptian war damage claims would be waived could not beinserted in the draft agreement until progress had been made withthe negotiations which were about to be resumed. Meanwhile, therewere no points in the draft agreement to which objection need beraised.The Cabinet Approved the draft agreement between the Governments ofthe United Kingdom and the United Arab Republicappended to C. (58) 144.Cotton. 5.   The Prime Minister said that the Lancashire cotton industryImports. had negotiated with the industries of India and Pakistan a voluntary(Previous        agreement designed to limit the exports of cotton textiles to the united reference:      Kingdom over the next three years on condition that a similarC.C (57) 68th   limitation was accepted by the Hong Kong industry.    In spite,Conclusions,    however, of warnings that this was unlikely to be acceptable to HongMinute l.)       Kong, the proposed agreement was to cover, not only grey cloth andbleached cloth, but also piece-goods and made-up goods.   While itwas our duty not to stand in the way of expansion of the export of manufactured goods from Hong Kong, it was also desirable that theLancashire cotton industry, which faced the need to make painfuladjustments, should be enabled to do so in a gradual and orderly manner.   The Prime Minister had therefore prepared, in agreementwith the Colonial Secretary and the President of the Board of Trade,a statement which he proposed to hand that day to representativesof the Lancashire industry, to the effect that the Government wereprepared to tell the Hong Kong industry that, in their judgment, theindustry would be well advised in its own interest to show itselfprepared to negotiate an agreement with the Lancashire industrycovering made-up goods, but that this was ultimately a matter for

The Minister of Labour said that a deadlock had now beenDisputes. reached in the dispute on the dockers&apos; claim for increased pay, neitherDocks. side being willing to submit it to arbitration, and there was a real(Previous        danger of a national dock strike. He was considering whether, despiteReference:      the threat of strike action, it would be expedient for him to proposeC.C. (58) 48th   the appointment of a court of inquiry.Conclusions,Minute 5.) In discussion it was pointed out that, if a court of inquiry in the docks dispute were to recommend a wage increase of 3 per cent, thiswould make it difficult for the employers in the engineering industryto reject the claim which they were now considering. This might,especially at the present season of the year, have a damaging effecton the strength of sterling. On the other hand, the effect on exportsof a national dock strike, which would be the more difficult to handleif it were unofficial, would also damage sterling. Plans were being prepared for the use of troops in the docks at a very early stage of thestrike if it should occur.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for thesituation in the docks dispute to be kept under review bythe Ministers principally concerned.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence (C. (58) 140). on a request from the United StatesGovernment that, from late in 1960, they might be allowed to basecertain of their naval and naval air forces on this country.The Minister of Defence said that the United States ships and aircraft concerned would form part of the North Atlantic treaty organisation (NATO) warning system and that the DefenceCommittee favoured acceptance of the request. Our agreementwith the United States Government would stipulate that the ships and aircraft concerned should not be used for warlike operations withoutthe prior agreement of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, unless they eitherhad previously been brought under NATO command or were forcedto act in self-defence. Subject to this stipulation and to the settlementof satisfactory administrative and financial arrangements, he recommonded that we should in principle accept the Americanrequest.In discussion it was suggested that the agreement with the UnitedStates Government should be so worded as to avoid any suggestionthat the American ships and aircraft could in any circumstances beused for warlike operations without the concurrence of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment. When it became necessary to announce the arrival ofthe American forces, the terms of the announcement should be agreed between the two Governments.It was also suggested that, in considering the location of these forces in the United Kingdom, regard should be paid to the levels ofunemployment in Scotland and in Northern Ireland.United states naval Forcesin the UnitedKingdom.(previous reference :C.C.
