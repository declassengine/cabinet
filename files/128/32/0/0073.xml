Far East.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 72ndConclusions,Minute 4.)1. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that, during his recent visit to the United States, he had ascertained that supplies toQuemoy and the other Chinese offshore islands were being maintainedbut that the morale of the defending forces was precarious. Therewas now some reason to believe that the People&apos;s Government ofChina were not contemplating an early attack on Formosa; and, ifthe present stalemate could be prolonged, some means might befound of negotiating the neutralisation of the offshore islands. Since;however, the United States Government were unwilling to agree thatthe People&apos;s Government of China should acquire sovereignty overthe islands, it would be necessary to find a formula which, whileallowing the opposing forces to disengage without loss of prestige,would leave the legal status of the islands undefined.In discussion it was suggested that, since the negotiations in warsaw between the Ambassadors of the United States Governmentand the People&apos;s Government of China seemed unlikely to lead to any settlement, the most hopeful course might be some form of negotiation sponsored either by the United Nations or by theGovernments mainly concerned. Alternatively it might be preferable to adopt a purely military approach to the problem and to endeavourto persuade the Chinese Nationalist Government to withdraw their forces, on grounds of strategic advantage, to a more tenable position.It would be inadvisable that we should press the United StatesGovernment to move towards a solution on these lines more rapidly than they themselves saw.fit. But it was for consideration whetherthe Prime Minister should send a personal message to the Head of theGovernment, inviting him to use his influence to promote a negotiated settlement about the offshore islands.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thepublication of such a message would not necessarily be to our political advantage. It would be preferable that, in continuation of thediscussions which the Foreign Secretary had already had withMr. Gromyko at the United Nations General Assembly, he should suggest to the Soviet Ambassador in London that the SovietGovernment should exert their influence to secure the abjuration of force in the Far East.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to make representations to theSoviet Ambassador in London on the lines agreed in their discussion.middle east.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 72ndConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the report by the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the situation in the Middle east would be presented to the General Assembly on the following day.This would emphasise the importance of the Assembly&apos;s resolution of21st August calling on the Arab States to refrain from interfering ineach other&apos;s affairs; and it would propose the establishment of a united Nations Headquarters in Amman, with branches in Beirutand Damascus, and the appointment of a United Nations representa-tive in the Middle East. Meanwhile the internal situation in Jordanappeared to have become more stable and King Hussein now wishedto announce on 1st October that the withdrawal of British troops would begin on 20th October. It would be wise that we should takethe initiative in this matter rather than postpone the decision until itwould appear to have been taken under pressure from the Afro-Asianbloc in the United Nations. It might therefore be appropriate thatwe should ourselves announce on 1st October that, having consideredthe Secretary-GeneraLs report and taken note of the assurances givenby the Arab countries that they would comply with the resolution of
21st August, we had decided that, provided that satisfactory progress was then being made in implementing this Resolution, we would begin to withdraw our troops from Jordan on 20th October and would hope to complete the operation in three weeks.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Provided that we could obtain the right to overfly Syria orIsrael, or preferably both, it should be possible to complete thewithdrawal within three weeks. A decision on overflying was,however, urgent since evacuation by sea would take longer.(b) Once the withdrawal had begun, it could not be reversed.(c) Our forces would require ten days&apos; notice of the beginning ofthe operation. The withdrawal of the United States forces from the lebanon was to begin on 15th October and completed within14 days. If our own withdrawal from Jordan did not begin until20th October there would be a period during which British troops would remain in Jordan when all United States troops had left the lebanon. Provided that our intention to withdraw our forces was announced on 1st October, the exact date for the beginning of themovement might be further considered; but there would be advantage in accepting, if possible, the date of 20th October which theJordanian Government had suggested.(d) It would be undesirable to evacuate locally resident Britishsubjects at the same time. They were probably in no greater dangerthan British subjects in Iraq; and we should avoid creating theimpression that we were now severing all connection with Jordan.This question might, however, need to be reconsidered if theannouncement of the withdrawal of our troops was followed by anti-British demonstrations.The Cabinet (.1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to give further consideration tothe date on which the withdrawal of British troops fromJordan should begin, on the lines indicated in their discussion.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1), invited the Foreign Secretary to announce on 1st October that the withdrawal would begin on 20th October and should be completed within three weeks.(3) Agreed that British subjects should not be evacuated fromJordan on the withdrawal of our troops.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence (C. (58) 194) seeking authority to introduce in thefollowing Parliamentary session a Bill to renew the Navy, Army andAir Force Reserves Act, 1954, and to make certain extensions in thepowers to call up reservists without a Proclamation.The Secretary of State for War said that, in the event of globalwar, all three Services would need to rely on reservists whoseliability to recall rested on the Act of 1954, which would expire inJune 1959. It was therefore proposed to renew this Act for a furtherfive years, but to restrict its application to men who joined the Forcesafter 1948, thus excluding the older men called up under wartimepowers. In certain circumstances short of global war it would benecessary to recall a certain number of reservists in order to bringunits up to full strength and to provide them with the necessary administrative support. It would be convenient if reservists could be recalled for this purpose without a Proclamation. But theGovernment^ powers in this respect were confined to the recall, for
Cyprus.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 72ndConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Prime Minister said that he had given furtherconsideration to the proposal made by M. Spaak, the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), that theUnited Kingdom plan for the future of Cyprus should be suspendedpending consideration, at a conference of the Governments of theUnited Kingdom, Greece and Turkey, together with representativesof the two Cypriot communities, of a modified version of this plan which he himself had prepared. Both the Greek and turkish governments had endorsed this proposal in principle and it would be inexpedient for us to reject it. On the other hand, there could be noquestion of our abandoning our own plan in favour of the schemewhich M. Spaak had now put forward. Nor was there any reason why we should change our policy in response to the latest suggestion by Archbishop Makarios that, after an agreed interval ofself-government, Cyprus should attain independence guaranteed bythe United Nations. Our reply to M. Spaak should therefore indicatethat, while we could not agree to suspend the progressive applicationof the policy which we had announced on 18th June and 15th August,we were prepared to accept in principle his proposal for aninternational conference on Cyprus, provided that such a conference was held on the basis and within the scope of our own plan. we might also indicate that, as we had repeatedly made clear, we wereprepared to consider modifications of this plan provided that they received the unanimous approval of all the three Governmentsconcerned.C.C. 73 (58)oversea service, of Section A of the Regular Army Reserve andCategory 1 of the Army Emergency Reserve; and the numbersavailable from these sources were insufficient to meet the probablerequirement. It was therefore proposed to establish a new sectionof the Territorial Army composed of men who, in return for a specialbounty, would voluntarily accept a liability to be embodied for service at home or overseas without a Proclamation.In discussion it was agreed that the mere renewal of the 1954 Actwould probably provoke relatively little public or Parliamentarycomment. But the proposal to seek new powers to create anadditional body of reservists would be liable to provoke enquiry aboutthe Governments intentions on the future of National Service andthe scale of their other preparations to deal with an emergency. Itwould be premature to reach a decision about the scope of theforthcoming legislation until these issues had been examined in greater detail.The Cabinet-(1) Appointed a Committee consisting of:  Home Secretary (in the Chair)Minister of defence minister of LabourSecretary of State for WarFinancial Secretary, treasury to examine the proposals in C. (58) 194 in relation to themeasures which might need to be taken as regards thefuture of National Service and the introduction ofemergency powers legislation.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for this Committee tosubmit an interim report to the Cabinet as rapidly aspossible on the scope of the legislation to be introduced inthe forthcoming session of Parliament to extend the Navy,Army and Air Force Reserves Act, 1954.
In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal.The Greek Government would probably maintain that our insistencethat our own plan should constitute the basis of the conference would prejudice the discussions from the outset. But we could not abandonthis stipulation without sacrificing the support of the TurkishGovernment and reviving their demand for a partition of the Island.They had now confirmed that they would be prepared to nominatetheir Consul-General at Nicosia to act as the Governmentalrepresentative whom they were entitled, under our plan, to install in cyprus on 1st October; and this gesture was further evidence of their willingness to adopt a co-operative attitude which we should be unwise to discourage by agreeing, at this late stage, to suspend our plan.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for a reply to besent, on the lines agreed in their discussion, to the proposal by the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic treaty organisation that an international conference on Cyprusshould be convened.social investment.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 66thConclusions,Minute 6.)5.   The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by the Financial Secretary, Treasury(C. (58) 196) examining Departmental programmes of social investment in relation to competing claims on investment resourcesduring the next few years;(ii) a memorandum by the Minister of Education (C. (58) 197)discussing the effect on educational policy of the reduction in the investment programme for education which was proposed inC. (58) 196.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Cabinet hadalready decided in principle that the investment programme for1960-61 should be higher by  150 millions than the programme forthe current year. This represented an increase at the rate of 5 percent, per annum over the next two years and, since this increase was greater than the assumed annual growth in the national product, it represented the maximum expansion in investment which it would be prudent to envisage in present circumstances. deparmental programmes, however, exceeded the proposed allocation for 1960-61by some  100 millions, and it was therefore necessary to consider how they should be reduced by this amount. A proportionate reduction inthe case of social investment would be of the order of 25- 30 millions, towards which housing must make a majorcontribution. But the hospitals building programme should bereduced by some  3 millions and the educational building programme by some  8J millions. A reduction of this order could be reconciledwith the forward drive in education which the Cabinet had approved in principle in the light of the agreed provision for expansion of the universities and technical colleges and of the fact that, in the case of primary and secondary schools, resources which had hitherto been allocated to building to meet the &quot; bulge &quot; could henceforward be gradually diverted, as the &quot; bulge &quot; passed out of the schools, toimprove the older school buildings.The Minister of Education said that, if the programme of educational investment was curtailed to the extent proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer, it would be impossible for theGovernment to present, in the autumn, a forward policy giving clear and significant priority to the development of educational facilities.From the point of view of presentation, the amount of buildingstarted in a given year was more important than the amount of work done in that year.   The programme which he had proposed
SECRET- 7 449envisaged that starts of educational buildings would rise from 46 millions in 1959-60 to  60 millions in 1960-61. The counterproposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, however, would confinestarts in the latter year to the same level as in 1959-60. The expansionof the universities and technical colleges demanded a correspondingimprovement of the primary and secondary schools from which theydrew their pupils. And the measures which had recently been announced to increase the supply of trained teachers would fall short of achieving their full purpose, both socially and politically, if theywere not matched by a corresponding improvement in schoolpremises. If the educational drive was to be convincing, the 1960-61programme must be, and must be seen to be, significantly greater thanthe 1958-59 programme of  51 millions in terms of building starts.The minimum allocation for this purpose would be  55 millions.The Minister of Health said that the figure of some  3 millions, bywhich it was proposed to reduce the hospital building programme in1960-61, was trivial in relation to the investment programme asa whole, but was significant in terms of the long overdue improvementin hospital accommodation. Although a reduction of this order would not prevent some increase in the rate of starts for major schemes, it would imply that the allocation to Hospital Boards for normal projects would be confined to the level of 1959-60, with theresult that this allocation would have remained static in money terms,and would have declined in real terms, for four successive years.The Minister of Housing said that, politically, it would be verydamaging to reduce the rate of starts in public authority housing toan annual level of 92,500, as proposed by the Chancellor of theExchequer. He would be prepared, however, to give furtherconsideration to the possibility of adopting a figure lower than the120,000 which he himself would prefer.In discussion there was general recognition of the importance ofmaintaining an adequate control over the volume of public investment in the interests of the Governments economic policy as a whole. Onthe other hand, the total provision for social investment as proposed for 1960-61 by the Departments concerned showed an increase of only  3 millions over the provision for the current year. If it was further reduced on the lines suggested by the Chancellor of theExchequer, the steady decline in social investment in each year since1956-57, both absolutely and in relation to the total investment programme, would be even more sharply accentuated. further thought should therefore be given to the possibility of reconciling thelimits prescribed by the Cabinet for the investment programmes for1959-60 and 1960-6.1 with a forward policy in education and the hospitals service. It might be reasonable that educational building inthe latter year should be allowed to rise to a total of some 52 or  53 millions, if necessary at the expense of some reduction inthe provision for minor works. It might also be possible to confine the reduction in hospital building to only  1J millions. these possibilities should be further examined in the context of the currentreview of the reductions which would need to be secured in the restof the investment programme, comprising mainly the transport and fuel and power industries; and a final decision should be taken when this review was complete in the latter part of October.The Cabinet (1). Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider further,in consultation with the Minister of Education, whetherstarts of educational building in England and Wales in1960-61 should be raised to a level of  52 or  53 millions.
(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Health, to consider further whether the curtailment of the hospital building programme inEngland and Wales in 1960-61 should be confined to a figure of  lJr millions.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Housing, to give further consideration tothe level of public authority house-building in Englandand Wales in 1960-61.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Scotland, to consider whatalterations in Departmental building programme inScotland might be made consistently with the modifica-tions envisaged in Conclusions (1), (2) and (3) above.(5) Agreed to resume their discussion in October when the review of the investment programme as a whole was complete.Housing 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordPohcy. Chancellor (C. (58) 195) reporting the results of an examination, by aCommittee of Ministers under his Chairmanship, of proposals by theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment for the introduction of new measures to facilitate homeownership.It was proposed that the Government should lend money to building societies participating in the scheme and that the societiesshould undertake to grant 95 per cent, mortgages on houses valued atnot more than  2,500 and built before 1919. The total amount ofthese loans would, in the case of each society, form the limit ofthe Government^ loan to the society, subject to an aggregatetotal of  100 millions for the advances by the Government.In addition, to the extent that their own funds were adequate to meetthe demand, the societies would grant 95 per cent, mortgages onhouses valued at not more than  2,500 and built between 1919 andi 940. In either case the rate of interest charged would not exceedthat payable on the societies&apos; ordinary mortgages. This rate wascurrently 6 per cent. The societies borrowed, however, at about 5 percent., and would hope to obtain advances from the Exchequer on thesame terms. But the Government would be vulnerable to criticism ifthey lent money to the societies at a rate of interest substancially lower than that which they charged to the nationalised industries andthe New Towns Corporations and to the local authorities. Theywould appear not only to be subsidising the building societies, but alsoto be giving home ownership unjustifiably high priority as comparedwith the productive investment of the nationalised industries and thewhole range of social investment by local authorities. Moreover, theywould invite strong pressure from the latter to reduce the rate ofinterest at which they could borrow from the Exchequer; and thewhole of the Governmenfs interest rate policy would then be jeopardised. For these reasons the new scheme should only becontemplated if societies could be induced, in negotiation, to agree topay interest on money borrowed from the Government at a rate notmore than \ per cent, lower than the rate they charged to their ownborrowers and if the Government were prepared to resist all pressure to extend similarly favourable treatment to the local authorities andthe nationalised industries.In addition it was proposed that a revised system of improvement and conversion grants should be introduced, under which the localauthorities would in future have no discretion to refuse applicationsfor grant and, in the case of certain &quot; standard improvements,&quot; theowner&apos;s share of the cost would, where he took advantage of the newhouse-purchase scheme, be advanced by the building society.
(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Health, to consider further whether the curtailment of the hospital building programme inEngland and Wales in 1960-61 should be confined to a figure of  1^ millions.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Housing, to give further consideration tothe level of public authority house-building in Englandand Wales in 1960-61.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Secretary Of State for Scotland, to consider whatalterations in Departmental building programme inScotland might be made consistently with the modifica-tions envisaged in Conclusions (1), (2) and (3) above.(5) Agreed to resume their discussion in October when the review of the investment programme as a whole was complete.Housing 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordPolicy. Chancellor (C. (58) 195) reporting the results of an examination, by aCommittee of Ministers under his Chairmanship, of proposals by theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment for the introduction of new measures to facilitate homeownership.It was proposed that the Government should lend money to building societies participating in the scheme and that the societiesshould undertake to grant 95 per cent, mortgages on houses valued atnot more than  2,500 and built before 1919.

Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th September, 1958.The Minister of Housing said that he would be obliged to makea statement on this subject at the forthcoming Conference of theConservative Party. He proposed that this should be in general terms, indicating merely that the Government had it in mind tointroduce measures to assist people who were unable to buy houses for themselves under the existing arrangements and so to widen thefield of house purchase. This would not commit the Government tooperating the new scheme either through the building societies or through the local authorities and would thus strengthen their position in negotiating with the former. He would enter into these negotiations immediately after the Conference and would report further to the Cabinet as soon as possible thereafter.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (58) .195.
