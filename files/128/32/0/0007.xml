2. The Commonwealth Secretary recalled that, when theFederal Government had enacted the Constitution Amendment Billin order to increase the number of seats in the Federal Assembly, theyhad also made known their proposals for a revision of the franchiseon which the enlarged Assembly would be elected. These proposals had been discussed by Parliament in the course of the debate on thedraft Order in Council assenting to the Constitution Amendment Bill.The Federal Government had now enacted a second Bill giving effectto their new electoral proposals, but the African Affairs Board had asked for the reservation of this Bill on the ground on which they had previously objected to the Constitution Amendment Bill namely,that the franchise qualifications which it stipulated would differentiateunjustly against African electors. Since the United KingdomGovernment had supported the previous measure, they should nowadvise that the Royal Assent should be given to the Bill incorporatingthe revised franchise proposals. This Bill would not be subject to the negative resolution procedure; but, in view of the assurances givenin the earlier debate, it would be necessary to provide an opportunityfor Parliamentary discussion if the Opposition so requested. It wouldbe desirable, however, to seek to dissuade the Opposition leaders fromasking for facilities for a debate in view of the politically damaging consequences in the Federation which might result from anyprotracted discussion in this country of the issues involved.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to recommend that the Royal Assent be given to theFederal Governmenfs Franchise Bill.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Colonial Secretary and the Chief Whip, to seek toreach agreement with the Opposition Leaders on the undesirability of any substantial Parliamentary debate onthis measure.Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland.(previous reference:C.C.

The Foreign Secretary said that he had discussed with theSecretary-General of the United Nations during his visit in thepreceding week the latter&apos;s proposal to institute an economic development scheme in the Middle East under United Nationsauspices. The objective was a commendable one, but the plan was liable to involve serious difficulties and would need furthercareful examination.The French Foreign Minister had visited this country for discussions on the proposed European Free Trade Area. The FrenchGovernment appeared to wish, for political reasons, to delay action onour proposals ; but he had impressed on M. Pineau the importance of completing the negotiations as rapidly as possible.The Governmenfs latest proposals regarding Cyprus had beenill received by the Turkish Government, and further discussion had now been suspended until he himself visited Ankara on 24th Januaryfor the meeting of the Council of the Baghdad Pact. It would benecessary for him to seek the Cabinet&apos;s view before his departure on52960-9b 2Parliament. ].   The Cabinet approved the terms of a Government Motion forthe forthcoming debate on the economic situation, inviting the Houseof Commons to support the Government in their resolve to maintainby every effective means the internal and external value of the poundsterling.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
British Forcesin Europe.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 5thConclusions,Minute 9.)the advisability of proceeding with the present plan if the TurkishGovernment maintained their opposition. It was satisfactory that theUnited States Secretary of State had agreed that our proposalsprovided a practical basis for further negotiations and had offered torecommend them to the Turkish and Greek Governments.The meeting of the Council of the Western European Union atwhich we should seek the Councils agreement to make a start withthe withdrawal of a further 8,500 troops from Europe was due to takeplace on 22nd January. The Foreign Secretary said that he would agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofDefence the terms in which we should state that, in the absence ofany early indication that satisfactory financial arrangements would bemade for meeting the local costs involved, we should have to plan forthe withdrawal of further troops.government expenditure.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 6thConclusions.)*4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (58) 10 and 11) about the Estimates for 1958-59and the financing of the deficit on the National Insurance Fund inthat year.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as the result of furtherDepartmental economies which had now been achieved or were in prospect, the excess of the Estimates for 1958-59 over the level of thecurrent year was likely to be of the order of  75 millions. he remained of the opinion that, if this figure was to be reduced to 50 millions, an increase in the National Health Service contribution would be preferable to any of the other economies in the social services which the Cabinet had already discussed. If this increase was established at \0d. and was brought into effect on 1st July, the yield of  30 millions in 1958-59 would reduce the increase in government expenditure in that year to rather less than  50 millions. Moreover,the yield of  40 millions in a full year would provide a margin fromwhich the Government should be able, without any further increasein the contribution, to meet such future increases in the cost of theNational Health Service as might be caused by, e.g., an increase in the remuneration of doctors.If, by this means, the increase in Government expenditure in1958-59 could be confined to rather less than  50 millions, it wouldbe possible to consider whether the emerging deficit of  23 millions on the National Insurance Fund could be met by realising some ofthe securities held by the Fund. But there were strong objections tothis course and, although it might perhaps be adopted to supplementgenuine measures of economy on Departmental Votes, it offered noproper substitute for such measures.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Further economies could probably be secured on the HousingVote and on Service Votes, amounting to  1 million and  2 millionsrespectively. But there was no reason to suppose that otherDepartmental Votes could offer comparable savings without major changes of policy which it would be inexpedient to adopt at short notice. For example, it might be desirable to close nursery schools ;but it would not be possible to adopt measures of this kind withoutexamining them in greater detail in the context of the Governmentssocial policy as a whole.(b) In terms of the demand upon real resources, capitalexpenditure was at least as significant as many of the items for whichthe Estimates provided ; and it was for consideration whether, by making some further reduction in expenditure &quot; below the line,&quot; theGovernment could claim credit for having maintained due controlover their expenditure in its broadest sense. On the other hand, public* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
opinion had now focused on the Governments current expenditurein the sense of the provision in the Estimates for the Supply services ;and it would be by this criterion that the Governments efforts toenforce economies would be judged.(c) An increase in the National Health Service contribution would constitute, in effect, an increase in a regressive type of poll-tax.If the Government were compelled, in default of genuine economies in expenditure, to approach the problem on this basis, it might be preferable to seek additional revenue by an increase in the normalsystem of graduated taxation. As against this, however, it could be argued that no increase in general taxation would be accepted by public opinion as a substitute for a more effective control over thoseitems of public expenditure which imposed on the Exchequer adisproportionately heavy demand. In particular, the Governmentcould not indefinitely sustain a position in which the Exchequer^liability in respect of the National Health Service continued to risewhile the beneficiaries contributed a diminishing proportion of the increasing cost of the Service.(d) An increase in the National Health Service contribution would also be liable to provoke grave discontent among wage-earners.The increase in the National Insurance contribution which would take effect in the first week of February had been ill received by publicopinion and had already been interpreted by the miners as one of the factors justifying the new wage claim which they had recentlysubmitted. A further increase in that contribution, even if specificallyattributable to the National Health Service element which itcomprised, would aggravate industrial discontent; and this risk wouldbe at its most acute if the increase were announced simultaneously with the publication of the Vote on Account, within a fortnight of thedate on which the latest the National insurance contribution would have taken effect.(e) If, despite these objections, the National Health service contribution was increased, it would be important to continue to observe, as far as possible, the principle that not more than 20 percent, of the cost of the National Health Service should be financed from contributions and charges. An increase of Sd. would satisfy thiscriterion, even in terms of the yield in a full year. An increase of 10d.,however, would be less easily defensible in this respect; and it wouldillustrate even more clearly the extent to which the National health service had been selected, by contrast with other social services, to sustain an increase in charges wholly disproportionate to the rise inthe expenditure attributable to the Service.(/) The ratio in which an increase in the contribution should be apportioned between employer and employee would also need furtherconsideration. If an increase of lOd. was distributed in the ratio of2d. and Sd. respectively, the contribution of the employee, whichwould in any case amount to 95. 5d. from the beginning of February,would exceed 10s. Od. The additional burden would fall even more heavily on self-employed and non-employed persons, whosecontributions would stand, from February onwards, at 11 s. 6d. and9s. Id. respectively. It might be preferable, therefore, that theincrease should be limited to 8d., that it should be divided equally between employer and employee, and that self-employed and non-employed persons should be required to pay only an additional 4d.In further discussion it was suggested that, in view of theobjections of principle to an increase in the National Health service contribution, it would be advisable to establish whether the economiesstill to be achieved could not be better secured by an instruction to departments that they should eliminate some  20-25 millions fromthe collective total of their Estimates even at the risk of requiring totake larger Supplementary Estimates later in the year. DepartmentalVotes were always underspent to some extent, and the Government
should not allow themselves to be forced to introduce an unwelcomeincrease in the National Health Service contribution if they could achieve their objective by the more straightforward means of reducingthe civil Estimates in general by the required amount. In particular,the estimated deficit on the National Insurance Fund in 1958-59 hadbeen recalculated at  23 millions as a result of the fact that the levelof unemployment had been assumed to rise from 325,000 to 400,000 ;but a re-examination of the factors involved might indicate that thelower figure could continue, at least initially, to provide the basichypothesis for the calculation and that the deficit on the national insurance Fund could accordingly- remain at the original estimate of 14 millions. If, by this means, a saving of  9 millions could properly be secured, only some  16 millions would remain to be obtained by further economies on other Departmental Votes. Some  10 millionsmight be secured towards this figure by an increase in the charge forwelfare milk; or, if this course was rejected as a politically indefensibleattack on the nutritional standards of the most vulnerable sections ofthe population, other Estimates must be submitted to the mostrigorous re-examination in the search for the necessary savings.The Home Secretary, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were in general agreement that the Government must continue to seek to confine the increase in Government current expenditure for 1958-59 to an amount rather less than  50 millions and that this objective must be secured by genuine economies before it would be proper to consider any proposal to meet the deficit onthe National Insurance Fund by realising part of the invested balances of the Fund. It would be desirable, however, to give furtherconsideration to the alternative possibilities of achieving the necessaryeconomies by increasing the National Health Service contribution orby subjecting civil Estimates as a whole to a further reduction of theorder of  25 millions. This figure would be reduced to  16 millionsif the Minister of Labour thought it proper, after reconsidering the factors involved, to assess the incidence of unemployment in 1958-59at a level no higher than in the current year.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Labour to re-examine the level atwhich unemployment should be deemed to occur in1958-59 for the purpose of calculating the deficit on theNational Insurance Fund in that year.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider, in thelight of the result of the enquiry under Conclusion (1)above, the possibility of enforcing further economies incivil Votes which would reduce the increase inGovernment expenditure in 1958-59 to rather less than 50 millions.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W. I,21st January, 1958.
