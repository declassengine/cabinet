* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET54010-10 B 2Far East. *1.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the substance of(Previous messages which he had recently exchanged with President EisenhowerReference: and the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Dulles, about the cm (56) 10th situation in the Far East. Mr. Dulles had agreed that it was minute TT&quot; unfortunate that the prestige of the United States was now engaged in1 &quot; &quot;&apos; maintaining the position of the Chinese Nationalist Government intwo small islands, Quemoy and Matsu, which were not easilydefensible. But if the United States sought to compel the nationalist government to abandon these islands, the latter would be liable to suffer so severe a psychological reverse that it might become impossiblefor them to preserve their hold on Formosa; and, if Formosa was lost,the chain of island positions in the Pacific, including Japan, Korea andthe Philippines, would be broken, South-East Asia would be exposedand Australia and New Zealand would be isolated. Mr. Dulles had some hope that, in view of the strength of the Chinese nationalist forces on Quemoy and the logistic support which they were receivingfrom the United States, they would be able to maintain their positionin the islands. If, however, the United States were compelled to intervene, they might be unable to avoid using small atomic weapons.In these circumstances, it was very desirable that the policies of theUnited States and the United Kingdom should be as closely alignedas possible and that the two Governments should neglect no meansof devising a peaceful solution to the problem. It might, forexample, be desirable to advocate the demilitarisation of Quemoyand the other off-shore islands.In his reply to this message, the Prime Minister had indicated thatin present circumstances public opinion in the other countries of theCommonwealth was unlikely to be in favour of military action by theUnited States in support of the Chinese Nationalist Government. Inthe United Kingdom also the general public were still likely to feelthat, as we had privately warned the United States in 1955, we shouldnot be justified in provoking a major war merely in order to maintainthe position of the Chinese Nationalists in two insignificant islands.On the other hand, it was clearly important that the People&apos;s Govern-ment of China should not be allowed to secure, by the use or threat of force, the psychological victory which would be implied in theevacuation of the islands by the Nationalist forces; and, although thePeopled Government might in the last resort refrain from pressing this issue by direct assault on the islands, we should consider urgently the feasibility of the alternative solution of demilitarisation of the islands.We should also consider the position which our two governments should adopt on this matter at the United Nations.The United States reply to this message was now awaited.In the interval, the position had been changed to some extent by the offer of the People&apos;s Government to resume negotiationswith the United States Government for a peaceful solutionof the problem of the off-shore islands. Nevertheless thesituation remained difficult and dangerous. We could not allow Communism to make a further advance in the far east; but we must weigh this risk against the equally grave danger that,if the United States Government adopted too provocative an attitude in support of the Chinese Nationalist Government, they might precipitate a third world war. It was unlikely, on balance, that theSoviet Union would welcome a major conflict; and this gave us somegrounds for hoping that they would restrain the People&apos;s Governmentof China from action which would make it impossible for the UnitedStates to abstain from armed retaliation. But the maintenance of theUnited States position in the Far East was essential to us, since it wasthe guarantee of the safety of Australia and New Zealand and of thepreservation of our interests in Hong Kong, Malaya and Burma.Moreover, we could not expect the United States to continue to assist us in defending our position in the Middle East if we did not give themcorresponding support in the Far East.  While, therefore, we should
neglect no means of securing a peaceful settlement of the dispute aboutthe off-shore islands, we must not seek to weaken the will of the UnitedStates Government to resist the gradual encroachment by ChineseCommunism on territories held by peoples friendly to the western powers. It might be advisable to ascertain the views of the australian government on the situation which was developing.In discussion the Cabinet expressed warm appreciation of theinitiative which the Prime Minister had taken in discussing with theUnited States Government a situation which held such grave dangersfor both Governments. Hong Kong was no less vulnerable toCommunist pressure than Quemoy and Matsu; and the robust attitude which the United States Government were adopting offered us the best hope of avoiding the damage which our prestige in the Far East would suffer if we were compelled to evacuate Hong Kong. It was morearguable, however, whether it would be to our advantage to pursue the suggestion that the off-shore islands should be demilitarised. Ifthis proposal was adopted, the islands would thereafter be defencelessagainst Communist occupation; and, if demilitarisation was extended by analogy to Hong Kong, the Colony would rapidly succumb toinfiltration from the mainland. Moreover, it was unlikely that theUnited States Government would feel able to concede demilitarisationof the off-shore islands without extracting from the People&apos;s Govern-ment some countervailing concession, such as their recognition of theNationalist Government; and the People&apos;s Government would undoubtedly regard this as too high a price to pay for theneutralisation of the off-shore islands.On the other hand, public opinion in this country would not beready to accept the risk of major war for the sake of a few unimportantislands which the United States themselves admitted were notstrategically essential. Moreover, it would be difficult for the UnitedStates and ourselves to maintain our position in the United Nationsunless we were seen to be ready to consider peaceful methods of resolving the dispute over the islands. For these reasons thesuggestion that the islands should be demilitarised might well deservefurther consideration.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider the advisability of sending a private and personal message tothe Prime Minister of Australia about the situation whichwas developing in the Far East.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion as soon as a reply had beenreceived from the United States Government to the PrimeMinister^ latest message to the United States Secretary ofState.territorial waters.IcelandicFishery Limits.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 68thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet were informed that the operations of our fishery protection Squadron off Iceland were proceeding satisfactorily. Butthey meant that British trawlers could fish in only about 10 per cent,of the disputed waters; and, although the trawler-owners would continue to support our policy, there was some risk that the skipperswould gradually yield to the temptation to fish outside the protectedzones. It was for consideration, therefore, whether we could take anyfurther action to confirm our resistance to the unilateral action of the icelandic Government.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It might help us to maintain our present policy, pending a further international conference on the Law of the Sea, if we wereto seek some form of arbitration on the legal issues involved in the fishery dispute. We could not compel the Icelandic Government toaccept the jurisdiction of the International Court; but, if they refusedto accept arbitration by the Court, the General Assembly of the united nations could, by a majority vote, request the Court to give an
CC. 70 (58)advisory opinion. Such an opinion might be obtained by next summer and there was a reasonable chance that it would be in our favour. Ifwe did not take action on these lines and it subsequently proved impossible to maintain our present policy until a further international conference was held, our chances of preventing general acceptance ofa twelve-mile limit for territorial waters might be considerably reduced.(b) A claim had now been put forward by the Faroe Islands toextended territorial waters of twelve miles; and the inhabitants of the islands had threatened to secede from Denmark if the danish government refused to support this claim. The Danish government therefore proposed to send a mission to London to discuss a revisionof the Anglo-Danish Fishing Agreement of 1955. Subject to theconsent of our trawler-owners, it might be expedient to offer, withoutprejudice to our legal rights or to the outcome of a further international conference on the Law of the Sea, to conclude anarrangement about fishing in Faroese waters similar to that which wehad offered to the Icelandic Government, i.e., an undertaking to refrain from fishing within six miles from the Faroes provided that we remained free to fish beyond this six-mile limit.(c) Further consideration would need to be given to the disposalof the Icelanders who had been captured, and were at present being held, by the Fishery Protection Vessel Eastbourne.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, inconsultation with the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs,to seek to negotiate with the Danish Government an agree-ment about fishing off the Faroe Islands on the lines indicated in their discussion.(2) Invited the Attorney-General, in consultation with theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister ofState for Foreign Affairs, to give further consideration, inthe light of the result of the negotiations under conclusion 1 above, to the desirability of seekingarbitration on the Icelandic fishing dispute.(3) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the Ministerof State for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General toexamine the most appropriate&quot;means of disposing of theIcelanders who had been detained by our fishery protection Squadron.Commonwealth 3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of the affairs. Exchequer (C. (58)  178) covering a Report by the MinisterialConference at Committee on the Commonwealth Trade and Economic ConferenceMontreal. which was due to open in Montreal on 15th September. The Reportsummarised the main issues which were expected to arise during this conference and indicated the line which it was proposed that theUnited Kingdom Delegation should take. Annex A of the Reportdiscussed an issue on which the Ministerial Committee had not beenable to reach a unanimous recommendation, namely whether weshould introduce legislation to permit United Kingdom building societies to invest funds in the other countries of the commonwealth as mortgages on local housing.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the agenda of theConference offered little scope for major innovations in Common-wealth economic relations. The value of the Conference would therefore be mainly political and psychological and the UnitedKingdom Delegation would endeavour to ensure that the finalcommunique emphasised the importance of continuing co-operationbetween the members of the Commonwealth in fostering economic expansion.
In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Freer trade and payments. The initiative in pressing fora reduction in discriminatory import restrictions against dollar goods and a greater degree of convertibility of sterling would be taken by canada. Our own policy was to advance in this direction when it waspossible to do so from a position of strength; but the extent and timing of any measures which we might take for this purpose must remain amatter for us to decide at our own discretion. Such concessions as wecould offer at Montreal e.g., a further curtailment of our import restrictions on dollar machinery, a measure of liberalisation in colonial dollar imports and the removal of restrictions on canned salmon- would be a valuable demonstration of our good intentions inthis matter; and they should strengthen our hand in resisting thetendency of Australia and New Zealand to advocate the imposition offurther quantitative restrictions in particular cases.(b) Commodity policy. We were liable to be criticised by certain members of the Commonwealth, particularly Australia, for not takingmore positive action to sustain the price of primary products and toextend the scope of commodity price agreements. But while wesympathised with the present difficulties of primary producers and agreed that excessive and violent fluctuations in commodity prices could be disadvantageous both to producers and consumers, it was clear that few international commodity schemes contributed to themaintenance of a high and expanding world demand for primary products, which offered the only permanent solution of the problem.(c) Development. The concept of a Commonwealth Develop-ment Bank had considerable political attraction. But the success ofsuch a Bank would depend partly on its capacity to attract funds from outside the Commonwealth and to stimulate savings within it andpartly on its ability to enlist the support of other international financial institutions, particularly the International Bank for reconstruction and Development. Examination had shown that in neither respectwas there any ground for supposing that the creation of a Common-wealth Bank would result in an increase in the supply of new finance for Commonwealth development; and it would therefore be unwise toattempt to press the project.(d) Training of Commonwealth students. The United kingdom delegation should emphasise the very substantial efforts which wewere already making, and would consider extending, in order to assistthe education and training of Commonwealth students, particularly inscience and technology. It might be possible to reinforce existing facilities by arranging for Commonwealth students to travel by air atreduced rates; and this suggestion should be further examined.(e) Commonwealth consultation. Although opinion in theCommonwealth had hitherto been opposed to any suggestion that thearrangements for Commonwealth economic consultation should beplaced on a more regular and formal basis, we should seek to securesupport for our proposal for the establishment of a commonwealth economic Consultative Council. This proposal amounted to littlemore than the creation of a new framework for existing consultativebodies; but it should have substantial presentational advantages.(/) Investment by United Kingdom Building Societies in theCommonwealth. There would be objection to any extension of theoperations of United Kingdom Building Societies to other parts of theCommonwealth on a scale which would imply a significant reductionin the availability of finance for house purchase in this country. Butwe should not neglect the possibility of strengthening the link between ourselves and the other members of the Commonwealth by offering tomake available our knowledge and expertise on this subject in an endeavour to help them to mobilise local savings on similar lines.(g) Commonwealth preferences. Certain sections of Common-wealth opinion would be disappointed if no steps were taken topromote the revalorisation of Commonwealth preferences, in the light
4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Scotland and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (58) 177and 180) on the salaries of Scottish teachers.The Secretary of Slate for Scotland said that, in accordance withthe Cabinefs earlier decision, the National Joint Council had beeninformed that in his view no major change in circumstances had arisenConclusions^&quot;&apos; since tne present salary scales came into effect in November 1956 and minute 3.) &apos; that any claim for an increase in salary would, therefore, fall to beconsidered in the course of the next general review of the remuneration of Scottish teachers. Nevertheless, the issue had been taken to arbitration and the arbitral panel had pronounced in favour of anincrease of 5 per cent. This finding by the arbiters had been adoptedby the Joint Council as their recommendation to himself. There wasno precedent for the rejection of a recommendation deriving fromarbitration; and, if he failed to accept the finding of the arbitral body in the present case, the effect on educational opinion in Scotland woul-be disastrous. The machinery of the National Joint Council wouldprobably break down; and there was some risk that the teachersthemselves would take direct action, by withholding their co-operation in the administration of school meals or by refusing to superviseexceptionally large classes, in order to indicate their opposition to the government&apos;s policy. He accordingly proposed that he should beauthorised to implement the arbitration award with effect fromEducation.Salaries ofScottishTeachers.(previous reference:of the decline in the value of money since the level of the preferenceswas originally established. Even if any such proposal was impracticable, it was important that the opposition to it should be seen to come from other members of the Commonwealth rather than fromthe United Kingdom.(h) Oil. The Canadian authorities might wish to discuss thepossibility of increasing exports of oil from the wells in Alberta, whichwere at present working at only 40 per cent, of capacity. It was doubtful, however, whether this proposal was economic, since Albertaoil could not at present compete commercially with Venezuela oil evenif the cost of constructing the necessary pipelines was left out of account.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, owingto the conflict of economic interests within the Commonwealth, it seemed unlikely that any striking results could emerge from theConference. The United Kingdom Delegation should seek, however,to make the Conference the occasion for a fresh demonstration of thepossibilities of Commonwealth co-operation, particularly by support-ing the proposal for creating some new Commonwealth institutionsuch as the Economic Consultative Council and by endeavouring to foster within the Commonwealth a more dynamic attitude towards theexpansion of resources and of trade. The under-developedCommonwealth countries would continue to press us to allocatesubstantial resources from the United Kingdom for their development at the expense of our own prospects of economic expansion; we shouldcounter this tendency by emphasising that the only genuine remedy forthe shortage of finance for development lay in a joint and determined effort to increase the real wealth of the Commonwealth as a whole.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (58) 178 for the policy whichthe United Kingdom should adopt at the forthcomingCommonwealth Trade and Economic Conference, and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as leader of theUnited Kingdom Delegation, to be guided by the considera-tions which had emerged during their discussion.
Hire Purchase.(previous reference:CC. (58) 66thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in the light of therecent announcement by the joint stock banks of new credit facilitiesfor customers, he had thought it right to defer publication of theGovernments decision to relax the control over initial deposits underhire purchase agreements in order to avoid creating the impression thatthe Government considered that restraint in consumption expenditure was no longer essential. But now that the initial publicity which had attended the announcement of the new banking facilities was1st October, on the understanding that he would endeavour to ensurethat no general revision of the salaries of Scottish teachers should takeplace before the agreed date of April 1960.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he saw great difficultyin this proposal. The policy of wage restraint which the Governmenthad sought to pursue during the year was already in danger of beingundermined by recent settlements which had conceded increases of4 per cent, to farm workers and 4i per cent, to dock workers. If a new standard of 5 per cent, was now established, the Government would face a serious risk of a renewal of cost inflation. Moreover, it had hitherto been accepted that there should be an interval of about threeyears between successive increases in the salaries of teachers. this principle should not be sacrificed, since any concession to the scottish teachers would undermine the ability of the local education authoritiesin England and Wales to resist the pending claim for an interim increase in the salaries of English teachers in advance of the nextBurnham review. It would also be liable to have repercussions outsidethe teaching profession in the National Health Service, in the middleranks of the Civil Service, in the universities and possibly evenin industrial employment which would seriously endanger theGovernments wages policy.In discussion there was general agreement that, on merits, thearguments were evenly balanced, but that the fundamental issue was whether, in the particular circumstances of this case, the finding ofthe arbitral panel constituted an arbitration award in the sense inwhich that term was generally understood. If it must be accepted that public opinion would see no distinction between this finding and a normal arbitration award, there would be very grave objection to any action by the Government which would appear to imply a departure from their policy of accepting the findings of arbitration. On the otherhand, it could be argued that in this case the arbitral body had beenconstituted not to decide the level of an increase in salary but toenable the parties to the joint Council to agree on the recommendationwhich they would submit to the Secretary of State, and that theSecretary of State therefore remained free to exercise his statutoryright to accept, or to modify, or to reject this recommendation. this argument was supported by the fact that the Secretary of Statehimself was not a party to the dispute on which arbitration had takenplace and that, since the attention of the arbiters had not been drawn to his statement that he did not consider that a major change in circumstances had taken place, they had not had the wider considerations before them.It was agreed that a considerable issue of principle was involvedwhich the Cabinet would need to consider further.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to circulate full details of the statutory powers under which he determined the salaries of teachers in Scotland, together with copies ofthe letter which he had addressed to the National joint council, the terms of reference of the recent arbitral tribunal and the full text of the tribunal&apos;s findings.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,9 th September, 1958.subsiding, it would be reasonable to proceed with the relaxation of the hire purchase controls. The necessary public statement might be made during the following week.He had also considered whether we could now dispense entirely with the requirement of a deposit. But it would be wiser to confineour action for the time being to a reduction in the percentage depositsrequired and to re-examine the need for a further relaxation at a later stage when it would be possible to assess more accurately the effects of the recent expansion of consumer credit on the economy and onforeign confidence in sterling. In any discussion of the possibility of abolishing the requirement of a deposit it would be necessary to take account of the fact that, irrespective of Governmental regulations onthis point, traders would probably continue to require some depositunder hire purchase agreements.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by theChancellor of the Exchequer and invited him to arrange for action to be taken during the following week to give effect tothe relaxation in hire purchase control which they had approved in principle.
