SubjectGovernment Expenditure
government expenditure.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 1stConclusions.)*The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the amount anddistribution of possible further economies in Government expenditurein 1958-59.The Minister of Defence said that, having again reviewed thematter in consultation with the Service Ministers, he felt unable to contemplate any further deferment of the projected scheme of improvements in Service pay and allowances. He was satisfied that,in order to avoid serious discouragement to recruiting andre-engagement, this scheme must &apos; be announced in its entiretysimultaneously with the publication of the 1958 Defence White Paper.If the objectives of the scheme were to be attained, the government must avoid creating an impression of niggardliness by announcingtheir proposals piecemeal. Moreover, it would be impossible to convince either the Armed Forces or the public why proposalswhich were announced in February should not come into force until the following October. In conjunction with the service ministers, however, he had reviewed once more the possibility of achieving additional economies elsewhere in the defence Votes, andhad reached the conclusion that, with great difficulty, additional savings of  5 millions might be achieved. The willingness of theService Ministers to accept these further reductions on Votes whichhad already been drastically curtailed was the measure of theimportance which they attached to maintaining intact the new proposals for pay and allowances. As a result, the defence Voteswould stand at a total of  1,469 millions, a sum which if due allowance was made for price changes-could be said to comply withthe limit of  1,450 millions which the Chancellor of the exchequer had stipulated for defence expenditure in 1958-59.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he remained convincedthat, if a new scheme of Service pay and allowances was announcedand implemented in the near future, it would provide an occasion fororganised labour to revive the pressure for increased wages at a mostinopportune point in the development of the Governmentsdisinflationary policy. Nor could he believe that a relatively shortdeferment of the operation of the scheme would seriously jeopardiserecruitment to the Forces or impair the possibility that NationalService could be brought to an end within the period which theGovernment had in mind. Moreover, he was in any case unable toaccept the element of betterment in the proposed scheme (amountingto some  7 millions) which was designed to improve the remuneration of Service personnel in relation to comparable civilian emoluments.In discussion it was suggested that, if the scheme was deferred inits entirety for, say, three months, a valuable economy of some 9 millions would be achieved. Alternatively, if the initialimplementation of the scheme was limited to the improvement in basic pay and the introduction of new allowances (which appeared tocomprise the greater part of the element of betterment) was deferred for a period, the saving would still be substantial and the Governmentwould be able to maintain that their immediate action had been confined to making the appropriate adjustment in basic pay whichwas required to preserve the broad parity between Service pay andcomparable civilian incomes. On the other hand any furtherdeferment of the new scheme of pay and allowances, whether in wholeor in part, could not be defended to public opinion. Moreover, the element of betterment had always been regarded as an essential factor in the scheme; nor would it be desirable, if the scheme as a whole was to have the maximum effect, to represent it as other than theoffer of new and attractive conditions of service, to which theGovernment would wish to give the maximum of publicity.52960-4* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRETb 2
In further discussion it was agreed that the additional economiesnow being sought in defence Votes must, in principle, be matched by further savings, of the order of  25-30 millions, on civil Votes. Theleast unsatisfactory method of achieving the greater part of thiseconomy would be a substantial increase, of perhaps Sd., in thatelement of the National Insurance contribution which was attributable to the National Health Service. It might be possible to secure thebalance of the required saving by increasing the charge for welfare milk to 6d. a pint; but it could be argued that an even greater increasethan Sd. in the National Health Service contribution would be preferable to this step.At this point The Prime Minister adjourned the meeting in orderthat members of the Cabinet might have an opportunity for reflectionon the various possibilities which had been discussed.When the discussion was resumed, The Chancellor of theExchequer said that, on the hypothesis that a saving of  9 millionscould be achieved by the deferment for, say, three months of the new scheme of Service pay and allowances and that an additional  25-30millions could be saved on civil Votes, the total reduction ofGovernment expenditure which was now in prospect was some 100-115 millions. He was doubtful whether the amount by which expenditure in 1958-59 would still exceed the level of 1957-58 couldbe defended to world opinion as consistent with the governments policies. If he was to be able to maintain that he had succeeded in his purpose of holding Government expenditure substantially at its present level, he must insist that the further saving on civil Votesshould be of the order of  30 millions rather than  25 millions; thatit should be found within the field of the welfare services by genuinesavings or the imposition of additional charges; and that the search for further economies in Government expenditure, apart from defence and the welfare services, should continue until the Estimates had tobe closed. As regards defence expenditure, he would prefer to secure an economy of  7 millions by introducing the new scheme of pay and allowances forthwith, but without the element of betterment, ratherthan to seek a saving of  9 millions by accepting the scheme in itsentirety, including the element of betterment, but deferring its introduction for three months. If, however, the saving of  7 millionscould be secured by further economies elsewhere in defence expenditure, he would reluctantly agree that the new scheme of pay and allowances in its entirety should be announced and implementedon the basis proposed by the Minister of Defence.The Minister of Defence said that, on this understanding, hewould consider whether further savings of the order of  7 millionscould be achieved on Service Votes.In discussion it was suggested that it was perhaps unrealistic to suppose that, if the welfare services were subjected to a reduction of 30 millions, still further savings need be found on other civil Votes.Moreover, further examination would be needed before it could beestablished whether it would be possible to achieve an economy ofthe order of  30 millions on the welfare services.   In particular, anamount of this size could not properly be found within the ambit ofthe National Health Service without infringing the principle, whichthe Government had not hitherto publicly challenged, that not morethan 20 per cent, of the cost of this Service should be found by wayof contributions or charges.   The maximum economy which, by thiscriterion, could be required of the Service in a full year would be some  20 millions; and, since the other economies which had been proposed were unacceptable or impracticable, this sum wouldprobably have to be found in its entirety by increasing the national health Service contribution.   In that event the possible reaction ofa substantial increase in this contribution on the National insurance and National Assistance schemes as a whole would itself need careful examination.
The Prime Minister said that he would review, in consultationwith the Ministers immediately concerned and in the light of the cabinet&apos;s discussion, the progress which had been achieved and would seek to formulate further proposals for early consideration by theCabinet.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Defence to consider, as a matter of urgency, whether further economies of the order of 7 millions could be achieved in Service Votes, either bya modification of the new scheme of Service pay and allowances or otherwise.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour to consider forthwith, inconsultation with the Minister of Pensions and theMinister of Health, whether economies of the order of 30 millions could be secured in expenditure on the welfare services.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would consult with theHome Secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theMinister of Defence and the Minister of Labour, with aview to formulating further proposals for consideration.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,9th January, 1958.
