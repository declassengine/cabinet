*2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Housing (C. (58) 64) outlining the action that might betaken to relieve hardship among tenants who were likely to be evictedin the following October as a result of the operation of the Rent Act,1957. This contemplated that a Bill should be introduced to provide that no landlord would be entitled to regain possession of his housewithout an order of the court and to empower the courts to give astay of eviction of some months instead of the present four to six weeks. To succeed in obtaining a postponement the tenant wouldhave to satisfy the court that he had made a reasonable attempt tonegotiate a new agreement with his landlord; that be had made everyreasonable effort to obtain adequate alternative accommodation; andthat he would suffer greater hardship from dispossession than would the landlord from failure to regain possession. If he succeeded in securing postponement, the tenant would have to pay a rentdetermined by the court between the limits of 2\ times and twice the gross value of the house. These provisions would operate for threeyears from the passing of the proposed Act.The Minister of Housing said that the number of evictions now expected to occur in October greatly exceeded that originallyestimated and might be as high as 25,000. This was mainly due tothe fact that more landlords were now anxious to sell their houses,partly because they feared the Labour Party&apos;s pledge ofmunicipalisation and partly because of the current policy of creditrestriction. He was satisfied that action of the kind outlined in his memorandum was the only way of averting large-scale evictions inLondon and other main centres of population and in some other areas where there was a high proportion of retired people. This would be inequitable to many of the tenants and in a high degree damaging tothe Government who, if earlier action had not been taken to avert this situation, might even be forced by public opinion into emergency legislation in the autumn. The Minister did not regard his proposals as fundamentally inconsistent with the principles and purpose of the rent Act, 1957, since the Government had already made clear their intention to secure that the purpose of the Act was achieved in a fair and reasonable manner.In discussion the Cabinet first considered whether a Bill on theselines would be effective in relieving hardship, in the limited numberof cases where protection was genuinely needed, without appearing to undermine the principles and operation of the main Act. The danger was that such a Bill might encourage tenants who had not already made new agreements with their landlords to refuse to do so and to rely rather on the hope of protection by the courts. On the otherhand, it was in the interest of the tenant to make a new agreementwhere he could, rather than rely on the uncertain outcome of an action in the courts; and the proposed Bill could fairly be regardedas providing an incentive to both landlords and tenants to reach agreement before October. The estimated number of cases wouldcertainly impose a strain on the courts, but they would be spreadover a considerable period of time and there was no reason to expect that the courts could not deal with them.From the political point of view there was no doubt that a bill which would amount to an admission by the Government that they* Previously recorded in a Most Confidential Record.SECRET53260-2 b 2RentRestriction.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 15thConclusions,Minute 8.)Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.Parliament would be adjourned for the Easter recess from 3rd to15th April. The Chancellor of the Exchequer would open his Budgeton 15th April.
had miscalculated the number of evictions likely to occur would be most unwelcome to their supporters, who had loyally championedthe Act of 1957. If the Government were to legislate on the lines proposed, evictions occurring at the end of the periods of stay granted by the courts might come at an especially embarrassing time.Moreover, to give protection to tenants who had not yet made new agreements would be regarded as unfair to those who had already done so in circumstances unfavourable to themselves, the more so ifit could be shown that agreements made as a result of the Bill would tend to be more favourable to the tenants than those made earlier.The Bill would also impose a further strain on the parliamentary programme: it might require five days of Parliamentary time, whichcould only be found by extra sitting days in August or in the autumn.On the other hand the political effect of a large number of evictionsoccurring simultaneously at the end of the year would be even more serious: the Government might well be forced to legislate underpressure and even to recall Parliament for this purpose during the recess.In view of the political difficulties of legislation it was suggestedthat the possibility of relieving hardship by administrative action should be further considered. If, however, this should prove impracticable, the scope of the legislation should be restricted to theminimum. For example, it might be possible to define the classes oftenant e.g., the old, the disabled and those with large families ofchildren in whose favour the courts would be empowered to grantextended stay of eviction. Further consideration should also be givento the length of time for which the Bill should operate and to theamount of rent payable during the period of stay. It might bedesirable to provide either that the rent payable should in all suchcases be 2\ times the gross value of the house or that there should bea fixed minimum with full discretion to the courts to determine the rent above that figure. In either case, however, it would be necessaryto consider with the National Assistance Board the possibility of granting assistance to tenants who were unable to pay a rent so determined.On the timing of legislation, it was argued that, if the government decided to proceed with this legislation, there was a strong case for animmediate announcement. The initiative at present lay with theGovernment: if an announcement were deferred, the government&apos;s decision would appear to have been taken under pressure and, inparticular, as a result of the County Council and Borough Councilelections in April and May. It might also be overtaken by anannouncement by the Liberal Party that they had adopted as theirown a policy similar to that now under discussion. Moreover,landlords would, during the coming months, be arranging to sell orre-let their houses in October and any delay in announcing theGovernments intentions would therefore cause practical difficulties.On the other hand there was now some evidence of increasingconfidence in the Government and it would be regrettable to checkthis by an announcement which would be unpopular in many quarters.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of the proposals inC. (58) 64 at a meeting later in the day.Malta. 3.   The Colonial Secretary said that it was now evident that the(Previous Opposition Party in the Malta Parliament were unlikely to supportReference: Mr. Mintoff in his intransigent attitude. Mr. Mintoff had sent him aC.C.(58) 25th letter indicating that the decision to reduce the United KingdomConclusions, contribution to the Maltese Budget was unacceptable and that, if the minute 4.) reduced contribution were not increased, the financial resources available to the Government of Malta would be exhausted by themiddle of April and he would be compelled to tender his resignation.
C.C. 26 (58)There could be no question of increasing our contribution of 5 millions to the Maltese Budget. But Mr. Mintoff would probablyseek to create financial and administrative chaos in Malta and torepresent this as the consequence of the policy pursued by the UnitedKingdom Government. He might also hope to provoke us to suspend the constitution in order to extricate him from the difficultpolitical situation which he had created for himself. We should not commit ourselves prematurely on the issue of suspending theconstitution; but, if Mr. Mintoff succeeded in creating a financialcrisis in Malta, the Governor would have to invoke his emergency powers in order to increase taxes and to raise a local loan in the island to supplement the United Kingdom contribution to the MalteseBudget.If Mr. Mintoff chose to resign, we had no means of preventinghim from basing his subsequent appeal to the Maltese electorate onthe issue of independence. But the Governor should cause it to be known locally that independence would have damaging economic consequences for the people of Malta. He might also indicate thatwe remained ready to resume discussions in an effort to devise along-term settlement acceptable to both countries, without definingat this stage the attitude which we should adopt if Mr. Mintoffreturned to office committed to achieve the independence of the island. Alternatively, he might make it clear forthwith that we werenot prepared to see the people of Malta suffer the economic consequences of complete independence and that we could not agreeto concede it even if a Government pledged to achieve it came into power as a result of the election.In discussion there was general agreement that we should not offer to increase our contribution of  5 millions to the Maltese Budget.The Governor should, however, be advised in more detail about thecourse which he should pursue if Mr. Mintoff deliberately sought to provoke a financial crisis in Malta. On the political issue of independence the Governor need not at this stage give any indication of the policy which the United Kingdom Government would adoptif a Government committed to achieve independence were returnedto power in Malta; but he should take every opportunity to emphasise the reasonable and constructive nature of our proposals which mr. Mintoff had rejected.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Colonial Secretary, to arrange for officials to consider at once the advice to be given to the Governor of Maltaon the course which he should adopt if Mr. Mintoff sought to precipitate a financial crisis in the Island.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theColonial Policy Committee to consider in more detail, inthe light of the result of the action to be taken under conclusion (1) above, the guidance to be given to theGovernor of Malta in dealing with the constitutional crisiswhich might arise in the Island.Wages Policy:national health service.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 13thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Health (C. (58) 62) about the terms on which staff should be assimilated to the new scales of salary to be introduced as part ofthe reorganisation resulting from the recent report by Sir Noel Hallon the Grading Structure of Administrative and Clerical Staff in theHospital Service.The Minister of Health said that the new salaries themselves hadalready been approved by the Cabinet and. subject to a fewoutstanding points, had been agreed by the Committee of the whitley council concerned.   Assimilation could be effected by either of two
methods. Under the first (Scheme A), each member of the staff would be assimilated to a recognised point on the appropriate new scale or to a point on a short notional scale represented by adownward extension or modification of the lower part of the new scale. This would involve salary increases for individual officersranging from 1-9 per cent, to 7-9 per cent., the average being about-7 per cent. Under the second scheme (Scheme B), all members ofthe staff would receive an increase of exactly 3 per cent.; but their salaries would not coincide with any of the recognised points on thenew scales and would correspond with those scales only at themaximum. Of these two schemes the former was clearly preferable.It was supported by the Secretary of State for Scotland and had been provisionally approved by the Committee on Pay Claims in the PublicService.In discussion there was general agreement that Scheme B was unacceptable. Scheme A might entail some embarrassment to theGovernment&apos;s wages policy in that it would imply that on averagesalary increases of 3-7 per cent, had been conceded to staff to whom a 3 per cent, increase had been refused by the Government in theprevious autumn. But this risk would not be substantial if thesettlement was presented not as an award based on normalcost-of-living considerations but as the result of a revaluation of thework performed by the staff on the basis of a comprehensive reviewof the grading structure of the Service.In further discussion, on the timing of the negotiations, theCabinet were informed that the Whitley Committee concerned was due to meet on 31st March. It was improbable that any agreement would be reached at that meeting, since even Scheme A was not likelyto be immediately acceptable to the Staff Side. It would, however,be unfortunate if, before the pending award on the railwaymen&apos;swages claim was published, it became known that, with theconcurrence of the Government, a salary increase averaging 3 - 7 percent, had been offered in the National Health Service. While,therefore, any delay in the negotiations would be unwelcome to bothsides of the Whitley Council, the balance of advantage appeared to lie in postponing the next meeting of the Council from 31st March toa date in mid-April and in deferring the conclusion of any final agreement, if possible, until May. This postponement mightstrengthen the case for granting some measure of retrospection in the implementation of the new scales. The decision on the operative date of the settlement should, however, be deferred until agreement had been reached in the Whitley Committee on the assimilationproposals and other outstanding points.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Health to arrange that further negotiations in the Committee of the Whitley Councilconcerned with the introduction of revised scales of salaryfor the clerical and lower administrative staff in theNational Health Service should be postponed untilmid-April.(2) Authorised the Minister of Health, on the resumption of negotiations, to offer, through his representatives on theManagement Side, the terms of assimilation defined asScheme A in C. (58) 62.(3) Agreed that a decision on the date of operation of the newsalary scales should be deferred until agreement had beenreached on the scheme of assimilation and other outstanding points.
ForeignTunisia.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 17thConclusions.Minute 2.)Meeting of heads of governments.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 24thConclusions,Minute 4.)Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,27th March, 1958.5. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that it had now been made plain to President Bourguiba that the FrenchGovernment could not be urged to accept the latest proposals for asettlement with Tunisia unless he, for his part, was willing to accept some arrangement for the establishment of a neutral commission onthe frontier. Despite this pressure, the President was unwilling to contemplate any independent supervision of the frontier, and therewas therefore no prospect of securing French agreement to theproposed settlement. Our next step might be to invoke the assistanceof the Secretary-General of the United Nations.The Prime Minister said that we should now consider whether we had anything to gain by further intervention in this problem. our good offices had produced no result, and by persisting with them werisked alienating public opinion in France. He would discuss this with the Foreign Secretary on his return.The Prime Minister said that agreement had now been reached with the United States Government on the terms of a draft statementof the attitude of the Western Powers towards a meeting of Heads of governments. This draft was now being discussed in the north atlantic Council, and he hoped that the statement might becommunicated to the Soviet Government, and made public, before theend of the week.
