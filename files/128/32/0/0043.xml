Parliament.parliamentary privilege.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 39thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Lord Privy Seal said that it was hoped that the House wouldbe able to adjourn for the Whitsun recess from 23rd May until10th June. In announcing this he would add that, in presentcircumstances, the arrangements must be regarded as provisional.The Lord Privy Seal said that he proposed to table, at the.appropriate moment, a Motion referring to the Committee of privileges the recent ruling by the Judicial Committee of the privy council that the House of Commons would not be acting in a mannercontrary to the Parliamentary Privilege Act, 1770, if it treated theissue of a writ against a Member of Parliament in respect of a speechor proceeding by him in Parliament as a breach of its privileges.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement.territorial waters.(Previous(Reference:C.C. (58) 41stConclusions,Minute 4.)2.   The Cabinet had before them:  (i) A memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (C. (58) 107) on possible methods of protecting British trawlers fishing within any area of the high seas over which the Icelandic Government claimedsovereignty or exclusive fishing rights;(ii) A memorandum by the Attorney-General (C. (58) 108)advising that we should enjoy the same legal right to use force in protecting our vessels in any such area as we should have to defendBritish territory, provided that the degree of force used was only such as would suffice to resist the use of force by the icelandic government.The Foreign Secretary said that it was not yet known whetherthe Icelandic Government would make a unilateral claim to extendedterritorial waters or fishery rights. They might claim a straightforward extension to twelve miles; or exclusive fishing rights in a twelve-mile zone but with preservation of established rights,probably subject to some limitation of time or of the quantity ofcatch permitted; or an extension of territorial waters to six mileswith an additional six miles&apos; exclusive fishery, subject to limitedpreservation of established rights. The North Atlantic Council wereto discuss the situation on the following day and a proposal mightemerge for a conference of North Atlantic Powers on fishery limits.But in any event it was necessary that any unilateral claim by the icelandic Government should be met by a declaration that we didnot recognise the claim and were prepared to protect British trawlersfishing in any area of the high seas claimed by Iceland.Discussion showed that there was general agreement that weshould provide protection for any British trawlers which Icelandicvessels attempted to impede or to arrest. Anything less would be tantamount to acquiescence in the Icelandic claim and, as such, wouldnot only be liable to provoke other unilateral claims to extendedterritorial waters and fishing rights but would also prejudice ourposition at the next International Conference on Territorial waters and before the International Court of Justice.It would be practicable to afford effective protection to ourtrawlers provided that we were prepared to withdraw naval vessels
from other commitments and that the fishing industry were willingto co-operate by agreeing to fish only within such limited areas of the disputed seas as could be kept under naval surveillance. It should bemade clear to them that we were not likely to be able to protect anytrawler which chose to fish outside the areas patrolled by the royal navy. While it was important that the measures which wecontemplated should not become publicly known before the icelandic government had reached their decision, it would be desirable. todiscuss them at once, on a provisional basis and in confidence, withthe Chairman of the British Trawlers&apos; Federation. Any request fromthe industry for compensation in respect of loss or damage whichtrawlers might sustain while fishing in the disputed waters would need to be reserved for further consideration and to be examined in thelight of the extent of the insurance which the industry normallymaintained.In further discussion it was agreed that it would be desirable toconsider in advance the statement which we should need to makeif the use of force by Icelandic fishery protection vessels gave rise toan incident or the matter was referred to the United nations organisation. We should also consider in advance the tactics to beadopted at the next international discussion on the breadth of territorial waters.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that weshould inform the United States Government of our intentions. Theymight be told privately that, since British trawlers could not be prevented from fishing in any area of the high seas claimed byIceland, there was no practicable alternative to the course which we proposed to adopt. We should also seek to enlist the support ofother members of the North Atlantic Alliance. Meanwhile,alternative statements should be prepared for use in the event of a unilateral claim by the Icelandic Government in one or other of the forms which seemed likely, and arrangements should be made tokeep the situation continuously under review.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary (i) to inform the United States Government and theUnited Kingdom Delegation at the North atlantic treaty Organisation that, in the event of a unilateral claim by the Icelandic Government toextended fishery rights or territorial waters, weshould refuse to recognise the claim and should provide effective protection for British vesselsfishing in any area of the high seas affected;(ii) to prepare, in consultation with the Minister ofAgriculture, the Attorney-General and the FirstLord of the Admiralty, alternative statements foruse if a claim of this nature were made by the icelandic Government;(hi) to arrange, in consultation with the ministers concerned and the Chiefs of Staff, for the plans forprotecting British trawlers to be kept under review in the light of developments, and to report to theCabinet as necessary;(iv) to consider, in consultation with the Attorney-General, the form of any statement which mightbe made if an incident occurred in the disputedwaters or it became necessary to discuss the issue in the United Nations Organisation.(2) Invited the Attorney-General to circulate a memorandumon the tactics to be adopted at the next international discussion on the breadth of territorial waters.
industrial disputes.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 42ndConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (58) 104) reviewing the preparations which had beenmade to meet an industrial emergency.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the associated society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen and the TransportSalaried Staffs Association had accepted the British transport commission^ offer of a wage increase of 3 per cent, with effect from july. The National Union of Railwaymen might, however, seek to reopen negotiations with the Commission; and although it now seemed unlikely on balance, that they would unilaterally declare astrike, they would probably try to protract the discussions in the hopeof extracting some further concession from the Commission. In themeantime the measures outlined in C. (58) 104 would be held in readiness, to be introduced if necessary.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of C. (58) 104.Cyprus.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 42ndConclusions,Minute 2.)*4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary ofthe Cabinet (C. (58) 109) covering a revised policy statement onCyprus.In discussion there was general agreement that the proposedexperiment in partnership with the Greek and Turkish governments in the administration of the Island represented the best course nowopen to us.In further discussion of the details of the draft statement the Minister of Defence expressed doubts regarding the advisability of our undertaking a commitment to maintain British sovereignty over the Island for as long a period as seven years. The plan would depend essentially on the co-operation of the Cypriot communities,and, in default of such co-operation, might break down at an early stage. If we were nevertheless committed to maintain internal security in the Island for the balance of the seven years, we shouldbe faced with a liability which was militarily unacceptable since itcould not be reconciled with the policy of a progressive reduction inthe strength of the Army. On the other hand it was argued that adefinite statement of intention was desirable in the interests of stableadministration in Cyprus and in order to reassure the TurkishGovernment. The balance of advantage therefore lay in retaining the reference to a period of seven years, but to making it clear thatthis period was itself part of the plan and was designed &quot; to allowtime for the new principle of partnership to be fully worked out and brought into operation under this plan in the neccessary atmosphere of stability.&quot; It was also agreed that the statement should be amended to indicate that the people of the Island would, through their representative institutions, be able to &quot; exercise authority,&quot;rather than merely &quot; to have a voice,&quot; in the management of the island&apos;s internal affairs.The Cabinet were informed that the Leaders of the Opposition,who had been given in confidence an outline of the new proposals,had expressed some doubts about them on the ground that they mightbe regarded as an attempt to perpetuate British sovereignty and to conciliate Turkish opinion without holding out any prospect to theGreek Government of the exercise of unitary self-determination.They had indicated that these objections might be reduced if the* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
North Atlantic Council were willing to endorse the maintenance ofBritish sovereignty for a seven-year period, and if the references inthe draft statement to the ultimate future of the Island werenon-committal. The text appended to C. (58) 109 might be regardedas going some way to meet this latter point, in that it no longerreferred explicitly to the Governments previous assurances in regardto the exercise of communal self-determination. But although itwould be possible to maintain that those assurances were relevantonly to the failure of the plan, there could be no question of theGovernments retracting their earlier pledge about the application ofcommunal self-determination in the last resort. It might, however,be possible to arrange for the proposals to be communicatedconfidentially to the North Atlantic Council and to secure their general approval. This possibility, together with the other problems of presentation and timing involved, both as regards the parliamentary statement itself and the prior diplomatic approach to the Greek and turkish Governments, would require further study. It would bedesirable, if possible, to avoid a Parliamentary debate on Cyprusbefore the Whitsun recess; and it might therefore be necessary tomake an interim statement in the House of Commons on 19th May,promising a full statement of the Governments policy at the earliest opportunity after the recess.The Cabinet (1) Approved the draft policy statement annexed to C. (58) 109subject to the points made in discussion.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would discuss with theForeign Secretary and the Colonial Secretary theproblems of presentation and timing involved.France. 5.   The Foreign Secretary reported to the Cabinet the latest(Previous        developments in the political situation in France.Reference:CC. (57) 41stConclusions,Minute 4.)Lebanon.(previous reference:CC. (58) 42ndConclusions,Minute 1.)*6. The Cabinet reviewed recent developments in the situationin the Lebanon.The Foreign Secretary said that we had informed PresidentChamoun that we would be prepared, in concert with the UnitedStates, to meet a request from the legally constituted Governmentof the Lebanon for assistance to maintain the independence andintegrity of their country against aggression or subversion promoted by external forces. In the meantime, the situation in the Lebanonappeared to be calmer and the pipeline of the Iraq petroleum company to Tripoli had been repaired. President Chamoun had given up his previous intention of seeking re-election to the Presidencyand General Chehab&apos;s support for the Government now appeared tobe firmer.The Minister of Defence said that, if necessary, three battalionscould be moved from Cyprus to the Lebanon and the Commanders-in-Chief in the Middle East had been authorised to bring thesebattalions to an advanced state of readiness provided that no indication was given that any operations outside Cyprus were in contemplation.The Prime Minister said that the United Kingdom and UnitedStates military staffs were preparing the necessary plans for any action which might be needed.   He had agreed that the United States* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
The Yemen.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 31stConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Colonial Secretary said that since our recent firm actionagainst the fort at Qataba, there had been a decline in the numberof incidents in which Yemeni guns had fired on our forces and loyaltribesmen in the Aden Protectorate. The Governor of Aden andthe military commander were satisfied that for the time being theexisting authority to take retaliatory action against guns sited outsideinhabited localities was adequate. If further attacks by Yemeniguns sited within inhabited localities occurred, the question of extending this authority would need to be reconsidered.The Prime Minister said that he would prefer that the generalauthority should not be extended. If further attacks were made byYemeni guns sited in inhabited localities, the extent of any retaliatory action would need to be determined in the light of the particular circumstances obtaining at the time. The local military authoritiesshould therefore be instructed to report immediately any furtherincidents. If these reports were sent to him, he would arrange for decisions to be taken without delay.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that for the time being the existing authority givento our forces in the Aden Protectorate to retaliate againstYemeni guns should not be extended.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for the PrimeMinister to be informed immediately of any incidentsinvolving attacks by Yemeni guns sited in inhabitedlocalities in order that the question of retaliatory action might be considered urgently.should provide the Commander-in-Chief of any joint force whichmight be established; and no British troops would be moved to the lebanon in advance of United States forces. The formal assurance of support which had now been given to President Chamoun mightsuffice to enable him to maintain order, and military interventionmight be unnecessary. On the other hand, if the situation deteriorated, it would be important to meet promptly any appeal for help from the Lebanese Government, since, if Lebanon was compelled to accede to the United Arab Republic, Iraq and Jordanmight not be able to retain their independence. Our close collaboration with the United States Government in this matter wasa clear indication that co-operation between them and ourselves hadbeen re-established and this should in itself exert a beneficial effecton the course of events in the Middle East. The Prime Ministers ofAustralia and Canada had been told in confidence the full extent ofthe arrangements agreed with the United States, and the PrimeMinister of New Zealand had been informed of the position in more general terms. The other Commonwealth Governments had beenasked for their views on the present situation in the Lebanon. Untilany overt action became necessary it was important to maintain theutmost secrecy about our undertaking to intervene, with the UnitedStates, in the Lebanon.The Cabinet Took note with approval of these statements.
