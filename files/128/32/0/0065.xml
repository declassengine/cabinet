BroadcastingDevelopment.(previous reference:CM. (56) 85thConclusions,Minute 3.)53860-11C.C. 65 (58)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C. (58) 159) discussing certain problems of broadcasting policy and the advisability of referring these problems for examination by an independent committee.The Lord Chancellor said that the most urgent of these issuesderived from the pressure for the introduction of an additionaltelevision programme and the desirability of limiting the profits ofthe television programme contractors. There seemed no practicablemethod of controlling the latter; but, while the Government could,with the technical advice already available to them, reach decisions on the provision of an additional television programme and on theother outstanding problems, their decisions would inevitably be unwelcome in some quarters. It was for consideration, therefore,whether the political advantages of referring these problems to anindependent enquiry outweighed the political disadvantages ofconstituting such an enquiry at the present time.The Postmaster-General said that there was no genuine public demand for a third television programme, and its introduction at atime when certain areas of the country were still unable to receiveeither of the two existing programmes would be liable to provokeresentment. Moreover, the capital cost of introducing an additional programme would be of the order of  7 millions and, if the programmewere allotted to the British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.), theadditional operational costs could be met only by increasing the television licence fee and surrendering to the B.B.C. the share of thelicence revenue which at present accrued to the Exchequer. nor could a third programme be introduced until the technical issue of thestandard of line-definition had been resolved. But a decison couldnot be deferred indefinitely; and, whatever form it took, it could notavoid arousing strong criticism from certain of the interests concerned.There would therefore be advantage in remitting this problem to anindependent committee of enquiry, together with the other current problems, possibly including the level of the profits earned by theprogramme contractors. Moreover, it would be necessary, in any event, to establish committees of enquiry in connection with the renewal of the B.B.C. Licence and Charter, which expired in 1962, andthe future of the Independent Television Authority (I.T.A.), for whichthe Television Act provided only until 1964. It would be possible,and might be desirable, to advance the dates of these enquiries and,by extending their scope to include the current problems discussed inC. (58) 159, to deal comprehensively with all the major issues of broadcasting policy in a single investigation.In discussion it was suggested that there were serious political objections to holding an enquiry on these controversial subjects in theperiod before a General Election. The B.B.C. would be apprehensive that their status as the &quot; main instrument for broadcasting &quot; would be undermined, while the I.T.A. and the programme contractors wouldbe no less concerned that their policy and their profits would come under attack. Moreover, an enquiry into the problems outlined inC. (58) 159 could not be regarded as a substitute for the enquiry whichwould be needed into the future of the B.B.C. and the I.T.A., whileany attempt to advance the date and to extend the scope of the latter would be premature and might be politically inexpedient. Nor was an enquiry into the current problems necessary on merits. Conclusivearguments had already been advanced against the early introductionof a third television programme; and an enquiry would be unlikely to yield practicable recommendations about the control of the profits of the programme contractors, which were liable, in any event, to normal taxation and, so far as the original contractors were concerned,could be defended on the basis of the financial risks which they had accepted and the heavy losses which they had initially suffered.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of advantage appeared to lie in refraining from appointingan independent committee of enquiry at the present stage. It wouldbe for consideration, at the appropriate time, whether the B.B.C.&apos;sCharter should be extended to 1964 in order to enable the future ofthe Corporation and of the I.T.A. to be considered simultaneously bya single enquiry, which might also examine, if necessary, the problemsoutlined in C. (58) 159. Meanwhile, if it was not possible to deferan announcement about the introduction of a third television programme, it should suffice to indicate that, in the light of the manycompeting claims on the resources available for investment, theGovernment were satisfied that there was as yet no case for theinstitution of an additional programme. Any announcement should,however, be deferred until after the adjournment of Parliament.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to defer the appointment of an independent committeeto enquire into the future of the B.B.C. and the I.T.A. andother problems of broadcasting policy.(2) Authorised the Postmaster-General to announce, if necessary,that the Government were satisfied that there was atpresent no case for introducing an additional television programme.2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Home Secretary(C. (58) 164) to which were attached appendices, prepared by thePostmaster-General, on the technical implications of televising theState Opening of Parliament or, alternatively, making a colour filmof this ceremony.The Home Secretary said that, although these appendicessuggested that there would be no insuperable difficulty in the way of either course, a colour film would demand a greater intensity of lighting than television and would be liable to cause considerablediscomfort to Her Majesty The Queen and the other persons attending the ceremony. In effect, therefore, the issue for decision was whetherthe Opening of Parliament should, or should not, be televised.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Confidential soundings of the Governments supporters had indicated that they were divided about the desirability of televisingthe ceremony. In particular, there was some opposition to theproposal to televise the proceedings in the House of Lords Chamberon the ground that this might establish a precedent for televising theordinary business of Parliament.(b) On the other hand it should be possible to maintain a validdistinction between the State Opening of Parliament and the routineproceedings in both Houses on the ground that the former had alwaysconstituted a public occasion.(c) The Government should not appear to be falling behindpublic opinion, which was increasingly in favour of televising thisceremony.(d) If the proposal was approved, the arrangements should bemade by the British Broadcasting Corporation.(e) A consequential request from the Press for permission to takestill photographs in the House of Lords Chamber might be conceded,so long as the facilities installed for this purpose were restricted to aminimum and that no camera flashes were involved.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that it would be desirable that facilities should be given to the British Broadcasting corporation for televising the forthcoming Opening of Parliament.
middle east.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 64thConclusions,Minute 3.)Baghdad Pact.Iraq.*3. The Cabinet reviewed the latest developments in the situationin the Middle East.The Foreign Secretary said that, at the meeting of the Council ofthe Baghdad Pact on the previous day, the United States Governmenthad undertaken to co-operate with the members of the Pact for their security and defence and to enter promptly into special agreementsdesigned to give effect to this co-operation. This undertaking, whichhad been incorporated in the public declaration signed by all thecountries represented at the meeting, in effect made the United Statesa full member of the Baghdad Pact.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of this statement.The Foreign Secretary said that future relations with the new regime in Iraq had been discussed with the United States and themembers of the Baghdad Pact on the previous day. Therepresentatives of Pakistan, Persia and Turkey had indicated, of theirown accord, that their Governments were in favour of recognising thenew Iraqi Government. The United States Government also sharedthis view. The Federal German Government intended to recognise the new regime on the following day and the other members of theNorth Atlantic Alliance were likely to take similar action in the nearfuture.In considering whether we should formally recognise the new regime in Iraq we must weigh our natural sympathies with the formerKing and Government against the realities of the present situation.Although the new Government contained certain liberal elements, itincluded also a number of supporters of Rashid Ali who had sidedwith Nazi Germany in the last war. Moreover, the new PrimeMinister might prove unable to control the more extreme membersof the revolutionary movement. On the other hand, in view of theBritish commercial interests which were involved, it was in our interest that there should be a stable Government in Iraq, capable ofmaintaining law and order throughout the country. The new government appeared, so far, to have the full support of the Armyand to be concerned to maintain existing commercial and culturalcontacts between this country and Iraq. In short, there appeared tobe no legal or practical justification for withholding recognition. Thenew Government, by indicating their intention to honour theirinternational obligations, had satisfied the requirement which hadusually been regarded in the past as one of the normal tests foraccording recognition.In discussion there was general agreement that, despite thebrutalities which had accompanied the coupd&apos;etat in Iraq, the national interest of the United Kingdom would best be served by according full recognition to the new regime. This action would not connoteapproval of the new Government; but the re-establishment of regulardiplomatic relations might enable us to exercise greater influence over*Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.C.C. 65 (58)(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would seek The Queen&apos;consent to this proposal.(3) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the Ministerof Works and the Postmaster-General to invite the formalapproval of the Lord Great Chamberlain and to concertthe necessary arrangements with him.(4) Agreed that, subject to The Queen&apos;s consent and the-concurrence of the Lord Great Chamberlain, a suitableannouncement should be made in Parliament on 31st July.
Meeting of heads of governments.The Foreign Secretary said that in his latest messageMr. Khrushchev had reverted to his original proposal for a Five-power meeting of Heads of Governments in Europe. In a brief discussionwith the United States Secretary of State on the previous day it hadbeen agreed that, despite the fact that the French government appeared to favour this suggestion, we should maintain our previousproposal for a meeting of Heads of Governments in New York withinthe framework of the United Nations. Mr. Dulles had now acceptedthe importance of attempting to reach, at this meeting, some limitedagreement covering the Middle East. It was proposed, therefore, tosuggest that the Permanent Representatives on the Security council should meet later that week with a view to making arrangements foran extraordinary session of the Council, to be attended by Heads of governments, on or about 12th August. If this suggestion was supported by the representatives of the United States and the UnitedKingdom and it was made clear that President Eisenhower and thePrime Minister would personally attend such a meeting, it would bedifficult for Mr. Khrushchev to reject the proposal.In discussion it was suggested that it would be important toemphasise in the reply that the use of the United Nations machineryon the lines proposed need not result in any delay in arranging ameeting attended by Heads of Governments and that the procedureenvisaged was sufficiently flexible to allow informal discussions between the representatives of the main Powers outside the meetingsof the Security Council. The United States Government, however,were now unwilling to agree that India should be given any specialstatus in the proposed meetings, in view of the difficulty ofdistinguishing between the claims of India and of the many othercountries which had already applied to participate formally in theproposed extraordinary session of the Security Council. The PrimeMinister of India might not be prepared to accept an invitation toparticipate only in the informal discussions.The Cabinet -(4) Invited the Foreign Secretary to prepare a reply for the PrimeMinister to send to the latest letter from Mr. Khrushchevon the lines proposed in their discussion.(5) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary, to give further consideration to thesituation resulting from the reluctance of the United StatesGovernment to agree that India should be given anyspecial status at the proposed extraordinary meeting of theSecurity Council.their future policies. It would be preferable, however, that our formalact of recognition should follow, rather than precede, recognition bysome of our other Allies, particularly the members of the BaghdadPact, who would in any event need to be consulted further about thefuture position of the Arab Union. This arrangement would alsoafford us time to explain our action to King. Hussein and theGovernment of Jordan.The formal grant of recognition to a new regime was not subjectto Parliamentary approval. It might, however, be desirable for someadvance notification of the Governments intention to be given totheir supporters.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that, at the appropriate time, formal recognitionshould be accorded to the new regime in Iraq.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to decide, in the light of the considerations which had emerged during their discussion,when this action should be taken.
development areas.(previous reference:CC. (57) 57thConclusions,Minute 6.)CC. 65 (58)4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister ofLabour (C. (58) 169) to which were appended:  (i) at Annex A, a copy of a Parliamentary statement to be madeby the President of the Board of Trade, defining the more stringent policy which it was proposed to introduce asregards the issue of Industrial Development Certificatesand indicating the circumstances in which financialassistance would be provided to industry under theDistribution of Industry (Industrial Finance) Act; and(ii) at Annex B, a list of the areas which would be regarded aseligible for financial assistance of this kind.The Minister of Labour said that an announcement on theselines had been approved by the Sub-Committee of the economic policy Committee, of which he was Chairman, as a result of their discussion of the action required to alleviate the exceptionally high level of unemployment in certain areas. There were objections topublishing a list of such areas; but, since the Government would undoubtedly be compelled by Parliamentary pressure to disclose the items in this list piecemeal, the balance of advantage appeared to lie in publishing it in its entirety forthwith.In discussion some doubt was expressed about the desirability of publicly identifying certain areas as being liable to suffer a persistentlyhigh level of unemployment. The population of the areas defined in annex B to C (58) 169 represented no more than some 7 per cent,of the total population of the country and it was undesirable to create an impression that the unemployment to which they were at presentsubject was likely to be incurable or represented a serious deterioration in the general health of the economy as a whole. Itwould be preferable, therefore, that the list of these areas should be accompanied by a statement on rather more positive lines, whichwould not refer specifically to the statutory criterion of eligibility forassistance under the Distribution of Industry (Industrial Finance) Act,but would indicate that, while it might be necessary to adopt a morecritical attitude towards the issue of Industrial DevelopmentCertificates in future, this policy would be supplemented by theprovision of appropriate financial inducements in certain areas on thelines envisaged in the Act.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Labour to arrange for the draft parliamentary statement annexed to C. (58) 169 to be revised on the lines indicated in their discussion.(2) Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to make this statement, as revised under Conclusion (1), on 30th July.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th July, 1958.
