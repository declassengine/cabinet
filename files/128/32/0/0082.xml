Parliament.parliamentary business.parliamentary procedure.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 66thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Home Secretary said that, in agreement with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, he proposed to suggest, in his forthcoming evidence to the Select Committee on Parliamentary Procedure, that theCommittee Stage of the Finance Rill should henceforward be taken inStanding Committee.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement.Ghana.(previous reference:CC. (58) 81stConclusions,Minute 9.)2. The Cabinet were informed that, although the PrimeMinisters of Ghana and Guinea had now publicly declared their intention to promote some form of political association between theirtwo countries, the implications of this proposal did not appear tohave been worked out in any detail. The lines on which this projectwould develop were, therefore, uncertain; and in any parliamentary statement which it might be necessary to make about it in the nearfuture it would be desirable to emphasise that the complex issues which were involved could not profitably be considered until thescope and nature of the proposal had been clarified.Defence.(previous reference:CC. (58) 64thConclusions,Minute 1.)integration of NATOAir Defence.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Defence (C. (58) 242) on the integration of air defence inthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).The Minister of Defence said that the Defence Committee had agreed that the organisation of NATO air defence on a territorialbasis was no longer realistic and that it would be to our advantage to accept in principle the plan of the Supreme Allied Commander,Europe (SACEUR) to establish an integrated air defence system.This system would be organised in a number of regions; and, sincethe United Kingdom would constitute a self-contained region, thenew arrangements should not greatly affect our control over ourown system of air defence. But delicate political considerations were involved in making any change in the established system under whichthe air defence of this country was the sole responsibility of theUnited Kingdom Government; and, if we accepted the new arrangements proposed by SACEUR, it would be important that weshould be able to demonstrate publicly that we remained free todetermine the size, composition and deployment of the air defence units which we assigned to him. In endorsing SACEUR&apos;sproposals, therefore, we should enter a specific reservation that it was our policy to confine such fighter and missile defence as might beprovided in this country to the defence of the deterrent, progressivelyto reduce our fighter force and to deploy missile defence only on an experimental scale until further experience had been gained. On this basis it should be possible to present the new arrangements in a manner acceptable to Parliament and public opinion.In discussion there was general agreement that, despite the safeguards which it was proposed to incorporate in the new arrangements, public attention would concentrate on the statement that &quot; national air defence units assigned to SACEUR will be placed under his operational command and control in peace and war.&quot;Whatever dispositions might become necessary in war, it would bedifficult to justify publicly the transfer to SACEUR of operationalcommand over our air defences in peace, particularly since we werethe only European member of NATO possessing a nuclear deterrentof our own.   SACEUR would no doubt agree that we occupied an
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, suggested thatthe objections to SA.CEUR&apos;s proposal might be overcome if a distinction was explicitly drawn between the degree of authority which he would enjoy in peace and in war. It should be made clearthat the control which he would exercise in peacetime, in addition to being subject to the proposed safeguards about the size, composition and deployment of assigned forces, would be no more than was required to enable him to plan the integration of those forces whichwould be essential to secure their maximum efficiency in war.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Defence to endeavour to arrange that the proposals put forward by the Supreme allied commander, Europe, for the establishment of an integratedair defence system in the North Atlantic Treaty organisation should be so amended as to make it clear that the operational authority which SACEUR would exercise overforces assigned to him for this purpose in peace would belimited to the planning and organisation of their effectiveintegration in war.social investment.(previous reference:CC. (58) 73rdConclusions,Minute 5.)Education.4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Education and the Secretary of State for Scotland (C (58) 239and 240) covering draft White Papers setting out the governments proposals for a new drive in education.The Minister of Education said that he had now agreed withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer a five-year programme of majorschool building amounting to about  300 millions in total, togetherwith an augmented programme of minor works. The decision topermit educational investment on this scale made it possible to announce a realistic forward policy for education on the linesdescribed in the White Papers.In discussion the following main points were made:  (a) Paragraphs 13-21 of the draft White Paper for England andWales contained references to the value of comprehensive schoolswhich might expose the Government to political embarrassment. Onthe other hand, these paragraphs also reaffirmed two of the main principles of the Governmenfs educational policy the importanceof the steady improvement of secondary modern schools and the conception of the education service as one to be administered bylocal education authorities with the maximum freedom to adaptdevelopment to local needs. The balance of advantage appeared,therefore, to lie in retaining this passage in the text but reconsideringthe drafting, particularly in paragraphs 15-18.(b) Paragraph 23 indicated that a limit was to be retained on thetotal volume of minor capital works which local education authorities would be allowed to undertake but that the maximum cost of individual projects of this kind which could be authorised by theauthorities in their own discretion would be raised from  10,000 to 20,000. It could be argued that the converse would be preferable to retain the  10,000 limit but to abolish the restriction on theaggregate of minor works to be allowed.    But the additionalexceptional position and that his main objective was to secure the integration of air defence in continental Europe. But he would in*probably resist any substantial amendment of his proposals on the W*ground that the other member countries in NATO, particularlyFrance, would refuse to accept arrangements in which we declined to share. These considerations must, however, be weighed againstthe political criticism to which the Government would be exposedif they formally accepted the proposal that SACEUR should assumeoperational command over the air defence system of the UnitedKingdom in peacetime.
commercial policy.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 71stConclusions,Minute 4.)Horticulture.5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Agriculture and the President of the Board of Trade (C. (58) 241and 243) about the protection of the horticultural industry.The Minister of Agriculture said that the tariff represented themeans by which it had been accepted that the Government would giveeffect to their pledge to maintain adequate incomes for those engagedin horticulture. The horticultural tariffs had, however, remained unchanged since 1953; and, in the light of recent increases incomparative costs in the United Kingdom and in other countries,some increase was now desirable. The Tariff Advisory Committeehad, however, rejected five applications for tariff increases; and their decision had been endorsed by the Economic Policy Committee. Ifit was to be put into effect, it would be necessary to devise some alternative means of implementing the Governments undertakings to the industry.   This would probably involve the introduction of a 2 millions which it had been agreed should be devoted to minor works in education should go far towards satisfying immediate needs, andany further relaxation could not be reconciled with the Governmenfsprogramme for public investment as a whole.(c) Paragraph 32 referred to the Governmenfs intention to initiate discussions with the authorities concerned with denomination-tional schools, with a view to introducing amending legislation toenable the Churches to take part in the new and enlarged programme,of school building. It would be premature, however, to arouseexpectations that legislation on this subject would be introduced during the current session; and the sentence should be so redrafted asto avoid any commitment on this point.(d) Paragraph 17 of the draft White Paper for Scotland referredto the Governmenfs decision to grant indefinite deferment from national Service to all trained teachers. Although this decision was of less importance in relation to England and Wales, it should be mentioned in both White Papers.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thedraft White Papers should now be amended on the lines agreed in discussion and should thereafter be published at the earliestconvenient opportunity. The moderate terms in which they weredrafted and the empirical approach which they adopted might result,to some extent, in their attracting less public attention than theydeserved. Special attention should therefore be given to ensuring the maximum publicity for them.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of Labour,the Minister of Education and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, to give further consideration to the drafting of the White Papers annexed to C. (58) 239and 240 in the light of the points made in their discussion.(2) Subject to such further amendment as might be required under Conclusion (1) above, approved the draft white papers on educational policy and invited the Secretary ofState for Scotland and the Minister of Education to publish them at the earliest convenient opportunity.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland andthe Minister of Education, to make arrangements for appropriate publicity to be given to these White Papers.
system of production grants similar to those adopted for agriculture,together with some reorganisation of the arrangements for marketingand distributing horticultural products. A scheme of this kind,would, however, provide the interests concerned with a new meansof exerting pressure on the Government; and it would therefore be preferable that in at least two cases (tomatoes and cut flowers) theapplication for a tariff increase should be granted.In discussion it was emphasised that the Government would be exposed to serious political embarrassment if they failed to implement the pledges which they had givens and frequently reaffirmed, to the horticultural industry. There were, however, no economic grounds for conceding a tariff increase in any of the five pending applications,particularly since the unprofitability of the horticultural industry wasthe result not of unfair competition from imported products but ofthe relative inefficiency of our own producers. Moreover, it wouldbe anomalous to increase protection in one sector of the economyat a time when, in the context of the Free Trade Area negotiations,we were seeking to reduce protection in general; and an increase inthe horticultural tariffs would be particularly unwelcome to the Dutchinterests who were our most reliable supporters in those negotiations.Finally, an increase in the tariff on tomatoes might significantly affectthe cost-of-living index; and it would be inopportune, in terms ofwages policy, that the Government should be seen to be taking actionwhich was liable to increase the cost of living. For these reasons it would be preferable that any further support for the horticulturalindustry should be provided in the form of increased assistance fromthe Exchequer rather than by means of an increase in tariffs.On the other hand, it would be inadvisable to announce thatthe Government were considering arrangements to enable theindustry to improve its competitive efficiency until it had been ascertained that a scheme for this purpose would be practicable and could be implemented without imposing an undue buiden on theExchequer. Some sectors of the industry were more profitable than others; and any proposals for financial assistance to horticulturewould need to be considered in terms of their impact upon theindustry as a whole.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, in thelight of the strong objections to an increase in tariffs, it would be advisable to explore alternative means of assisting the horticulturalindustry. Proposals for this purpose might need to be discussedprivately with representatives of the industry. But they should notbe publicly announced until they had been approved by the Cabinet;and, since they would help to offset the unfavourable effect of thedecision to reject the five pending applications for an increase in tariffs, the announcement of that decision should be deferred untilthe new scheme had been worked out.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to prepare, as a matter of urgency, a scheme for providing financial assistance tohorticulture on a basis similar to that adopted in the caseof agriculture.(2) Agreed that, subject to the result of the enquiry to be madeunder Conclusion (1), the pending applications for increases in horticultural tariffs should preferably be rejected, but that no announcement of their rejectionshould be made until it had been ascertained whetheralternative means of support for the horticultural industry could be devised.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,25th November, 1958.
