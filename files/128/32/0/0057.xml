CC. 57 (58)*Middle East. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that, in the light of(Previous        their previous discussion, he had sent a further message to PresidentReference:      Eisenhower indicating that we would support the United StatesCC. (58) 56th   Government, both politically and, if they wished, physically, in their conclusions.)   proposal to intervene with military force in the Lebanon.   But hehad also emphasised that we now regarded the conflict in the Lebanonas only one aspect of a critical situation which was developingthroughout the Middle East and that we hoped we could rely on theco-operation of the United States in any measures which might become necessary to restore the position in Jordan and Iraq.The United States Government had now launched the operation against the Lebanon and intended to land American troops, withoutBritish military support, at 1 p.m. that day. They proposed to informthe Security Council of this action at an emergency meeting that morning, when they would propose the establishment of a united nations force in the Lebanon to which the United States force couldtransfer responsibility for the maintenance of peace and order in thearea. But they had given no detailed consideration to the situationin Jordan and they would be unable to offer, until later in the day,considered comment on our suggestion that King Hussein should beinvited urgently to make a formal request for United States and united Kingdom military assistance to maintain the integrity of jordan.Meanwhile the situation in Iraq remained confused. Theinsurrection appeared to be confined to Baghdad; and according toan unconfirmed rumour Nuri es-Said had escaped. We had warned the Rulers in Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar to be on their guard againstattempted insurrection in their territories; and we were taking such steps as were possible to secure the protection of British lives and property in the Lebanon during the disturbed period which was likelyto follow the landing of United States forces.In discussion it was agreed that the initial response of the UnitedStates Government to our proposal for immediate action in Jordanwas disappointing. We were entitled, under the Charter of theUnited Nations, to give King Hussein the assurance, for which hehad asked, that we would give him such military assistance as hejudged to be necessary for the preservation of the integrity and theindependence of his Kingdom. It was also desirable, however, thatwe should give effect to this assurance by establishing a military force in Jordan as rapidly as possible, before the King could beoverthrown or the United Nations had occasion to adopt a resolutioncondemning the despatch of any further military reinforcements tothe Middle East. In taking such action we should need to have thepractical support and co-operation of the United States Government,since we should be exposed to grave risks if the United States forcein the Lebanon was withdrawn after a temporary occupation andwe were left to deal alone with the situation in Jordan and Iraq.It would be undesirable, therefore, to incur a definite commitment to King Hussein until it became clear, later in the day, whether theUnited States Government had resolved the legal and political difficulties which appeared to inhibit them for the moment from joining us in giving the assurance for which the King had asked. but all possible action should be taken in the interim to encourage theKing to stand firm in order to reduce the danger of an insurrectionand the risk that the Government of Israel might be tempted to intervene. The Chiefs of Staff were examining the means by whichwe could provide military assistance to Jordan; we had asked theGovernment of Israel to acquiesce in our over-flying Israeli territory in order to reinforce Jordan; and the forces allocated to this task
3B4were now ready to move from Cyprus to Amman within a few hours.Moreover, as soon as it became known in the Middle East that UnitedStates forces had landed in the Lebanon, the dissident elements in jordan might seek to overthrow the Government. King Husseinshould therefore be warned forthwith of the United Statesintervention in the Lebanon. He should also be informed of theterms in which he would best frame an appeal to the United Statesand ourselves for military assistance, since the form of appealappropriate to circumstances in which the Government of Jordanapprehended a threat to the integrity of the country would need tobe varied, if the appeal was to be related to circumstances in which an insurrection had already broken out.It was to our advantage that King Hussein, though now theHead of the Arab Union, had implied that, if he appealed formilitary assistance, he would do so only in respect of Jordan. Itwould not necessarily be wise that we should become involved in an indefinite commitment to restore the regime in Iraq. nevertheless we must take such steps as were open to us to protect British lives and property in that country. It might not be feasible to reinforce the station at Habbaniya which, though occupied by some 900technical personnel of the Royal Air Force and still in wirelesscommunication with the United Kingdom, was being closely watchedby the rebel forces. But we should warn the insurgents in Baghdadthat we should hold them, responsible for injury or damage suffered by British lives and property; and it was for consideration whethera statement in Parliament to this effect would suffice or whether weshould use the good offices of a friendly Government to convey this message.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Attorney-General to consider the terms in whichKing Hussein of Jordan might be invited to make a formalappeal for military assistance from the United StatesGovernment and ourselves on the alternative hypothesesthat: -(i) the appeal would relate to circumstances in which theGovernment of Jordan apprehended a threat to the integrity of the country;(ii) it  would  relate  to   circumstances  in   which   aninsurrection against the Government had actuallybroken out.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider further the most appropriate means of warning the insurgents in Baghdadthat we should hold them responsible for any injury or damage sustained by British lives and property.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting in the light of the expected reply from the United StatesGovernment about their attitude towards the request byKing Hussein for an assurance that he could rely, ifnecessary, on military support from the United Statesand the United Kingdom.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th July, 1958.
