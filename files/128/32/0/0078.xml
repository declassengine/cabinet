83CC. 78 (58)EconomicSituation.(previous reference :CC. (58) 77thConclusions,Minute 9.)*The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memorandum(C. (58) 211) which the Chancellor of the Exchequer bad circulated on the current position and forward prospects of the national economy.There was general agreement that the Government would faceserious political embarrassment if unemployment rose significantlyabove the level of 500,000. It seemed likely that, in any event, itwould not fall far below this figure during 1959, apart from theperiod of seasonally high employment in the summer. In particular,there were some grounds for believing that the recovery in the UnitedStates might be relatively short-lived; and the prospects for international commodity prices indicated that the primary producing countries would provide only an indifferent market for our exports in 1959. It was therefore essential that measures should beintroduced forthwith to counter, as far as possible, the prospective increase in unemployment to a level of some 625,000 during thewinter. In selecting the measures for this purpose it would benecessary to guard against the risk that they might revive inflationary pressure and undermine the relative stability of prices which had nowbeen achieved. It would also be important to avoid imposing a freshstrain on the balance of payments which might provoke a decline of the present confidence in sterling and precipitate an exchangecrisis which could not be easily or rapidly overcome. On the otherhand, it was less difficult in principle to restrain an expansionarytendency which threatened to become excessive than to revive the impetus in an economy in which production was stagnant andindustrial confidence had been shaken. Although the Governmenthad already taken a number of measures designed to preserve the momentum of production, these must now be supplemented by further measures which should be judged primarily by their capacity to take rapid effect and to exert a significant impact, both functionallyand geographically, on those sectors of the economy which were most adversely affected by the present recession.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) The only immediate stimulus which could be applied toinvestment in the public sector would be a further reduction inBank Rate. This possibility should be considered when thecircumstances were technically favourable.(b) There was some reason to believe that the effective operationof the recent Distribution of Industry (Industrial Finance) Act wasbeing impeded by failure of the Development Areas (TreasuryAdvisory) Committee to deal promptly with the proposals submittedto them. The procedures adopted by the Committee should be reviewed as a matter of urgency. There might also be advantage inappointing an individual (on the analogy of the Commissioner forthe Special Areas under earlier legislation) who would be given direct responsibility for ensuring that the provisions of the Act were putinto effect as vigorously as possible.(c) A selective expansion of building in the public sector should now be undertaken. The building programme for the Armed forces might be re-examined from this point of view; plans for the new towns, slum clearance, and building for special needs (e.g., homes for old persons) might be accelerated; and other projects, such aswater and sewerage schemes, might be brought forward. But theGovernment might not obtain the necessary co-operation from localauthorities unless they substituted, for the restrictive circular issued in the autumn of the previous year, a new directive indicating that local authority plans for building expansion would now receive more* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
favourable consideration. A reduction in the interest rate charged by the Public Works Loans Board would be a valuable psychologicalreinforcement.(d) An increase in educational building would take longer to exert an effect on the economy; and, if starts of school buildingwere increased, it would not be possible thereafter to hold school building at a steady level unless starts were reduced again in later years a step which it would be difficult to reconcile with theGovernments policy for a forward drive in education. It should,however, be possible to bring forward certain minor w^orks whichwould take effect more rapidly and could be curtailed again at alater stage without damage to the Governmenfs educational policy,provided that the main school-building programme could thereafterproceed at an adequate pace.(e) The depression in the steel industry seemed to be largely due to recent de-stocking, particularly by the major users of steel.An approach should be made to the oil companies and other majorusers and exporters of steel to induce them to begin to accumulatefresh stocks as rapidly as possible. In the interests of the exporttrade as well as of the steel industry an effort should also be madeto ensure that the supplies of steel required for constructionalcontracts overseas would be delivered as rapidly as possible, on thebasis that, if necessary, we would make finance temporarily availablein order to enable the purchasers to hold stocks for a rather longer period than they would ordinarily do.(/) The investment programmes of the nationalised industries should be re-examined, in order to ascertain how far a selectiveacceleration would contribute to a recovery of production in theheavy industries; and the re-equipment programme of the armed forces should be reviewed for the same purpose.(g) The production of commercial vehicles had suffered a sharpdecline. Special consideration should be given to the possibility ofproviding a fresh stimulus here.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwas important that the Government should adopt a calm, butdetermined, attitude towards the increase in unemployment. Therewere signs that industrial confidence was beginning to revive, andthe Government should avoid creating the impression that theyforesaw a major depression. At the same time they must be seen to be taking the initiative in introducing positive and vigorousmeasures designed to meet the situation which was likely to develop in the months immediately ahead. It was unfortunate that, at a timewhen it might be necessary to stimulate employment by selectiveincreases in Government expenditure, the form of the Budgetaccounts made it difficult to justify reductions in taxation withoutcorresponding reductions in expenditure. The presentation adoptedin the annual Financial Statement should be re-examined before theBudget.There was clearly a strong case for abolishing the remainingcontrols over hire purchase; and the other suggestions which hadbeen made during the Cabinefs two discussions should be further examined as a matter of urgency. Departments should not be askedto apply initially too meticulous a criterion: they could be invitedto submit any proposals which would create employment: it couldbe left to the Treasury to select those which would exert a rapidimpact on those sectors of the economy which were particularly affected by the recession. It would also be desirable that all departments should receive a fresh directive defining the objectives of the Governmenfs economic policy, both in the short term and inthe long term. Finally, a detailed plan of action should be prepared,which would allocate responsibility for further action on the various
proposals which had been put forward. In the light of this plan,the Cabinet should keep the situation under regular review on thebasis of periodical reports from the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet -(1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to announce as rapidly as possible that the remaining hire-purchasecontrols would be abolished.(2) Agreed that the power to re-impose hire-purchase controlsshould be retained in the forthcoming Emergency Laws(Repeal) Bill.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, whatadministrative arrangements should be made to ensurethat appropriate action was urgently taken on the various suggestions which had been advanced in the cabinets discussion.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulateperiodical reports on developments in the economy.cabinet Office, S.W.1,27th October, 1958.
