middle east.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 61stConclusions.)Meeting of heads ofGovernment.Lebanon.Iraq.*1. The Prime Minister said that, as a result of discussions withCongressional leaders, the United States Government had felt unableto take the initiative in proposing, at the meeting of the security council on the previous day, that an extraordinary session of theCouncil, attended by Heads of Governments, should be convened todiscuss the situation in the Middle East. They had, however,indicated that, if the North Atlantic Alliance favoured such a discussion in principle, they would support a proposal by the UnitedKingdom that it should take place in the Security Council. It wastherefore proposed that the Foreign Secretary, in opening the debate on foreign affairs in the House of Commons that afternoon, shouldoutline the advantages of a meeting of Heads of Governments in theSecurity Council and should indicate that a proposal for such ameeting would constitute our formal reply to Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s letter.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that our proposal hadbeen endorsed by the other members of the Commonwealth. Butthe Government would inevitably be questioned, during theParliamentary debate, about the extent to which any special positionwould be accorded to India at the extraordinary meeting of theSecurity Council. It would be inadvisable to offer any firmundertaking on this point since the attendance of an Indianrepresentative would necessarily depend on the agreement of theother countries concerned. It could, however, be stated that the flexibility of the proposed procedure would allow other countries,such as India, to be associated with the discussions, either formally orinformally.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal that the Prime Ministers reply toMr. Khrushchev&apos;s letter should suggest that the situationin the Middle East should be discussed at an extraordinarymeeting of the Security Council, to be attended by Headsof Governments.The Foreign Secretary said that it seemed likely that a newPresident of the Lebanon would be elected in the near future, andthat there was some risk that he would request the immediatewithdrawal of the United States forces. Our wisest course, therefore,might be to propose that the Lebanon should enjoy a neutral statussimilar to that of Austria and to seek international recognition of thisarrangement while the American forces were still established in the lebanon. It might be advisable to indicate, during theParliamentary debate that afternoon, that the objective of Westernintervention in the Lebanon was to promote a settlement on theselines.The Cabinet (2) Took note, with approval, of this statement.The Foreign Secretary said that it might also be necessary to define our attitude towards the new Government in Iraq. The reportsindicated that, after the initial outbreak of violence, order had been restored throughout the country and that the new Government werein control of the situation. H.M. Ambassador at Baghdad had beengiven an assurance that compensation would be paid for the damage done to the British Embassy and that the families of British residentswould be allowed to leave the country if they wished. The new government also seemed anxious to maintain existing cultural and commercial relations with this country. It would be inadvisable,therefore, to take any precipitate action which might provokeretaliation against our oil interests in Iraq, and the right course in the* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annexe.53860-4
short term would be to accept the present position and to indicate ^that our future attitude would depend on the policy adopted by the \j;new Government.In discussion it was recognised that, while an interim statement on these lines was desirable, more detailed consideration would need to be given to our relations with the new Government of Iraq,particularly in terms of the Iraqi balances held in this country andthe export of arms to Iraq. These issues should be studied by a small group of Ministers who would report their recommendations to theCabinet.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that our interim attitude towards the new government of Iraq should be as proposed by the foreign secretary.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for a small group of Ministers to examine our future policy towardsIraq in greater detail.Kuwait. The Minister of Defence said that our plans for protecting our oil interests in Kuwait had had to be revised in view of the objections raised by the Government of Israel to our overflying their territory.Any military assistance to Kuwait might now need to be based onBahrein, and it would therefore be desirable to move to that area theparachute battalion, which was standing-by in Cyprus, and thenecessary transport aircraft.In discussion it was agreed that, although it would be preferable,from the purely military point of view, to establish a British force in kuwait with the agreement of the Ruler before an insurrection broke out, it would be inadvisable to embarrass the Ruler at this juncture bypressing him to agree to such an arrangement. The necessaryredeployment of our forces to meet the situation should therefore be examined by the Defence Committee.The Cabinet (5) Invited the Minister of Defence to submit to the DefenceCommittee revised proposals for the redeployment ofBritish forces required to meet any threat to the securityof Kuwait.territorial waters.(previous reference:CC. (58) 50thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C. (58) 156) on the tactics to be adopted at the nextinternational discussion on the law of the sea, together with amemorandum by the Minister of Defence (C. (58) 162) on the rightof innocent passage for military aircraft over territorial waters.The Lord Chancellor said that a Committee, under his chairmanship, had given further consideration to the questionwhether we should support the proposal that the General Assemblyof the United Nations should convene a further conference on the breadth of territorial waters and exclusive fishery limits, on whichthe recent Geneva Conference on the Law of the Sea had failed toreach agreement. The Committee had concluded that, if a further conference were held and adequate steps were taken to obtain thesupport of friendly nations, there was a reasonable chance that wecould secure agreement to a six-mile limit to the territorial sea. But,if no conference were held, we should be bound to be confronted witha series of unilateral claims to a twelve-mile territorial sea, whichwould before long become recognised in international law as hardlyless valid than a convention. In neither case did there seem any hope
of securing rights of innocent passage for military aircraft overterritorial waters, except possibly by means of bilateral agreements with coastal States in the areas with which we were especiallyconcerned.The Committee had also considered whether we should try toensure that fishery questions were discussed separately from the breadth of territorial waters on a regional basis. While this would materially increase the chances of securing agreement to a six-mile limit to the territorial sea, there was some danger that a regional&apos;agreement in one area of the world on exclusive fishery limits of twelve miles or more would be regarded as a determining precedent in other regions where narrower limits were to both our interest andjustified by local conditions. The Committee had therefore agreed,as a compromise, that we should seek to secure a resolution from theGeneral Assembly that the next conference should be restricted to the breadth of territorial waters and, without specific reference to regionalfishery conferences, that member States should seek to negotiatemultilateral or bilateral agreements on fishery questions.In discussion it was pointed out that international agreement ona six-mile limit to the territorial sea without the right of innocentpassage for military aircraft would debar us from access to theMediterranean through the Straits of Gibraltar, to Aden and to singapore. If, as was suggested, any attempt to preserve rights of passage for military aircraft involved a serious risk that such rights would, on the contrary, be expressly excluded from any conventionagreed, we should be in a stronger position if no conference were held and no international agreement were reached, since we should thenbe able to challenge unilateral claims to twelve-mile territorial waters.On the other hand, such claims would soon become recognised asvalid in international law. Moreover, it was unrealistic to hope thatthe present three-mile limit to territorial waters could be maintained,and the choice therefore lay between a six-mile and a twelve-mile territory sea with no rights of innocent passage preserved, in either case, for military aircraft. In the circumstances, the best coursewould be to seek to secure a six-mile territorial sea and thereafter torest on a quasi-prescriptive right, based on long usage, to overfly itwhere necessary. A decision whether to adopt this course or to reserve our position on the passage of military aircraft in the context of any Convention which we might ultimately sign could, however,be deferred.In further discussion doubt was expressed whether it would beto our advantage to endeavour to separate the question of exclusive fishing rights from the question of the breadth of territorial waters.The proposal of the United States Government at the geneva conference, that a six-mile limit should be adopted for the territorial sea and that exclusive fishing rights should be conceded in anadditional six miles subject to the preservation of historic rights, hadlinked these two questions and had secured considerable support. Itmight therefore be possible, by adequate discussions with friendlycountries in advance, to obtain the necessary majority for thisproposal at the next conference. On the other hand, if this attemptfailed, it was likely that the conference would agree to a twelve-mile territory sea, which would be no less damaging to our fishery intereststhan the expected effect of a series of regional fishery conferences and far more damaging to our defence interests.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion seemed to be in favour of the compromise proposedby the Lord Chancellors Committee, namely, that we should seek theviews of friendly countries on the proposal that the General Assembly
3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C. (58) 160) on the Defence Regulations and otheremergency enactments which still remained in force.The Lord Chancellor said that the Emergency legislation committee and the Home Affairs Committee had reviewed theemergency powers which were still in force. The object of the reviewhad been, first, to dispense with as many of these controls as possible and, second, to delimit the powers which must be retained in such away as to ensure that existing indispensable controls could continueto be exercised but no new ones could be introduced without fresh legislation. The draft Bill annexed to C. (58) 160 would repeal mostof the emergency legislation on which the Defence Regulations atpresent depended; it would provide that certain specified regulations should remain in force by virtue of the Bill itself; it would restrict thepurposes for which these Regulations might be used in future to thepurposes for which they were used now; it would continue the powers conferred by emergency legislation on the Minister of Supply; and itwould extend that Ministers powers to enable him to undertaken on-military work at research and development establishments. the life of the Bill would be limited to five years. The Home AffairsCommittee recommended that legislation on these lines should beincluded among the main Bills for the 1958-59 session and that a white Paper explaining its effect should be presented early in the new session.Agreement had not been reached, however, on the questionwhether the Defence (Armed Forces) Regulations, which enabledtroops to be used in civil emergencies, should be continued in force by the Bill. It would be possible, as a compromise measure, to prolong these Regulations by an Emergency Laws (Continuance)Order in December 1958, without providing for their continuance inthe Bill. They would then remain effective throughout the greaterpart of the remaining life of the present Parliament but would automatically lapse when the Bill came into operation.Discussion showed that there was general agreement that legislation on the lines proposed by the Lord Chancellor, thoughundoubtedly controversial, should be promoted in the forthcoming session. Some doubt was expressed, however, whether it wasnecessary to continue the Defence (Armed Forces) Regulations. Ifit was essential to use troops in a strike, an emergency could beproclaimed under the Emergency Powers Act, 1920, and this procedure had been found adequate up to 1939. There were,moreover, political objections to extending the Regulations beyondDecember 1958. On the other hand, the use of troops in strikeswas now more acceptable to public opinion than before the war; andthe power to use them was of some psychological value in checkingEmergencyPowers.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 32ndConclusions,Minute 5.)should be invited to adopt a resolution limiting the next conference to the breadth of territorial waters and recommending member states to negotiate fishery agreements among themselves. We should not,however, commit ourselves to this course at the present stage; andin view of the problems connected with rights of passage for military aircraft and the arguments for and against separate discussion offishery questions, we should be free to reconsider our tactics, in thelight of the reactions of the Governments whom we consulted.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary, the Minister of Defence and the attorney-General, to approach the Governments of theUnited States, Commonwealth countries and friendlycountries in Europe on the lines agreed in their discussion.
Egypt.financial negotiations.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 53rdConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C. (58) 161), to which was annexed a memorandum by officials on the progress of the financial negotiations with the egyptian government together with a report of discussions held in Genevabetween a representative of the Treasury and the Governor of theNational Bank of Egypt.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in the course of these discussions, the Governor of the National Bank had indicated thathe would be willing to recommend to his principals a lump sumsettlement based on a payment of  35 millions by the egyptian government, on the understanding that the sequestration chargespayable on British property in Egypt would be increased. UnderEgyptian law the Sequestrator-General was entitled to levy a charge on the gross receipts from all property in his custody and on the pricesrealised from the sale of such property. We had not yet reached agreement with the Egyptian Government about the basis on whichthese charges should be calculated. But in the aggregate they couldamount to a considerable sum; and it was therefore to our advantage to seek to link the discharge of our liability on this account with the lump sum payment. Provided that the additional figure to be conceded in respect of the sequestration charges in the context of a lump sum payment of  35 millions was of the order of  2-3 millions and did not in any event exceed  5 millions, it should be possible toreach a final settlement with the Egyptian Government which wouldbe financially defensible. Such a settlement would, of course, be conditional on a parallel settlement of the outstanding claims by the shell Oil Company Limited in respect of their assets in Egypt.In discussion there was general agreement with this view. It wassuggested that in present circumstances there might be some advantage in protracting the negotiations in order that the financial settlement with the Government of Egypt might appear as only one item in themore comprehensive settlement of the political issues arising from thepresent situation in the Middle East which we hoped to achieve as aresult of the forthcoming discussions in the United Nations. On theother hand, we should not necessarily gain, and might possibly suffer,if we failed to take advantage of the apparent willingness of theEgyptian Government to settle the financial issues in the near future.C.C. 62 (58)industrial unrest. Moreover, it was necessary, from time to time, touse troops in circumstances e.g., civil disasters in which it wouldbe inappropriate, or ultra vires, to issue a proclamation under theEmergency Powers Act, 1920. In such circumstances officers of the armed Forces should not be subject to the risk that their orders mightbe legally challenged. But, if the Regulations were allowed to lapse,it would be more difficult to reinstate them by legislation for thispurpose alone than to retain them in the context of the proposed Bill.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of advantage appeared to lie in continuing the Defence(Armed Forces) Regulations in the proposed Bill.The Cabinet (1) Approved the introduction in the 1958-59 session of anEmergency Laws (Repeal) Bill on the lines of the draft annexed to C. (58) 160.(2) Agreed that a White Paper explaining the effect of the Billshould be presented early in the new session.(3) Agreed that the Defence (Armed Forces) Regulations shouldbe continued in force by the Bill.
On balance, therefore, it would be expedient that the possibilities ofa settlement on the lines indicated by the Chancellor of the exchequer should continue to be explored in further informal discussions,especially since, even if these discussions resulted in agreement inprinciple, the further period which must thereafter be allowed for the resumption of formal negotiations and the drafting of the definitiveagreement would allow us, if necessary, to reconsider our tactics.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forfurther informal discussions  to  be conducted  with  arepresentative of the Egyptian Government on the basis indicated in C. (58) 161.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd July, 1958.
