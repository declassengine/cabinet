Middle East.(previous reference :CC. (58) 58thConclusions,Minute 1.)53860-1B 2* The Cabinet had before them telegrams from H.M. Charged&apos;Affaires in Amman (Nos. 856 and 857) reporting that the King andPrime Minister of Jordan had made a formal request for the immediate despatch of British and United States forces to Jordan. The basis ofthis request was that Jordan was faced with an imminent attempt bythe United Arab Republic to create internal disorder and to overthrowthe regime, and that Jordan&apos;s territorial integrity was threatened bythe movement of Syrian forces towards her northern frontier and by.infiltration of arms across it. They- had reason to believe that aninsurrection fomented by the United Arab Republic would begin in thecourse of the following day, and they hoped that it would be possiblefor some British troops to arrive in Jordan in the early part of that day. The King and the Prime Minister had said that their requestfollowed the example of Lebanon and was based on the same grounds.They proposed to inform the Jordan Cabinet and members of the senate and Chamber of Deputies that the request had been made.The Cabinet were informed that the operation which had beenmounted for this purpose in Cyprus could be launched at short notice.If the movement was authorised at once, the first wave of British troops could arrive at Amman soon after 8 a.m. on 17th July. The build-up,to a strength of two battalions, could be completed in twenty-two hours. Further reinforcement could be provided, if necessary, by thedespatch of the Guards Brigade, which would bring the total numbers to more than 4,000 men. The tasks envisaged for this force were tohold the airfield at Amman, to safeguard the King and members of hisGovernment and to protect the main Government establishments inAmman. For these limited tasks it would be fully adequate. But itwould have relatively little mobility and no heavy weapons. It couldnot be deployed on the west bank or on the Syrian frontier, as theKing and Prime Minister of Jordan appeared to envisage. If a stateof disorder spread throughout the country it would not be ableto restore the position. And, if it were attacked by the whole strengthof the Jordan Army including its armour, it would not by itself be ableto maintain a prolonged resistance though in that event it could by day be given effective air support by fighters and bombers based onCyprus. The plan provided for a small number of fighters to accompany this force and to remain at Amman. There would be difficulties in operating a larger number of fighters from there, as therewas an acute shortage of petrol in Jordan and all supplies neededwould have to be brought in by air from Cyprus.The Cabinet were informed that there was reliable information,from secret sources, that an insurrection fomented by the United arab republic was to begin on 17th July. There was no reason to doubt theauthenticity of this information, though there could of course be no guarantee that the insurgents would in fact execute the orders whichthey had received.The Cabinet agreed that the first step must be to ascertain whatresponse the United States Government proposed to make tothe request which they had received from Jordan. Themeeting was adjourned in order to enable the Prime Ministerto consult the United States Secretary of State by telephone.When the meeting was resumed the Prime Minister informed theCabinet of the upshot of his conversation with Mr. Dulles. UnitedStates aircraft were to make a demonstration flight over Jordan onthe following day in the hope of discouraging potential insurgents.The United States Government would not be able to commit themselves to any joint military operations in Jordan until they hadan opportunity of consultation with Congressional leaders. they recognised, however, the need for urgent action; and, if the UnitedKingdom Government decided to respond at once to Jordan&apos;s request,
they would be ready to express publicly their moral support of this action. If time allowed for the formulation of a joint Anglo-Americanplan, they would also be ready to give logistical support to our forces.Mr. Dulles had expressed the view that the situation might developless quickly than we feared, and he hoped that we might feel able to defer action until there had been time for further Anglo-Americanconsultation after the Foreign Secretary arrived in Washington.After a further adjournment the Cabinet considered the situationin the light of this expression of the preliminary views of the UnitedStates Government.In favour of immediate intervention, in response to .Tordan&apos;request, the following considerations were urged. If immediate action was not taken to occupy the airiield at Amman it might fall into hostilehands with the result that the opportunity for effective intervention would be lost. If we failed to respond to his request, King Hussein&apos;swill to resist would be seriously weakened and the insurgents wouldbe correspondingly encouraged; and there would be a grave risk thatJordan would pass under the influence of the United Arab Republic.If that happened, our position in the Gulf would at once be injeopardy. Our right to respond to Jordan&apos;s request could not becontested on legal grounds. We were fully entitled to help Jordan todefend herself against an insurrection inspired from outside. our action would be reported to the United Nations and we should be inat least as good a position as the United States were in respect of theirintervention in Lebanon. We had the assurance of the moral supportof the United States Government, and we might expect that we shouldalso receive logistical support from them as the situation developed.Domestic political difficulties in this country might be considerable:public opinion would at the outset be sharply divided. But, if theGovernment declined to respond to this request and Jordan passedunder the influence of the United Arab Republic, the ultimate political difficulties for the Government would be even more serious. Therewould have been great advantages if intervention could have been based on an agreed Anglo-American plan, concerted during theForeign Secretary&apos;s visit to Washington. But we could not afford to delay action for more than a day or two, at most.; and it was evidentthat within that time the United States Government would not be ableto commit themselves any further than Mr. Dulles had already done in his conversation with the Prime Minister Therefore, from thepoint of view of Anglo-American consultation, we had little to gain bydelaying the decision; and even a day&apos;s delay might rob us ofthe opportunity of seizing the airfield at Amman and establishing abridgehead in Jordan.On the other side it was pointed out that the forces which we couldsend to Jordan were small and ill-equipped for any heavy fighting. the objectives which they could secure were limited. And, even though their presence at Amman might encourage the existing Government toremain in office, it was possible that their arrival might have the effectof turning some of the local population against the King and increasingthe dissident element in the Jordan Army. Disquieting reports hadbeen received from Israeli sources about the extent to whichdisaffection had spread through the Jordan Army. It was thereforedifficult to see how this intervention could be turned to our advantage in the long run. Although the operation might achieve its immediate and limited objectives, there seemed to be no possibility of exploiting itin the longer term. And it would be undertaken at a heavy politicalcost in this country. From this point of view it would have been betterif we could have waited, at any rate for another day, to see whether theForeign Secretary could not concert in Washington plans for a more effective Anglo-American intervention in Jordan. There was a strongpossibility that we might eventually be confronted with a hostileJordan Army. In that event the small and lightly armed forces whichwe had committed might be overwhelmed unless we could rely on theUnited States Government to go to their assistance, especially bysupplying them with the heavier types of weapons and equipment.
C.C. (59) 58In further discussion the point was made that, if this force were sent into Jordan, it would have to be supplied wholly by air. Thiswould involve flying over Israel and could be done only with theapproval of the Israel Government. The Cabinet were informed thatthere was good reason to believe that in all the circumstances the IsraelGovernment would find no difficulty in acquiescing in our over-flyingtheir territory for these purposes. The Cabinet could thereforeassume, for the purposes of this discussion, that there would be no legalor practical difficulties in conveying this force into Jordan by air andsupplying it thereafter by air up to the level required for its limitedobjectives.The general feeling in the Cabinet was that the balance ofadvantage lay on the side of responding to Jordan&apos;s appeal by the immediate despatch of British troops to Jordan. ThePrime Minister said, however, that before a final decision wasreached, he would like to have the opportunity of a further discussion with the United States Secretary of State.When the meeting was resumed the Prime Minister summed upthe position on the following lines. Militarily this was a difficult and dangerous operation. But the Chiefs of Staff believed that it wassoundly planned and capable of achieving the limited objectivesproposed for it. If the worst happened and the British troops on the airfield at Amman were attacked by the whole weight of the JordanArmy, including its armour, we should be m great difficulties; but inthat event we should have the opportunity of counter-attack,particularly against the armour, by aircraft based on Cyprus. Fromthe military angle the main objection to this operation was that therewas no scope for exploiting it in the longer term. It was difficult tosee that it would serve any purpose beyond that of stabilising theexisting regime in Jordan and denying this territory for a time to theUnited Arab Republic. The political considerations were more evenly balanced. The operation would give rise to a sharp division of opinion in this country and, in view of its limited objectives, it would be difficultto show that it had been successful. On the other hand, if we failed to respond to Jordan&apos;s appeal and the country passed under the influence of the United Arab Republic, the political position of the UnitedKingdom Government would be gravely weakened. No moralobloquy would attach to this operation if it were undertaken, and inthat respect the Government would be less open to criticism than theprevious Administration had been in respect of the Port Saidoperation. The operation now proposed could, indeed, be criticisedfrom the opposite angle of being too quixotic. From the internationalpoint of view it would expose our interests in the Gulf to great risks.But the risks in that area would be no less if Jordan passed under thecontrol of the United Arab Republic. Among other commonwealth countries our intervention would arouse mixed feelings. The olderCommonwealth countries, including even Canada, would probably beready to support it. We could also rely on the support of Pakistan andthe other members of the Baghdad Pact. But the operation wouldstrain our relations with India, Ceylon, Ghana and Malaya though in view of her financial difficulties, India would probably be anxious toavoid at the present time any open breach with either the United states or the United Kingdom. If they decided to go forward with this plan,therefore, the Government must ensure that, in its presentation to world opinion and in the United Nations, their action should be madeto appear as closely comparable as possible with that taken bythe United States in respect of the Lebanon. It should be reported atonce to the Security Council, where we should table a resolutionparallel to the United States resolution submitted in respect ofthe Lebanon and we might offer to withdraw our forces as soon as other effective arrangements could be made to safeguard the integrity and independence of Jordan.
The Prime Minister said that, in his second conversation withMr. Dulles, he had said that his colleagues were disposed to respond to the request of the King and Government of Jordan and to sendBritish troops into Amman on the following day. Mr. Dulles had undertaken that in this event the United States Government wouldgive us their full support, both in public statements and at the united nations. He was also ready, on his own authority, to promiselogistical support as the situation developed and to agree that the demonstration which United States aircraft were to make over israel and Jordan on the following day should be co-ordinated with theneeds of our own operation. He had, however, made it clear that hooperational support could be considered until there had been anopportunity for consultation with Congressional leaders.In conclusion the Prime Minister said that this would be aquixotic undertaking. It would, however, be an honourable one andthe political risks in this country were nicely balanced. It wasimpossible at this stage to see what the end of the enterprise mightbe: it might have grave consequences, both for the nation and forthe political future of the Government. Nevertheless he consideredthat the consequences of any alternative course might be at leastequally grave; and the action proposed might well prove in the eventto be the lesser evil. At least he was satisfied that, for the reasons which had been advanced earlier in the discussion, it would be noeasier for the Cabinet to reach a decision if the question were deferred for twenty-four hours.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, in response to the request of the King and PrimeMinister of Jordan for military assistance, a British force should be despatched forthwith to Amman with the limited objectives approved in their discussion.(2) Agreed that the response to this request should at once be reported to the Security Council, where our case shouldbe presented on a basis as nearly comparable as possible with that adopted by the United States Government inrespect of their corresponding intervention in the lebanon.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for animmediate approach to be made to the Government of israel for the grant of the facilities for overflying Israeliterritory which would be required in connection with boththe original despatch of this expedition and itssubsequent maintenance.(4) Invited the Minister of Defence to give instructions for themilitary operation to be carried out on the basis approved in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.(5) Instructed the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs toarrange for appropriate communications to be sent to theKing of Jordan and to arrange for information about theproposed operation to be communicated to the north atlantic Council, the other members of the Baghdad pact and other Allied Governments.(6) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to arrange for other commonwealth Governments to be informed of theproposed operation.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,17 th July, 1958.
