Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Death of The Home Secretary said that, although there was no precedentformer for doing so, he thought it would be appropriate for him, as LeaderSpeaker. of the House of Commons, to propose that the House should expressits sorrow at the death of the late Lord Ruffside and its sympathy with his relatives. No formal Motion need be moved.Parliamentary The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council had ruled that the privilege. House of Commons would not be acting in a manner contrary to(Previous        the Parliamentary Privilege Act, 1770, if it treated the issue of a writReference:       against a Member of Parliament in respect of a speech or proceedingC.C.

R. Strauss, M.P., in respect of statements made in a letter which he had sent to the Paymaster-General.   Itwould be preferable, however, that discussion of this matter shouldbe deferred until after the Whitsun recess, when the reactions ofParliament and the genera! public to the decision of the JudicialCommittee could be assessed.The Cabinets Took note, with approval, of these statements.Parliament:Expenses ofMembers.(previous references:C.C. (54) 52ndConclusions,Minute 2, andC.C. (57) 47thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Home Secretary said that a suggestion had been madeby the Opposition that Members of Parliament should be entitled to claim a refund of expenses, equivalent to the cost of a first-classreturn ticket, in respect of journeys to and from their constituencies in their own motor-cars.In discussion the view was expressed that this suggestion wasnot unreasonable. The Select Committee on Members&apos; Expenseshad, however, recommended in 1945 that the refund of Members&apos;travelling expenses should be confined to travel by rail and air. any modification of the existing rules would require a new Resolution bythe House of Commons for which the present was not an opportunetime.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the commonwealth secretary, to give further consideration, in due course, tothe suggestion that Members of Parliament should beentitled to claim a refund of expenses in respect of journeysto and from their constituencies in their own motor-cars.Industrial *3.   The Cabinet reviewed the latest developments in the railwayDisputes. wages dispute.  They were informed that the unions concerned were(Previous        now considering separately the results of their discussions with the reference:       Chairman of the British Transport Commission and proposed toC.C. (58) 38th   concert their future course of action at a joint meeting that afternoon.Conclusions,     There were indications, however, that although one section of minute-3.)       opinion in the National Union of railway men would probablyfavour strike action, the Associated Society of Locomotive engineers and Firemen and the Transport Salaried Staffs Association &quot;would prefer, if possible, to find some means of avoiding a strike.  In thesecircumstances it was not certain that the joint meeting, of the unions would take place.53440-5b 2
The Prime Minister staid that, in considering the tactics to beadopted, the Cabinet should have clearly in view the situation whichwould confront them if a strike spread throughout the whole of thetransport industry and, as a result, normal economic activity was brought to a standstill in a relatively short period. The Governmentwould then have to choose between three possible courses of action.They might seek, even in these circumstances, to sustain their opposition to the demands of the unions until the unions themselvesadmitted defeat.  Alternatively, they would have to admit that theywere no longer capable of controlling the situation.   Or they might seek to reach some compromise with the unions which, while notconceding the full measure of their claims, would represent to someextent a concession to their pressure.   In his view, it would not bepossible to inflict a clear defeat on the unions in a major transportstrike unless public opinion was satisfied that the unions were makingunreasonable demands and were deliberately seeking to transforman industrial dispute into an organised conspiracy against the life of the nation.   This was not at present the view of the public, whowere impressed by the fact that the recent decision of the railway staff National Tribunal had implicitly admitted that the wages paidto railwaymen were inadequate.   It had been reasonable, therefore,for the Government to suggest that a concerted effort should now bemade by the Government, the Transport Commission and the railway unions to increase productivity on the railways; and it was now generally accepted that such, an effort should, in time, effect asubstantial improvement in the finances of the Commission.   Onthis hypothesis the Chairman of the Commission had given the unions is a firm undertaking that the Commission would grant some wage increase in October and would be prepared to consider in July thepossible scope of that increase.   The unions, on the other hand,continued to insist that some increase should be granted at once. Thedifference between the two parties to the dispute was now, therefore,merely a difference about the date at which the railwaymen shouldreceive a wage increase which had already been conceded in principle;and it was doubtful whether public opinion could be relied upon tocontinue to support the Government in sustaining a major transportstrike on such an issue.The Home Secretary reviewed the state of preparations to meet a general transport strike. The Emergencies Organisation in the regions had been strengthened and the necessary emergency regulations were ready for introduction. In extreme emergencyabout 200,000 Service personnel could be called upon; but only about90,000 could be made available without a major dislocation of Servicefunctions, and only some 7,500 Service vehicles could be suppliedunless the Government authorised the bringing into use of vehiclesat present in store.Apart from the General Strike of 1926 there was no precedent for an emergency on the scale now under consideration, particularly if the oil tanker drivers also declared a strike; and, although it might prove possible to maintain the minimum of essential services in such circumstances, the dislocation of the normal life of the community would be very severe. It was therefore important that theGovernment, while maintaining their economic policy in ailfundamental respects, should be seen to be adopting a consistentlyreasonable attitude towards the demands of the unions, since only by this means could they be sure that, if a major transport strikedeveloped, they would have the maximum support from publicopinion in confronting it.In discussion the following points were made:  -(a) The wage claim in the coal-mining industry would shortly bethe subject of arbitration. The National Coal Board would bestatutorily compelled to accept the award. If it conceded a largerwage increase than was now in dispute with the railway unions, theGovernments case against them would be weakened.
CC. 39 (58)(b) The claims of the railway unions would be further reinforced by the fact that the cost-of-living index might shortly rise by as muchas two points.(c) The outstanding wage claim of the dock workers, which was due to be further considered in the near future, would offer theTransport and General Workers Union the means of bringing further pressure to bear on the Government.(d) The General Strike of 1926 was not comparable with thestrike which now threatened to develop. In 1926 it had been generally accepted that the strikes declared by various industries in support ofthe miners had constituted, in effect, an illegal conspiracy againstthe public interest. In present circumstances the general public wouldnot be persuaded to take the same view of the claims of the railwaymen, towards whom they were well disposed in principle.(e) Foreign confidence in sterling would be liable to b e more seriously affected in the long term by any apparent surrender by theGovernment to the unions than by the economic dislocation of a major strike.(/) The desirability of preserving a reasonable attitude towardsthe unions&apos; claims should not be allowed to outweigh the importanceof maintaining a disinflationary policy which should be of ultimatebenefit to all sections of the community but could only be realisedif wage increases were related to achieved improvements in productivity and were not granted merely on the strength of generalundertakings to increase output or to secure economies.(g) The Governments supporters regarded the present situation as a critical test of the Governments determination to maintain aneconomic policy which they must be deemed to have adopted in fullrealisation of its probable consequences. Any apparent retreat bythe Government in the face of pressure by the unions would be strongly resented by an influential section of the Conservative Partyboth in Parliament and in the country.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in the light of these considerations the Government should consider whether it might bepossible, without conceding an immediate wage increase orprejudicing their economic policy in general, to reach some compromise settlement with the railway unions. The least objectionable method of doing so might be to extend the settlementover a rather longer period by conceding wage increases of specificamounts at defined dates, related to the progressive realisation ofthe economies foreshadowed in the recent discussions between theunions and the Chairman of the Transport Commission.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thissuggestion deserved further consideration. The Government shouldnot over-estimate the strength of their position in relation to therailway wages claim. Despite the disinflationary policy, substantialwage increases continued to be granted in the private sector; and,even in the public sector, wage awards in the majority of the nationalised industries were not within the Governments control.It was relevant to the Cabinets decision in the present instance thatthe industry involved was one in which the Government could, tosome extent, influence wages policy but the unions were admitted bythe Railway Staff National Tribunal to have a reasonable case andwere also in a position to bring organised pressure to bear on theGovernment. If the Government were to be seen to deal reasonablywith this situation without departing from the main principles of their economic policy, they must seek to import into the discussions somefactor of which the Tribunal had not been able to take account in their recent decision. This could be found in the subsequent discussions between the unions and the Chairman of the transport commission, which had established the possibility of securing greater productivity on the railways by a concerted effort on the part of both
0 &quot;? Q s\4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C. (58) 93) covering a memorandum by the EconomicSteering Committee about the application by the New zealand government for the imposition of anti-dumping or countervailingduties on butter imported into the United Kingdom from Sweden,Finland and, the Irish Republic. The Board of Trade were satisfiedthat these imports had been a contributory factor in causing andthreatening material injury to the New Zealand industry, within theterms of the Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies). Act, 1957, andthe Economic Steering Committee had therefore considered whether we should:  (i) impose countervailing duties under the Act of 1957; or(ii) try to secure a voluntary undertaking from the countries concerned that they would either raise the price of the butter whichthey exported to the United Kingdom or limit the quantity of thoseexports; ormanagement and labour. It would be dangerous, however, to seek to assess too precisely or too far in advance the economies likely toflow from this joint effort at definite points of time; and it might be preferable that any agreement ultimately reached with the unionsshould be seen to be based primarily on the good faith of the parties concerned. If, on this hypothesis, a memorandum of understandingcould be drawn up, defining the respective contributions of theGovernment, the Transport Commission and the unions to a combined endeavour to improve the finances of the Commission, itmight then be possible to secure the acceptance by the unions of anarrangement whereby they would meet the Transport Commission at regular intervals in order to review the progress which had actually been achieved in giving effect to these economies and to agree wage increases which would be justified by the fact, rather than by the precise amount, of this progress. In this way a new and valuableelement of stability might be introduced into wages policy as awhole.An approach on these lines should be accepted by public opinon as reasonable and might well reinforce the more moderate elements in the unions themselves. He would therefore hold himself in readiness to receive the unions if they should ask to meet him again.If their projected joint meeting that afternoon did not take place,they must be deemed to be still in a state of negotiation with theTransport Commission and Government intervention might be deferred until the outcome of that process was known. If, however,the joint meeting was held, there would clearly be a risk that the more extreme elements would seek to insist on calling a strike, and theMinister of Labour should therefore give notice, in advance of themeeting, that he proposed to discharge his statutory function of usinghis good offices to seek a settlement of the dispute.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Labour to be guided, in his attitudetowards the negotiations between the British transport commission and the railway unions, by the considerations which had emerged during their discussion.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, after consultation with theService Ministers, to report to the Prime Minister any action which he considered to be necessary in order toensure that, in the event of a general transport strike, themaximum number of Service personnel and vehicles couldbe made available as rapidly as possible.(3) Agreed to keep the development of the situation under closereview.
(ui\ make a direct grant from the United Kingdom exchequer to the New Zealand Dairy Industry Account; or(iv) offer the New Zealand Government a short-term credit, of,say^  5 millions which, though provided for general purposes, could,if necessary, be used by the New Zealand Government in modifyingtheir internal policies in connection with the production of butter.The Committee had recommended that the last of these possible courses of action was likely to be the least injurious to the long-term interests of the United Kingdom and New Zealand.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Economic PolicyCommittee had not endorsed this recommendation. They had agreed that a direct grant to the New Zealand dairy industry would constitute a most dangerous precedent; but they had felt that, whilethe imposition of countervailing duties would admittedly involveembarrassing discussions with the parties to the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade, it would be difficult to justify our failure to use,in the last resort, the statutory powers now available to us. Moreover,it was important to preserve the goodwill of the New zealand government, who were pressing for a drastic reduction of UnitedKingdom preferences in the New Zealand market. The economic policy Committee had therefore concluded that the best course wouldbe to seek to secure an agreement with Sweden, Finland and the irish republic for the voluntary limitation of their exports of butter or,in default of such an agreement, to impose countervailing duties on those exports.Discussion showed that there was general agreement with thisview. Action should not, for the time being, be taken either against those countries of whom New Zealand had not complained or against the Argentine, where the validity of the complaint had notyet been established. Meanwhile, a loan or a credit to the NewZealand Government might be envisaged in principle, but its detailswould need further consideration before we incurred any commitment in this respect and, if granted, it should be linked with an undertaking by the New Zealand Government to withdraw the more extremeof their demands for a modification of United Kingdom and Colonialpreferences.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) The consumption of butter in the United Kingdom wastending to increase. The New Zealand Government should thereforebe warned, in their own interests, of the dangers of increasing theprice of their butter to a level which might cause increased consumption of margarine.(b) Our assistance to New Zealand should be based on a clear understanding that they would take effective action to limit their production of butter.(c) A public announcement of the Governmenfs decision shouldbe deferred until the reactions of the New Zealand Government were known.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of State,Board of Trade, to inform the Deputy Prime Minister ofNew Zealand that the Government were prepared to seek an agreement with Sweden, Finland and the irish republic for the voluntary limitation of their exports of butter or, in default of such an agreement, to imposecountervailing duties on those exports.
(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Commonwealth Secretary, the Colonial Secretary andthe Minister of State, Board of Trade, to give furtherconsideration to the possibility of granting a loan orcredit to the New Zealand Government and to theconditions which should be attached to any such loan orcredit.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th May, 1958.
