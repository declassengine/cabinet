The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Housing (C. (58) 209) discussing the question of compensation forthe reduction in the value of property known to be subject to compulsory acquisition by a public authority at some future date.The Minister of Housing said that this reduction, known as&quot; planning blight,&quot; undoubtedly caused hardship and should be dealtwith in the context of the forthcoming Town and Country planning bill. Representatives of local authorities had expressed the view, inconfidential discussions, that statutory action was unnecessary since they would be prepared to buy affected properties if the Governmentenabled them to do so by way of loan sanction or grant in advance ofthe development of the schemes for which the properties wereacquired. It would be unwise, however, to leave this matter wholly tothe discretion of the local authorities : it would be preferable that theyshould be under a specific obligation to purchase at the request of theowner. This obligation might be limited to owner-occupiedresidential properties, which gave rise to the great majority ofcases in which hardship was known to occur. But it would more appropriately be extended to all residential properties and be exercisable without regard to hardship, in order to ensure thatresidential property which was not owner-occupied but was affectedby &quot; planning blight&quot; would not relapse into slums. It should not,however, include non-residential properties, since owners of such property could not reasonably claim the right to choose the moment at which they would compel the local authority to acquire premisesfor which they would be unable, in most cases, to find any use.  The1. The Minister of Housing said that an unfortunate situation was developing on a site at Egham which had been occupied, withoutplanning permission, by a caravan company, Modern Trailer HomesLimited. Local feeling against the occupants of the caravans was growing; but the law relating to the use of unauthorised sites couldnot be easily enforced and the company had been able to avoidtaking action until the Lord Chief Justice had granted an injunctionrestraining them from using any unauthorised site in the Egham area.After further postponements the company had now been compelledto serve notices to quit on the occupants of the caravans and to obtain an eviction order from the County Court. Some of the occupantswere resisting these measures; but, although the Court might grant a pending application for a further stay of execution, the EghamUrban District Council could not be expected to acquiesce indefinitelyin the occupation of a site for which they had refused planning permission.In discussion there was general agreement that this situation wasa potential source of political embarrassment. It would seemindefensible that people who had acquired caravans on the assumptionthat they would be allowed to remain on the site indefinitely should now be forcibly ejected, even though alternative accommodation forthem could be found. Nor was it reasonable that the bailiffs should beexpected to evict these individuals at the risk of personal injury.Some means should be found whereby the rights of the local authoritycould be reconciled with the needs of individuals who were the victims of a company which had deliberately defied the law.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government to try to arrange that the Egham Urban District Council should refrain from pressing their case against the unauthorisedoccupation of certain caravans in order to allow reasonable time for the occupants to make alternative arrangements.
territorial waters.(previous references :C.C. (58) 74thConclusions,Minute 1 andC.C. (58) 70thConclusions,Minute 2.)FaroeseFishery Limits.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture(C. (58) 210) about the revision of the 1955 Agreement with the danish government which conceded exclusive fishing rights for the Faroesein certain ai-eas outside the three-mile limit.The Minister of Agriculture said that, following a unilateral declaration of a twelve-mile exclusive fishing limit by the Faroese, the danish Government had proved anxious to reach a revised agreement which would be acceptable both to the United Kingdom and theFaroese. It would be to our advantage to conclude a new agreementsince this would strengthen our stand in the dispute with Iceland and,if it followed the lines indicated in C. (58) 210, would not prejudice ourposition at the next International Conference on the Law of the Sea.The revision proposed would provide an exclusive fishing zone forthe Faroese within a line approximately six miles from the coast (witha confidential understanding about the limitation of fishing in thiszone); a zone between six and twelve miles (drawn from low-watermark) in which foreign fishing would be limited to nations enjoyinghistoric rights, including the United Kingdom; and, within the six-to-twelve-mile zone, a limited number of areas in which only line-fishing would be allowed.Discussion showed that there was general agreement with theseproposals.  The following points were made:  (a) There could be no guarantee that a revised agreement wouldbe respected by British trawlers.  Trawler owners would have to bepurchase of non-residential properties affected by &quot; planning blight &quot;should therefore be left to the discretion of the local authorities,subject to advice and pressure from the Minister in appropriate cases.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would prefer to limit the obligation to the purchase of owner-occupied residentialproperties. This alone might cost the Exchequer  2 millions a year,and the inclusion of all residential properties might involve anadditional  1 million a year. He would also wish to consider further the extent to which the Exchequer liability could be reduced bylimiting the payments to the local authorities, in advance of the actualdevelopment, to the loss of revenue which they would incur in meeting loan charges on the capital cost of buying the properties.Discussion showed that there was general agreement that theTown and Country Planning Bill should, in principle, impose upon local authorities some obligation to buy properties affected by&quot; planning blight.&quot; Such an obligation might inhibit local authorities,to some extent, in the preparation of development schemes and might result in their acquiring an unduly large number of houses. but since purchase would be dependent on a request by the owner and ona definite intention on the part of the local authority to implement aparticular development scheme, this risk could be discounted. Onthe other hand the exclusion of non-residential property was morearguable. In particular &quot; planning blight&quot; was liable to causehardship in relation to commercial and industrial properties, whichwere often held by trustees for the benefit of charities or individuals.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that the forthcoming Town and country planning Bill should deal with the problem of &quot; planningblight&quot; by imposing on local authorities some degree of statutory obligation to acquire prooerties affected by&quot;blight.&quot;(2) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government toask the Home Affairs Committee to consider, in the lightof their discussion, the precise extent of this obligation.
persuaded to take steps to ensure that their vessels would observe its provisions.(b) The proposal that in certain areas only line-fishing shouldbe allowed was unwelcome to the British industry. It might bepossible to persuade the Danish Government to reduce the numberof such areas from three to two or, alternatively, to reduce their sizeor the period in each year during which the restriction was to operate.This was a matter for bargaining.(c) The Danish Government wished to reserve the right to demand further revision of the agreement if we recognised any morefavourable arrangement in respect of Iceland. It was undesirable that a concession on this point should extend to any interim measuresprescribed by the International Court if the Icelandic dispute were referred to them; but the negotiations should not be allowed to breakdown on this issue.(d) The revised agreement should not take effect until the othercountries accustomed to fish off the Faroe Islands had assented to it.On this understanding it would not be necessary to press for a multilateral agreement to which those countries would be parties.The Cabinet Agreed that negotiations with the Danish Government on a revised agreement on Faroese fishery limits should proceed on the lines proposed in C. (58) 210, subject to the points made in their discussion.Nigeria.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 71stConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (C. (58) 213) reporting progress in the Nigerianconstitutional conference.The Colonial Secretary said that there was now a good prospect that agreement would shortly be reached on all outstanding issues and that a satisfactory Defence Agreement would be accepted by the nigerian leaders. On these assumptions it was no longer possible to resist the Nigerian request that we should name a date in 1960 onwhich Nigeria should attain independence. He therefore sought authority to inform the conference now that, if the present discussions were concluded in a manner acceptable to us and if the nigerian government repeated their request after the Nigerian elections of 1959, we would then be prepared to undertake to grant full independence to Nigeria in the autumn of 1960.In discussion there was general agreement that no useful purpose would be served by postponing this decision and forfeiting Nigeriangoodwill. The balance of advantage lay in adopting the colonial secretary&apos;s proposal.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) In the absence of a suitable coastal site, it might be impracticable to seek to reserve an enclave of British territory as apermanent military base. It was essential, however, that ouroverflying rights should be secured in a form which could not be legally challenged.(b) It was for consideration whether, with this end in view, itwould be wiser to defer conclusion of the Defence Agreement until the nigerian Government were exercising full sovereign powers afterattaining independence or whether we should take advantage of theexisting goodwill to settle its provisions in the context of theconstitutional discussions.C.C. 76 (58)
(c) The Defence Agreement would involve us in certain financial obligations which would need to be examined in greater detail bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer before we incurred any firm commitment.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (58) 213, subject to the points made in their discussion.Far East(previous reference :CC. (58) 73rdConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Foreign Secretary reported to the Cabinet the latest developments in the situation in the Far East.In discussion it was suggested that the threat presented by thePeople&apos;s Government of China was beginning to assume a commercial,as well as a military, form. Both Japan and Hong Kong wereapprehensive about the effect of Chinese competition on their owntrade; and in the implications for the current negotiations betweenthe textile industries in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong might need to be examined in more detail.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary to submit, for considerationby the Prime Minister, a memorandum on the implications for Hong Kong of the expansion of Communist Chinesetrade.Traffic.(previous reference :CM. (56) 38thConclusions,Minute 5.)Speed limit for PublicService and light goods vehicles.6. The Minister of Transport said that the Home AffairsCommittee had approved, subject to the endorsement of the Cabinet,the proposal that the maximum speed limit for public service vehicles and light goods vehicles outside built-up areas should be increased from 30 miles per hour to 40 miles per hour. There was relatively little risk that this proposal would encounter the opposition fromthe trades unions concerned which had arisen in connection with theproposed increase in the speed limit for heavy goods vehicles; andon other grounds there v/ere clear advantages in a measure whichshould ensure a more even flow of traffic on roads where the generallimit of 40 miles per hour was now being applied.In discussion there was general agreement with this view. Evenif the unions sought to use the change as an additional argument insupport of a fresh wage claim, they were unlikely to regard it as initself an occasion for a labour distmte.The Cabinet-Approved the proposal that the maximum speed limit for public service vehicles and light goods vehicles outside built-up areas should be increased from 30 miles per hour to40 miles per hour.GovernmentInformationServices.(previous reference :CC. (58) 60thConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (C. (58) 207) reporting on his recent tour of India, Pakistan, Aden and East Africa.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that, as a resultof his study of the information services in these areas, he was convinced that certain changes of policy were urgently necessary. Themost important task was to provide more effective means ofcountering Cairo Radio.   To some extent this objective could be
achieved by modifications in the technique adopted by the british broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.), which should ensure that, without detriment to the Corporation^ traditional policy of objectivity, itsservices would acquire a more direct and colourful appeal. Inaddition, however, it was essential that the distorted and maliciousmaterial disseminated by Cairo Radio should be rebutted moreswiftly and positively than was possible consistently with the B.B.C&apos;policy. For this purpose the local programmes broadcast by the stations in Kenya, British Somaliland and Aden should be ensureda prompt and regular supply of monitoring reports, together withguidance on rebuttal; and the new station at Berbera should be usednot only to relay the B.B.C&apos;s programmes in Arabic, Somali andSwahili but to provide, in addition, a programme of material devoteddirectly to countering the broadcasts of Cairo Radio. A service ofthis nature might also supply the necessary monitoring reports forthe use of local stations. It would probably need to be organised,directed and financed by the United Kingdom Government.At the same time the oversea programmes of the B.B.C. shouldbe re-examined. In particular, the Corporation^ General OverseaService, which entailed expenditure of some  l\ millions a year, wouldbe of progressively declining value as local services developed; and itmight well be to our advantage to concentrate henceforward onsupplying such services with recordings of propaganda talks andcommentaries prepared in London.More active steps should also be taken to satisfy the great and growing demand for education in the areas which he had visited by a selective expansion of the work of the British Council and theDepartmental Information Services. The Soviet Union had already begun to exploit the market in India with cheap books in the english language; and the threat to our position which was implicit in this development would need to be met by a vigorous extension of our plans for promoting the teaching of English and increasing the supplyof English text books.In discussion there was general agreement with the policyadvocated in C. (58) 207. The following points were made:  (a) We had insufficient resources to enable us to compete withan unscrupulous opponent in terms of broadcast propaganda; andit would be important to ensure that such rebuttal of Cairo Radio aswe might promote was factual in its nature and was presented withcare.(b) It had been agreed at the recent Commonwealth Trade andEconomic Conference at Montreal that a Commonwealth Conferenceon Education should be convened in the spring of 1959. In the preparations for this Conference it would be necessary to take accountof any further measures which we might adopt to encourage the teaching of English overseas.(c) Particular attention should be given to the possibility of developing local and regional television services in the Middle Eastand Africa. It might be appropriate to launch any venture of thiskind in Aden.(d) The additional expenditure entailed by the proposals inC. (58) 207 would need to be considered in the light of the economies which might be achieved by a re-examination of the B.B.C&apos;s ExternalServices. It would also be desirable to survey our information service as a whole in order to ensure that any activities which no longer serveda useful purpose were discontinued without delay.(e) It was for consideration whether we should make a more positive attempt to induce our allies, particularly in the rest of theCommonwealth and in the United States, to share with us the burdenof countering the propaganda of the Soviet Union and the Afro-Asian bloc.
The Cabinet-(1) Approved, in principle, the forward policy for theGovernment information services outlined in C. (58) 207.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe other Ministers concerned, to examine, as a matter of urgency, the detailed implementation of that policy.cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd October, 1958.
