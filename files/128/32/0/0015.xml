The Foreign Secretary said that, subject to amendment atone point, the Prime Minister had now approved the draft reply toMr. Bulganin&apos;s letter of 9th January in the form approved by theCabinet at their last meeting (Commonwealth Relations office telegram to Australia track No. 246). The draft was also acceptable to the United States Secretary of State. He accordingly proposedto circulate it to the North Atlantic Council forthwith, with a viewto its delivery to the Soviet Government at the end of the week.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the draft reply,as amended by the Prime Minister, to be circulatedforthwith to the North Atlantic Council.Statement on 4.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister ofDefence, 1958. Defence (C. (58) 34), covering a draft of the Statement on Defence,1958.The Minister of Defence briefly reviewed the main provisions inthe draft Statement. The importance of the introductory sectionslay in the fact that, by indicating the extent to which the western powers relied on the nuclear deterrent in order to balance the overwhelming Soviet superiority in conventional forces, they would explain and justify the insistence of the West that any nucleardisarmament should be accompanied by simultaneous reductions inconventional armaments and military man-power.The Cabinet considered the draft Statement paragraph by paragraph and agreed on a number of amendments. In the courseof the discussion the following points of substance were made (a) Doubts were expressed about the advisability of mentioning,in paragraph 5, that the Soviet Union was only restrained fromattacking Western Europe by the fact that Soviet forces could not
simultaneously destroy the vital strategic bases in the UnitedStates. This indication of the exposed position of the UnitedKingdom might stimulate opposition to the establishment of intermediate range ballistic missile sites in this country. On the otherhand it was desirable that public discussion of these issues should bebased on an informed appreciation of the facts involved. Moreover,a statement that, for geographical reasons, &quot; the superiority of theWest was likely to increase, rather than to diminish, as a consequenceof the advent of medium-range ballistic rockets &quot; should set in betterperspective the recent Soviet scientific successes and, by emphasising the dangers of an isolationist policy, should underline the wisdom of close collaboration with the United States.(b) It was perhaps unrealistic to refer, in paragraph 9, to&quot; complete disarmament by all nations, coupled with completeinspection and control by a world authority &quot; as the ultimate aim.Even in an ideal future all nations would need to retain some armed forces for the maintenance of law and order. Moreover, theconceptions of a world authority and a world police force did notcommand the unanimous support of public opinion. On the otherhand there was a certain presentational advantage in indicating atthe outset of the Statement that, although Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere compelled by circumstances to sustain a costly and elaboratedefence effort, they were not oblivious of the ultimate objective of world-wide disarmament. Further consideration should, however, begiven to the precise drafting of paragraphs 9 and 10.(c) The reference, in paragraph 64, to the Royal Navaldockyards at Portsmouth, Devonport, Chatham and Rosyth had been so drafted as to avoid any suggestion that a decision had yet beentaken about the future of the naval dockyard at Malta, whichdepended on the outcome of the present negotiations for the transferof the dockyard to a commercial organisation. The First Lord ofthe Admiralty proposed to make a statement on the future of thenaval dockyards on the day before the Statement on Defence was published. It would be desirable to announce at the same time the closure of certain other naval establishments which would increaseunemployment in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. There had,however, been little time to give advance notice to the NorthernIreland Government of the prospective redundancies in CountyDerry. It might be preferable, therefore, to omit paragraphs 62-64from the Statement on Defence and to arrange for a comprehensiveannouncement of the Governmenfs intentions regarding navalestablishments to be included in the memorandum on the navy estimates, which was due to be published on 18th February.(d) The Statement should include a discussion of the economic implications of the revised defence programme, emphasising inparticular the disinflationary effects of the reductions in Serviceman-power and of the release to industry of resources previouslyallocated to defence production.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence to circulate, in the light oftheir discussion, a revised draft of the Statement on defence, 1958.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theHome Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland, theMinister of Labour, the Minister for Welsh Affairs andthe First Lord of the Admiralty to consider further theform and timing of the proposed announcement on thefuture of the naval dockyards and the closure of certain other naval establishments.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.6th February, 1958.
