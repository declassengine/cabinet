Industrial 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the course of the discussionsDisputes. held on the previous day between the Chief Industrial Commissioner(Previous of the Ministry of Labour and the parties to the London bus wagesReference: dispute.   The Transport and General Workers Union had shownC.C. (58) 44th little disposition to modify their claim and were evidently trying to conclusions, secure that it should be settled, on the same lines as the recent railwayMinute l.) dispute, by the grant of an undifferentiated wage increase.In discussion there was general agreement that the Governmentcould not countenance the renewal of negotiations on any basis whichdeparted significantly from the award of the Industrial Court. It hadbeen calculated at the time that the award would cost about  1 million,and that this might be recovered by operational economies. but those economies had not yet been brought into effect and in themeantime the strike was inflicting on the Executive a growing financial loss which would make it progressively more difficult for them tojustify maintaining their original acceptance of the arbitration award.Moreover, although there was some risk that, in the absence of any settlement of the dispute, strike action would spread to the docks andto certain sections of the road transport industry, it was likely tobecome increasingly difficult for the union leaders to sustain the busstrike and it would be unwise for the Government to appear to weaken in the firm attitude which they had hitherto maintained.Therefore, in any further discussion with the union representatives,the Chairman of the Transport Executive should confine himself toindicating that, despite the additional strain imposed on theExecutive^ finances by the bus strike itself, he was still prepared togive effect to the Industrial Court&apos;s award of a wage increase of 8s. 6d.a week to bus workers in central London, provided that the strike was brought to an end forthwith, and would be ready to extend this increase [to the drivers of Green Line buses, whose wages he hadalready promised to review in July.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Transport to inform the Chairmanof the London Transport Executive that, in any further discussion of the London bus, dispute with the transport and General Workers Union, he should adhere to his earlieroffer to implement the recent award of the Industrial Court,should offer to extend that award to the drivers andconductors of Green Line buses, but should not make anyfurther concession.53550-1C.C. 45 (58)Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the week following the Whitsun recess.It was suggested that, in connection with the proposed debate on disarmament on 10th June, there would be advantage in remindingParliament and the general public of the disarmament proposalswhich the Government had themselves put forward.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider the desirability of publishing a White Paper on the Governmenfs disarmamentproposals in preparation for the forthcoming debate on disarmament.
territorial waters.(previous reference:CC. (58) 44thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet had before them: (i) a note by the foreign secretary (C. (58) 116) covering a draft declaration to be made by theGovernment in the event of a claim by the Icelandic Government toextended fishing rights; and (ii) a note by the Attorney-General(C. (58) 117) to which were annexed draft instructions to the captain of the Fishery Protection Squadron on the protection of British trawlers fishing on the high seas within any extended limit claimed bythe Icelandic Government, together with draft instructions to be givenby the owners of the trawlers to their skippers.In discussion of the draft Government declaration the followingpoints were made :  (a) Paragraph 2 should be omitted from the statement itself andits substance should be provided as background information for thePress.(b) The opening sentences of paragraph 3 should be redrafted inorder to lay the initial emphasis on the fact that the Icelandic claimhad no legal effect under international law. It would then follow thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government could not recognise the claim,(c) The last sentence of paragraph 3 should be redrafted in orderto make it clear that the Government would use force to protect british fishing vessels on the high seas only if Icelandic vessels usedforce against them.(d) The last sentence of paragraph 5 should be amended by substituting the words &quot; adhered to their view that&quot; for the words&quot; believed that.&quot;(e) The statement might need further amendment in the light ofthe precise claim made by the Icelandic Government. It should beissued immediately after any such claim was published; and discussions with the British fishing industry should also be initiatedas soon as the nature of the claim was known, in order to secure their co-operation in the measures which we proposed to take for their protection and to restrain them from any provocative action.(/) The Australian Government were strongly opposed to anyunilateral claim to extended fishing rights and might be willing togive public support to our declaration.In further discussion on the draft instructions to our fishery protection Squadron and to trawler skippers, the following points were made:  (g) The words &quot; across her bows&quot; should be deleted fromparagraphs 6 and 7 of Annex A to C. (58) 117.(h) The effect of paragraphs 7 and 10 was that our fishery protection ships would be instructed not to open fire with liveammunition if an Icelandic vessel either refused to release an arrestedBritish trawler or herself opened fire. But while it was clearly desirable that they should refrain from using live ammunition for thepurpose only of enforcing orders to release a British vessel, it wouldbe difficult to justify restraining them from the exercise of their rightto retaliate if they were attacked on the high seas. They should,therefore, be authorised to fire live ammunition if, but only if. they themselves or British trawlers were fired upon and only after they had given three clear warnings to the Icelandic vessel. Moreover, theirfire should be directed to disabling the vessel&apos;s guns and not to sinkingthe vessel herself.(0 In paragraph 9 the words &apos;&apos; unless the Icelanders used themfirst &apos;* should be retained and the paragraph should be incorporatedwith, or follow, paragraph 5.The terms of the draft instructions to British trawler skippers at annex B of C. (58) 117 were approved.
Commercial 4.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the ChancellorPolicy. of the Exchequer (C. (58) 114) and the Paymaster-General (C. (58)Free Trade 110 and 115) on the possibility of making some concessions in dealingArea. with the problems of origin in the Free Trade Area negotiations.(Previous The Paymaster-General said that the political situation in FranceReference:       made it difficult to foresee the future attitude of the FrenchC.C. (58) 28th   Government to the Treaty of Rome and the Free Trade Area.   in conclusions,    these  circumstances  it  would   be  desirable  to  defer  furtherMinute 2.)       consideration of the problems of origin until French policy becameclearer.   Discussion of these problems with Commonwealth officials should also be reserved for the later stages of the series of meetingsdue to begin on 2nd June.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to defer their discussion of C. (58) 110, 114 and 115until a later meeting.(2) Invited the Paymaster-General to keep them informed of developments in the international discussions about theproposed European Free Trade Area.PostageStamps.(previous reference:CM. (56) 44thConclusions,Minute 9.)Commemora-tion of RobertBurns.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster-General (C. (58) 105) about a proposal by the BurnsFederation for the issue of a special stamp to mark the bicentenaryof the birth of Robert Burns. This proposal had also been the subjectof representations to the Prime Minister by a deputation from bothHouses of Parliament in association with officers of the Federation.The Postmaster-General said that the suggestion ran counterboth to accepted practice and to the views of the Post Office AdvisoryCouncil. The head of the Sovereign had always been the dominatingfeature of our stamps and it was unthinkable that a representationC.C. 45 (58)The Cabinet ( (1) Agreed that, if the Icelandic Government made a unilateralclaim to extended fishing rights, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should make a public declaration on thelines of the draft annexed to C. (58) 116, subject to the amendments agreed in their discussion and to such further amendments as might be necessary in the light of the precise scope of the Icelandic claim.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the attorney-General, to submit the final draft of thedeclaration to the Prime Minister for his approval.(3) Invited the Attorney-General, in consultation with the FirstLord of the Admiralty, to submit to the Prime Ministerfor his approval the final draft of the instructions to the captain of the Fishery Protection Squadron, revised onthe lines agreed in their discussion.(4) Approved the draft instructions to British trawler skippersin Annex B to C. (58) 117.(5) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, as soon as the nature ofthe Icelandic claim was known, to seek to secure theco-operation of the fishing industry in the measures whichit was proposed to take for the protection of trawlers.(6) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to consider whetherthe Australian Government should be invited, in the eventof an Icelandic claim to extended fishing rights, publiclyto endorse our policy.
of a private person should be placed beside that of the Sovereign.Moreover, any breach of the principle that a postage stamp shouldnot commemorate a private person would establish a precedentwhich many other nationalist and partisan interests would seek to turn to advantage; and the experience of the United States Govern-ment, who issued a certain number of special stamps each year,provided sufficient evidence of the invidious nature of the task ofselecting the individuals to be commemorated in this way. Finally,there was good reason to believe that the majority of Scottish opinion was opposed to the issue of a Burns commemorative stamp.In discussion there was general agreement with these views. Itwas suggested, however, that it might be desirable to allow letters tobe franked in commemoration of the bicentenary of the birth ofBurns, provided that the cost of franking was reimbursed by someappropriate organisation and that the arrangement was not associatedwith Scottish Nationalist sentiment.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a special stamp should not be issued tocommemorate the bicentenary of the birth of RobertBurns.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would reply accordingly,at the appropriate moment, to the representations whichhe had received on this subject.(3) Invited the Postmaster-General to consider the possibility ofcommemorating the bicentenary by allowing letters to befranked appropriately, subject to reimbursement of any expenditure involved.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23 rd May, 1958.
