CC. 77 (58)emergency powers.(previous reference :CC. (58) 62ndConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord Chancellor(C. (58) 215) to which was annexed a draft White Paper on emergency Legislation.The Lord Chancellor said that the Emergency Laws (Repeal)Bill, which was to be introduced at the beginning of the new session,was likely to prove controversial and it was therefore desirable thatit should be accompanied by a White Paper describing its provisions and indicating the political philosophy which justified them. the text accordingly affirmed that, in the opinion of the Government,Regulations should not remain in being which could be used as a means of introducing far-reaching economic controls without specificlegislative sanction and that it was the Governments intention tosweep away the emergency legislation which provided authority forthe Regulations, to provide fresh legislative authority for the powersstill required and to limit those powers strictly.In discussion it was suggested that it might be wise to amend the wording of certain passages in Part I of the White Paper which,quoted out of their context, might be used to misrepresent theGovernment as sacrificing economic realism to a doctrinaire politicalphilosophy. It might also be considered improper to take politicalcredit, in a document presented by the Government to Parliament, forthe great reduction in emergency powers which the present Govern-ment had already effected. Certain drafting amendments were agreed with a view to meeting these criticisms.In further discussion the Cabinet were informed that agreement had been reached on the legal power to vary Regulations and on theretention of power to control hire-purchase transactions, and that onthese two points only minor drafting amendments were required.The Cabinet Approved the draft White Paper on Emergency Legislationannexed to C. (58) 215, subject to the amendments agreed in their discussion and such other drafting amendments as might be necessary, and authorised its publication on29th October.Cyprus. 2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Foreign(Previous        Secretary and the Colonial Secretary (C. (58) 216) about the pendingReferences:     application by the Greek Government to the European Human RightsCC. (58) 75th   Commission in connection with a number of cases of alleged ill-Conclusions,    treatment by the security forces in Cyprus.   The hearing of this minute 1, and   application was to be resumed on 12th November and the Sub-C.C. (57) 78th   Commission concerned might decide, under pressure from the GreekConclusions,    Government, to take oral evidence either in Cyprus or at Strasbourg.Minute 9.)       If we refused to co-operate in making witnesses available, we shouldHuman Rights. ^e m Dreacfi of the Human Rights Convention, and the damage to our international reputation might be serious.   On the other hand, therewas little doubt that, if we conceded the point, the morale of the armed Forces and the police in Cyprus would be seriously affected and the task of maintaining public order in the Island would becomeeven more difficult.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the Council of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) had not yet reached agreement on the composition of the proposed conference on thefuture of Cyprus. They were at present considering alternative proposals, that the conference should consist of representatives ofthe United Kingdom, Turkish and Greek Governments, togetherwith either the Secretary-General of N.A.T.O. alone or the Secretary-General and representatives of two other Governments, probably the
steel&apos; 3.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterLocation of of Power (C. (58) 212) on the location of the proposed new steel stripNew Works.      mill.(Previous The Minister of Power said that, as an alternative to the proposalReference: discussed earlier by the Cabinet that the new plant should be sitedC.C. (58) 44th either in Wales or in Scotland, he now suggested, after consultationConclusions, with the Iron and Steel Board, that one-third of the new capacityMinute 6.) (i million tons) should be located at Ravenscraig, near Glasgow, andthe other two thirds (^ million tons) at Newport. The total cost would be of the order of  130-140 millions, the major part of whichwould need to be provided by the Exchequer. The Ravenscraigproject, which would be operated by Colvilles, would probably meetthe whole of Scotland&apos;s needs for strip steel but would be capableof further expansion if necessary. He was satisfied, however, that thebalance of the required capacity should be located in Wales and that,of the various possible Welsh sites Newport, Swansea andKidwelly Newport was the most advantageous. The site at Swanseawould not easily accommodate a further expansion of the plant infuture, if necessary. The site at Kidwelly could be developed only atthe expense of sterilising some 900 million tons of coal. Newportsuffered from neither disadvantage; and it offered the prospect ofa lower unit cost of production than any other site. These arguments in favour of selecting Newport were reinforced by the fact that itwould be preferable that the new plant should be operated byRichard Thomas and Baldwins, Ltd., in association with their existingworks at Ebbw Vale, rather than by the Steel Company of Wales.The latter already enjoyed a considerable preponderance of strip-millcapacity in the country; and, although they might be prepared tocontribute from profits one-third of the cost of the new plant, itwould be indefensible that the Exchequer should finance the greaterpart of a further enlargement of a de-nationalised company in whichit had already invested over  100 millions. Richard Thomas and baldwins, Ltd., on the other hand, remained a State-ownedundertaking, which might reasonably look to the Exchequer for any additional finance that it might require.United States and Norway. But it was not yet certain that the GreekGovernment would agree to the holding of a conference at all.There was general agreement that, if the N.A.T.O. conference was still in prospect or actually in progress at the time when theSub-Commission of the European Human Rights Commissionresumed their hearing of the Greek Application, its chances of successwould be liable to be seriously prejudiced if the Sub-Commissiondecided to summon witnesses. In those circumstances we should useall available arguments to oppose the taking of oral evidence. If,however, it became clear before 12th November that the N.AT.O.conference on Cyprus would not take place, the question might need to be reconsidered.The Cabinet (1) Approved, in principle, the proposals in C. (58) 216.(2) Agreed that, if it became clear before 12th November thatthe proposed conference on Cyprus under the auspices of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation would not beheld, it would be desirable to give further considerationto the Governmenfs attitude towards the examinationof witnesses by the Sub-Commission of the EuropeanHuman Rights Commission in their resumed hearing of greek allegations of ill-treatment by the security forcesin Cyprus.
In discussion a general welcome was extended to these proposals,which struck a fair balance between the claims of Scotland and thoseof Wales and between the interests of private enterprise and those ofpublic ownership. The decision would not receive unqualifiedapproval in Scotland, where organised labour would still press forthe whole of the additional capacity to be located at Grangemouth.Scottish public opinion would probably be reconciled to the new proposals, however, when it was realised that the Ravenscraig projectwould increase the capacity of Colvilles by 340,000 tons of other products as well as by 250,000 tons of sheet steel and would be soplanned as to allow further expansion in the future. In Wales thesociological arguments in favour of Swansea or Kidwelly wereadmittedly stronger than those for Newport, where there was already a shortage of labour, and it would not be easy to justify the grant ofan Industrial Development Certificate. But these considerations were outweighed by the economic advantages of Newport, which was likely to become one of the major commercial and industrial centres of the country.In further discussion it was suggested that there might be advantage, from the point of view of opinion in Scotland, in announcing the Ravenscraig project separately and in advance of theremainder of the scheme. On balance, however, it would be preferable that the proposals should be announced as a whole andat the earliest possible date. It was unlikely that the arrangements with Colvilles could be completed before the Debate on the Address;but it might be possible to give some indication of the governments intentions, in general terms, during that Debate.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (58) 212.(2) Invited the Minister of Power, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to consider the form and timing of an appropriate announcement.4. The Home Secretary said that opinion among the government&apos;s supporters remained in favour of early legislation to repeal section 88 of the Representation of the People Act, 1949,which restricted the number of cars which might be used on behalfof a candidate to take voters to the poll at a Parliamentary Election.There was also a strong case on merits for such legislation. Therestriction had been widely evaded at the General Election of 1955and section 88 was falling into increasing disrepute. It had been ascertained that the Labour Opposition would resist its repeal; but since the Government could claim in support of their proposal therecommendation of the Speakefs Conference on Electoral reform in 1944, they would be on strong ground in introducing a Bill forthis purpose.In discussion it was suggested that the proposed legislation would entail no electoral, benefit for the Government and that its introduction in the last full session of the present Parliament wouldbe open to misrepresentation which might operate to the Govern-menfs disadvantage during a General Election. On the other hand,the Government would be entitled to claim that their proposalsrepresented a progressive and realistic adjustment of electoral law tothe circumstances of modern life, in which a large proportion of the electorate owned cars, and that the Opposition were adopting aretrograde attitude in seeking to maintain a restriction which wa;out of date in the light of current social conditions.SECRET54550-1 B 3Elections.Use of Cars.(previous reference:C.C.

Housing 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterPolicy. of Housing (C. (58) 217) reporting that agreement had been reached(Previous with representatives of the building societies on the details of a schemeReference: to assist house purchase through the agency of the societies, includingC.C.

(58) 217.agricultural policy.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 66thConclusions,Minute 7.)6. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C. (58) 214) covering a draft White Paper on assistance for small farmers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the text of the white paper had been approved by the Committee on the Farm Price review and it was desirable that it should be published as soon as possible.Provision had been made for the necessary legislation in theprogramme for the forthcoming session.In discussion it was suggested that the White Paper might causesome disappointment among those small farmers who would not be eligible to benefit from the Governmenfs proposals. On balance,however, its provisions should be welcomed as further evidence ofthe Governmenfs concern to promote a steady improvement in the competitive strength of agriculture.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the text of the draft White Paper on assistance for small farmers, annexed to C. (58) 214.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Agriculture to arrange for its publication at an earlydate.Armed Forces.(previous reference:CM. (56) 2ndConclusions,Minute 5.)FamilyPensions.7. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Defence (C. (58) 219) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C. (58) 221) about family pensions in the Armed Forces.  .The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that while he was preparedto accept the increased scale of benefits proposed by the AdvisoryCommittee on Recruiting, he could not agree that the improvedscheme should remain on a non-contributory basis, as the Minister ofDefence suggested. Such a change would represent a retreat fromthe Governmenfs declared intention that any future revision of the family pensions of the Forces would place it on a contributory basis.The Cabinet-Agreed in principle that legislation to repeal section 88 ofthe Representation of the People Act, 1949, should beintroduced in the forthcoming session of Parliament.
Egypt.financial negotiations.(previous reference:CC. (58) 67thConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had ascertained that Mr. Black, the President of the International Bank, would beprepared to assist in resolving the present deadlock in the Anglo-Egyptian financial negotiations if he received a request to this effect from both Governments. The Egyptian Government had already indicated that they would welcome mediation by Mr. Black; and itappeared to the Foreign Secretary and himself that it would be toour own advantage to accept such an arrangement provided that thenegotiations were conducted on an informal basis and were given as little publicity as possible. This would leave us some freedomof manoeuvre as regards acceptance of any settlement which mr. Black might propose but we ourselves might not find whollyacceptable. For example, Mr. Black was likely to suggest that the lump sum payment by the Egyptian Government should be spreadover a rather longer period than we ourselves should wish and shouldbe discharged, at least to some extent, in the form of securities withvarying dates of maturity. We should need to consider such aproposal with care before committing ourselves to accept it. Weshould also need to maintain our insistence that a settlement betweenthe Shell Oil Company and the Egyptian Government should bereached simultaneously with, or as part of, the general settlementCC. 77 (58)It would also be in direct conflict with the general policy that provisionfor old age should be on a contributory basis and with the fact thatall other Crown servants who enjoyed family pension schemes were required to contribute to them. It would therefore involve the riskof widespread and expensive repercussions in other parts of the publicservice.The Minister of Defence said that the Advisory Committee on recruiting had specifically recommended that the non-contributory basis of the scheme should continue. The administrative difficultiesof a contributory scheme would be serious. Most of the men in the ranks did not serve long enough to earn pensions, and much effort would be wasted in returning contributions which had been deducted from pay. The only practicable alternative would be to deductcontributions from the grant which long-service officers and menreceived on retirement; but this abatement of a grant which was designed to assist the transition to civil life would provoke legitimatepresentment and would damage recruiting. The danger of reper-cussions could be minimised if it was emphasised that Service pensionshad never been contributory and that this principle was designed,together with other features of the conditions of service, to compensate for some of the inevitable disadvantages of a career inthe Armed Forces.In discussion there was general agreement that, in the interestsof Service morale and of recruiting, it would be desirable to maintainthe non-contributory basis of the family pensions scheme of theForces, provided that further examination suggested that the risk of widespread repercussions in the rest of the public service could be discounted.The Cabinet Approved in principle the proposals i ii C. (58) 219, subjectto further consideration by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,in consultation with the Ministers concerned, of the riskof repercussions in the remainder of the public service ifthe family pensions scheme of the Armed Forces remainedon a non-contributory basis after the introduction of the improvements recommended by the Advisory Committee on recruiting.
EconomicSituation.(previous references:C.C. (58) 74thConclusions,Minute 3, andC.C. (58) 66thConclusions,Minute 10.)*9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (58) 211) on the current position andforward prospects of the economy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Governmenfseconomic policy had three main objectives to sustain the strength of sterling; to achieve stability of prices; and to maintain a high and stable level of employment. As a result of the measures taken duringthe previous 12 months substantial progress had been made towardsthe first two of these objectives; and, as the risk of inflation was nowconsiderably less than a year ago, it was now possible to contemplatea further adjustment of economic policy designed specifically to check the growth of unemployment. Any measures adopted for this purposemust be related to a situation in which both exports and industrial production were declining and would probably continue to decline;consumer expenditure was higher than ever before and was likely toremain buoyant; and investment, while rising in the public sector,might tend to decline slightly in the private sector, particularly in manufacturing industry. In the light of these tendencies, it was reasonable to assume that unemployment might rise to a level of600,000 at the beginning of 1959. On the other hand confidenceappeared to be reviving as a result of the renewed expansion in theUnited States, the successive relaxations of our credit policy and theoptimistic forecasts of an expansion in world trade and investment which had been expressed both in the Organisation for european economic Co-operation and during the recent Commonwealth Tradeand Economic Conference at Montreal. Unemployment would normally fall during the spring, and the Government should seek to assist and accelerate this tendency by introducing suchexpansionary measures as would take rapid effect without revivinginflationary pressure in 1960.The Government had already taken action which would contribute substantially to this purpose. Bank Rate had beenreduced; the restrictions on credit and on hire-purchase transactionshad been eased; public investment programmes had been enlarged;special steps had been taken to assist particular areas in which therewas a specially high level of unemployment; and arrangements hadbeen made to finance an increase in exports to other commonwealth countries. Further action should be considered under three mainheads:  (i) Exports. We might take the initiative in offering to make available five-year credits under Section 3 of the Export GuaranteesAct for financing additional exports, provided that orders werebetween the two Governments. Mr. Black had initially been unwilling to concern himself with the claim of the Shell Company:but arrangements were being made for him to have discussions withthe Company in London and he might be induced to extend his efforts to promote the solution of this issue as well.In discussion there was general support for these proposals,provided that the negotiations undertaken by Mr. Black were attended by the minimum of publicity and were regarded as being in the natureof mediation rather than arbitration.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Foreign Secretary, to seek to arrange for mr. Black, the President of the International Bank, to use his good offices in promoting a settlement of the outstanding issues in the Anglo-Egyptian financial negotiations.
In discussion the Cabinet were informed that since mid-September unemployment had risen by a further 38,000 to a level of514,000, or 2-3 per cent. This increase was larger than the normalseasonal rise at this period of the year; and unemployment had nowrisen above the level of 500,000 for the first time since the end ofthe war. The recent increase in the seasonally adjusted figure ofunfilled vacancies gave some grounds for cautious optimism; but itwould be prudent to assume that unemployment might rise to about625,000, or 2-9 per cent., in the early months of 1959, although it was unlikely to exceed 3 per cent. Thereafter, in the absence of anyfurther stimulus to production, it would follow the normal seasonalcourse and was likely to remain at an average level of about 550,000during the year.It was suggested that in the light of these latest developments the economic outlook was more forbidding than the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer had suggested. The steel industry was suffering amarked recession; and the decline in the international freight marketmade it unlikely that ship-building orders would revive for at leastanother 12 months. Local authorities were still adopting a cautiousattitude towards building, under the influence of the 6 per cent,interest rate currently charged by the Public Works Loans Boardand the restrictive circular which had been issued by the Ministry of housing and Local Government in the context of the disinflationary measures adopted in the previous autumn. These factors indicated that there was room in the economy for a significant expansion ofproduction; but it was important that any measures taken to stimulatesuch an expansion should not be such as would subject the balanceof payments to renewed pressure or restrict in advance the freedomof manoeuvre which the Chancellor of the Exchequer would wish toplaced rapidly. Such facilities might be extended to the Colonies,to some of the independent members of the Commonwealth andpossibly to selected foreign countries.(ii) Investment. Apart from measures which should properly be reserved for the Budget, the only stimulus to private investment which could be applied at short notice would be a further reductionin Bank Rate. Public investment had already benefited from theadditional allocation of  30 millions authorised during the summer;and total public investment during the current year should be some 35 millions higher than the upper limit which had been imposed aspart of the disinflationary measures adopted in the previous autumn.It had already been agreed that, for the following year, public investment should be increased by  75 millions; and, as a result of a survey of the possibility of accelerating projects scheduled for 1960-61,this figure might be increased to  125 millions. Employment might thus be provided for an additional labour force of 50,000 to 70,000men in 1959.(iii) Consumption. Consumer expenditure was already at a record height, and any further measures affecting it should be sodevised as to ensure that they would not recreate an excessive levelof demand which would disturb the relative stability of prices whichhad now been achieved. It might be desirable, however, to considera relaxation of the remaining hire-purchase controls (which affectedmainly cars, wireless and television sets and household durable goods)or some acceleration in the release of post-war credits. The last of these possible measures had the disadvantages that it would involve legislation and might undermine confidence by creating the impression that the Government foresaw a serious recession. On the other handits impact on the economy would be direct, immediate and non-recurrent.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th October, 1958.retain in the Budget of 1959. It was for consideration whethermeasures could be devised which, while avoiding these risks, would ensure that the increase in unemployment at the beginning of 1959would be less serious than at present appeared likely.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of the economic situation at a subsequent meeting.
