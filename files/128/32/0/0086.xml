 TO/CC. 86 (58)Cyprus. 1.   The Cabinet were informed that on the previous day the(Previous       Foreign Ministers of Greece and Turkey had made a joint appeal to reference:      the Foreign Secretary, in Paris, for the exercise of clemency towardsCC. (58) 80th two Greek Cypriots who were under sentence of death in Cyprus.Conclusions,    In connection with this appeal they had indicated that there was nowMinute l.)      some prospect that their Governments might be able to put forward in the next few days joint proposals for a settlement of the dispute over the future government and status of the Island. These facts hadbeen communicated to the Governor of Cyprus late on the previous evening; and, in consideration of them, he had decided to commutethe death sentences.The Governor had now suggested that he should make it plain,in a public statement, that his decision had been influenced by a desireto improve political relations between Greece and Turkey.In discussion it was pointed out that it would be contrary toprecedent for the Governor to offer any public explanation of thereasons which had influenced his decision in the exercise of the prerogative of mercy. It was agreed that it would be dangerous to depart from precedent on this occasion.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the circumstances in which the Governor of cyprus had decided to commute the death sentences onthese two Greek Cypriots.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to instruct the Governor thathe should refrain from making any public statement aboutthe reasons which had influenced him in reaching thisdecision.InternationalWhalingConvention.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries (C. (58) 254) about the International Whaling Convention.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, for purposes ofconservation, the Convention prescribed a limit to the aggregateannual catch of whales by all the countries which were parties to it.Within this total each country was free to secure as large a catchas it could. The economic conditions of the whaling industry were,however, gradually deteriorating and, on the initiative of the UnitedKingdom, representatives of the other four countries principally concerned Norway, Japan, the Netherlands and the Soviet Union had agreed to recommend to their Governments a scheme of fleetlimitation, under which the Soviet Union would not build more than three new whaling fleets in addition to their present one and the othercountries would not increase their present fleets, together with a quotascheme under which the Soviet Union would be entitled to 20 per cent.,of the aggregate catch authorised by the Convention and theremaining 80 per cent, would be divided between the other four countries in proportions to be agreed between them. This agreement would serve our own interests but it could not come into force unlessthe Governments concerned ratified it and reached agreement on theindividual quotas before 1st June, 1959. The United kingdom industry were doubtful whether this could be achieved; and they therefore proposed that before the end of the year we should give notice of our intention to withdraw from the International WhalingConvention, on the understanding that if agreement on quotas wasreached, the notice would be rescinded before it came into effect on30th June, 1959. The purpose of this proposal was to put pressure on the other countries to reach an agreement on quotas and tosafeguard our position, if agreement was not reached, by enabling usto engage in unregulated competition for whaling catches. If we were
not so safeguarded, the consequences of failure to reach an agreement on quotas would be liable to be serious. One of the Scottish whalingfleets might be compelled to withdraw, and over 200 men would beseasonally unemployed in an area in which unemployment was already high.In discussion it was suggested that, if we gave notice of withdrawl from an international convention on conservation whichhad been in force for many years, we might jeopardise our attempts to persuade the Government of Iceland to negotiate a settlement ofthe current fisheries dispute and might also prejudice our position at the next international conference on the law of the sea. Moreover,it was doubtful whether, by giving notice to withdraw from theConvention, we should in fact succeed in persuading the othercountries to reach an agreement on quotas. If we gave notice of withdrawl and no agreement was reached, we should be to someextent protected from competition for the time being; but we shouldalso forfeit the benefit of the Soviet agreement to accept a limitationof the Soviet share of the aggregate catch to 20 per cent. If, on theother hand, we did not give notice of withdrawal and no quotaagreement was reached, the Soviet Union might nevertheless accept that limitation for the next fishing season, during which a quotaagreement might be negotiated. Meanwhile, our own industry couldbe assured that, if these objectives were not achieved, we would give notice before the end of 1959 of our intention to withdraw from theConvention. Finally, it was possible that one of the other countries concerned in the proposed quota agreement would give notice of withdrawl from the Convention. This would create a new situationin which a decision by ourselves to take corresponding action mighthave less damaging results.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of advantage appeared to lie in refraining from taking theinitiative in giving notice to withdraw from the Convention.  Every1959, and the position should be reconsidered if, in the meantime,one of the other Governments gave notice of withdrawal.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries to endeavour to secure agreement, by 1st June, 1959, between the UnitedKingdom, Norway, Japan and the Netherlands on thenational quotas to be fixed under the agreement reached at the recent London conference on international whaling.(2) Agreed that the United Kingdom Government should not give notice of withdrawal from the International WhalingConvention before 31st December, 1958.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries to submit the issues to theCabinet afresh if one of the other parties to the Conventiongave notice of withdrawal.territorial waters.IcelandicFishery Limits.(previous references:CC. (58) 76thConclusions,Minute 3and 71stConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the Icelandicrepresentative on the North Atlantic Council was likely to raise thecurrent fisheries dispute between Iceland and ourselves during thecurrent meeting of the Council and to appeal to us to withdraw our naval forces from Icelandic waters while negotiations took place.The Foreign Secretary had therefore proposed that we should takethe initiative in suggesting that, if the Government of Iceland would withdraw their fishery protection vessels outside the 6-mile limit,we would withdraw naval protection from our trawlers as an interim arrangement during negotiations.After discussion with the Ministers concerned he had reachedthe conclusion that it might be to our tactical advantage to put
commercial policy.Free trade area.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 84thConclusions,Minute 5.)forward a proposal on these lines and he had therefore authorised theForeign Secretary to act accordingly.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers statement.4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet ofthe course of the discussion, at the recent meeting of the ministerial council of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation(O.E.E.C.) under his chairmanship, about the negotiations for theestablishment of a European Free Trade Area. The Council, after taking note of the fact that these negotiations had broken down andexpressing the hope that it might be possible for them to be resumed,had considered the proposals put forward by the Six Powers for an interim modus vivendi until a long-term solution to the problem couldbe found. These proposals had been criticised by the countries whichwere not parties to the Treaty of Rome and the United kingdom delegation had then advanced our own counter-proposal that anyenlargements of import quotas which the Six Powers extended to one another from 1st January, 1959, should be extended, on a non-discriminatory and reciprocal basis, to all other members of O.E.E.C.This suggestion had provoked some divergence of opinion among the six Powers themselves, which they had only been able to resolve bysuggesting that our proposals should be the subject of more detailed examination by O.E.E.C. during the early months of 1959. TheUnited Kingdom delegation had then been compelled to indicatethat, if the discriminatory system implicit in the Common market was to be established as from 1st January and our own counter-proposal was to be left in suspense for a further period, we must reserve our right to adjust our commercial policy in self-defence.The French representative had reacted strongly to this statement andhad indicated that his Government would not negotiate under duress.But subsequent discussion had made it clear that all the othermembers of the Organisation dissociated themselves, with varying degrees of conviction, from the intransigent attitude of the FrenchGovernment; and it had finally been agreed that the ministerial council should reassemble on 15th January, that in the intervalO.E.E.C. should give further consideration to the probableconsequences of the proposals put forward by the Six Powers for an interim modus vivendi and to our own counter-proposal, and thatwe ourselves should refrain from any retaliatory action untilmid-January.In discussion there was general agreement that the outcome ofthe meeting was not unsatisfactory. We had now achieved theinitiative in the further discussions; and we had also mobilisedconsiderable goodwill for our own proposal. The countries whichwere not parties to the Treaty of Rome had given us their completesupport; and, since we had secured agreement to the derestrictionof the relevant documents, we could now consider the publication ofa White Paper designed to demonstrate to world opinion the reasonable and constructive character of our policy. It was forconsideration whether we should also address a note to the SixPowers, emphasising that the French Government, by admitting thatdiscrimination was an essential feature of the Common Market, haddemonstrated that their own policy was at variance with the basic principles of a European Free Trade Area of the kind which we hadbeen concerned to establish. On the other hand, a statement of thiskind might be to our tactical disadvantage in present circumstances.There was now considerable support, even among the Six Powersthemselves, for the conception that the principle of non-discriminationshould be firmly re-established in the economic life of Europe, andwe should seek to turn this spirit to our advantage by formally
EconomicSituation.(previous references:C.C. (58) 83rdConclusions,Minute 5and 78thConclusions.)*5. The Chancellor oj the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that,during the recent meeting of the Ministerial Council of theOrganisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.), hehad had an opportunity to discuss with the Finance Ministers ofFrance and Germany our proposal to unify the official andtransferable rates for sterling. It was well known that sterlingconvertibility was the ultimate objective of our external financial policy, which we had been steadily approaching for some time.International opinion was now expecting that we should take the decisive step of unifying the rates in the near future; and the Bankof England were strongly in favour, on technical grounds, of ourdoing so. Convertibility should work to our advantage, by reinforcingconfidence in sterling; and it would not significantly impair our ability to withstand any future pressure on the rate of exchange since,even in present conditions, the margin of elasticity provided by asystem of dual rates was slight and we could not afford to allow the transferable rate to fall by more than a small amount without being compelled to support it. At an earlier stage it had seemed possible that, if we unified the rates at this particular juncture inthe negotiations for the creation of a European Free Trade Area, theFrench Government would regard it as a hostile act, directed toaggravating their own financial difficulties, and would accordinglybecome even more reluctant to co-operate in the Free Trade Areaproject. But more recent information had indicated that they themselves were thinking of making the franc convertible in the nearfuture; and, during his discussions in Paris, he had been able to confirm that they would welcome the convertibility of sterling andwould be prepared to take corresponding action themselves in relationto the franc. He had also learned that the German Governmentwould follow our lead as regards their own currency and that theyPreviously recorded in a Confidential Annex.tabling our counter-proposal in O.E.E.C. as rapidly as possible. Weshould also demonstrate our desire to reach agreement by being prepared to enlarge nil or negligible quotas throughout the whole range of industrial goods with the minimum of exceptions. our objective should be to seek to secure agreement in O.E.E.C. on measures which would ensure that, as from 15th January, 1959, quotadiscrimination in Europe would be reduced to a minimum. In thelight of the success of our efforts to this end it would then be necessaryto decide whether the residual degree of discrimination could beaccepted or whether it would involve such damage to our interests that, rather than accept it, we should finally break off negotiations and face the prospect of commercial warfare between ourselves andthe Common Market.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Chancellorof the Exchequer about the recent discussions on a european Free Trade Area at the meeting of the ministerial Council of the Organisation for european economic Co-operation.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe President of the Board of Trade, to define in detail theproposals which we wished to put forward as analternative to the interim modus vivendi proposed by the six Powers and to instruct the United kingdom permanent Representative at O.E.E.C. to table theseproposals as rapidly as possible.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the President of the Board of Trade and the paymaster-General, to consider the desirability of publishing a White Paper on our policy for the creationof a European Free Trade Area.
Cotton.Imports.(previous reference:CC. (58) 84thConclusions,Minute 8.)6. The Prime Minister said that, following further discussionwith the Chairman of the Cotton Board, he proposed that theGovernor of Hong Kong should be instructed to offer the Hong Kongtextile industry the choice between two alternative methods of limiting their exports to the United Kingdom. The first method would ensure them an allocation of 115 million square yards forpiece-goods during each of the following three years and an additional3 million square yards as a &quot; permissive &quot; ceiling for yarn dyed clothand towelling, together with arrangements whereby any shortfall onthe annual allocation of piece-goods could be carried forward foruse within the subsequent six months. Alternatively, if theycontinued to insist on a system of formal escalation, the annualallocations for piece-goods in the following three years would be110, 112-i- and 115 million square yards, together with 3 million square yards for yarn dyed cloth and towelling but without any arrangementsfor carrying forward any part of the allocation which was not utilisedCC. 86 (58)would be prepared to offer a substantial loan to the FrenchGovernment if, as seemed likely, the franc was devalued at the sametime as it became convertible. He had therefore suggested that theCentral Banks of the United Kingdom, France and Germany should consider the technical implications of a decision by the three governments to move simultaneously to full convertibility of theirrespective currencies, with particular regard to the substitution of theEuropean Monetary Agreement for the European Payments Union.If it appeared, as a result of these technical discussions, that theoperation could be successfully carried out, there would be advantage in arranging for it to take place towards the end of the month. Itwould be necessary, however, to ensure that the other members ofthe Commonwealth were given advance warning of our intention.It would also be necessary to reserve our right to keep under ourown control the rate at which we proceeded to remove discrimination against dollar imports. This step was the logical concomitant of sterling convertibility; but we had indicated, at the recentCommonwealth Trade and Economic Conference at Montreal, thatour action in this respect would be determined by the state of our balance of payments and the level of our reserves, and we should adhere firmly to this declaration.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal.Simultaneous action by ourselves, France and Germany would be welcome evidence of a community of purpose in this matter whichmight help to promote a more favourable atmosphere for the renewal of the negotiations on the Free Trade Area. Moreover, theFrench Government might have a greater incentive to collaborate inthose negotiations if, as a result of the action which they envisaged,a more stable level of internal prices was established in France. Onthe other hand, sterling convertibility on the basis of a fixed rate would demand the maintenance of a disinflationary economic policyin the United Kingdom; and this aspect of the proposal, together withthe progressive removal of dollar discrimination, would need to be presented with considerable care to public opinion in this country.The Cabinet Agreed that arrangements should be made to unify the sterling rates towards the end of the year, subject to, confirmation, in the light of detailed discussions betweenthe Central Banks of the United Kingdom, France andGermany, that this operation would be technically succesful and would be supported by corresponding action by theFrench and German Governments in relation to theirtheir respective currencies.
in the year to which it related. The Hong Kong industry woukUbe reminded once again that it was to their advantage to agree,before the end of the year, to a voluntary restriction on exports of textiles to the United Kingdom and it would be made clear to themthat, if they were unwilling to accept either of our suggestions, the pressure on the United Kingdom Government for the impositionof a compulsory quota on textile imports from the Colony might become irresistible. If, however, they would agree to one or other of the methods of limitation which we had in mind, we would use our good offices to persuade; the Cotton Board to acquiesce in anarrangement on these lines.Discussion showed&apos; that there was general agreement that theproposed alternatives constituted a fair offer to the Hong Kongindustry.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Governor of Hong Kong should be instructed to offer the Hong Kong textile industry a choice,to be exercised before the end of the year, between the twomethods of limiting their exports to the United kingdom which had been described by the Prime Minister during their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,18th December, 1958.
