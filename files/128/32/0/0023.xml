Bl&apos;it;sh *2.   The Minister of Labour said that the arbitration tribunalTransport       which had been considering the claims of the London busmen hadCommission.    awarded an increase of 85. 6d. a week to the drivers and conductors(Previous        of buses in central London.  This award could be regarded as reference:       satisfactory, in that it represented a departure from the practiceC.C. (58) 11th   of conceding an indiscriminate percentage increase in wages and conclusions,     confined the increase to those grades for whom the strongest caseMinute 8.)       could be made out on grounds of skill and intensity of work.  TheTransport and General Workers&apos; Union would probably seek to persuade the London Transport Executive to grant an increase in wages to the grades who would not benefit under the award; but, ifthis request was refused, it was unlikely that the union would have recourse to strike action.The Minister of Transport said that the award would involvethe Transport Executive in additional annual expenditure of theorder of  1 million. Of this sum, about  750,000 could be coveredby general economies and reductions in services, while the balancecould be met over a period by the progressive removal of minoranomalies in the fares structure. The Transport Executive did not intend to apply to the Transport Tribunal for permission to increasefares.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It would be desirable to emphasise, in guidance to the Press,that the award did not represent any acceptance of the union&apos;s claim that their members were entitled to an increase in pay on grounds of increased cost of living.(b) Although the award represented an increase of only some-2-j per cent, in the wages of all the grades covered by the claim, itconstituted an increase of 4 per cent, for the grades who would benefit from it. It would be important to ensure that this latter figure received the minimum of publicity and to avoid creating theimpression, particularly in relation to the impending wage claim by railway workers, that this selective award constituted a precedent for a general increase in wages by any particular percentage figure.(c) It could be argued that, if it appeared to remain uncertainfor a time whether the award would necessitate an increase in fares,the public disquiet on this point might be an additional factor inrestraining the union from invoking strike action. On the otherhand, it might be desirable, in the interests of the general policyof price stability, to allow it to become known forthwith that theTransport Executive would not apply for permission to increasefares, particularly since the oost-of-living index figure, to be published on the following day, would indicate that the cost of living had nowremained unchanged for four successive months.Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inSunday the House of Commons in the following week.Observance. ^ne jjome Secretary said that on the following day the House ofCommons would consider a Private Member&apos;s Motion proposing the appointment of a Select Committee to consider the revision orrepeal of the Sunday observance laws. He proposed that the reply on behalf of the Government should be confined to an undertaking that they would consider any resolution passed by the House.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Home Secretary&apos;sstatement.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernments attitude towards the award should be one of relativedetachment. In particular, they should avoid implying that they regarded it as a victory for themselves as against the unions or as evidence that they had now succeeded in inducing arbitrators toco-operate in enforcing the disinflationary policy. It should be made clear that the cost of the award would not be met by any increasein the scale of Exchequer assistance to the Transport Executive butthat, for the rest, it now lay with the parties to the dispute to decide whether they would accept the .award and, if so, how its financial implications should be met.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Labour and the Minister ofTransport to see that the points noted in the cabinets discussion were brought out in public comment on theaward.Meeting of 3.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the progressHeads of        of his discussions with the United States Government on theGovernment.    proposed meeting of Heads of Government.  The reply finally sent(Previous        by the United States Government to the latest Soviet Note had been reference:       less negative and uncompromising than their original draft.   ButC.C. (58) 20th   there would be advantage in a further public restatement of theConclusions,     position of the Western Powers on positive lines; and he had minute 2.)       therefore asked the Foreign Secretary to discuss with the UnitedStates Secretary of State at Manila the draft of a statement whichhe had prepared for this purpose.   This draft reaffirmed that ameeting of Heads of Government was desirable, provided that therewas reasonable hope of reaching some agreement, even of limitedscope.  It suggested that the necessary preparatory work could best be performed at a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the fourBowers who had attended the Geneva Conference, and that thepurpose of this preparatory meeting would be not to reach decisionsbut to establish which questions were most likely to lead to some measure of agreement and which subjects required at least someserious discussion in view of the importance of the problemsthemselves.In discussion there was general agreement on the value of apublic statement on these lines, if it was sponsored jointly by theUnited States Government and ourselves There were indications that public opinion was beginning to appreciate that the Governmentwere genuine in their expression of willingness to participate in ameeting of Heads of Government but that our attitude wasnecessarily determined by the paramount importance of maintainingunity of purpose between the United States Government and ourselves. There was also reason to believe that the general public in the United States was less hostile than opinion in Congress to ameeting of Heads of Government.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th March, 1958.
