The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that theSecretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, whohad been invited to discuss with the Federal German Governmentthe financing of the local costs of British forces in Germany, had asked our Permanent Representative on the North Atlantic council for some indication of the level of financial support which we wouldbe prepared to accept if our claim was not satisfied in full. It wouldbe premature to provide this information at the present juncture,since previous experience suggested that any reduction in Ourdemands would be accepted by the German Government withoutany comparable concession on their part. Moreover, it would be unwise to volunteer any concession which might discourage theother members of the North Atlantic Council from maintainingpressure on the German Government in support of our claim. Inany event we had not yet considered what lower figure might be acceptable; and, although there was some indication that the GermanGovernment might be prepared to contribute about  25 millionsprovided that this payment was an element in a wider agreementdealing also with debt repayment and orders for munitions, it wouldbe preferable to await clarification of the exact scope of any arrangement of this kind before reaching a final decision on theminimum level of financial support for our forces in Germany whichwe could accept. There would be a further meeting of the Councilof the Western European Union on the following day, at which our proposal for the immediate withdrawal of a further 8,500 troops from Germany was likely to be unanimously approved.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be inadvisable at this stage to give any indication to the GermanGovernment that we should be prepared to accept a compromisesettlement of our claim in respect of financial support for our troopsin Germany during the coming financial year. On the other hand it was increasingly unlikely that the German Government would continue to make any contribution to the costs involved in subsequent years, and it would therefore be desirable to decide inthe near future the maximum Deutschemark expenditure which wecould afford next year, the number of troops which it would be practicable to withdraw immediately, and the level of forces whichwe could afford to retain in Germany in the absence of any financial52960-13b 21. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that thePrime Minister and the Foreign Secretary had concurred in principle in the proposal that the further reply to be sent by the Prime Ministerto Mr. Bulganin&apos;s letter of 9th January should be short and, whileinsisting on the need for adequate preparation before a meeting of heads of Government, should leave open the procedure by which such advance preparation should be carried out. They had also agreed that our own views on the main items for discussion shouldbe restated in a Ministerial speech shortly after the reply was published rather than in an- Annex to the reply. The foreign secretary had discussed the proposed reply, in Ankara, with theUnited States Secretary of State, who had reserved his views until he had been able to consult President Eisenhower.The United States Government had kept us informed of their negotiations with the Soviet Union on arrangements for improvingcultural exchanges. Despite the wide publicity which had been givento the recent United States agreement on this subject, it was doubtfulwhether the arrangements provided for any greater interchange incultural matters with the Soviet Union than we had already established as a result of the efforts of the British Council.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.
contribution to the local costs involved. Our objective should beto reach agreement with the German Government and with our allies in the North Atlantic Alliance on a long-term plan which would avoid an annual recurrence of disagreement on the financial aspect of the problem. Our Permanent Representative on the north atlantic Council should raise this matter formally at an early meeting.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Defence,to circulate a memorandum on the minimum acceptablecontribution by the German Government during thecoming financial year to the local costs involved inretaining British forces in Germany, the number of troops which it would be practicable to withdraw from germany in the near future and the level of British forces whichwe could afford to retain in Germany in the longer termin the absence of any financial contribution by theGerman Government.(2) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs(Mr. Ormsby-Gore) to arrange for the United kingdom permanent Representative on the North Atlantic Councilto bring formally before the Council at an early meetingthe importance of establishing satisfactory long-termarrangements covering the stationing of British forces inEurope.agricultural policy.(previous references:C.C. (57) 77thConclusions,Minute and 19thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the cabinet would shortly need to consider a number of important issues inrelation to agricultural policy. He proposed that the forthcomingannual review of farm prices should again be considered initiallyby a Ministerial Committee, who should define the main issues for submission to the Cabinet.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, that the Home Secretary wouldappoint a Ministerial Committee to consider the conductof the forthcoming annual review of farm prices.NationalInsuranceFund.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 8thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had considered further, in consultation with the Minister of Labour and the Ministerof National Insurance, the incidence of unemployment in 1958-59to be assumed for the purpose of calculating the deficit on theNational Insurance Fund in that year. The Minister of Labour had confirmed his earlier estimate that unemployment might rise to a level of 350,000, involving a deficit of  16 millions on the Fund.The Minister of National Insurance, however, considered that a deficit of only  14 millions could be properly assumed, mainly onthe ground that in past years the forecasts of unemployment hadbeen consistently over-estimated. In these circumstances the lower figure could perhaps be accepted.He had also reviewed the method of financing this deficit inthe light of the Cabinefs decision to increase the element in theNational Insurance contribution which was attributable to theNational Health Service. This decision made it unnecessary toconsider further the possibility of meeting the deficit on the fund in 1958-59 by realising some of its invested balances, particularly since it would be apparent to informed opinion that such action,
so far from constituting a genuine economy, would be inflationaryin its effects. Any public statement on this subject should, however,be so framed as not to exclude recourse to this method of financing the deficit in future years, when the economic objections to it mighthave less force.In discussion there was general agreement with these views. Itwas suggested, however, that there would be advantage in indicating that the future of the Fund must be considered in the context of theGovernments proposals for a new pensions scheme.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the emerging deficit on the National insurance fund in 1958-59 should be estimated at  14 millions.(2) Agreed that this deficit should be charged to Votes, withoutprejudice to the method which might be adopted to finance the deficit in subsequent years.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer,with the Minister of National Insurancedraft of a possible public statement on the future ofthe National Insurance Fund in relation to theGovernments proposals for a new pensions scheme.in consultationto circulate the arts Council.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 8thConclusions.Minute 3.)5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that informalenquiries had revealed that the Gulbenkian Foundation were unlikely to be disposed to supplement the Exchequer grant to the arts council, at least until they had received the report of the long-termenquiry which they had recently instituted into the whole problemof financial support for the arts in this country. In thesecircumstances it was possible that, if the Exchequer grant to theCouncil in the forthcoming year was restricted to  1 million, SachetsWells would be forced to close. On the other hand, to increase thegrant to  1-1 millions, some 10 per cent, above the current year&apos;sfigure, would invite pressure for further increases in future yearsand might be regarded as inconsistent with Government policy inrelation to public expenditure.In discussion it was suggested that the Arts Council might not,in fact, withdraw their support from Sadlets Wells if they were refused a grant of  1-1 millions. Indeed, it might be stipulated,as a condition of a grant of  1 million, that a due proportion of this sum should be devoted to Sadlets Wells. Such a step would,however, expose the Government to undesirable pressure from individual cultural bodies and would be contrary to the policy of using the Arts Council as the intermediary for the distribution ofGovernment assistance. Moreover, public opinion was alreadycritical of the extent to which Government assistance was devotedto the support of cultural activities in London, to the detriment ofother parts of the country.The Home Secretary, summing up the discussion, said that itwou]d be desirable to seek to establish, in further discussion withthe Arts Council, whether there was a genuine risk that Sadler&apos;s Wellswould close if the Exchequer grant to the Council was restricted to 1 million. In the light of the results of this enquiry it might benecessary for the Cabinet to give further consideration to this issue.The Cabinet -Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give furtherconsideration to the level of the Exchequer grant to the arts Council in 1958-59 in the light of a more detailedenquiry into the risk that Sadlets Wells would be compelled to close if the grant was restricted to  1 million.
6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (58) 22) on the possibility of securing ga substantial economy in public expenditure in respect of the Collcutt fTower.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, if the scheme to preserve this structure as part of the Imperial College of Sciencewas abandoned, a saving of some  160,000 would be secured. But,although the Government were not finally committed to the retentionof the tower, considerable controversy would be provoked by adecision to abandon the scheme. Moreover, the economy would notbe realised until 1960.In discussion it was pointed out that the retention of the towerserved no useful purpose and that the scale of the expenditure involved in preserving it might justify a reversal of the earlier decision. On the other hand this course would be represented asa breach of the spirit, if not the letter, of the compromise proposalformulated and announced in 1956. Moreover, it might entailfurther modification of the plans for the expansion of the ImperialCollege of Science, which would be liable not only to delay thecompletion of the building but also to result in an increase, ratherthan a decrease, in eventual expenditure.The Home Secretary, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of advantage appeared to lie in proceeding with the scheme.The question should, however, be kept under review in the light of developments in the economic situation.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that the existing scheme for preserving the Collcutt Tower as part of the Imperial College of science should be allowed to proceed.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to keep the matter under review in the light of developments in the economicsituation.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (58) 21) on the subject of part-timeDirectors of the Bank of England.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Tribunal ofEnquiry into the alleged premature disclosure of the decision toincrease Bank Rate had clearly indicated in their Report that, inspite Of the conflict of loyalties to which a member of the Courtof the Bank of England might in certain circumstances be subjected,it would be undesirable to contemplate any alteration in the status and functions of part-time Directors without further exhaustiveenquiry. Moreover, the statement which the Governor of the Bankhad made to the Tribunal, emphasising the advantages of the present arrangements as against any alternative system which would entrust the management of the Bank more exclusively to a permanent full-time bureaucracy, provided an additional argument against anyprecipitate action. It would be appropriate, therefore, that theproblem should now be referred to the Committee on monetary policy and that the Governments decision to this effect should be announced in the course of the forthcoming debate in the Houseof Commons on the Report of the Tribunal of Enquiry. At thesame time the Governor of the Bank of England might be privatelyinvited to consider a modification of the arrangements whereby bank rate was determined every Thursday morning, in order that it mightbe possible to consult the Court on this question only when an alteration in Bank Rate was in prospect and to make such an alteration at any convenient time instead of only on a Thursday.
In discussion there was general agreement with the view thatthe Government should not appear to be adopting a defensiveposture on this, or on any other, issue arising out of the Reportof the Tribunal of Enquiry. In the forthcoming debate theOpposition would probably seek to criticise the management of theBank of England and, more generally, the conduct of business inthe City of London as a means of diverting attention from theirfailure to substantiate their original charges. The Governmentshould not acquiesce in a manoeuvre of this kind; nor should theyallow the Opposition leaders to evade the censure which they hadattracted by their abuse of Parliamentary privilege in impugning the personal honour of private individuals on grounds which had been shown to be wholly without foundation. It would be unwise,however, to pretend that no problem existed in respect of part-timeDirectors of the Bank of England. The Tribunal had indicated, atseveral points in their Report, that a part-time Director who was required, while discharging his normal obligations to his partners in business, to be party to the discussion, within the Bank, of mattersof such consequence as an increase in Bank Rate might well findhimself in an embarrassing position. Moreover, public attention hadconcentrated on the terms of the letter of 16th September, 1957,in which Mr. W. J. Keswick, who was a Director of the Bank ofEngland and also a director of Matheson and Co., Ltd., had advised the managing director of Jardine, Matheson and Co., Ltd., in hong Kong to realise gilt-edged securities in London and to continue his policy of transferring funds into North American bonds andequities. Mr. Keswick&apos;s own admission, in this letter, that the courseof action which he proposed was liable to be damaging to sterling would undoubtedly be interpreted as evidence of the unsoundnessof a system which permitted an individual whose decisions wereinevitably influenced by purely commercial considerations to be amember of the Court of the Bank of England.Nevertheless, the potential conflict of loyalties to which a part-time Director of the Bank might be exposed should not be exaggerated. Any person holding a position of consequence in public life was liable to be confronted from time to time with thenecessity of resolving a problem of this nature; and it could be argued that an individual who was capable of facing such a problem with the sense of responsibility derived from long experience of administering a diversity of interests was a more valuable associateand counsellor than a man who had protected himself from the riskof such embarrasment at the cost of taking no part in the practicalmanagement of affairs. Moreover, the Bank of England Act, 1946,had by implication left with the Court of the Bank the responsibilityfor making changes in Bank Rate; and, since the Court included the part-time Directors, the Opposition must be deemed to have recognised, when that Act was passed during their term of office,that part-time Directors would&quot; be liable to participate in thediscussion of such changes.The Home Secretary, summing up the discussion, said thatGovernment spokesmen would be compelled to recognise, in theforthcoming debate, that the status and functions of the part-timeDirectors of the Bank of England constituted a problem which theReport of the Tribunal of Enquiry had not resolved; and, while the gravity of this problem should not be overstated, it would be unwise to seek to defend without reservation certain of the incidents whichthe Report of the Tribunal had placed on record in this connection.The right course, therefore, would be to admit the existence of a problem but to maintain that it was neither serious nor urgent and could properly be remitted for further study by the Committee onMonetary Policy. The terms in which the Government should invite
Lord Radcliffe to arrange for this Committee to give special attentionto the question would need further consideration.The Cabinet (1) Approved, in principle, the proposals in C. (58) 21.(2) Took note that the Home Secretary would consider, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, themethod by which the Committee on Monetary policy might best be invited to give consideration to the problemof the status and functions of the part-time Directors ofthe Bank of Engand.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to inform mr. Thorneycroft of the attitude which the government proposed to adopt towards this problem in theforthcoming debate in the House of Commons.8. The Minister of Labour said that he had arranged to meetrepresentatives of the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union later that day to discuss his rejection of their request that a committeeshould be set up to enquire into the current London bus dispute.While it would be premature to assume that the risk of a strike haddiminished, direct action by the bus workers was more likely to takethe form of a ban on overtime. There was increasing evidence thatthe general public were beginning to appreciate the reasons whichhad influenced the Government in rejecting a committee of enquiry.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th January, 1958.british transport commission.(previous reference:C.C.
