*MiddIe East(previous references:C.C. (58) 47thConclusions,Minute 2and 46thConclusions,Minute 2.)The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that a coup d&apos;etathad taken place in Bagdad that morning. The position was obscure;but unconfirmed reports indicated that the insurgents claimed to haveoverthrown the monarchy and to have established a republicanGovernment; that King Feisal, after being initially detained, hadbeen allowed to escape; that the Crown Prince of Iraq and the PrimeMinister, Nuri es-Said, had been killed; and that the british embassy had been burnt and one member of its staff had lost his life.We appeared to be maintaining our position at Habbaniya, but it was uncertain how long we could continue to do so.King Hussein of Jordan, who had succeeded in quelling anattempt to provoke a similar revolt in Amman during the previousweek, had declared that, in the absence of King Feisal, he would himself assume power as the Head of the Arab Union; but he had not so far appealed to the United States and ourselves for active assistance.President Chamoun of the Lebanon had, however, indicated thathe would call upon the United States and the United Kingdom withinthe next twenty-four hours to honour their undertaking to intervenewith military forces along the Syrian frontier. The United StatesGovernment proposed to inform him that they would be prepared todo so. They intended to report their action retrospectively to theSecurity Council of the United Nations on the following day. Theyhad indicated that they would be content to conduct the Lebanonoperation alone and that we might be well-advised to reserve for useelsewhere the British contingent which had been envisaged as taking part in that operation.In discussion there was general agreement that the situation in the lebanon must now be reconsidered in the wider context of the more serious developments in Iraq and Jordan. A temporary Anglo-American intervention confined to the Lebanon alone would be to our disadvantage rather than to our benefit. It would expose our commercial interests in that country to the risk of serious damage,while offering no prospect of a permanent solution to the politicaltension which was spreading throughout the Middle East. It was thelatter problem which made the more urgent demand on the resolution of the Western Powers; and we must seek to decide rapidly, inagreement with the United States, whether we were prepared to acquiesce in the expansion of nationalist sentiment throughout the arabian Peninsula, in the hope that a more stable political situation would ultimately develop, or whether we should take action forthwith to arrest, before it was too late, a development which would constitute an increasing threat to our interests and prestige. On the latterassumption it would be essential that, having initiated the necessary measures, both we and the United States should be prepared to carrythem through to a successful outcome. Moreover, we could not limitourselves to action designed merely to enable the existing regimes inthe Arab States to restore their internal authority. Our objectiveshould be to concert with the United States a policy which wouldpromote the social and political development of the Arab peoples, even at the expense, if necessary, of substantial modifications in the existingsystems of government, and would thus diminish the politicalattractions of the United Arab Republic. If we allowed the legitimateGovernment of the Lebanon to be overthrown and acquiesced in the armed insurrection in Iraq, disorder would rapidly develop in Jordan;Israel, Turkey and the Persian Gulf States would be isolated; and the intervention which the Western Powers would then be compelled toundertake in defence of their own interests would be too late toretrieve our position in the Arab world.The legal sanction of our action must, however, be made clear from the outset.   In terms of international law we should not be
justified in intervening in the Lebanon in order to suppress a purelyinternal insurrection; and we should therefore emphasise to world opinion that the conflict in the Lebanon was not primarily a civil war,but was a form of covert aggression promoted by the United arab republic. It was important, in the case both of the Lebanon and ofthe Arab Union, that we should be able to produce evidence insupport of our claim that we were assisting a legally constitutedGovernment to resist subversion organised by foreign Powers; and weshould not allow ourselves, by basing our intervention only on theneed to protect British lives and interests, to be compelled to with drawour forces as soon as the United Arab Republic temporarily ceasedfrom fomenting dissension. Our case must rest throughout on a secure legal foundation if we were not to be in danger of alienatingIndia and Pakistan and imposing a grave strain on our relations with canada.The form of our intervention would also need furtherconsideration. There might be some advantage in accepting thesuggestion of the United States Government that they alone should carry out the landing in the Lebanon and that we should reserve our forces against the possible need to provide military assistance to theGovernments of Iraq and Jordan. By so doing we might reduce tosome extent the risk to which our interests in the Lebanon, particularly the pipeline and the oil installations at Tripoli, would be exposed duringthe operation; we might more easily persuade the French Governmentto abstain from participating in the intervention; and we might obtain a margin of time in which to seek to secure the support of the othermembers of the Commonwealth for our policy. But these advantagesmust be weighed against the risk that the United States government might consider that, having restored order in the Lebanon, they were under no liability to assist us in retrieving the position in Iraq andJordan. Since their active support was essential for this purpose, itmight be wiser to offer at least a token British contingent for theoperation in the Lebanon and to make it clear to the United StatesGovernment that, even if they regarded such a contingent asunnecessary, we should expect them to regard the whole enterprise of restoring political stability in the Middle East, with the possible exception of Kuwait, as a joint task which they should share with us.The Cabinet were informed that, during their discussion, a message had been received from King Hussein that he was determined to maintain his position and that, while he had no specific request tomake to us at this stage, he wished to know urgently what action we proposed to take. The possibility of moving troops into Jordan andof reinforcing the R.A.F. personnel at Habbaniya would need to be examined urgently. The Defence Committee had already authorisedcertain precautionary measures to strengthen our position in the Gulf.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet should review thesituation again later that evening. In the interval, he would endeavour to communicate with President Eisenhower in order thatthere should be no risk of misunderstanding on the part of the UnitedStates Government about the scale and purpose of the jointintervention in the Middle East which we regarded as essential in thelight of the latest developments in Iraq.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th July, 1958.
