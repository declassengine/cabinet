* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET53860-6 B 2Lebanon. * 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that the internal situation in the(Previous Lebanon was deteriorating seriously. The strikes and disordersReference: which had broken out in Tripoli had now spread to other parts of cm. (56) 97th the country; the Iraq Petroleum Company&apos;s pipe-line had been cut;Conclusions, and, following a clash between Lebanese troops and armed intruders,Minute 2.) the border with Syria had been closed. There was increasing evidencethat these disturbances were being deliberately fomented by theUnited Arab Republic and that arms were being covertly introduced into the Lebanon from Syria and Egypt. At present the LebaneseArmy was in control of the situation; but it now seemed doubtfulwhether General Chehab, the Army Chief of Staff, was prepared tocontinue to support President Chamoun in his attempt to seekre-election for a second term. General Chehab was not, however,prepared to stand for the Presidency himself or to suggest any alternative candidate: his main concern was evidently to promotesome political solution which would preserve the unity and integrity of the Army. In these circumstances President Chamoun had askedwhether the United States, the United Kingdom and France wouldbe prepared to provide military assistance within twenty-four hoursof an appeal from the Lebanese Government, in order to preserve the independence of the country. Unless the Western Powersresponded to this appeal, President Chamoun would probably beoverthrown and the Lebanon would be compelled to accede tothe United Arab Republic. The Foreign Secretary therefore recommended that, if the United States Government were preparedto intervene actively in an attempt to uphold the LebaneseGovernment, we should agree to support them. It should not benecessary to provide any considerable number of troops, since their main function would be confined to maintaining law and order withinthe country and there should be relatively little risk of their becoming involved in more extensive operations.In discussion there was general agreement that the failure ofthe Lebanon to withstand the growing pressure of the United arab republic would greatly undermine the influence of the western powers in the Middle East. In particular, it was doubtful whether,if the Lebanese fell, Iraq and Jordan would be able to maintain their independence. The major responsibility for intervention in supportof President Chamoun, in terms both of material assistance and of diplomatic reinforcement, would have to be assumed by the UnitedStates Government; but, if they were prepared to act, we should offer our co-operation, at least to the extent of providing a tokencontribution to any military contingent which might be required.It would be desirable, however, to confirm that the Governmentof Iraq would favour intervention by the Western Powers. It wouldalso be important to ensure that the United Nations were kept informed of the action taken and the reasons which justified it.Although the subversive tactics so far adopted by Syria might notbe held to constitute an act of aggression against which the LebaneseGovernment could appeal to the Security Council, it might be advisable that President Chamoun should notify the United nations of the gravity of the threat to his country at the same time as heappealed to the Western Powers for support. We should not,however, allow ourselves to become involved in proceduraldiscussions in the United Nations which would delay the provisionof immediate and effective assistance to the Lebanon. Moreover,an attempt should be made to dissuade the French Government fromovertly taking part in the action which was contemplated, since their participation would be liable to prejudice the attitude of the arab states to the Western intervention.
2 S a&apos;The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to ascertain urgently the viewsof the United States Government on the reply to be given   (&quot;^to the enquiry from President Chamoun whether the     ^Western Powers would be prepared, on receipt of a request from the Lebanese Government, to intervene inorder to preserve the independence and integrity of the lebanon.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to ascertain the probablereaction of the Government of Iraq to any Anglo-American intervention.&apos;(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider the means bywhich the French Government could best be dissuadedfrom seeking to take any overt part in the course ofaction which was proposed.(4) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for an urgent,study to be made of the scope and nature of the military contribution which the United Kingdom could make toany Anglo-American intervention in the Lebanon.Cyprus. * 2.   The Cabinet had before them notes by the Secretary of the(Previous        Cabinet (C. (58) 102, 103 and 106) covering memoranda on variousReference:      possible plans for a settlement of the Cyprus problem.CC. (58) 36thConclusions.) The Prime Minister recalled that the Cabinet had previouslyfavoured a plan for the establishment of a tridominium in Cyprus.Subsequently, however, the Governor of Cyprus and Her Majesty&apos;ammbassadors at Athens and Ankara had indicated that this plan was unlikely to be acceptable either to the two communities in cyprus or to the Greek and Turkish Governments. Moreover, theUnited States Government had given the proposal only qualifiedsupport. After further discussions with the Governor of Cyprusthe alternative plan outlined in the Annex to C. (58) 106 had therefore been prepared. This plan provided that the international status of cyprus should remain unchanged for seven years, during whichinternal security would remain under full British control; that theGreek and Turkish Governments should be invited to appoint representatives in Cyprus to co-operate with the Governor in a jointeffort to achieve peace, progress and prosperity in the Island; that,under a new Constitution, the two Cypriot communities should enjoyautonomy in communal and cultural affairs, while matters of common concern should be administered jointly; and that both Greek and turkish Cypriots should be given the opportunity of acquiring Greekor Turkish nationality in addition to their British nationality. in presenting this plan we should indicate that, if it succeeded, the initial period of limited partnership might be succeeded by a lastingsettlement, based on the surrender of sole British sovereignty overthe Island (apart from bases and military facilities retained for strategic reasons) and a full sharing of that sovereignty with theGreek and Turkish Governments. If, however, the plan failed andit became necessary to seek a final solution of the problem of Cypruson other lines, we should regard ourselves as bound by our previousassurances in regard to the application of the principle of self-determination.In discussion it was suggested that this new plan constituted,in effect, a reversion to the original proposal for the continuation ofBritish rule in Cyprus, albeit with a different form of Constitutionfrom that proposed by Lord Radcliffe. It could provide only an interim solution to the present problems of the Island, v/hereastridominium might have proved to be a final settlement. The new plan might not, therefore, make so favourable an impact on world opinion as the concept of tridominium.   On the other hand, it now
3. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the railway wages dispute.The Minister of Transport said that, as a result of the Cabinet&apos;discussion on the previous day, he had sent a further letter to theChairman of the British Transport Commission recording the government&apos;s understanding that the Commission were preparedto achieve, in addition to the very heavy commitments which theyhad already undertaken, a further reduction in their working costs;that the railway unions would accept whatever staff adjustments were necessary to give effect to the enlarged programme of economies;industrial disputes.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 40thConclusions.)appeared that a tridominium would not be acceptable either to theCypriots or to the Greek Government, whereas the new plan was likely, in the opinion of the Governor of Cyprus, to be welcomed bythe majority of the inhabitants of the Island. Moreover, it had themerit that it could be implemented in part if it was accepted by onecommunity even though it was initially rejected by the other.Doubts were, however, expressed about the desirability of including in the proposals any specific term of years as the limit of the proposed continuation of the present status of the Island.The Governor of Cyprus had proposed a period of seven years inorder to allow a reasonable opportunity for stable conditions to beestablished and the habit of co-operation to develop; and he was inclined to feel that any shorter period might only encourage themore extreme elements of Cypriot opinion to continue to promotetheir own solutions of the problem by violent means. But, in theabsence of goodwill on the part of all the parties concerned, it wouldbecome increasingly difficult to provide the necessary British troopsin the Island to maintain law and order over so long a period as seven years. Moreover, a statement of intention to maintain british sovereignty for this period would not commit any future Governmentin the United Kingdom and would not, therefore, necessarily ensurethe internal stability of Cyprus to which the Governor rightlyattached importance. It might be preferable, therefore, merely toindicate that the present status of the Island would be maintained for a term of years, without specifying any particular period.Moreover, it would be desirable to present the final stage of theplan, if it succeeded, as a sharing of sovereignty between the UnitedKingdom, Greece and Turkey, and to omit any reference to the surrender by the United Kingdom of sole sovereignty over the Island.It would also be desirable to modify the reference to Cyprus asenjoying the advantages of &quot; association&quot; with the BritishCommonwealth, since the Island was already, and would presumablyremain, within the Commonwealth.The attitude adopted by the Opposition in Parliament would belikely to influence the reception given to the new plan. The Leadersof the Opposition should therefore be given, in confidence, an outline of the new proposals.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theColonial Secretary, the Governor of Cyprus and her majesty&apos;s Ambassadors at Athens and Ankara, toexamine the proposals in C. (58) 106 in greater detail inthe light of their discussion.(2) Agreed that, subject to the results of the discussions under conclusion (1) above, these proposals should be outlined in confidence, to the Leaders of the Opposition.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.
and that the Government were ready to accelerate the modernisation of road bridges and level crossings and to examine the possibilityof adjusting the Commission^ obligations in connection with their maintenance. The letter had also emphasised that there could beno question of an Exchequer subsidy to meet the cost of increases in railwaymen&apos;s pay and that the extent and timing of any wage awardmust therefore depend on the Commission^ own assessment of their ability to finance such an award, having regard to the additional resources which would accrue to them progressively over the next twelve months as a result of the intensified measures of economy which had now been agreed between the Government, theCommission and the unions.The Chairman of the Commission had informed the unions ofthe contents of this letter. He had also availed himself of the discretion which the Government had given him to say that he favoured the appointment of an independent committee to makea comprehensive examination of the wages structure and grading of railway staff. Finally he had stated that the Commission wereprepared to offer a wage increase of 3 per cent., to take effect in thefirst week of July (i.e., the week beginning on 30th June). In response to these proposals the representatives of the Associated Society of locomotive Engineers and Firemen and the Transport SalariedStaffs Association had indicated that they would be prepared torecommend their Executives to accept this offer. The representativesof the National Union of Railwaymen had, however, stated that theywere not prepared to recommend their Executive to vary the decisionalready taken to issue strike notices unless the wage award took effect in June, preferably at the beginning of the month. They had also urged that the award should be at the rate of 4 per cent.; butthey would probably be prepared to accept an increase of 3 per cent,if the effective date was advanced to June. They had regarded theamount of the increase as closely linked with its effective date, andit could not be claimed that, in principle, they had accepted an award of 3 per cent.In these circumstances the Chairman of the Commission wasnot prepared, in the exercise of his own judgment, to make anyfurther concession to the unions beyond his offer of a wage increaseof 3 per cent, with effect in July, and he would require the approval and active support of the Government in giving effect to any decision to advance the date of this award.In discussion there was general agreement that the Governmentshould stand on the offer which they had authorised the Chairmanof the Commission to make to the unions. That offer had itselfanticipated to some extent the economies to be achieved, and anyfurther improvement in its terms could not be reconciled either withthe letter which the Minister of Transport had sent to the Chairmanof the Commission or with the fundamental principles of the government&apos;s economic policy. Further concessions to the unionscould not be defended to the Governmenfs supporters and publicopinion in general, while the unions would be likely to forfeit thepublic sympathy which they at present enjoyed as soon as it became clear that two of them were reluctant to take strike action and thatthe third proposed to provoke a strike on no more plausible an excuse than the postponement of the effective date of a wage increase by two or three weeks. In these circumstances it wouldbe clear that their action derived not so much from legitimate concern for the interests of their members as from a desire to coerce theGovernment.On the other hand the Government should not lightly abandon their attempt to establish a rate of 3 per cent, as the standard rateof award for the wage claims now outstanding. They should therefore remain ready to use their good offices in an endeavour
to promote a settlement of the dispute at the appropriate moment.It was for consideration whether, for this purpose, the Chairmanof the Transport Commission should indicate to the union representatives, before breaking off discussions with them, that theMinister of Labour would be willing to hold a further meeting withthe parties to the dispute. On balance, however, it would probablybe wiser that at this stage he should merely state that his offer of a wage increase of 3 per cent, with effect in July represented the limit of concession which the Commission felt justified in contemplating.He should press them to urge their Executives to accept this offer;and he could, if necessary, indicate that acceptance would not beregarded as debarring them from submitting a further claim in thenormal way as soon as circumstances entitled them to do so. Itwas possible that, when confronted with this evidence of firmnesson the part of the Commission, the unions would accept the offer.If, however, they then issued strike notices, it would still be possiblefor the Government to intervene in an attempt to settle the dispute.In that event it would be necessary to publish a full statement ofthe offer which had been made to the unions and the course which their discussions with the Transport Commission had taken. If,however, the unions refrained from strike action, it would be forfurther consideration how far it would be desirable to make public the details of the negotiations.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Transport to inform the Chairmanof the British Transport Commission that he would havethe approval of the Government in indicating to therepresentatives of the railway unions that, while theCommission maintained their offer of a wage increase of3 per cent, with effect in July, they were not prepared to contemplate any further concession.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th May, 1958.
