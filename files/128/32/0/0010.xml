The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the reply to be sent by the Prime Minister to the letter of 9th January from Mr. Bulganin.They had before them the Prime Ministers suggestions for analternative draft (Commonwealth Relations Office telegrams from new Zealand Nos. 61 and 62 of 24th January) together with proposed amendments to this draft prepared by the Minister of State forForeign Affairs in the light of their previous discussion.* 1. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the current Londonbus dispute, on the basis of a draft letter prepared by the Minister ofLabour, in consultation with the Minister of Transport, rejecting therequest of the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union that acommittee should be established to enquire into the dispute.The Minister of Labour said that the letter had been drafted inthe light of the Cabinets earlier discussion. While it deliberatelyavoided any overt reference to provincial differentiation, it indicated that the Government would not dismiss the possibility of an enquiry into the wages problem in the road passenger transport industry as awhole; and it constituted, therefore, a reasoned refusal of the union&apos;request which the union would find it difficult to present as adequatejustification for strike action.In discussion, it was suggested that it might be unwise for theGovernment to appear to take the initiative in enlarging the scope ofthe potential dispute. There was general agreement, however, that,on balance, a reply on the lines proposed by the Minister of labour would represent the least disadvantageous method of rejecting theunion&apos;s request.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was unlikely that a comprehensive enquiry of the natureindicated in the draft letter would ever be constituted, since theemployers, particularly in the provinces, would be reluctant to take part in it. The unions, on the other hand, might endorse such aproposal. The possible embarrassment to the Government if a situation of this kind developed should be anticipated by amending the draft reply so as to emphasise that the initiative for any suchenquiry would need to come from all the parties concerned,(b) The public presentation of the Governments decision would need careful consideration, since the reply was formally a privatecommunication to the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union. TheGovernment should, however, take such steps as were possible toensure that it was published in full at the appropriate time. It wouldbe particularly important to emphasise that the union had hithertorefused, for reasons which they had not been prepared to divulge in public, to submit the dispute to arbitration in the normal way.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Labour to arrange for the despatch ofa letter, on the lines agreed in their discussion, to theTransport and General Workers&apos; Union, rejecting their request for the establishment of a committee of enquiry into the current London bus dispute.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour, in consultation with theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to take appropriate measures, in the light of developments, to secure that theGovernments reasons for rejecting the request receivedadequate publicity.
In discussion certain drafting amendments were agreed and thefollowing main points were made :  (a) The list of topics for consideration at a possible meeting of heads of Government should be abbreviated by grouping the variousEuropean problems under one heading. The Foreign secretary should be invited, in addition, to consider whether the question ofEuropean security should be omitted entirely from the list, on theground that it would be unwise to provoke speculation about our attitude towards a complex problem on which we had not yetformulated a definite policy which would command the support of our allies.(b) It was doubtful whether it would be to our advantage to setout at length, in an Annex to the letter, a definition of our attitude on each of the items in the list. On some, e.g., disarmament, there mightbe value in restating our constructive proposals; on others, however,there would be little point in reiterating views which were already on record. On the other hand the Soviet leaders should not be allowedto monopolise the propaganda advantage to be derived from a constant repetition of their own proposals; and, if the Annex to thePrime Minister^ letter was to be omitted, it would be desirable toensure by other means (e.g., a speech by the Foreign Secretary at an appropriate moment) that the content of our own counter-proposalsreceived adequate publicity.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr.Ormsby-Gore) to submit to the Prime Minister and theForeign Secretary the amendments to the draft reply toMr. Bulganin which had been suggested in their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,25th January, 1958.
