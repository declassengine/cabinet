SECRET 3   &quot;        167C.C. 25 (58)Parliament. 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Economic 2.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofSurvey, 1958.   the Exchequer (C. (58) 60), to which was annexed a draft of theEconomic Survey, 1958, as approved by the Economic PolicyCommittee.In discussion certain textual amendments were agreed and thefollowing points were made:  (a) The statement, in paragraph 78, that the records of 1948-49and 1953-54 gave grounds for confidence in the ability of the UnitedStates Government to prevent any serious decline in economic activity in the United States implied that we were indulgingexpectations which might be falsified by events. It might be preferable, therefore, to omit this statement or to adopt a moreneutral form of words in discussing the possible extent and duration of the current recession in the United States.(b) Chapter IV of the Survey, particularly in its Conclusions,was less satisfactory than Chapters I-III. While it emphasised the close link between the domestic economy and economic developmentselsewhere in the world, it did not sufficiently indicate how far it waspossible for us to ensure, by our own policies and actions, that thisinteraction between the United Kingdom and the rest of the world would constitute an ascending, rather than a descending, spiral ofeconomic activity. It contained no reference to the continuing needfor restraint in claims for increases in personal incomes; nor didit mention the scope for initiative and enterprise if it became possible,during 1958, to resume the expansion of the economy. While it was clearly necessary, in present circumstances, that the Conclusions ofthe Survey should be worded even more cautiously than usual, itwas doubtful whether paragraphs 86-88, as at present drafted, wouldmake any significant impression on public opinion and it was forconsideration whether these paragraphs should be omitted or,alternatively, revised on slightly more positive lines.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to reconsider thedraft Economic Survey in the light of the points made during their discussion.(2) Authorised the publication of the Economic Survey asamended in the light of Conclusion (1).rent restriction:Scotland.glasgow corporation.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 85thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the glasgow corporation had not complied since 1938 with their statutory duty to review the rents of their houses and to make such changes as circumstances might require. As a result current rents were very low and the Corporation^ Housing Accounts were now beingsubsidised by the rates to an extent equivalent to a rate of 3.y. Id.in the pound. He had received several protests from Glasgowratepayers and the minority Party on the Corporation, and theauditor of the Accounts had commented adversely on the situation.The Corporation had, however, refused to review the rents inquestion until the Government reduced interest rates and increasedhousing subsidies. He therefore proposed to hold a local enquiryunder Section 356 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1947,which should demonstrate that the Corporation were in default ontheir obligations. If publication of the report did not induce theCorporation to take the necessary action, he would be able to issue
an order requiring them to discharge their statutory duty. If they refused to comply with this order or made only a nominal adjustment in rents, he would ask the Court of Session to make an order for specific performance. Action on these lines appeared to be unavoidable; but it would inevitably provoke considerable oppositionboth from the Corporation and from their tenants.The Minister of Housing confirmed that the measures proposed were not likely to have any embarrassing consequences in Englandand Wales.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement withthese proposals. It would, however, be desirable to ensure thatthe necessary action, both administrative and legal, was completedas quickly as possible.The Cabinet Approved the course of action proposed by the Secretaryof State for Scotland to require the Glasgow Corporation to review the rents of their houses and to make such changesas circumstances required.Malta. 4.   The Colonial Secretary said that, in his discussions with the(Previous        Prime Minister of Malta since the Cabinet&apos;s previous meeting, he had reference:      found Mr. Mintoff more disposed to seek an accommodation with c.C. (58) 24th Her Majesty&apos;s Government.  In particular, Mr. Mintoff had declaredConclusions,     his willingness to withdraw his earlier proposal that, at any timeMinute 6.)      until full economic equivalence was achieved, the Maltese people should retain the right to reject integration and to declare their independence of the United Kingdom.    Moreover, there were grounds for believing that the Maltese Government would now beprepared, as part of an acceptable agreement on the future status of Malta, to withdraw the resolution of the Maltese LegislativeAssembly repudiating any obligation towards the United KingdomGovernment unless a guarantee of alternative employment was givento workers discharged from the dockyard.   They might also be willing to accept a reduction to  5 millions in the United Kingdomsubvention to the Maltese budget.In discussion it was recognised that this change of attitude onthe part of Mr. Mintoff might increase the possibility of reaching an agreement with him. On the other hand, the political objectionsto introducing the consequential legislation in the 1958-59 sessionof Parliament had lost none of their force. Nor could we necessarilyrely, in the light of past experience, on any of the undertakings which Mr. Mintoff gave and retracted as he felt disposed. It would therefore be desirable to suggest to him that he should now returnto Malta and should thereafter send the Colonial Secretary a written statement of the proposals which he would regard as constituting a satisfactory settlement of the issues under discussion. The UnitedKingdom Government could then consider this statement and coulddecide whether they, for their part, regarded it as acceptable. Itmight also be desirable to examine the possibility of ascertaining,before the introduction of any legislation in the Parliament at westminster, whether the people of Malta still genuinely wished forthe integration of the Island with the United Kingdom.The Cabinet-Invited the Colonial Secretary, in his further discussion withthe Prime Minister of Malta, to be guided by the points made in their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,19th March, 1958.
