middle east.(previous reference:CC. (58) 59thConclusions.)CC. 60 (58)t 1. The Prime Minister said that the operation which the cabinet had approved at their previous meeting was in danger of beinginterrupted by the failure of the Government of Israel to grant our request for permission to over-fly Israeli territory, although they hadsanctioned the proposed demonstration by United States aircraft overIsrael and Jordan. On our initiative the United States Governmenthad now given the Government of Israel the assurance that they fully supported our intervention in Jordan; and he had himself sent a personal message to the Prime Minister of Israel emphasising the urgency of our request, which the Israeli Cabinet were now considering. Meanwhile the leading British aircraft, carrying theCommander of our troops, had disregarded Israeli orders to turnback and had had a friendly reception in Jordan. Several additional aircraft had subsequently reached Amman and the force now in position amounted to some 400 men. But unless we could rely onpermission to over-fly Israeli territory as a routine measure for thesupply and reinforcement of our troops, it would be impracticable toprovide assistance to Jordan on the scale which we had originally contemplated. In these circumstances there appeared to be no alternative but to suspend the operation until we had obtained thenecessary permission from the Government of Israel and had considered any conditions which they might attach to their consent.In discussion it was recognised that this development might prejudice our ability to counter the threat to Jordan in time.Moreover, announcements were already appearing in the Press thata British force was being sent to Jordan in response to a request forassistance from King Hussein; and it would be necessary to make astatement in Parliament on the subject that afternoon. If we hadnot obtained permission to over-fly Israeli territory by the time thatthis statement had to be made, it would be inadvisable to attempt to conceal the reason for the delay in providing support for Jordan andit would be necessary to admit that, pending a decision by theGovernment of Israel, we had established only an advance party inAmman.The Cabinet Agreed to* resume their discussion when it was known whether the Government of Israel would grant us permission to over-fly Israeli territory in connection with the transport to Amman of the British troops intended to reinforceKing Hussein of Jordan.Parliament 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.3. The Home Secretary said that he intended to make in thefollowing week a statement on Parliamentary privilege in relation toletters from Members of Parliament to Ministers. Ministers whowere asked to investigate crticisms of the administration of public services could not do so satisfactorily without forwarding to the public bodies concerned the letters from Members or their constituents inwhich the criticisms were made; but he proposed that further adviceshould be given to Departments on the exercise of discretion in handling correspondence of this kind.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement by the lord privy Seal.* Later in the day a message was received from the Israeli Government acquiescing in thisover-flying of Israeli territory, and the movement of British troops into Jordan was completed,f Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.parliamentary privilege.(previous reference:CC.

GovernmentInformationServices.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 49thConclusions,Minute 12.)international labour organisation.(previous reference:C.C. (57) 78thConclusions,Minute 10.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Labour (C. (58) 141) on two Conventions, each with a supplementaryRecommendation, adopted by the 40th session of the InternationalLabour Conference.The Minister of Labour said that Convention No. 106 providedthat all persons employed in commerce and offices should be entitledto an uninterrupted weekly rest period of not less than twenty-four4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster (C. (58) 138 and 139) reporting the progressachieved in the development of Government information services athome and overseas and discussing the method of financing new developments in the oversea services.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster recalled that a yearago the Cabinet had agreed that expenditure on oversea information services might be incurred up to  15 millions a year on theunderstanding that this figure would not be exceeded without furtherCabinet authority. Increases in costs, however, had already, raisedexpenditure on these services so near the approved limit that no margin remained for important new projects such as the proposal to expand the British Councils educational work in the Horn of africa on the lines described in Appendix B to C. (58) 139. This proposal was only one example of urgent and essential developments whichwere liable to be frustrated by lack of funds. Other cases would shortly demand attention, particularly the provision of broadcastrelay facilities in the Horn of Africa. An examination had been madeof the possibility of financing the current proposal, estimated to cost about  100,000 in a full financial year, from compensating economies in other information services; and Appendix C to C. (58) 139illustrated the reductions which would be required if the newenterprise was to be accommodated within the limit of  15 millions.There were strong objections to each of these possible economies.Moreover, urgent decisions were liable to be delayed if, on each occasion when a new project was under consideration, the whole field of hypothetical savings had to be reviewed. He wished, therefore,to feel free to seek the authority of the Cabinet, in appropriate cases,to incur expenditure on important new developments in excess of the 15 millions limit.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, without detractingfrom the value of the oversea information services, he was obliged, incurrent financial circumstances, to stipulate that any new projects,however important, should be financed from economies on the existing services and that the limit of  15 millions should not be exceeded.In discussion it was suggested that the figure of  15 millions hadnot originally been regarded by the Cabinet as an absolute maximumwhich might in no circumstances be exceeded. On the other hand,the principle of an upper limit to expenditure was not lightly to bebreached if compensating economies could be achieved without undue sacrifice. A new project might be justified by changes in circumstances, and it could be submitted to the Cabinet forconsideration on its merits. But the Cabinet should not be invitedto accept the expenditure entailed as necessarily additional to theallocation of  15 millions until the possibilities of achieving offsetting savings had been exhaustively examined.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C. (58) 138.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Foreign Secretary, the Common-wealth Secretary and the Colonial Secretary, to examinethe practicability of financing the proposed developments in the information services in the Horn of Africa by reductions in the other oversea information services and,if necessary, to submit proposals thereafter to the Cabinet.
Anglo-EgyptianResettlementBoard.(previous references:C.C. (58) 52ndConclusions,Minute 4 andC.C. (57) 51stConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (58) 143) discussing the future of the Anglo-egyptian resettlement Board.The Home Secretary said that the Board themselves had suggested that they should be disbanded by 31st December, 1958.While, however, the bulk of their work would have been completed by that time, there would remain a number of refugees who could probably never be resettled in the normal sense. The most difficultcategory consisted of elderly and formerly prosperous people whom it would be both harsh and politically embarrassing to reduce abruptlyto National Assistance Board standards of maintenance. he therefore proposed that a decision on the winding up of the resettlement Board should be deferred until it was clear whether the resumed negotiations with the Egyptian Government for a financial settlement were likely to have a successful outcome and whethersatisfactory arrangements could be made to deal with the residualproblems of resettling the refugees from Egypt.Discussion showed that there was general agreement with thisproposal. Moreover, the Government were under increasing pressure to accelerate the settlement of the claims of British subjects to compensation in respect of Egyptianised property and damage tosequestrated property, and it might become necessary, in order to demonstrate the Governments sympathy with these claimants, toagree that the arrangements for ex-gratia advances which had hitherto been confined to claims in respect of private property should beextended to claims in respect of business assets. These arrangements were operated by the Resettlement Board: and it would thereforebe inopportune to disband the Board at the present juncture.The Cabinet-Agreed to defer a decision on the winding up of theAnglo-Egyptian Resettlement Board.FoMsii-y. 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture(C. (58) 150) on forestry policy. This proposal that the planting programme of the Forestry Commission should be settled for tenyears at a time. For the five years 1959-63 planting should be at therate of about 60,000 acres a year and for the following quinquenniumshould be reduced to 235,000 acres in all. The extent of plantingin the second ten-year period should be reviewed in five years&apos; time.In the choice of areas to be planted special attention should be paidto the social needs of Scotland and Wales.   In the private sector grantC.C. 60 (58)hours. Entitlement to a weekly rest period was in this countryalready well established by custom and ratification of this convention would impose on Her Majesty&apos;s Government an unnecessaryobligation to enforce it.Convention No. 107 provided international standards for theprotection and integration of indigenous and other tribal and semi-tribal populations in independent countries. This had no application to the United Kingdom.He therefore proposed that Her Majesty&apos;s Government shouldtake no action to ratify these Conventions and recommendations and that, in accordance with precedent, a White Paper should bepublished indicating the reasons for this decision.The Cabinet Approved the proposal in C. (58) 141.
aid to private owners should be improved; but in future the trend of receipts as well as of costs should be taken into account in the periodical reviews of the level of grants, with the result that grants should eventually be reduced to a nominal amount. The presentsystem for licensing felling should be continued, but its administration should be somewhat relaxed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, whereas the recentinterdepartmental Working Party had recommended that currentstrategic and economic requirements pointed towards a deliberatereversal of the previous policy of. fostering an increasing forest estate,the draft Parliamentary statement annexed to C. (58) 150 might bethought to create the opposite impression of the governments intentions. On the other hand the Home Affairs Committee had thought it unwise, having regard to the long-term nature ofafforestation, to make any drastic change of emphasis at this stage inour forestry policy. They had, however, accepted a significant reduction in planting in the period 1964-68; and they had recognisedthat payment of grants to private owners should not be continuedbeyond the point at which receipts and costs were in balance. the flexibility of the Governments policy might be further illustrated ifthe draft statement made it clear, in paragraph 2, that the review in1963 of the second ten-year programme would be conducted on thebasis of a reassessment of the national needs at the time.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) In order to reassure the Scottish crofters, who attached importance to adequate afforestation, the draft statement should emphasise that an annual planting programme of 60,000 acresinvolved some increase on the current rate of planting.lb) The statement should also stress the fact that, by concentrating planting in Scotland and Wales, the Government wouldnot only be meeting a social need but would also be adopting apractical policy for the diversification of industry in remote ares which would always be unattractive to manufacturing enterprises.(c) The section on private forestry in the statement should be clarified in order to make it plain that it referred to grant aidcalculated on an aggregate, not on an individual, basis.(d) The Agriculture Ministers were discussing with the Ministerof Housing detailed arrangements for the control of felling.(e) In order to allay the anxieties of private owners it would bedesirable to announce the Governments policy before the summer recess.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Agriculture, in consultation with the Home secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to revise the draft parliamentary statement in the light of the points made inthe discussion.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, approved the proposals inC. (58) 150 and invited the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of Agriculture to consult with the HomeSecretary about the timing of the proposed statement inParliament.
