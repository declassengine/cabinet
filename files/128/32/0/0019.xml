Parliament.british forces inEurope.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 16thConclusions.Minute 6.)1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, although theFederal German Government remained unwilling to make a cashcontribution to the foreign exchange costs of our forces in germany in 1958-59, we had enlisted considerable sympathy for our case in theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and it would be to our advantage to try to reach an agreement on the financing of our forcesin Germany over the next three years. We should therefore declareto NATO that we were prepared to maintain five brigade groups inGermany during the three years beginning in 1958-59, provided thatthe following conditions were fulfilled:  (a) In respect of 1958-59 the German Government should agree:  (i) To repay in that year the  45 millions of their post-war debt to us in respect of economic aid which would otherwise be repayableover the period 1967-72. The  67 millions already on deposit inLondon on account of repayment of the balance of this debt shouldalso remain here.(ii) To deposit at least  50 millions by way of advance payment for munitions orders in addition to orders already placed.(b) In each of the two following years a contribution of at least one-third of the foreign exchange expenditure attributable to the fivebrigade groups should be provided through the agency of NATO.(c) There would be no modification, during the three years, in basic NATO strategy and no major change in the internationalpolitical climate in Europe.id) Economic co-operation in Europe should be developed in a manner comparable with the political and military co-operationestablished in NATO.If we failed to secure agreement to an arrangement on these lines,we should reduce our forces in Germany to four brigade groups as rapidly as possible. Even this reduced force would entail anadditional annual commitment of some  32 millions in foreign currency. On the other hand, a settlement on the basis outlinedwould provide us with a reasonable degree of Budgetary relief in1958-59, while the foreign exchange liability of some  25 millions ayear which it would involve in the two subsequent years would represent a price which might be thought to be unavoidable if wewere to preserve the unity of the North Atlantic Alliance. Even so,it would constitute an unwelcome additional commitment at a timewhen our other external liabilities would be very heavy, and it wouldbe necessary to seek economies elsewhere in mitigation of this newburden.In discussion it was emphasised that we were committed, underthe Western European Union, to maintain four divisions on theContinent. We should also face serious administrative problems ifwe attempted to reduce our forces in Germany below the level of fivebrigade groups during the next two years. Moreover, the expenditure involved in maintaining five brigade groups in Germany was littlegreater than the expenditure attributable to four brigade groups. Forthese reasons it would be to our advantage to seek to achieve asettlement governing the financing of the costs of our forces inGermany during the next three years rather than to attempt, in the face of German opposition, to secure an adequate contribution inrespect of our expenditure in 1958-59 alone. We should thereforeendeavour to enlist the support of the United States Government andthe Secretary-General of NATO for a solution on the lines proposed.At the same time, however, we should emphasise, in the discussions
territorial waters.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 17thConclusions,Minute 5.)in NATO, that an arrangement of this kind would involve us in a heavy additional commitment which we could discharge only if our allies were prepared to contribute one-third of the foreign exchangeexpenditure involved in the second and third years of the period. Weshould also seek to ensure further economies by enforcing a simpler-standard of support services for our troops in Germany, and byaccelerating as far as possible the reduction in the strength of theArmy as a whole.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Defence,to discuss with the Secretary-General of the north atlantic Treaty Organisation the possibility that theOrganisation might sponsor a settlement of the problemof financing our troops in Germany on the lines indicated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to consider the possibility of accelerating the rate of reduction in the strength of theArmy as a whole.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence to examine the possibility of reducing the standard of support services for our troopsin Germany.3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the foreign secretary and the Attorney-General (C. (58) 52 and 54) reporting theprogress of discussions, at the International Conference on the law of the Sea, on the breadth of territorial waters and the limit ofexclusive fishing rights.The Attorney-General said that, while these discussions haddisclosed some support for the retention of the present three-mile limit of territorial waters, it remained unlikely that the conference would reaffirm this limit. If we failed in our efforts to persuade themto do so, we must choose one of two possible compromises :  (i) Retention of the three-mile limit, together with an extensionof exclusive fishing rights up to a twelve-mile limit.(ii) Adoption of a six-mile limit for all purposes, with the reservation of rights of passage for warships, without priorauthorisation, and rights of passage for aircraft, outside the three miles.The United States delegation were canvassing support for thefirst of these proposals, and we must therefore decide whether we ourselves should endorse it or whether we should advocate the secondproposal and seek to persuade the United States representative tosupport us in doing so, without putting forward the first proposal atall.In discussion there was general agreement that we shouldcontinue to press, as long as possible, for the retention of thethree-mile limit for all purposes. But if we failed to secure this objective, it would be dangerous to sponsor the concession ofexclusive fishing rights up to twelve miles. This course would exposeour fishing industry to severe damage; it would prevent us fromarguing, before the International Court of Justice, that claims toexclusive fishing rights outside the limit of territorial waters had novalidity in international law; and it would tempt other States to seek to extend the breadth of territorial waters proper to the twelve-mile limit initially conceded in respect of exclusive fishing rights.Moreover, if two compromise proposals were put forward inde-pendently, the chances of success for either would be prejudiced. Weshould therefore seek to persuade the United States delegation tosupport us in advocating a six-mile limit for all purposes. It would,however, be important to couple with this proposal a specificreservation of rights of passage for warships and aircraft.

The Cabinet again reviewed the political risks of proceeding with legislation to amend the Agriculture Acts and the agricultural holdings Acts.. They recognised that this legislation was likely togive rise to a considerable amount of controversy, especially inScotland. They were, however, informed that the agitation againstthe proposed abandonment of disciplinary powers was subsiding,and that agreement had now been reached between the CountryLandowners1 Association and the National Farmers&apos; Unions on theproposals affecting security of tenure. The Governments supporters in the House of Commons were in favour of the Bill, and theGovernment were likely now to gain more credit by proceeding with it than by abandoning it.The Cabinet Reaffirmed their decision to proceed with legislation toamend the Agriculture Acts and the Agricultural HoldingsActs.5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (58) 48) and the Minister of Power (C. (58) 50) onthe proposal to raise loans from the International Bank for reconstruction and Development (I.B.R.D.) to assist in financing the United Kingdom nuclear power programme.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that officials had nowdiscussed this possibility with representatives of the I.B.R.D. Theirreport was annexed to his memorandum. It envisaged a loan of$50 millions from the I.B.R.D., in conjunction with a loan of thesame amount from the New York market. We could not afford to dispense with any potential source of gold and dollars which would strengthen our reserves in the long term; and, on a balance of allthe considerations, he was disposed to recommend that negotiationsfor these loans should now be opened. He would prefer that bothloans should be raised by the electricity authorities; but, if on further enquiry it seemed disadvantageous for them to borrow on the new york market, he would be content that the Government should themselves raise that loan.The Minister of Power said that this proposal was open to objection on the grounds summarised in paragraph 2 of his memorandum.   He was concerned about the effect on the BritishThe Conference was also likely to be invited to endorse aproposal that all nuclear tests at sea should be prohibited. Thisproposal would receive considerable support. But we should probably not be alone in opposing it; and the Conference might eventuallybreak down on this issue. This would not necessarily be to our disadvantage.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the attorney-General, to seek to enlist the support of theUnited States Government for the adoption of a six-mile limit on territorial waters for all purposes, with the reservation of rights of passage for warships, without priorauthorisation, and rights of passage for aircraft, outsidethe three miles.(2) Invited the Attorney-General to be guided, in the discussions at the International Conference on the Law of the Sea,by the considerations which had emerged in their discussion and to report progress to the Cabinet.
public, who had taken pride in the success of our nuclear power programme and would be shocked to think that it could not becarried through without American help. He was even more concerned at the risk of submitting this programme to the scrutiny of technical experts engaged by the I.B.R.D., since an unfavourable report would seriously damage our export prospects. He would not maintain hisobjections to the proposal if the Chancellor were satisfied that therewas an overriding financial need to borrow this $100 millions. But he hoped that, in that event, the electricity authorities would not be askedto borrow on the New York market, for the reasons set out inparagraph 3 of his memorandum.In discussion serious misgivings were expressed about the expediency of proceeding with this proposal. Special importance was attached to the risk that the I.B.R.D. might seek technical advice on our nuclear power programme from United States experts inatomic energy who were known to be jealous of its success and mightbe disposed to take a critical view of its future prospects. attention was also drawn to the possibility that the request for this loan might affect the attitude of Congress towards the amendment of theMcMahon Act.The Prime Minister said that he would be glad of a further opportunity to weigh these arguments before a final decision wastaken.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would give furtherconsideration to the issues raised by C. (58) 48 and 50.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,27th February, 1958.
