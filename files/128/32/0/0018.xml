Export of aircraft.(previous reference :C.C. (57) 63rdConclusions,Minute 4.)Sale of CometAircraft to egypt.secret &apos; ^1. The Foreign Secretary said that the de Havilland company had received enquiries about the possible sale of Comet IV aircraft to Egypt. In August, 1957, the Cabinet had considered whether itwould be expedient that Vickers Ltd. should sell Viscount aircraft to egypt, but it had in the event been decided that no objection need beraised to that transaction. Subject therefore to the Cabinet&apos;s views,he proposed to inform the de Havilland Company that there was noreason why they should not conclude a contract for the delivery ofComet IV aircraft to Egypt, on the understanding that payment would be made through the Egyptian No. 1 (Special) Account.The Cabinet Agreed that no objection need be raised to this proposed saleof Comet aircraft to Egypt on the basis indicated by theForeign Secretary.Middle East.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 7thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinefs attention was drawn to a suggestion, reportedin Bagdad telegram No. 287, that a special corporation for promotingeconomic development in the Middle East might be established on thebasis of contributions from Iraq, Kuwait, the United States, theUnited Kingdom and the oil companies operating in the area. Fromthese sources a fund of more than  40 millions might be created to finance development projects in Arab countries. A similiar plan wasunder consideration by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.It might be useful if at this juncture the United Kingdom Governmentcould take the initiative in putting forward a project on these lines.The Foreign Secretary said that it was doubtful whether the IraqGovernment or the Ruler of Kuwait would be willing to lend support to such a project. He himself favoured the alternative possibility of bringing Kuwait into some sort of economic association with iraq and Jordan, with the consent and approval of King Saud. He hadalready arranged for this possibility to be examined, and he hoped tobe able to put forward specific recommendations to the Cabinet in thenear future.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Artificial 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeInsemination. Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (58) 47)proposing the appointment of a Departmental Committee to enquire into the existing practice regarding artificial insemination of women and to consider both its social and its legal aspects.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were doubtful about the expediency of undertaking an official enquiry into the moral and socialaspects of this practice. A report recommending that it should be prohibited or regulated would confront the Government with an embarrassing responsibility; for on that issue either decision was likelyto give offence to large sections of public opinion. Moreover, on the moral issue, it had yet to be established that there was need for theGovernment to intervene.There would, however, be less objection to an enquiry limited tothe legal aspects of the practice. There were grounds for amending the law, as recommended by the Royal Commission on Marriage andDivorce, so as to provide that artificial insemination by a donorwithout the consent of the husband (whether or not it constitutedadultery) should be a ground for divorce or judicial separation, andfor reversing the current legal decision that the issue of artificial insemination by a husband was illegitimate. But legislation to dealwith these and other legal aspects of the problem could not beprepared without further detailed examination of the whole subject.
The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland to consider, in consultation with the LordChancellor, the composition and terms of reference of a departmental Committee to review the legal consequences of the existing practice of artificial insemination of women.(2) Authorised the Lord Chancellor to say, in replying to the debate in the House of Lords on 26th February, that theGovernment intended to institute an enquiry into the legalconsequences of this practice and would consider its termsof reference in the light of the views expressed in the debate.road programme.(previous reference :C.C. (57) 84thConclusions,Minute 9.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Transport and Civil Aviation (C. (58) 46) reviewing the main civil engineering projects in the road programme in the period 1956-65.The Minister of Transport said that work had already begun orbeen authorised on the Dartford tunnel, the two Clyde tunnels, andthe Barton, Runcorn-Widnes, King&apos;s-ferry and Forth bridges. Theremaining projects, consisting of the Tyne and Blackwall tunnels andthe Severn bridge, were included in the road programme approvedby the Treasury but had not yet been publicly announced. TheFederation of Civil Engineering Contractors, the British Construc-tional Steelwork Association and the Export Group for the Construc-tional Industries, after examining the programme, had advised that itcould be carried out in its entirety without undue strain on theindustry&apos;s resources and without detriment to export interests. Itwould therefore be desirable that the Government should nowannounce that work on the Tyne and Blackwail tunnels wouldcommence in the financial year 1958-59 and that on the severn bridge in 1960-61. It would also be advisable that, in the interests of economy, the negotiations with the consortium of contractors whowere undertaking the Forth bridge project should be extended tocomprise also the highly specialised super-structure work on the severn bridge.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would have noobjection to an announcement that the Tyne tunnel would be commended in 1958-59. But the Cabinet had agreed, in their earlier discussion of the Severn bridge, that a decision on this project shouldbe deferred until the forthcoming investment review in April.Moreover, the financial implications of the Blackwall tunnel had notyet been examined in detail. The capital expenditure on these twoprojects was very substantial, particularly if account were taken of thecost of the associated schemes for road development; and, although this expenditure would be recovered over a period by toll charges, its initial impact on the economy would be inflationary. The decisionon these projects should, therefore, await the investment review.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviationshould announce that the Tyne tunnel project would be commended in the financial year 1958-59.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, to arrangefor the Blackwall tunnel and the Severn bridge projects to be further examined in the course of the forthcominginvestment review.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,25th February, 1958.
