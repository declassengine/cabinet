CC. 50 (58)Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.On 30th June, in Committee of Supply, there would be a debate on the cotton industry with special reference to the import of textilesfrom Hong Kong. Among Government supporters in the House ofCommons there was widespread sympathy with the attitude of theLancashire cotton industry towards these imports. It was therefore important that the Colonial aspect of the problem should be clearly stated in the course of the debate.Elections.Use of Cars.(previous reference:CC. (57) 71stConclusions,Minute 4).2. The Home Secretary recalled that on 7th October, 1957, theCabinet had approved a proposal for the repeal of Section 88 of the representation of the People Act, 1949, which restricted the numberof cars that might be used on behalf of a candidate to take voters to the.poll at a Parliamentary election. This provision had been enactedwhen a Labour Government was in office; and it had now been ascertained that the Labour Opposition would strongly resist its repeal.At this stage of the session it would be inexpedient to introducecontroversial legislation on this subject, and it was therefore proposedto defer its introduction until the beginning of the following session.In discussion there was some difference of opinion on the expediency of proceeding with this legislation in the face of opposition by other political Parties. There was, however, general agreement that it would be impracticable to pass the Bill in the current session.The Cabinet Agreed  that  legislation  to  repeal  SectionRepresentation of the People Act, 1949, sheintroduced in the current session of Parliament.uldof thenot beParliament.parliamentary privilege.(previous reference:CC. (58) 39thConclusions,Minute 1).3. The Cabinet were informed that the Committee of Privilegeshad unanimously decided to recommend that no action should betaken on their earlier finding that the London Electricity Board had committed a breach of privilege in threatening to take proceedings forlibel against Mr. G. R. Strauss, M.P. There should be no difficulty in persuading the House of Commons to carry a motion incorporatingthis recommendation. But the House would also be free to considerthe Committee&apos;s original report. The Attorney-General, who haddissented from the findings in that report, would be obliged to speakagainst it. He was likely to have the support of some new membersof the Committee, and it was possible that the House might reject thereport.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.OverseasJourneys byMembers of royal Family.Procedure atLondonAirport.4. The Home Secretary said that the Lord Chamberlain had informed him that it was The Queen&apos;s pleasure that, subject to thespecial responsibilities of the Minister of Civil Aviation, ministers should no longer feel any obligation to go to London Airport whenmembers of the Royal Family were leaving this country by air on official visits overseas. Her Majesty thought it unnecessary that ministers should spend the time involved in making the journey to andfrom the Airport. She would prefer that any necessary leave-takingby Ministers should take place at the residence of the member of theRoyal Family concerned. The same procedure would apply whenmembers of the Royal Family were returning to this country by airfrom a visit overseas.
3113Territorial 5.   The Cabinet had before them: -Waters.(Previous (i) A memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (C. (58) 126)Reference:      recommending that the Conventions on the Territorial Sea, the HighC.C. (58) 45th Seas, Fisheries Conservation and the Continental Shelf, adopted by theConclusions,    recent International Conference on the Law of the Sea, together with minute 3).      an Optional Protocol on the submission of disputes arising under the conventions to the International Court of Justice, should be signed onbehalf of Her Majesty&apos;s Government with a view to their laterratification.(ii) A memorandum by the Attorney-General (C. (58) 121) on the tactics to be adopted at the next international discussion on the breadth of territorial waters.Law of the Sea. The Attorney-General supported the recommendation that her majesty&apos;s Government should sign the four Conventions and the optional Protocol. In particular, acceptance of the Articles dealingwith the freedom of all nations to fish on the high seas would reinforceour opposition to the Icelandic Governments claim to extendedfishing rights, and signature of the Conventions would improve ourposition generally at the next international discussion on the breadth of territorial waters without committing us on that issue.Discussion showed that there was general agreement with thisview. The following main points were made:  (a) Article 19 of the Convention on the Territorial Sea, which dealt with the arrest of persons and the conduct of investigations onboard foreign ships passing through the territorial sea, would require legislation in respect of England and Wales. The Bill would betechnical and non-controversial and would not be required beforethe Convention was ratified.(b) Article 5(8) of the Convention on the Continental Shelf,which required the consent of the coastal State to scientific research on the Shelf, might inconvenience and delay research. Furtherconsideration should be given to the desirability of attaching a reservation to our acceptance of this Article at the time of ratification.(c) The Government had in general been prepared to accept thejurisdiction of the International Court in disputes under Conventionsto which we were a party. Signature of the Optional Protocol should,on balance, strengthen our position if other nations sought to put an unacceptable interpretation on any of the Conventions.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Geneva Conventions on the territorial sea, the High Seas, Fisheries Conservation and theContinental Shelf, together with the Optional Protocolon the settlement of disputes under these Conventions,should be signed on behalf of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwith a view to ratification in due course.It was noted that the arrangements now proposed would further the efforts which were being made to establish a convention that ministers from Commonwealth or foreign countries arriving in this  /&quot;vcountry by air could suitably be received elsewhere than at london airport.The Cabinet Took note that the Home Secretary would arrange for a note to be circulated to Ministers on the procedure to be followedon these occasions.
rf*v   Territorial The Attorney-General recalled  that  the last InternationalO   Waters Conference on the Law of the Sea had concluded that the united nations should study the advisability of convening a further conference on the unresolved issues of the breadth of the territorial sea and exclusive fishing rights. It would be to our advantage to endorse this conclusion and to canvass support for our policy amongthe other members of the Commonwealth in advance, since aninternational agreement offered the only prospect of forestalling&apos;unilateral action by individual countries. A further conference might,admittedly, fail to establish such an agreement or even recommend the adoption of a twelve-mile limit to the territorial sea. But these risk would be reduced if agreement could be secured that the issueof exclusive fishing rights should be dealt with separately at a seriesof regional conferences rather than on a single world-wide basis.There was no hope of securing agreement to the retention of a three-mile limit to territorial waters and, if a further conference wasconvened, we should again support the proposal of the United StatesGovernment for a six-mile limit. The innocent passage of warships,though not of aircraft, through territorial waters and internationalstraits was secured by the new Convention on the Territorial Sea, andto that extent a six-mile limit could be regarded as acceptable fromthe strategic point of view.In discussion it was emphasised that, if there was to beinternational agreement on a six-mile limit to the teritorial sea, itwould be very important to secure, if possible, recognition of the rightof innocent passage for military aircraft, which would otherwise be denied access to the Mediterranean, Aden, Singapore and Hong Kong.It was suggested that, if the possibility of establishing this right was in doubt, it might be preferable to oppose a further conference and to resist as far as possible any unilateral claims to extended territorial waters which might subsequently be made.On the other hand, the majority of other nations could beexpected to acquiesce in unilateral claims of this nature, with theresult that they would in time become hardly less valid in internationallaw than formal convention. An agreed de-limitation of territorial waters would be to our advantage in other respects and would leaveunaffected the right of passage of aircraft, which we should seek tonegotiate as a separate issue. This possibility might be exploredfurther with the United States and with the other members of theCommonwealth before we committed ourselves to endorsing theproposal for a further conference on the breadth of territorial waters.In further discussion some doubt was expressed about the expediency of handling the question of exclusive fishing rights atseparate regional conferences. Moderate opinion on this subjecttended to be concentrated in Europe, and if a conference dealing witha non-European region agreed on an exclusive fishery limit of twelvemiles or more, Iceland, Denmark and other European countries mightbe encouraged to refuse agreement to any narrower limit. On theother hand, regional conferences, by taking account of the differingconditions and requirements of local fishing industries, should reducethe pressure for a general extension of the limit of territorial waters to twelve miles.The Home Secretary, summing up the discussion, said that, beforethe Cabinet could reach a final decision on their policy in this matter,the issues raised during the discussion should be given more detailed consideration. The result of this examination should, if possible, besubmitted to the Cabinet during the first half of July.The Cabinet (2) Took note that the Home Secretary would recommend to thePrime Minister the appointment of a ministerial committee,   under   the   chairmanship   of  the   Lord
Chancellor, to give further urgent consideration to the issues discussed in C. (58) 121.Icelandic The Minister of Agriculture said that the British TrawlersFishery Limits Federation proposed to send representatives to Iceland in order to assess the reaction of local opinion to the Icelandic Government^declared intention to claim extended fishing rights and to emphasise the disadvantages to Iceland of pursuing this claim.In discussion it was recognised that the Federation could not be prevented from sending representatives to Iceland for this purpose.Such a mission might, however, be regarded by the icelandic government as a sign of weakening on the part of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and, if it was to go, its departure should be deferred until well after 30th June, when the new Icelandic regulations wereto be published.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to try to dissuade theBritish Trawlers Federation from sending representatives to Iceland, at least until some time after 30th June.aden protectorate(previous reference :C.C. (58) 33rdConclusions,Minute 2)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the colonial secretary (C. (58) 131) on future policy towards the Aden Protectorate.The Colonial Secretary recalled that in 1956 the Cabinet had approved in principle proposals for the establishment of a federation in the Western Aden Protectorate but these proposals had beenfrustrated by the rivalry and suspicion which had existed at the time between the Rulers of the States concerned. Recent events, however,had caused those Rulers who were most friendly to this country andmost determined in their opposition to the Yemen to overcome theirjealousies sufficiently to agree among themselves on the desirabilityof federation. They had now asked us to help them to give effect tothis policy and to give military and financial assistance to thefederation when established. They contemplated that the federation should enter into treaty relations with the United Kingdom and shouldbe as closely bound to it as were the individual States at present; butthey also hoped that we would be prepared, in launching thefederation, to make it clear that it would be expected to achieveindependence in due course and thereafter to enter into a new kindof treaty relation with the United Kingdom.The proposals which had been worked out in response to this initiative were outlined in C. (58) 131. They had been discussed and approved by the Colonial Policy Committee. They would involve some increase of expenditure; but this should be outweighed by theadvantages of securing greater cohesion among the States concerned.The Colony itself would not be immediately affected by theestablishment of a federation and would continue gradually todevelop its own system of internal self-government. It would bedesirable that the island of Perim and, possibly, the Kuria andMuria islands should now be separated from the Colony asunobtrusively as possible and administered henceforward by theGovernor as a separate unit and that further consideration should be&quot;given to the possibility of excising at a later stage a part of theColony itself to constitute a permanent military base.Discussion showed that there was general support for theseproposals. Some doubt was expressed, however, whether the relatively powerful and stable Arab State which they would promotemight in certain circumstances prove more damaging to our intereststhan the weak and divided political units who at present shared theterritory involved. It would therefore be essential to make it clear from the outset that, although the federation might hope to achieve
CC. 50 (58)independence in due course, this did not imply that we contemplatedsurrendering control over the defence policy and external relations of the States concerned at any time in the foreseeable future. Itwould also be desirable, in view of the strategic importance of Aden,that no interval should elapse between the establishment of thefederation and the conclusion of a new defence treaty satisfactory to ourselves. If possible, the provisions relating to defence should be incorporated in the constitutional document establishing thefederation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while endorsing theproposals in principle, he would need to give further consideration totheir financial implications. At present the maintenance of ourposition in Aden entailed expenditure of some  3^ millions a year.The establishment of a federation, if pursued simultaneously with theprogramme of social and economic development now underconsideration, would increase this figure to between  5 and  6 millions a year. It would be necessary to consider whether the individualStates themselves could make some contribution towards this expenditure and whether the burden on the Exchequer could also bereduced by some deferment of the development programme. the rulers should not be allowed at this stage to suppose that we would necessarily be ready to incur expenditure of the order of  6 millions a year in support of their policy.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Home Secretary would report to thePrime Minister that, in principle, they recommendedapproval of the proposals outlined in C. (58) 131.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary, subject to the Prime Minister^approval, to inform the Rulers of the States concerned that Her Majesty&apos;s Government favoured the formationof a federation in the Western Aden Protectorate.(3) Invited the Colonial Secretary to discuss further with theChancellor of the Exchequer the extent to which it mightbe possible for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to undertaketo provide financial support for such a federation.(4) Invited the Colonial Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Defence, to examine further the method bywhich a defence treaty could best be concluded with thefederation without risk to our essential strategic interestsin Aden.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (58) 127) discussing the attitude which the Governmentshould adopt towards the World Youth Festival to be held in Viennain July 1959.The Foreign Secretary said that World Youth Festivals, whichwere held every few years, were consistently used in the interests of communist propaganda. We had therefore condemned them inprinciple and had discouraged organisations and individuals in thiscountry from taking any part in them. Since the forthcoming festivalwould be held outside the Soviet bloc, it would be less open to objection in this respect; and it would also be easier for us to arrangefor the Western point of view to be actively represented during thediscussions. While, therefore, we should maintain our policy ofdenouncing these conferences and advising reputable organisations to refrain from participating in them, we might adopt, in connectionwith the projected conference in Vienna, a rather less discouragingattitude than on other occasions towards young people wishing toattend the conference as individuals.
wages policy.(previous reference:CC. (58) 41stConclusions,Minute 5).compulsory arbitration.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Labour (C. (58) 122) reporting the unanimous recommendation ofthe Committee on Wages Policy that Defence Regulation 58 A A,together with the Industrial Disputes Order, should be annulled atthe end of the year.The Minister of Labour said that the system of compulsory arbitration in industrial disputes, which had been a logical corollary of the prohibition of strike action during the war, had become increasingly less important since that prohibition had been withdrawn.The system could not operate without the agreement of both sides of industry; and, although the Trades Union Congress were in favourof its continuance, the British Employers&apos; Confederation were firmlyopposed to it. Moreover, there were relatively few cases in whichresort to compulsory arbitration could now be reconciled with the accepted principles of free collective bargaining; and it was more in keeping with those principles that industrial disputes should be settled,on a voluntary basis, by reference to the Industrial Court. There was,admittedly, sufficient agreement between the two sides of industry tomake it reasonable to suppose that non-controversial legislation couldbe enacted to continue that part of the existing Order which related to &quot; issues,&quot; i.e., to questions whether terms and conditions not less favourable than those negotiated by the established machinery of aparticular industry should be enforced upon an individual employer.But the question of &quot; issues &quot; was too small to exert any significant effort on industrial relations; and legislation limited to this alone would serve little useful purpose.Since Defence Regulation 58 A A derived from the Supplies and services Act, 1945, which would need to be renewed for other purposeson 10th December, it would be necessary to revoke the Regulation bya specific Order in Council. It would be appropriate that theGovernments intentions should be made clear during the autumn,preferably after the annual conference of the Trades Union Congress.In discussion there was general agreement with these views. Thefollowing points were made :  (a) The abandonment of compulsory arbitration increased theimportance of the review of the system of voluntary arbitration onwhich the Committee on Wages Policy were already engaged.(b) It would be possible to allow Defence Regulation 58AA tocontinue in force until the Supplies and Services Act, 1945, was itselfrepealed after the enactment of legislation on economic controls.This possibility might be further examined.(c) If, however, it appeared preferable to revoke the Regulationby an Order in Council, the debate on the Order might with advantage be so timed as to form part, if possible, of the more general debate on the renewal of the Supplies and Services Act.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (58) 122.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour to give further consideration,in the light of the points made in their discussion, to the timing of the announcement of these proposals and of theaction required to give effect to them.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal.The Cabinet Approved, in principle, the proposals in C. (58) 127.
CC. 50 (58)9. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it now appeared that, as part of the negotiations following the end of the London busstrike, the London Transport Executive proposed to offer a wage increase of 5s. 6d. a week to the bus crews who had been excludedfrom the award of the Industrial Court, An increase of this ordermight be regarded as too great a reduction in the differential betweenthe wages of central London bus crews and those of the excludedgrades, and it would be preferable that the increase granted to thelatter should not exceed 4s. 6d. or, at the most 4s. 9d. a week. Itwould be undesirable to issue a formal direction to the Executiveon this point; but he proposed, in concert with the Minister ofTransport, to warn the Chairmen of the British Transport Commissionand of the Executive of the importance of restricting the increase toa figure which would maintain a reasonable differential in relationto the award of the Industrial Court. The Commission were apparently prepared, on their own responsibility, to ensure that theoffer made by the Executive would not exceed 5s. Od.; but it was desirable that the increase should, if possible, be less than this figure.In discussion there was general agreement with this view.The Cabinet were also informed that, despite the public indicationby the Chairman of the Executive that it might be necessary for theExecutive to increase certain fares in order to recover the losses whichthey had sustained during the recent strike and to meet the cost of the wage increases agreed, the timing of the approach from the executive to the Transport Tribunal which would be necessary for this purpose would need to be reserved for further consideration.The Cabinet Took note that the Home Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, would seek the PrimeMinister^ approval of the advice which it was proposed togive to the British Transport Commission and the london transport Executive on the current negotiations in respect ofthe wages of the bus crews excluded from the recent award of the Industrial Court.industrial disputes.(previous reference:CC. (58) 48thConclusions,Minute 5).Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,26th June, 1958.
