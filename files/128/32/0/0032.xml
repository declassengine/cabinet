-    El) 4SECRET9ContentsTerritorial Waters
Territorial The Cabinet resumed their discussion of recent developments atWaters the International Conference on the Law of the Sea.  These included(Previous the latest United States proposal for a six-mile limit to territorialReference: waters and an additional six miles for exclusive fishing rights, with c.C. (58) 31st the reservation of fishing rights in the outer six miles to any StateConclusions. which had previously enjoyed them for a continuous period of fiveMinute 5) years.The Attorney-General said that it now seemed likely that theMexico-Indian proposal for an extension of territorial waters and exclusive fishing rights up to a limit of twelve miles would secure amajority in Committee, and thereafter the necessary two-thirds majority in Plenary Session. Even without the latter, States who wished to extend their territorial waters to twelve miles would claim that they had the support of the majority of the members of theUnited Nations and it would subsequently be difficult to challengetheir action effectively before the International Court. meanwhile the Canadian delegation were intending to put forward, either as aseparate proposal or as an amendment to the United States proposal,an extension to six miles for territorial waters with a further six milesfor exclusive fishing rights, without any reservations in respect ofexisting fishing rights as proposed by the United States. The indian representatives appeared likely to accept the latest United states proposal subject to the proviso (which the United States would not accept) that States might claim twelve miles of territorial waters ifthey had already maintained such a claim for a specified period.The Soviet representatives had suggested to the United States thatas an extension to twelve miles for exclusive fishing rights was nowbeing generally recognised, this limit should also be adopted forterritorial waters, since it was in the interests of both Governments toprevent any more extensive claims for territorial waters. Our ownproposal of six miles for both territorial waters and exclusive fishing rights had no chance of acceptance, and in the Attorney-GeneraFsjudgment the only way to prevent the adoption of twelve miles forall purposes was to support the United States proposal. Our support would probably secure for it a majority in Committee and possibly in Plenary Session.- In discussion on the impact of the United States proposal onour fisheries interests, the danger was recognised that fishing rightsenjoyed for five years, even if safeguarded in Committee, might subsequently be lost or restricted, especially if in accordance withthe proposal a dispute were to be submitted to arbitration. Forexample, attempts might be made to impose limits on the period forwhich the reserved rights might be exercised, on the number of ships which might enjoy them or, by way of conservation provisions, on themethods of fishing which might be adopted. On the other hand,provided that adequate safeguards were preserved, the United states proposal was not materially less favourable than our own, and if thealternative were twelve miles&apos; exclusive fishing rights with noreservation, on balance it would be to our advantage to support theUnited States proposal in Committee. We should, however, reserveour position at the plenary stage, when the details of the final formof the provision would be known.In discussion of the strategic implications of the United states proposal the following points were made:  (a) Since there was at present no right of innocent passage for aircraft over territorial waters or international straits, the extensionof the breadth of territorial waters from three to six miles would seriously affect the movement of military aircraft. In practicedifficulties were unlikely to arise in the areas covered by the north atlantic Treaty Organisation, but the approaches to Singapore by air would be closed and the air approaches to Aden and Hong Kong
would be restricted. It seemed unlikely that the necessary rights of innocent passage for military aircraft could be provided later byamendments to the Chicago Convention on Civil Aviation, as suggested by the United States delegation, since this Convention didnot apply to military aircraft and the far-reaching revision necessarywould require the unanimous agreement of its signatories. though there was a possibility that some provision governing the passage ofcivil aircraft might at a later stage be inserted in the present draftConvention on the Law of the Sea, since many Afro-Asian countries were interested in ensuring freedom for their national airlines, it was doubtful whether any express safeguards could be provided in thisway for the movement of military aircraft. In these circumstances itwas arguable that even a twelve-mile limit to which we had refusedto subscribe was preferable to our public acceptance of a six-mile limit.(b) The effect of the present draft Convention on the rights of innocent passage by ships through international straits was open tolegal doubt. It was hoped that at a later stage the present Article 24in the draft Convention (which entitled a coastal State to make thepassage of warships through the territorial sea subject to previousauthorisation or notification) could be eliminated; but the view mightbe held that the right of innocent passage through international straitswithout prior authorisation was not prejudiced by Article 24.(c) The extension of territorial waters to six miles would,however, close the access by sea to Singapore, except with the priorauthorisation of either the Malayan or Indonesian Governments.This restriction on our use of Singapore as a naval base could notbe accepted.In further discussion on the tactics to be adopted at the geneva conference the following points were made :  (d) It was unsatisfactory that decisions on such important issueshad to be taken at such short notice. Any deferment of the vote onthe breadth of territorial waters in Committee on the following afternoon was unlikely, however, since the Soviet bloc had indicated that they would oppose any deferment and this attitude was likelyto be supported by the Afro-Asian group. We should, however,register a protest against the procedure adopted at the Conference.(e) It would be unwise to suggest that the United States proposal should not be put forward until the plenary stage, because this wouldresult in a majority for the Mexico-Indian proposal in Committee.Even if this proposal did not subsequently obtain a two-thirds majorityat the plenary stage, States intent on obtaining a twelve-mile limit forterritorial waters would be in a position to claim that their view hadbeen supported by a majority of the members of the United Nations.(/) Tactically it would be preferable for the United states proposal to obtain a majority in Committee even if it were subsequently defeated in Plenary Session. Without any such support for an alternative proposal, a breakdown of the Conference would present the Soviet bloc with valuable material for propaganda andwould expose us to unilateral claims for extension of territorial waters to twelve miles or more. Moreover, there was reasonable hope that theUnited States proposal would secure some majority in plenary session and, if the Conference broke down through the conflict ofthe United States and Mexico-Indian proposals, we should be in a stronger position to resist unilateral claims and our existing practice in regard to the movement of aircraft would not be prejudiced.(g) The Convention, as and when adopted by the Conference,would be binding only on those States who subsequently decided to sign it, and the question whether signature with reservations wouldbe permitted had not yet been debated. The Cabinet would thereforebe able to consider at a later stage whether Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould adhere to the Convention in its final form.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that, on balance, it would seem preferable that the United Kingdom delegation
Cabinet Office, S.W.1.16th April, 1958.should speak and vote in favour of the United States proposal in committee, but should make it clear that they were doing so on the assumptions:  (i) as regards fisheries, that the final form of the convention would in all respects safeguard all existing rights which had beenenjoyed for five years;(ii) as regards movement of ships, that established conventionsof innocent passage without prior authorisation were preserved;(iii) that all rights of access to ports hitherto exercised werepreserved;(iv) that the extension of territorial sea from three miles to sixwould not prejudice normal and existing practices in regard to themovement of aircraft.It should also be made clear that Her Majesty&apos;s Government werenot committed at the plenary stage if there were any derogation fromthese assumptions.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Attorney-General to support the latest UnitedStates proposal at the International Conference on the law of the Sea, subject to the reservations agreed in their discussion.(2) Invited the Attorney-General to keep them informed offurther developments at the Conference.
