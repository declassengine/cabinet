Jordan. The Foreign Secretary said that there were as yet no indications of any further weakening in King Hussein&apos;s position in Jordan, but itwas difficult to forecast how the situation might develop. If united nations observers could establish themselves in Amman, this mighthave some effect in discouraging dissident elements. But there was little doubt that the Egyptian Government could, if they chose, stirup disaffection on the West Bank.In discussion some anxiety was expressed about the situationin which the British troops in Amman would be placed if the wholeweight of the Jordan Army were turned against them. It was desirablethat they should be provided with the anti-tank weapons and otherheavy equipment which they would need to meet such an attack.It would become easier to supply them with this equipment when a line of communication by land had been opened.The Cabinet -(1) Invited the Minister of Defence to consider what steps could now be taken to supply heavier anti-tank weapons to theBritish forces in Amman.Meeting of The Cabinet were informed that, as a result of further exchangesHeads of with the United States Government and discussions in the NorthGovernments. Atlantic Council, some changes had been made in the text of thePrime Ministers proposed reply to the latest message fromMr. Khruschev. The main change of substance was that the reply would not exclude the possibility that the proposed meeting of theSecurity Council, attended by Heads of Governments, might be heldin Europe.The Cabinet &apos;(2) Approved the terms of the revised text of the PrimeMinisters reply to Mr. Khruschev, and authorised its immediate despatch to Moscow.(3) Took note that the text of the reply would be embodied in astatement which the Prime Minister was to make in theHouse of Commons that afternoon.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed that Parliament would adjournfor the summer recess on 1st August. An assurance would be given that Parliament would be re-convened during the recess if theinternational situation developed in such a way as to make thisdesirable. Subject to this, Parliament would meet and be proroguedon 23rd October, and the new session would be opened on28th October.The Lord Privy Seal said that he would be considering duringthe recess what evidence he should give to the Select Committee on procedure. If Ministers had any suggestions to make to him onthis, or any comments on the evidence already given to theCommittee, he hoped they would communicate with him.53860-12Middle East. 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Governments  of(Previous Pakistan, Persia and Turkey were likely to announce that day their reference: recognition of the new regime in Iraq. He proposed that the UnitedC.C. (58) 65th Kingdom Government should take similar action on the following conclusions, day.

Opening ofParliament.TelevisionFacilities.(previous reference :CC. (58) 65thConclusions,Minute 2.)mThe Cabinet Took note that it would be announced that afternoon in both Houses of Parliament that facilities would be givento the British Broadcasting Corporation for televising theforthcoming Opening of Parliament.Pensions.(previous reference:CC. (58) 54thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Pensions (C. (58) 165) to which was annexed a draft white Paper on the development of the National Insurance scheme.The Prime Minister recalled that the Ministerial Committee on pensions had been invited to examine certain unresolved issues of detail in the compromise pensions scheme which the Cabinet had approved in principle (a graduated scheme with contracting out andthe existing flat-rate scheme for those contracted out and the self-employed). The principal issues were the treatment of the national health Service contribution and the method of deriving additional revenue from the graduated scheme to compensate for the loss ofcontributions from those who were contracted out. The Committeehad agreed that the National Health Service contribution should beat a flat rate, but the draft White Paper before the Cabinet reflecteda compromise between divergent views on other questions: theNational Health Service contribution was to remain unequallydivided between employer and employee but merged with theNational Insurance contribution, and the level of earnings to whichthe minimum contribution would be related and above which the graduated scheme would operate (the cross-bar) should be raised from  8 to  9.The Chancellor of -the Exchequer said that he would prefer that the National Health Service contribution, divided unevenlybetween employer and employee, should be kept separate from theNational Insurance contribution. With this arrangement the scheme would be simpler to present, and it would be easier to increase theNational Health Service contribution if that became necessary atany time in the future. If the National Insurance contribution were fixed at 8 per cent, instead of 1\ per cent, as originally proposed, thescheme could be presented as financially sound and the cross-barcould be retained at the level of  8 a week, which representedminimum earnings at the present time. If the cross-bar were raised to  9 the scope of the graduated scheme would be unduly narrowedand there would be little room for manoeuvre if, by the time thescheme was introduced, minimum earnings had risen and the3, The Prime Minister said that The Queen had given herconsent to the televising of the forthcoming Opening of Parliament,and an announcement to this effect would be made in both houses of Parliament later that day. There were indications that the division of opinion on this question in the House of Commons wassharpening but, even so, there was little doubt that the government&apos;s decision would command a broad measure of support.The Cabinet were informed that the question might be raised whether television of this ceremony would contravene Section 41of the Criminal Justice Act, 1925, which made it an offence to takephotographs in a court of law. The Lord Chancellor said that hewas satisfied that there was no substance in this suggestion. Thejudicial functions of the House of Lords were subsidiary to its mainfunction; and it was clear that on the occasion of the Opening ofParliament the House of Lords was not a court within the meaning of this section of the Criminal Justice Act.
Government had in consequence decided to raise the rate ofbenefit. Moreover, the compromise proposed would have the effectthat the contribution for insurance benefits would be a higherpercentage of earnings for higher-paid than for lower-paid workers,a principle which might be politically dangerous, and that women would receive a higher pension than men on the same earnings level,and receive it five years sooner, although they would be paying lowercontributions.The Minister of Pensions, on the other hand, favoured theinclusion of the National Health Service contribution within a totalpercentage contribution of 8i per cent, of earnings and, in order tobring in the additional revenue required, the raising of the cross-barto  9. The element of the total contribution which related to industrial injuries benefit must be at a flat rate in order to avoidpressure for graduated benefits and it followed from this that,whether or not the National Health Service contribution were included within the total, the portion of the total which related to insurance benefit (excluding industrial injuries) must represent ahigher percentage of earnings for the higher-paid than for the lower-paid workers. Since, however, the total percentage was the samefor all within the graduated scheme, this was little more than apresentational point. The contributions and benefits for womencould probably be so adjusted as to avoid the anomaly to which theChancellor of the Exchequer had referred.Discussion showed that opinion in the Cabinet was divided onthese issues. The effect of the Chancellor^ proposals would be thatat the maximum level of earnings in the graduated scheme ( 15 aweek) the present employee&apos;s contribution of 9s. lid. would beraised by about 4s., as against an increase of less than 3s. entailed by the original proposals of the Minister of Pensions (including an even split of the National Health Service contribution). While thehigher cross-bar of  9 might be thought preferable on social andpolitical grounds, it would pre-empt the possibility of raising the cross-bar to finance any subsequent increase in the basic pensionrate and so greatly add to the future difficulties of the scheme.In further discussion on the draft White Paper the followingpoints were made:  (a) The inherent merits of the graduated scheme should be more clearly presented.(b) The background material contained in Parts I to IV of thedraft should be so rearranged as not to obscure the impact of theGovernments proposals.(c) The examples illustrating the effect of these proposals oncontributors should be set out more clearly and forcibly. Inparticular, some examples in the present draft were misleading inthat they did not reveal the extent to which women were more favourably treated than men.(d) Some diagrammatic representation of the effect of theemerging deficit might be included.(e) The White Paper should be published at the end ofSeptember or early October, before the Conservative party conference.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that further consideration should be given to the issues of policy which remained unresolved. Meanwhile, a draft Bill should be prepared on the basis of the compromise put forward by the ministerial committee: this could, if necessary, be amended in the light of later53860-12b 3
ssdecisions.   At the same time, the draft White Paper should be revised in order to present the Governmenfs proposals in a form      ariyas attractive and intelligible as possible.The Cabinet &apos;(1) Agreed that further consideration should be given to thetreatment of the National Health Service contribution and the level of the cross-bar.(2) Authorised the Minister of Pensions to arrange for a Billto be drafted, provisionally and subject to Conclusion (1)above, on the basis that the National Health service contribution should remain unequally divided betweenemployer and employee and should be merged in thetotal percentage contribution and that the level of the cross-bar should be  9 a week.(3) Invited the Minister of Pensions to prepare a revised draft white Paper on the same provisional basis taking accountof the points agreed in their discussion.Employment.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 64thConclusions,Minute 4.)5., The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that on 24th july the Cabinet had invited him to submit a list of measures whichcould be introduced, with immediate and selective effect, to redressa decline in industrial production and employment. There were some indications that the decline in employment had been checkedduring the past month. He had, however, come to the conclusion thatit would be wise to inject into the economy at this stage anadditional expenditure of about  30 millions on projects whichwould quickly provide employment, especially in areas where unemployment was relatively high. He therefore proposed that authority should be given for work to be started on an additional7,500 houses in England and Wales, and he also proposed theexpenditure of  9 millions on maintenance and equipment of hospitals,  1 million on maintenance of Government buildings and 5 millions on miscellaneous local government projects, includingroads and some minor educational works, in areas of high unemployment. In selecting these measures account had been taken of the cuts imposed on these programmes in the past, the extent towhich additional expenditure in the current year would relieve the investment overload in future years, and the need to direct additional work to areas of high unemployment. It was hoped that about one-third of the total would be placed in such areas, providing workfor about 10,000 people. On present forecasts expenditure of this amount should suffice to meet the situation. If, however, the levelof unemployment increased unexpectedly, it would be possible toauthorise further short-term projects which could be undertakenquickly..The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he also proposedthat, towards the end of August, there should be a relaxation ofcontrol over the initial deposits on hire purchase arrangements overa wide range of industrial products, particularly machinery and plant.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be expedient to inject into the economy an additional amount of investment expenditure of the order of  30 millions. Although the primary aim was to provide additional employment in areas where unemployment was relatively high, some of the measures proposed were designed to help the national economy as a whole. The size of the provisional allocation for hospital maintenance took accountof the fact that the hospital programme had been severely cut. But,by the same criterion, there was a strong case for some further
increase in the education programme, where many, minor workscould be started quickly. The possibility of increasing the allocation to such projects should be considered further.There was also general support for the proposal to relax controls on hire purchase. In view of the indications of a fall in demand forengineering projects, it was suggested that these relaxations might subsequently need to be extended.It would be undesirable that any general announcement shouldbe made about the proposals for additional investment during thecurrent year. These should be put into operation separately, by administrative action. It would, however, be necessary to announce the relaxations in the control over hire purchase. Thatannouncement might be made during the week beginning25th August.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that an additional  30 millions of investment expenditure should be undertaken in the public sectorin the current financial year.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss further with the Ministers concerned whether a larger proportionof this expenditure could effectively be applied to minorworks under the education programme and a lesserproportion to maintenance work on hospitals.(3) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrange forthe proposed relaxation in hire-purchase control to be announced during the week beginning 25th August.social investment.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 64thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Home Secretary made an interim report on his consultations with the other Ministers concerned on the scope of increased investment in the social services in future years. a constructive policy on the social services was both necessary and politically valuable, but it must not be pressed forward at the riskof imperilling the country&apos;s finances. The main features of theprogramme should be pensions, schools, hospitals and prisons. Nocapital investment would be required for the first. The competing claims of the others, in the years 1959-60 and 1960-61, must besettled within the total investment programme agreed in principle by the Cabinet.In discussion it was suggested that, in the sphere of housing,the main advance should now be made in connection with house purchase rather than through local authority programmes.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to continue his review of social investment policy and to report further on this to theCabinet.agricultural policy.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 41stConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (58) 166) on the government&apos;s proposals for assistance for the small farmer.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that these proposals had now been discussed with the National Farmers Unions and, as aresult, the supplementary scheme (which had originally been designedto provide assistance on a temporary basis both to farm businesses
not likely to be viable in the foreseeable future and to those which,though fundamentally viable, were not yet able to embark on anycomprehensive programme of improvement) had been modified to exclude the non-viable businesses, except those covered by theexisting marginal production schemes. The effect would be to reducethe total number of farmers eligible for assistance from 130,000 to90,000. The schemes would enable the Government to claim a netcredit of some  6 millions at the next Annual Review but wouldinvolve the Exchequer in additional expenditure on fertilisers and \Jon the ordinary subsidies for ploughing-up to the extent of about 3^ millions.The Minister of Agriculture said that the only point on whichthere had been substantial disagreement with the Unions was their desire to have part of the assistance in the form, not of grants, but of interest-free loans, the capital for which would be providedoutside the Annual Review. This could not be accepted, partly because of the objection to providing additional funds for agricultureoutside the Annual Review and partly for practical reasons ofadministration. Assistance by way of grants might, however, enablethe farmers themselves to negotiate loans through the banks, whichwould have considerable political as well as financial advantages.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.The Government were virtually committed by the last White paper on the Annual Review to introducing the necessary legislation duringthe 1958-59 session and it should be passed early in the session in orderthat credit for the new schemes could be taken at the 1959 annual review. Arrangements should therefore be made to draft the bill and the accompanying White Paper without delay.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (58) 166.CivilAviation.(previous reference:C.C. (58) 61stConclusions.)KuwaitAirways.Jet Aircraft.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Transport and Civil Aviation (C. (58) 170) on thenegotiations between British Overseas Airways Corporation(B.O.A.C.) and Kuwait Airways.The Minister of Civil Aviation said that protracted negotiationswith Kuwait Airways by both B.O.A.C. and Hunting Clan had failed to produce any satisfactory commercial agreement. He had therefore asked the Corporation to conclude an agreement on thebest terms possible, even if this involved them in a loss; and a contract had been signed in time for operations to begin early inJune. Although the agreement was likely to involve the corporation in a loss of  100,000, at any rate in the first year, it would serve thenational interest by averting the risk that an Egyptian airline would establish itself in Kuwait.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of C. (58) 170.The Cabinet also had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Transport and Civil Aviation (C. (58) 172) on the degreeof noise which would be made by jet aircraft in the approaches toLondon Airport.The Minister of Civil Aviation said that the agreement forreciprocal services between Moscow and London by british european Airways (B.E.A.) and Aerofiot had been made on theexplicit understanding that the noise level of the Soviet jet TU-104aircraft would be subject to our approval before the services began.
CC. 66 (58)It appeared that Aerofiot had not been able to fit noise suppressorsto the TU-104 without a substantial loss of power. They had,however, opened operations between Moscow and Amsterdam and moscow and Brussels and would shortly operate to Paris. Thus the projected service by B.E.A. to Moscow was being held back while their competitors on the continent were able to operate such a service.He therefore proposed to inform the Soviet Government that hewould be prepared to allow the TU-104 to operate to and from london Airport, subject to fairly severe restrictions designed toreduce disturbance caused by the noise of its engines. this concession would mean that at a later date other big jet aircraft would also have to be allowed to use London Airport, but the operating conditions in each case would be adjusted to the noisecharacteristics of the particular aircraft. These restrictions onforeign jet aircraft should work to the advantage of the Comet,which had a much lower noise level.The Cabinet -(2) Approved the proposals in C. (58) 172.Cabinet.ProcedureduringRecess.9. The Prime Minister said that during August and the first half of September the Standing Committees of the Cabinet wouldnot meet for the transaction of ordinary business: urgent business on subjects normally handled by them would be dealt with by theCabinet itself. For emergency business, especially business arisingfrom the situation in the Middle East, meetings of the DefenceCommittee or the Cabinet would be held as necessary; and these meetings would be attended by such Ministers as were in London or within easy reach of it. Ministers directly concerned with the handling of that situation would need to adjust their holiday plans in the light of developments; but other Ministers need not at presentmake any change in the arrangements which they had made for thefirst part of the recess. Throughout August there would be enoughMinisters in the United Kingdom to enable the essential urgentbusiness of the Cabinet to be carried on. If the situation changed,and different arrangements had to be made, a further notificationwould be sent to the individual Ministers concerned.EconomicSituation.(previous reference:CC. (58) 48thConclusions,Minute 4.)10. The Cabinet were informed that the sterling area reserves of gold and dollars had suffered no net loss during July. Sterlinghad remained remarkably strong in the face of recent events in theMiddle East. It was likely that, owing to seasonal factors, therewould be some drop in the reserves in August and September.
