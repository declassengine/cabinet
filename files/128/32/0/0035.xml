Parliament.LocalGovernmentReform.(previous reference :C.C. (57) 71stConclusions,Minute 6.)Education.2. The Prime Minister said that the Association of EducationCommittees, supported by the National Union of Teachers, had recently proposed that the Local Government Bill, which had passedits Committee Stage in the House of Commons, should be amended inorder to restore the percentage grant in relation to the capitalexpenditure of local education authorities.Discussion showed that opinion in the Cabinet was divided on this issue. On the one hand, it was argued that the development of theeducation service should form a major element in the Governmentsfuture policy and that, unless some attempt was made to conciliate the educational interests, who were strongly critical of the inclusion ofeducation in the proposed general grant, they would be increasinglyreluctant to co-operate in implementing the Governmenfs plans.Moreover, the proposal had merit in itself. The need for capitalexpenditure on education varied widely in different parts of thecountry and it would be difficult to devise a formula for distribution ofthe general grant which would be adapted to these variedcircumstances.On the other hand, Government spokesmen had repeatedly statedthat educational development would not be hampered by thesubstitution of the general grant for a percentage grant, and the government&apos;s supporters, who had been content to endorse this argument throughout the debates on the Bill, would be dismayed by anabrupt reversal of policy at this late stage. The amount of theproposed percentage grant would be negligible in relation to thegeneral grant, and the Government would be judged by the amount ofmoney which they made available for the development ofthe education service rather than by the form in which the grant was paid. If the proposed concession was made, it would be necessary toapply it to capital expenditure by local authorities in other fields andit might not be possible to avoid extending it to certain types ofmaintenance expenditure as well.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, on balance, it appeared to be inopportune to move the proposed amendment in the House of Commons at this stage. It would therefore be necessary to re-emphasise that the Government were inearnest in their intention that the general grant should in no wayimpede the development of the education service. But, in view of thestrength of the feeling on this subject, it might be desirable &apos;oconsider the possibility of amending the Bill in the sense proposed inthe House of Lords.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Local Government Bill should not be amended in the House of Commons in order to restore thepercentage grant on capital expenditure by local educationauthorities.(2) Invited the Minister of Education and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland, in consultation with the Minister of housing and Local Government, to circulate a memorandum on the implications of moving such an amendment in the Houseof Lords.Vaccines: 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePoliomyelitis. Minister of Health (C. (58) 90) to which was annexed a minute by the(Previous Secretary of the Medical Research Council (M.R.C.) containingReference : further advice from the Council on vaccination against poliomyelitis in C.C. (58) 34th relation to the present shortage of vaccine. On further considerationConclusions,Minute 3.) SECRET53440-2 1! 21. The Cabinet were informed of the business tc be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
the M.R.C. had advised that, as a temporary expedient in the present emergency, it would be justifiable to consider making available Salicvaccine which had not passed the safety tests of the M.R.C., inaddition to British vaccine and Salk vaccine which had passed bothBritish and American tests, provided that the relative risks of eachtype of vaccine were made known to the medical profession and thepublic and that both doctors and recipients were free to choosewhether or not they would use it.The Minister of Health proposed that he should incorporate thesubstance of this advice in the statement which he intended to make inParliament on 1st May. In addition, the Ministry of Health and theDepartment of Health for Scotland would issue to Medical Officers ofHealth and general practitioners a memorandum of technical guidance on the use of Salk vaccine, which would be agreed with the M.R.C. andwould inevitably receive a certain amount of publicity.In discussion it was suggested that the M.R.C. might wish, inaddition, to publish their own statement of die reasons which, in their view, justified a temporary change in the Governments policy on thetesting of Salk vaccine. It was open to question, however, whether thiscourse would be advisable. Publication might constitute an embarrassing precedent in relation to other advice tendered to theGovernment by the Council. It might also create a greater degree ofpublic alarm about the reliability of untested Salk vaccine than thefacts warranted. Finally, it might provoke discussion in the course ofwhich it would become clear that the Council had modified their recent advice, albeit on their own responsibility, after the Governmenthad invited them to reconsider the issues involved. Further considera-tion should, therefore, be given to the form in which any statement ofthe Councils views might be published.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, as a temporary measure, supplies of Salk vaccineshould be made available without testing by the medical research Council.(2) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with the Secretaryof State for Scotland, the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster and the Minister of Health, to discuss with theSecretary of the Medical Research Council, in the light ofthe points made in their discussion, whether, and if so in what form, a statement of the Councils views should bepublished and thereafter to submit this issue to the PrimeMinister for his decision.Steel. 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the location of Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (58) 66) and a memorandum by theNew Works. Minister for Welsh Affairs (C. (58) 87) about the location of a new steel(Previous        strip mill.Reference: j/7e chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Economic policy .C. (57) 42nd Committee were satisfied that the probable growth of demand for conclusions, sheet steel and tinplate made it essential to construct a new strip mill;Minute l.) tnat- the project would have to be undertaken by Richard Thomas and baldwins, Ltd., the only major steel-making company which was stillnationalised; and that the greater part of the cost of construction,estimated at some  120 millions, would need to be met bythe Exchequer.The Committee had been unable, however, to agree on the site ofthe new mill. They had considered four possible sites Newport,Grangemouth, Kidwelly and Immingham. Exhaustive examination by the Iron and Steel Board, Richard Thomas and Baldwins, Ltd., theBritish Transport Commission and the National Coal Board indicated that, on economic grounds, Newport was the most suitable site. Amill constructed at Newport should ensure a higher return on capital
The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.and a lower unit cost of production than a mill of the same capacity atGrangemouth. Moreover, Newport had advantages over Grange-mouth in.terms of dock facilities and the supply of coking coal; it wascloser than Grangemouth to the main markets of the steel industry inthe Midlands and London; and whereas development of the site &quot;atGrangemouth would sterilise large deposits of coal, no coal depositslay directly beneath the Newport site. The Scottish Council(Development and Industry) had, however, maintained that, from theeconomic point of view, Grangemouth compared more favourably with Newport than the Iron and Steel Board&apos;s assessment indicated;and strong social arguments had also been advanced in favour of the site at Grangemouth.In discussion it was suggested that, since the exports of the metal-using industries were likely to encounter increasingly strongcompetition, the choice of the site lor the new strip mill should bedetermined primarily by reference to the economic implications of operation at each of the possible sites. The costings put forward by theScottish Council in relation to Grangemouth had&apos; been rejected by theMinistry of Power after consultation with the other interests concerned; and it seemed clear that, on economic grounds, theNewport site enjoyed an advantage which would become even mor significant if production was increased beyond the assumed initiallevel. On the other hand, it could be argued that this advantage wasnot so substantial as to outweigh the considerations of social policywhich the Government were statutorily bound to take into account in seeking to effect a balanced distribution of industry. From this pointof view there were strong arguments for the Grangemouth site.Unemployment at Newport was negligible; but at Grangemouth it was already high and was tending to increase as the result of theGovernments own action in closing Service establishments and promoting a contraction of the shale oil industry. The migration of skilled labour from Scotland was a matter of increasing concern, and scottish public opinion regarded the Government^ decision on the location of the new strip mill as a critical test of their willingness totake bold and imaginative action in order to secure a greater diversifi-cation of industry in Scotland where no steel strip capacity existed atpresent. The choice of Grangemouth as the site for the new millshould therefore do much to reduce local unemployment by attractingrelated industries to the industrial area of Scotland, whereas a decision in favour of a Welsh site would merely intensify the concentration ofsteel strip production in Wales contrary to any sound policy for thedistribution of industry.These arguments, however, must be weighed against the claims ofthe site at Kidwelly, which, though less profitable than Newport,should ensure more economic operation than Grangemouth and, in thelight of the current level of unemployment, could be argued to have at least as strong a claim as Grangemouth on social and political grounds. Moreover, local feeling on the location of the new mill wasno less strong in Wales than in Scotland, particularly since it was widely known that Richard Thomas and Baldwins, Ltd., had declaredthemselves in favour of the Newport site. If the Government nowpreferred Grangemouth, their decision would be interpreted by Welshnationalist sentiment as deliberate discrimination against Wales. Ifeconomic factors alone were to decide the issue, the case in favour ofNewport was strong. But, if social arguments also were to be takeninto account, Kidwelly could match the claim of Grangemouth to heselected as the site for the new mill.
territorial waters.(previous reference :C.C. (58) 33rdConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof State for Foreign Affairs (C. (58) 88) on the results of the recentInternational Conference on the Law of the Sea.The Foreign Secretary said that, although the Conference had failed to reach any agreement on the limit of territorial waters and exclusive fishing rights, Conventions about fisheries and the conservation of natural resources, the continental shelf and the regimeof the high seas had been adopted. These Conventions were acceptable to us and the United Kingdom Delegation, under the leadership of the attorney-General, were to be congratulated on their presentation ofour case. The question of the formal signature and ratification of the conventions would not arise for several months; but we should consider forthwith the policy to be pursued if the Icelandic Govern-ment unilaterally proclaimed a twelve-mile zone for exclusive fishing rights.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that we had alreadyurged the Icelandic Government to avoid precipitate action on thisquestion pending further discussion. There was, however, a risk thatthe Canadian Government, who wished to establish a twelve-mile limit for exclusive fishing rights, would make a unilateral declaration to this effect and that the Icelandic Government would follow theirlead. It would be helpful, therefore, if the Prime Minister would send a personal message to the Canadian Prime Minister urging restraint inthis matter.In further discussion it was suggested that, in view of the diversityof the national interests involved, it might be unrealistic to hope to achieve any comprehensive agreement on the limit of territorial waters and exclusive fishing rights. It would be wiser, therefore, to attemptto deal with the problem of exclusive fishing rights by bilateral agreements or by multilateral agreements limited to a particulargeographical area, such as the North Atlantic. In this context thequestion of fishing rights off Iceland could be dealt with either by direct negotiations with the Icelandic Government or through widerdiscussions in the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation,where it might be possible, in the course of the current negotiations ona European Free Trade Area, to bring economic pressure to bear onthe Icelandic Government to adopt a more co-operative attitude. Themost suitable procedure for these further discussions should be studiedurgently. It would also be important to indicate to the UnitedKingdom fishing industry that the Government were proposing to take further steps to defend their interests in order to avoid any precipitate action on their part which might complicate an eventual settlement.The Cabinet (lj Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Minister of Agriculture, to submit to the PrimeMinister the draft pf a message to the Prime Minister ofCanada urging the Canadian Government to refrain fromdeclaring any unilateral extension of exclusive fishing rights pending further discussion of this problem.(2) Invited the Paymaster-General, in consultation with theForeign Secretary, the Minister of Agriculture and the attorney-General, to arrange for an urgent study to bemade of the most suitable procedure for further discussions on exclusive fishing rights, particularly, in the north atlantic area.(3) Agreed to resume their consideration of this matter when theresults of the study to be made under Conclusion (2) wereavailable.(4) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to consult the Attorney-General on the terms of the statement to be made on thefollowing day to the United Kingdom fishing industryabout the steps being taken by the Government to protect their interests.
british transport commission.(previous reference :CC (58) 34thConclusions,Minute 4.)Buses.CC. 35 (58)6. The Minister of Transport said that the Chairman of theLondon Transport Executive had informed him that, in his discussions with the trade union leaders on the previous day, he had made themaximum concessions which he felt were justified and that, since this offer had been rejected, there appeared to be no further initiativewhich he could take in order to avoid a strike of London busmen.The Minister of Labour said that he had received a letter from theGeneral Secretary of the Transport and General Workers&apos; Unionasking him to use his good offices to bring about a settlement of thedispute with the London Transport Executive. He proposed to basehis reply on the recent statement which he had made in Parliament onthis question, indicating that it would be inappropriate for him to intervene and that the primary responsibility now rested with theunion.The Cabinet (1) Took note of these statements.Railways. The Prime Minister said that it should be made clear to theBritish Transport Commission and the railway trade unions that theywould need to be able to hold out good hopes of achieving significanteconomies in the operation of the railways before the Governmentcould consider, as their contribution to the effort to increase productivity, any increase in the financial provision for capital investment under the railway modernisation plans. This point shouldbe impressed on the Commission and the unions without delay in orderto anticipate any suspicion that, for tactical reasons, the Governmentwere deliberately seeking to prolong the discussions on this subject.It would be desirable, for this purpose, to arrange that the transport commission^ proposals should be discussed with the Chairman of theCommission later in the week at a meeting under the Chairmanship ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Transport, to arrange for furtherdiscusssions with the Chairman of the British transport commission on the lines agreed in discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,29th April, 1958.
