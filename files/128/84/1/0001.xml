STRATEGY	(C(86) 5) on Economic Strategy.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the sharp fall in the price of oil had radically changed the budgetary prospect he now faced. Lower oil prices would mean lower inflation in most parts of the world, faster growth and more demand for manufactured goods. The British economy would share in these benefits, but at the same time Government revenue would fall substantially. Overall lower oil prices could be said to be good for the economy but bad for the Budget. With the exception of the continuing problem of very high unemployment, the recent performance of the British economy had generally been good; and per cent growth achieved the previous year in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) had been in line with previous forecasts, and although inflation had been a little higher than forecast, exports had risen strongly and the current account surplus had been larger than expected. The outlook for 1986 was for 3 per cent growth in GDP; if achieved, this would be the fifth successive year of growth averaging 3 per cent. Inflation was expected to be down to 4 per cent by the fourth quarter of 1986, the strong rise in exports was likely to continue, and there would again be a substantial current account surplus. Business investment was continuing to increase, and the company sector was making healthy profits. Manufacturing productivity was continuing to increase rather faster than in most other industrial countries, but the faster growth of earnings and unit labour costs remained a most serious problem. The fiscal prospect for 1986 was inevitably clouded by the uncertainty about oil prices; if the 40 per cent reduction below the previous autumn&apos;s levels were to be maintained, the Government&apos;s oil revenue would be reduced by about   5 billion. The buoyancy of the rest of the economy meant that non-oil revenues would continue on a satisfactory trend, partially offsetting the losses on oil account. It was remarkable that it should be possible, despite the loss of oil revenue, to avoid any increase in taxes; but there was no escaping the conclusion that the scope for tax reductions had been deferred. The British economy remained exposed to substantial risks; oil prices could fall further, and market pressures might cause adverse movements in the exchange rate and in interest rates. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries were seeking to put maximum pressure on the British Government by holding their next meeting exactly at the time of the Budget. Privatisation receipts in 1986-87 were now put at   4^/4 billion, over   2 billion higher than the previous year&apos;s estimate; given that such receipts effectively financed rather than reduced Government demands on the rest of the economy, some would argue that the underlying Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), on the basis of the 1985 projection in the Medium Term Financial Strategy (MTFS), should be regarded as more than   12 billion, rather than   7i billion. The position in the financial markets had been held


   by the prompt 1 per cent increase in interest rates that January, followed by determined resistance to any further upward movements, and with any strain taken on the exchange rate. The markets appeared now to have suspended judgment until the Budget. His judgment was that, particularly in view of the additional privatisation receipts as well as this substantial downside risk, it would be prudent to aim at a PSBR a little below the previous year&apos;s MTFS figure of Z7i billion if the confidence of the markets was to be retained. In all the circumstances the fact that it was possible to contemplate a Budget without an increase in taxes was impressive evidence of the strength of the economy; great concern had been expressed about the impact on the economy of the coming rundown in oil production over a long period, but in value terms half of the impact of that had already been felt. This could reduce substantially any remaining problems of adjustment.

In discussion, the following main points were made -

a.	Great importance was attached to the problem of continuing high unemployment. Any available resources should be devoted to measures to counter unemployment. There would be great advantage if the number unemployed could be reduced below 3 million, and at least unemployment should not go above its present level. The fact that the expansion of the Community Programme and the two-year Youth Training Scheme announced in the 1985 Budget were only now coming into effect gave some grounds for optimism, and should be recalled in the presentation of the Budget. One approach would be to look to a further expansion of the Community Programme, together with some kind of extension of Enterprise Allowances; but it was arguable that it would be better to devote available resources to the creation of new capital assets rather than to &apos;making work&apos;.

The difficulty was that experience showed that it would cost a very great deal of money to have any substantial impact on unemployment; the view of the House of Commons Employment Committee that the main problem of unemployment could be overcome at an annual cost of about   3i billion reflected that Committee&apos;s failure to realise that the people employed under the arrangements they recommended would in many cases displace existing employees.

b.	Much concern was expressed about trends in earnings and in unit labour costs. Despite the correct advice offered year after year by the Government and by the Confederation of British Industry private sector employers persistently refused, when they were making reasonable profits, to hold out against demands for inflationary wage increases. This produced a situation in which competitiveness could only be maintained by progressive depreciation of sterling, which in turn created market pressure for interest rates higher than they would otherwise need to be. High interest rates were a major source of difficulty both for small businesses and for the increasing number of people buying their houses on mortgages.

d.	The problem of incentives, and the unemployment trap, remained serious; although specific initiatives could help to reduce the


   numbers of people on the register, and to make the labour market work better, the underlying difficulty that many people could expect practically the same household income out of work as in work remained a serious obstacle to progress in reducing unemployment.

The removal of the wage-stop, although helpful from the standpoint of reducing the extent of family poverty, had made the problem of incentives worse. So far as the Budget was concerned, it was arguable that reductions in income tax rates, which would improve incentives throughout the economy and strengthen political support for public expenditure restraint, would be preferable to real increases in tax thresholds as a means of using any available &apos;fiscal adjustment&apos;.

d.	It was doubtful whether it would be prudent to seek to create room for direct tax reductions by real increases in indirect taxes, as had been done in 1979. There could be a case for some real increase in the duty on road fuel, which would counter-balance the impact on pump prices of the fall in world oil prices; but the overall prospect for inflation relied on reductions in oil product prices to counter-balance the impact on the general price level of the reduction in the value in sterling.

e.	Although the overall net effect of lower oil prices on the British economy could be presented as positive, this country would benefit relatively very much less than Japan and Germany which could look forward to zero inflation or even a fall in price levels, substantial increases in real incomes, and some reduction in unemployment. It would become harder for the Government to maintain the line that high unemployment was an international problem about which they, like other national Governments, could do little.

f.	Some commentators expected the British economy to do much worse than the Chancellor of the Exchequer had suggested; fears had been expressed of a current account deficit, a much higher PSBR, and an increase in inflation of li per cent. The prospect shown by the Chancellor of the Exchequer was much more reassuring, but most of the risks were on the downside.

g.	The future stability and growth of the economy depended on the maintenance of confidence that the Government could win the next General Election. If the overall effect of lower oil prices on the economy were broadly neutral     in terms of prospects for inflation and output - would it be possible to make the previously intended fiscal adjustment despite the deterioration in oil revenue? Additional expenditure on housing, construction and the urban programme could prove effective in recovering political support as well as in reducing the numbers unemployed. There was very heavy pressure for additional public expenditure in all these areas, as well as in education.

h.	Relatively modest increases in public expenditure could in some circumstances prove the key to much larger increases in


   private sector expenditure, with beneficial effects on employment. Possible examples were Urban Development Grant, improvement grants for private sector housing, and improvements to the transport infrastructure. Undue rigour in classifying some of these activities to the public sector should be avoided.

i.	Great skill would be needed if an essentially stand-still Budget were to be presented in an attractive way. Efforts would need to be made to find attractive low-cost &apos;sweeteners&apos; which would attract public support. One possible example might be a concession on gifts to charities.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet fully endorsed the maintenance of the sound and prudent policies pursued by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. They considered it a major achievement that he should be able to avoid any net increase in taxation in his forthcoming Budget, and endorsed his intention to aim at a PSBR a little below the previously projected   7^ billion for 1986-87. They recognised the difficulties the Government would face in holding public expenditure within the planning totals set out in the recent White Paper, particularly in the light of difficulties with local authorities, and agreed that it would be particularly important to look for possibilities of increasing freedom of manoeuvre by making savings in existing programmes. Insofar as the Chancellor of the Exchequer had any room for manoeuvre in his Budget, they considered that this should be devoted to measures which offered the prospect of some reduction in unemployment at very modest budgetary cost. They agreed that possible minor concessions should be sought which would make the Budget attractive and interesting, but without having any major effect on the underlying arithmetic. Similarly consideration should be given to modest public expenditure proposals where these could be shown to be the key to much larger expenditure by the private sector. The overall fiscal stance should be a cautious one, as recommended by the Chancellor of the Exchequer; it would always be possible to relax that stance later if circumstances permitted, while a Budget incorporating unjustified concessions could do damage which would be very hard to reverse. Meanwhile greater efforts should be made to secure wider understanding of the need to reduce the rate of increase in unit labour costs, which remained a major obstacle to the achievement of lower interest rates and lower unemployment.

The Cabinet -

1.	Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.

2.	Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take account of their discussion in preparing his forthcoming Budget.
