TO

CC(86) 41st Conclusions

LOCAL	THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that urgent legislation was

GOVERNMENT	required to rectify a flaw in the interpretation of local authorities&apos;

FINANCE	total expenditure under the Local Government, Planning and Land Act,

LEGISLATION 1980. Total expenditure formed the basis for the distribution of block grant to local authorities, and played a key role in the rate and precept limitation process, and all these mechanisms were at a standstill until the matter was resolved. Although the Government&apos;s interpretation of total expenditure had been adopted at the request of the local authority associations in 1980, the Attorney General had now advised that it was wrong in law. Operating on a strict interpretation of the statutory language was not a realistic option. There was, therefore, no alternative but to validate the Government&apos;s existing interpretation, both retrospectively and prospectively, by a Bill that would need to be enacted as quickly as possible. The preparation of this measure had proved to be more complex than had been expected and it was now clear that, if it did no more than validate the point at issue, the sequence of Orders and consultative periods on rate and precept limitation would extend through May, and even to June. He had therefore agreed with the Secretary of State for the Environment and other Ministers most closely concerned, including the Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip, that there was no realistic alternative but to enact rate limitation and precept limitation on the face of the Bill, by reference to classes of authorities, in order to avoid problems of hybridity. The Bill would need to be introduced in the following week, and taken to Royal Asgent by Easter. Its Parliamentary passage could be difficult, and the Government would doubtless be accused of muddle. But there was no alternative.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT agreed with the Lord President&apos;s statement of the problem. The interpretation of total expenditure that the Government had adopted was, in fact, less effective as a matter of financial discipline than would be a strict interpretation of the 1980 Act, but he agreed there was no alternative but to validate the interpretation that had been used in practice. The legislation would have to be introduced urgently, not only to secure Royal Asgent in time to bear on the next financial year, but because the point at issue would be exposed in a case brought against his Department by Greenwich Council, which was being heard the following Wednesday.

The essential point to stress throughout the presentation of this legislation would be that it did no more than validate the law as it had generally been supposed to be, and did not in any way represent a substantive new policy initiative.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that the need for the legislation described by the Lord President of the Council was manifest, and that it was essential that it should not itself contain any flaws. The Secretary of State for the Environment might wish to


   arrange for it to be seen in draft by leading Counsel. The necessity of the Bill, in order to validate the law as hitherto understood, should be emphasised at all stages of its Parliamentary passage. The Cabinet noted that the Secretary of State for the Environment did not intend to make a Statement about the Rate Support Grant (RSG) settlement for England for 1987-88 until January, after a reasonable consultation period on his latest proposals, though the Secretary of State for Wales had not put proposals out to consultation and was therefore under some pressure to make a Statement soon. The Secretary of State for Wales should consult the Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip about the timing and handling of a Statement on the RSG settlement for Wales: it was unlikely that this could be finalised until the Secretary of State for the Environment had made his Statement on the need for validating legislation, and the Parliamentary response to that had been assessed.

The Cabinet -

1.	Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of the discussion.

2.	Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment to make a Statement in the following week about the need for legislation to validate the existing practice on the existing practice on the interpretation of local authorities&apos; total expenditure, and to bring forward a Bill as described by the Lord President of the Council for introduction as soon as possible.

3.	Invited the Secretary of State for Wales to discuss with the Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip the timing of a Statement on the Rate Support Grant settlement for Wales

for 1987-88.
