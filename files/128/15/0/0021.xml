Political 1.   The Home Secretary said that on the previous dayProcessions     gir Oswald Mosley&apos;s Union Movement had held a meeting atin London.      Dalston from which members of the Union had marched in(Previous       procession to West Green, Tottenham, where a further meeting was reference:      to be held.  There were clashes with Communists at Dalston and in. (48) 3lst   the course of the procession, though opposition to the procession had conclusions,    been reduced to some extent by an alteration of the route of which minute 2.)      the Communists had not been aware.  As there were four meetingsalready in progress at West Green, Tottenham, the police told the organisers of the Union Movement that they could not hold a meetingthere.   Thereafter there were serious attacks upon the police byopponents of the Union Movement, who threw milk bottles and othermissiles.   392 police officers were required to maintain order at the meetings   and   during   the   march.     From   May   1948   untilFebruary 1949 public processions in the Metropolitan Police Districthad been banned by an Order made by the Commissioner of Police,with the consent of the Home Secretary, under section 3 (3) of thePublic Order Act, 1936.  An Order under the Act lasted for threemonths and the Order made in May 1948 had been twice renewed.The Commissioner of Police had not felt justified in making afresh Order in February last.There was general agreement that the experiences of theprevious day made it desirable to secure a renewal of the ban on public processions in the Metropolitan Police District. Processionsby Fascists or Communists were provocative in character and led to serious breaches of the peace, and the law did not admit of anydistinctions between those processions and other public processions.It was unreasonable that nearly 400 policemen should have to beemployed in protecting a procession of 150 members of the union movement. Disorders of the kind which had taken place on theprevious day created a bad impression abroad.It was also pointed out that, while the Fascist march had been deliberately provocative in character, serious attention must also bepaid to the general Communist policy of preventing those with whom they disagreed from being heard and of using physical force.Subsequently the Home Secretary reported that he had receiveda proposal from the Deputy Commissioner of Police of the metropolis, in the absence from London of the Commissionerffor anOrder which would prohibit public processions in the East End ofLondon. The device of prohibiting the holding of public processionsonly in a limited area in the East End had already been tried at thebeginning of May 1948 and had not proved to be successful. Inthose circumstances he proposed to inform the Deputy Commissionerthat he could only give his consent to an Order covering theMetropolitan Police District.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Home Secretary should take steps to secure. forthwith the making of an Order prohibiting publicprocessions in the Metropolitan Police District.Parliament. 2.   The Lord President drew attention to the fact that, owing-North Atlantic to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s absence in Washington for the signing- . of the North Atlantic Pact, it would not be practicable to hold,until after the Easter recess, a debate in which the Governmentwould seek the support of the House of Commons for ratification of the Pact.  This delay might give rise to criticism.In discussion it was pointed out that no useful purpose wouldbe served by holding a debate before the signature of the Pact since it might then be necessary to have a further debate in connectionwith the ratification. In any event, the Government had made itclear that, under the recognised constitutional practice, the signing36823-2 b 2Pact.(previous reference erence:CM. (49) 19thConclusions,Minute 1.)
of a Treaty was their responsibility. When the Foreign Secretarygave the details of the Pact to the House of Commons on Friday,18th March, there had been general support for the Pact and no sign of any desire for an early debate.The Cabinet-Took note that it would not be practicable. to debate theNorth Atlantic Pact in the House of Commons until afterthe Easter recess.Unauthorised 3.   The  Minister  of  Labour  explained  that  the  BritishStrikes in Electricity Authority were concerned about a recent sudden stoppageElectricity 0f -work at Barking Power Station which had not been justified byUndertakings, the ostensible grounds of dispute and which had been in breach ofthe men&apos;s contract of service. Stoppages had also been threatenedon subsequent occasions at other electricity power stations on equallytrivial and unjustified grounds. The Communists appeared to beresponsible for these occurrences. The Chairman of&quot; the british electricity Authority felt that, unless a firm stand was taken againstthreats of unconstitutional action, there would be a risk of continuingendeavours to coerce the British Electricity Authority and theGovernment by means of threats to electricity supply. Under the conspiracy and Protection of Property Act,&quot; 1875, as extended toelectricity undertakings by the Electricity Act, 1919, the british electricity Authority could take proceedings against workers whobroke their contract if they knew that, as a result of their action,the public would be deprived of their supply of electricity. Little,if any, use had been made of this power in the past, and it mightbe better to rely on the dismissal of persons guilty of lightningstrikes in breach of contract. The Chairman of the british electricity Authority had completed a review of the conciliation machinery within the industry and was taking all practicable stepsto bring the existence of this machinery to the notice of employees,so that little excuse would exist for resort to unconstitutional action.The Chairman wished, however, to be assured that, if unwarranted* strike action was taken, he would have the support of the Govern-ment in taking a firm stand notwithstanding that this might involvea dislocation of electricity supplies over wide areas.In discussion the following points were made : (a) The Conspiracy and, Protection of Property Act, 1875,required notices to be exhibited, warning workers of the nature ofits provisions; and it was necessary to show that workers who broketheir contracts knew that, as a result of their action, the public would be deprived of their supply of electricity. It was not clearthat notices were being exhibited and it might be difficult to beginnow the practice of exhibiting them. Moreover, because of theexistence of the grid it was always open to an accused person tosay that he had reason to believe that the needs of the public for electricity could be met, through the grid, from other generating stations.(6) Under section 6 of the Trade Disputes and Trade UnionsAct, 1927, which had subsequently been repealed, it was an offencefor any person employed by a local or other public authority tobreak his contract of service if that was likely to cause injury tothe community; arid there still appeared to be power under defence regulation 58a for the Minister of Labour to make an order prohibiting persons employed in essential undertakings fromabsenting themselves from work without reasonable excuse. legal provisions which created criminal offences were not, however, very effective in this field, since they might involve bringing considerable numbers of persons before police courts and endeavouring to secureconvictions.
(c) In some industries it had been the practice, in flagrant casesof breach of contract, to bring civil proceedings against strikersfor damages. It might be useful to examine whether the contractsmade with workers, in the many industries where employment was now on a regular and not a casual basis, were being so drafted asto make it practicable to take civil proceedings against strikersin bad cases of unauthorised strikes which imposed hardship onthe public.(d) In the last resort, the Government and public authorities would have to rely on public opinion to induce persons contemplatinglightning strikes which would damage the community to realisetheir responsibilities. If there were signs that Communists were likely to try to stage lightning strikes in electricity undertakingswith a view to paralysing the community, a survey would have tobe conducted of the extent to which Communists were employed inthe electricity supply industry and steps might have to be takento weed them out. In fact, the danger of lightning strikes whichthe British Electricity Authority had feared seemed to have passed,at least for the time &quot;being.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Ministers of Labour and Fuel and Powerto inform the British Electricity Authority that theGovernment would support them in resisting unauthor-ised strikes, threatening public supplies of electricity,which appeared to be fomented for political reasons or without adequate justification.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour to submit a memorandumon the extent to which contracts of service in essential industries required modification so as to make it clearthat workers were under an obligation to fulfil their contracts, which could be enforced if necessary by civil proceedings.Sale of H.M.S. 4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the First Lord&quot; Ajax &quot;to of the Admiralty (CP. (49) 65) on the question whether H.M.S. A jcuicChile. should be sold to the Chilean Government.The memorandum recalled that the Defence Committee, at their meeting on 21st July, 1948 (D.O. (48) 12th meeting, Minute 4), hadpostponed a decision on this question in the hope that the politicalsituation in the Antarctic would be clarified shortly. The negotia-tions for a permanent settlement were still proceeding, and the chilean Government had refrained from any provocative action inthe Antarctic in recent months. A decision on the disposal ofH.M.S. A jaw could not reasonably be longer delayed. By this sale,we should earn dollars; and refusal would prejudice our close and long standing relations with the Chilean Navy. On the other hand,the strategic importance of the Chilean Navy was negligible; andthere would certainly be criticism in Parliament of the Government^action in handing over so famous a British warship to a foreign power which was in illegal occupation of British territory in the falkland Islands Dependencies.The general view of Ministers was that the fact of Chileanoccupation of British territory in the Antarctic need not in itselfpreclude the sale of a warship to the Chilean Government. Moreover,it was understood that the sentimental opposition to the sale ofH.M.S. A jaoo to a foreign Power was not shared by the Royal Navy.The Cabinet were, however, informed that an alternative offer of another cruiser of similar type, H.M.S. Orion, could be made to the chilean Government, and Ministers felt that some political diflicul-ties could be avoided by adopting this course.

Sale of H.M.S. 4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the First Lord&quot; AJax &quot; to of the Admiralty (CP. (49) 65) on the question whether H.M.S. A jaooChile. should be sold to the Chilean Government.The memorandum recalled that the Defence Committee, at their meeting on 21st July, 1948 (D.O.

The Cabinet-Agreed that an offer of the sale of H.M.S. Orion in theplace of H.M.S. Ajax, should be made to the chilean government.ConstitutionalDevelopmentin SmallerColonialTerritories.(previous reference erence :CM. (48) 30thConclusions,Minute 9.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (CP. (49) 62) on the question of constitutional development in the smaller Colonial territories.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that recent discus-sions by the Commonwealth Affairs Committee had drawn attentionto the fact that there had hitherto been no comprehensive study ofthe constitutional problems of the smaller Colonies; in the pastdevelopments had taken place on ad hoc decisions without relationto an accepted body of principles or to an agreed policy regarding their ultimate structure and status. The Committee had reachedthe conclusion that a committee ought to be appointed to make an exhaustive study of the whole field and to submit recommendations on which future policy could be based. In CP. (49) 62, he had made detailed recommendations regarding the composition and termsof reference of this committee. It was essential that the enquiry,at least in its first stages, should be conducted in the strictestconfidence.There was general support for the proposal that a comprehensive-sive enquiry shoiild be carried out into the constitutional problemsof the smaller Colonies. In further discussion the following points were made : (a) Political unrest in the Colonies was often caused by economic and social discontents. If these could be dealt with first,there would be less immediate pressure for constitutional advance,and firmer foundations could be laid for liberal and efficient self-government. It was agreed that, while the scope of the committee&apos;senquiry ought not to be unduly enlarged, the terms of referencesuggested in CP. (49) 62 should be amended to ensure that theygave adequate attention to the economic and social background. ofpolitical and constitutional change in the Colonies. And, in thisconnection, it was suggested that at least one of the members of thecommittee ought to be selected with special reference to this aspect of the problem.(b) Some Ministers expressed anxiety lest a committee consti-tuted on the lines suggested in paragraph 5 of CP. (49) 62 mightbe unduly academic in outlook, with the result that adequate weightmight not be given to the defence and other factors unavoidablylimiting the pace and scope of constitutional progress in some ofthe smaller Colonies. Might it not be preferable to appoint an interdepartmental committee of officials to undertake this enquiryunder the general supervision of a special Ministerial Committee?Against this, it was pointed out that it was important that thecommittee would bring a fresh and constructive point of view tothe problems covered by their enquiry; this could best be ensuredby appointing both officials and non-officials to serve on the com-mittee. It was intended that some at least of the unofficial members should have administrative qualifications, including experience oflocal government. There was no reason to suppose that a committeethus constituted would fail to make a practical approach to its task.(c) The Foreign Office did not wish to be represented on thecommittee, but steps should be taken to ensure that it was kept intouch with the progress of the enquiry.(d) It was suggested that it might be useful if the committeeacquainted itself with the administrative and constitutional machinery of the Channel Islands.
The Cabinet (1) Subject to the point recorded in paragraph (a) above,approved the recommendations made in CP. (49) 62 forthe appointment of a committee to enquire into the con-stitutional problems of the smaller Colonies.(2) Invited Ministers to communicate to the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies any suggestions they might wish to makeregarding the composition of the proposed committee,and took note that the Secretary of State for theColonies would consult with the Prime Minister regard-ing the membership finally proposed. .6. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the terms inwhich he proposed to reply to suggestions made by the Prime Minis-ter of Northern Ireland that the United Kingdom Governmentshould lodge a protest with the Eire Government about their anti-partition campaign and should make a public declaration condemn-ing Eire&apos;s interference in the affairs of Northern Ireland. Thedraft followed the lines suggested in CP. (49) 48, which the cabinet had endorsed on 8th March.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the terms of the letter whichthe Prime Minister proposed to send to the Prime Ministerof Northern Ireland in reply to his letter of 18th February.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,21st March, 1949.Ireland.Partition.(previous reference:CM.
