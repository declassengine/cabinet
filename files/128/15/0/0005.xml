Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenBusiness in    in the House of Commons in the following week,the House of It was agreed that, in the debate on Palestine on 26th January,Commons.      the Foreign Secretary should speak first and the Prime minister should reply to the debate.On the Second Reading of the American Aid and european payments (Financial Provisions) Bill on 27th and 28th Januarythere would be a wide-ranging debate covering the long-term pro-grammes of the countries participating in the European recovery programme. It was agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Economic Secretary to the Treasury should speak on27th January, and that the President of the Board of Trade should reply to the debate on 28th January.Tribunals of inquiry(Evidence)Act, 1921.Inquiry intoAllegationsagainstMinisters and officials ofthe Board ofTrade, &amp;c.(previous reference erence:C.M.(48)67thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Horns Secretary said that he expected to receive on24th January the report of the Tribunal over which Mr. JusticeLynskey had presided. He would arrange for it to be presented toParliament as soon as possible thereafter. He would do his utmost to secure that copies were available in the Vote Office of the Houseof Commons by the afternoon of 25th or, failing that, 26th January.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to impress on the stationery Office the need for the utmost expedition in printingthis report.The Cabinet took note of these statements.Housing Bill.(previous reference:CM. (48) 82ndConclusions,Minute 5.)365273.   The Minister of Health reminded the Cabinet that theyhad agreed on 25th November last that grants for the improvementof tied cottages should be limited to those let on a tenancy agreement,but had invited the Ministers concerned to consider whether therewere any limited classes of case in which, because of potentialhardship to the occupier, it was necessary to make grants to cottagesoccupied as part of a contract of service.  At a subsequent meetingof a committee of the Labour Party Executive to discuss the problemof tied cottages with representatives of the agricultural unions, ofwhich he had given notice to the Cabinet on 22nd December, it had become clear that the agricultural trade unions would not be per-persuaded to refrain from opposing any proposal to make government grants for the improvement of tied cottages, whether occupied aspart of a contract of service or let on a tenancy agreement.   he believed that their attitude was logical and it was in accord withthe proposals which he had originally placed before the Cabinet.At the same time it was clear that Ministers generally believedthat cottages let on a tenancy agrement should, in the ordinary way,be eligible for grant, and it would be difficult to exclude theagricultural worker from this benefit while including others, suchas quarry workers.   In these circumstances he recommended thatthe Cabinet should adhere to their decision to give grants for theimprovement of tied cottages let on a tenancy agreement, and shouldjustify this by the argument that the prospect of grants in respectof free and restricted tenancies would be a valuable inducement to farmers to let on tenancy agreements cottages which had hitherto been occupied as part of a contract of service.   He and the agriculture Ministers agreed that it was not practicable to isolatelimited classes of case in which grants should^be made to cottagesoccupied as part of a contract of service.-1 b 2
The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that grants for the improvement of tied cottagesshould be limited to those let on a tenancy agreement andshould not extend to cottages occupied as part of a contract of service.(2) Invited the Minister of Health to include the necessaryprovisions to this effect in the draft of the Housing Bill,and to bring that Bill before the Legislation Committeefor final examination.Future ofItalianColonies.(previous reference:CM. (48) 12thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet considered a joint memorandum by the foreign secretary and the Secretary of State for War (CP. (49) 12)proposing that administrative responsibility for Cyrenaica andTripolitania should be transferred from the War Office to theForeign Office as soon as the necessary arrangements could be made,and that a working party should be set up to examine the adminis-trative implications of this transfer and of a possible prolongation of War Office responsibility for the administration of Eritrea andItalian Somaliland.The Foreign Secretary said that, so long as Cyrenaica wasunder military occupation, the occupying Power was bound by theprovisions of The Hague Convention, which, among other things,prevented any interference with civil affairs. The importance whichconsiderations of foreign policy assumed in connection with themaintenance of the British position in Cyrenaica indicated that theForeign Office was the Department most suitable to assume responsibility for its administration.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he agreed with the proposals in CP. (49) 12. Past experience of the kind of supervision which would be required in Cyrenaica, taken with the difficult political questions which would arise, indicated that dualityof responsibility between the Foreign Office and an administrativeDepartment would best be avoided by placing Cyrenaica (andtemporarily Tripolitania) wholly under the Foreign Office.In further discussion it was suggested that it was in principleundesirable that the Foreign Office should assume administrativeresponsibilities. It was not equipped for such work; and, moreover,its Ministers might find themselves embarrassed in discharging their primary responsibilities to Parliament in the field of foreignpolicy if they were answerable to Parliament on the day-to-day administration of overseas territories. On the other side, it waspointed out that these difficulties had not proved unmanageable inrespect of the Foreign Office responsibilities for the administrationof the Sudan or, more recently, of Germany. An important argu-ment against transferring to the Colonial Office the responsibilityfor the administration of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania was that the title &quot; Colonial Office &quot; gave rise to misunderstanding and prejudice,particularly in the United Nations, where the term colonial &quot; wasassociated with past examples of colonial exploitation by european countries. There were good grounds for considering whether the title should not now be changed. It would also be worth while to review the distribution of responsibility for the administration of overseas territories between the Colonial Office, commonwealth relations Office and Foreign Office. Such a review would, however,take some time and should not be allowed to delay the limitedtransfer of responsibility from the War Office to the Foreign Officeproposed in U.P.

5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (49) 13) covering a report on the economicsituation, together with a note on recent relaxations of economic controls.The following points were made in discussion: The most disturbing feature of the man-power situation wasthe steady increase in the numbers employed in the distributive trades. This tendency might be checked by further reductions indistributors&apos; margins, and Ministers concerned should keep thispoint in mind. There were now 178,000 foreign workers in employ -ment in the United Kingdom. There was little further scope forthe employment of foreign men, and it was becoming more difficultto recruit foreign women for employment here.The figures of involuntary absenteeism in the coal industry were still causing anxiety. In general, the industry was not short of equipment, and good progress was being made by the national coal Board in preparing plans for modernising existing pits and opening new ones.economic affairs.(previous reference:C.M.(48)79thConclusions,Minute 6.)Man-Power.Production.implications of this transfer of responsibility, and the followingpoints were made : (a) It was to be hoped that Italian Somaliland could be placed under Italian trusteeship, and that part of Eritrea might go toAbyssinia, although special arrangements might have to be madein respect of Asmara and Massawa. As, however, these arrange-ments might not be made for some time and the United kingdom would meanwhile remain responsible for these two territories, theworking party should not be required to assume that they would remain indefinitely under the War Office, but should be empoweredto consider whether a form of civil administration would be prefer-able. This would require some amendment of paragraph 1 of theterms of reference annexed to CP. (49) 12.(b) In paragraph 2 of the draft terms of reference the working party were instructed to assume that the section of the ForeignOffice administering Cyrenaica and Tripolitania would be a self-contained entity which did not make use of any existing elements of the Foreign Office organisation. What was intended was that thesection should be organised on the model of the Sudan Department,which reported direct to the Secretary of State and not throughany of the political branches of the Foreign Office. The terms ofreference were, however, open to the interpretation that the sectionshould not make use of any of the common services in the ForeignOffice. They should be amended to make it clear that this was not excluded.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposal in OP. (49) 12 that the administra-tive responsibility for Cyrenaica and Tripolitaniashould be transferred from the War Office to the ForeignOffice as soon as the necessary arrangements could bemade.(2) Agreed that a working party should be set up to work outthe administrative implications of this transfer, and toconsider what arrangements should be made for theadministration of Eritrea and Italian Somaliland if they remained in British hands. The terms of referenceannexed to OP. (49) 12 should be amended to meet thepoints noted in paragraphs (a) and (b) above.(3) Agreed that. the Government Organisation Committeeshould examine and report on the distribution ofresponsibility for the administration of overseas territories between the Colonial Office, commonwealth relations Office and Foreign Office, and on thedesirability of changing the name of the Colonial Office.
fi t&apos;Building.external trade.Balance ofPayments.&quot;Wage Bates.Belaxationsin economic controls.The Minister of Health drew attention to the fact that theState of the housing programme in the months preceding the GeneralElection in 1950 would depend upon decisions taken early in 1949.As a result of the administrative steps taken in 1947 to bring theprogramme into balance and the subsequent cuts imposed by theGovernment, there had been signs of a relaxation of effort on thepart of the local authorities, and he was concerned at the position that might arise unless some expansion of the programme could now be authorised. After the war, it had been assumed that 750,000additional houses would make it possible to provide a separate home for each family, but it was now clear that there was no soundstatistical basis for this estimate. He had asked local authorities for information on which a more reliable estimate could be based;and he believed that the total, when ascertained, would greatlyexceed 750,000. An early decision should be taken on theexpenditure which should be allocated to housing within the totalprovision available for social services in 1949; and he hoped that itmight be agreed that plans should be based on a rate of completionof 200,000 houses a year. The Chancellor of the Exchequer saidthat the Cabinet would shortly have an opportunity of consideringthe size of the housing programme in connection with the economic survey for 1949.In external trade our main aim must be to expand our exportsto the United States and Canada. As regards the former, remark-able progress had been made in the past year, but. conditions were now becoming more unfavourable to our exporters. If additionalsteel could be found, however, there were still prospects of securingincreased sales of motor cars in this market. In Canada, also,substantial progress had been made, though importers had been strongly opposed to the restrictions imposed on imports from theUnited States and had, in consequence, been reluctant to developalternative sources of supply. There was, however, scope for some improvement in our selling arrangements. A recent Mission had expressed the view that our engineering exports to Canada couldbe doubled within the next few years: they had, in particular,drawn attention to the importance of persuading &quot;provincial governments and public corporations to explore the possibilities of placing contracts in this country rather than in the United States.Although the figures for 1948 had been relatively satisfactory,there were certain aspects of the position which gave cause for anxiety. The dollar earnings of Colonial territories had fallen, andit seemed inevitable that heavy gold and dollar payments wouldhave to be made in 1949 to some non-dollar countries, particularlyBelgium, Switzerland and Persia. It was uncertain how far itwould be possible to recover these deficits under the european recovery Programme.There had been no significant change in December in theMinistry of Labour indices of wage rates. The number of dayslost as a result of industrial disputes in 1948 had been 1,944,000,which was 500,000 less than in 1947.The Appendix to CP. (49) 13 showed that satisfactory progress had been made in the relaxation of economic controls, but it was important that Ministers concerned should keep the position under continuous review. In announcing alterations of particularcontrols, care should be taken to avoid implying that they had been imposed or maintained unnecessarily : relaxations should be related to increased production or improved supplies. It was suggestedthat inadequate publicity had been given to the extent to whichcontrols had been relaxed, and that there might now be advantage in issuing a general statement on the matter. It was argued,however, that it would be premature to do this at present: furtherimportant changes were likely to be made within the next fewmonths, and a general survey could then be made public with much better effect.
6. The Prime Minister recalled that, as a protest againstrecent events in Indonesia, the Governments of India, Pakistan and ceylon had prohibited Dutch aircraft from flying over their territories. The Netherlands Government had thereupon askedwhether Mauritius could be used as an alternative stage by theregular K.L.M. services to Batavia. This request had been madeunder Article 5 of the Chicago Convention on International CivilAviation and Article 1 of the International Air Services TransitAgreement of 1944; and there appeared to be a clear legal obligationto provide the facilities asked lor. Contracting States admittedlyhad the right, under Article 9(B) of the Convention, to restrict orprohibit flying over their territories in exceptional circumstances;but, if any such ban were imposed, it would have to be appliedequally to French and South African aircraft using Mauritius,and probably also to our own aircraft. No decision had been takenby the United Nations to impose sanctions on the netherlands government, and in the circumstances he thought that the right course was to explain the legal position, to Commonwealth Govern-ments, and to inform the Netherlands Government that the necessary facilities would be provided, subject to an assurance that nomunitions of war would be carried.The Attorney-General said that it was his view that a contracting State could not discriminate in favour of its own aircraftunder Article 9(B) of the Chicago Convention. The purpose of theConvention was to establish conditions in the air comparable to thoseimplicit in the doctrine of the freedom of the seas. We had in thepast made great efforts to establish the principle that a State mightnot discriminate in favour of its shipping even in its own territorial waters, and he believed that it would be contrary to our long-term interests to seek to interpret Article 9(B) in a contrary sense. Inany event, it was not open to doubt that any ban imposed on Dutchaircraft in Mauritius would have to be extended to French andSouth African aircraft.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the regular K.L.M. services to Batavia shouldbe allowed to use Mauritius as a temporary staging point,provided that an assurance was given that no munitions of war would be carried in these aircraft.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to inform other Commonwealth Governments of the reply which was to be returned to the request of the Nether-lands Government and to explain to them the legal basisof the decision.7. The Prime Minister said that a journalist in the House ofCommons had overheard two members of the Cabinet discussingwhat had passed in the Cabinet&apos;s meeting on Palestine on17th January. The newspaper had reported this incident to him and, at his request, had made no use of the information thusobtained. The Government would, however, have been involved ingreat political embarrassment if any of this information had been published; and the incident illustrated the need for Ministers to observe the greatest caution in mentioning, in places where theymight be overheard, confidential discussions which had taken nlacebetween their colleagues.The Cabinet-Took note of CP. (49) 13 and of the points made in discussion.
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,20th January, 1949.The Prime Minister therefore repeated the request,&apos; which hehad made on earlier occasions, that all Ministers should exercise the greatest discretion in relation to the business discussed at meetings of the Cabinet and its Committees.
