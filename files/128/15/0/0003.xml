Palestine. Xhe Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreign Secretary(Previous       (CP. (49) 10) summarising recent developments in the PalestineBeference:        situation. ,CM. (48) 78th Discussion turned first on the circumstances in which five R. A.F.Conclusions,    aircraft had been shot down on 7th January by Jewish forces nearMinute 3.)      the Egyptian-Palestine frontier.The Foreign Secretary recalled that the Cabinet had agreed on12th November that additional reinforcements and ammunitionshould be despatched by air to the Royal Air Force at Amman andthat naval dispositions should be made in the Suez area to enableAqaba to be defended against attack.   On 3rd January the DefenceCommittee had further decided that a small British force should be moved to Aqaba.   On 29th December reports were received thatJewish. forces had crossed the Egyptian frontier.  As the Jewishauthorities had refused to allow United Nations observers to enterthis area, the Royal Air Force had been instructed to carry out recon-reconnaissances, if possible in concert with the Egyptian Air Force, toascertain whether these reports were correct.   This instructioninvolved no new policy, for it had be Gil t IlC normal practice of RoyalAir Force units stationed in Egypt to carry out, from time to time,reconnaissance flights in this area.   At the same time, the UnitedStates Government were informed of the reports which we hadreceived; and, in reply, the United States Assistant Secretaryof State expressed the hope that we might be able to obtain reliableconfirmation of the military situation.The Chief of the Air Staff said that by a reconnaissance flighton 30th December it was established that Jewish forces hadSenetrated  some  20  miles  into  Egyptian   territory.   Similarights  carried  out on the ensuing days  showed that therehad   been   further   Jewish   advances.   The   flight   of   30thDecember was carried out in co-operation with the Egyptian AirForce; but the latter did not take part in subsequent flights.   TheChief of the Air Staff then gave the Cabinet a detailed report on the events of 7th January when the five R.A.F. aircraft were shot down.The Commander-in-Chief had fully recognised the risks involved in continuing regular reconnaissance flights in the neighbourhood ofthe frontier; but he had understood that these must be accepted inview of the political importance of obtaining exact information ofthe Jewish dispositions.   Clear instructions had been given to the pilots that they must on no account cross the Egyptian-Palestinefrontier; and the wreckage of three of the lost aircraft had subse-quently been found well within Egyptian territory.In reply to questions the Chief of the Air Staff made thefollowing comments: (a) The action of the Egyptian Air Force in withdrawing fromco-operation in reconnaissance flights after 30th December mighthave been due to the anxiety of the Egyptian Government to avoid any implication that they were likely to invoke our assistance underthe Treaty of 1936 or, indeed, to admit to their own public thatJewish forces had entered Egyptian territory.(b) It had been reported in the press that the Royal Air Forceofficer captured by the Jews had admitted that the British aircraft were over Palestine territory when attacked. But some of the other points in the statement attributed to him were so demonstrably falsethat it would be unwise to rely on any part of that report. no conclusions about the position of the aircraft at the time of attackcould reasonably be drawn from the fact that the body of onepilot had been recovered in Palestine territory.(c) It had been suggested that it was in fact impracticable for aircraft to judge the exact position of an international frontierrunning through tie desert. This depended very largely on the physical character of the country. The Royal Air Force in theMiddle East had acquired a very exact knowledge of this area, andthere were no grounds for doubting the Commander-in-Chief&apos;s viewthat the aircraft concerned could clearly distinguish this particularpart of the frontier.
id) Some press reports had given the impression that on 7thJanuary the British aircraft had been flying in company withEgyptian aircraft. This misapprehension should be dispelled..(e) While the Egyptian Air Force used British fighter types,and markings were not always clearly distinguishable in the air,the markings should have been clear to Jewisn aircraft attackingfrom above.(/) Reliable information about the Jewish military operations on the frontier could not have been obtained by other means thanair reconnaissance.The Service Ministers and the Chiefs of Staff then withdrewfrom the meeting, and the Cabinet turned to discuss the political aspects of the situation.The Foreign Secretary said that in CP. (49) 10 he had put before the Cabinet a full historical statement on the developmentof his policy in resrect of Palestine and an appreciation of thepresent situation. He had little to add to his memorandum. Itwas inevitable that the United Kingdom Government should have played a leading part in the Palestine problem; for they had held the mandate ana they had binding treaty obligations with some ofthe Arab States. But the United States Government had also been closely concerned, both by reason of the influence exercised byZionists in the United States and also because our strategic positionin the Middle East was of great importance to the United States.The Foreign Secretary had therefore consistently sought to securethat the policy of the two Governments over Palestine should bekept in line; but he had been handicapped throughout by theinstability of United States policy in this matter. After recallingthe vacillations in United States policy during the past three years,he said that even now they seemed unable to follow a consistentline for any length of time. Thus, although President Trumanhad assured His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington on13th January that he supported the United Nations Resolution of27th November, which contemplated that Jerusalem should be placed under international control, a message had been received from washington on 14th January indicating that the State department were inclined to think that, if the Trans Jordan Government showedwillingness to consider the proposal for partitioning Jerusalem, weshould encourage rather than discourage them. In present circum-stances the only hope of securing a peaceful settlement was to seizeany opportunity that offered of getting Jews and Arabs into direct negotiations with one another. For some time past he had beenurging the Arab States to negotiate for a settlement, and therewere now at last some signs of their being willing to heed this advice. Conversations between the Jews and representatives ofTransjordan had been taking place intermittently in Jerusalem;and discussions between the Jews and the Egyptians had now been initiated in Rhodes. It was most important that nothing should bedone at this stage which might prejudice the continuance of those discussions.The Minister of Health recalled the earlier occasions on whichhe had expressed doubts about the expediency of the policy whichthe Government were pursuing in respect of Palestine. While he agreed that the maintenance of our position in the Middle East was of vital strategic importance, he had always been doubtful whether that position could be maintained through support of the unstableand reactionary Governments of the Arab States. He had alwayssuspected that the Government&apos;s political and military adviserswere seriously over-estimating the strength of those States; and hissuspicions had been amply confirmed by the Jewish militarysuccesses against the Arab armies. At the outset the Arabs hadbeen the better armed, but even so, they had proved no match forthe Jews. The course which events had taken confirmed his belief,36526-1 b 2
that we should have done better to base our position in the Middle-East on the friendship of the Jews, who, if we had pursued adifferent policy, would have been glad, to give us all the facilitieswe needed to establish strong military bases in Palestine. He alsofeared that the Government s attitude towards this question could:be shown to have been inconsistent with the spirit, if not with theletter, of the traditional policy of the Labour Party.As regards the reconnaissances of the recent fighting on theEgyptian frontier, he drew attention to the final sentence in para-graph 32 of the memorandum annexed to CP. (49) 10, in which itwas admitted that the decision to make these reconnaissances hadalready been taken before the United States Assistant Secretary ofState had indicated that he would be glad of any information whichwe might be able to obtain about the military situation on thefrontier. It was therefore clear that we had not made thesereconnaissances at the request of either the United Nations, theUnited States or Egypt. Why, then, had we taken the responsibilityof making them on our own initiative? Why had we exposed ourpilots to these risks ? On the earlier occasion our aircraft had been accompanied by Egyptian aircraft: was it not therefore likely that the Jews would be tempted to attack British aircraft whichthey had previously seen in company with their enemies? In con-nection with an earlier sentence in paragraph 32 of the memorandum the Minister also asked whether it was seriously suggested thatthere was any risk of Egypt&apos;s calling upon us for assistance underthe 1936 Treaty? After all the argument about the revision ofthat Treaty, would it be politically possible for any egyptian government to invoke our help under it?It was surprising that the recent developments in the Palestinesituation had not been discussed earlier by the Cabinet. Thedecision to send land forces to Aqaba had been taken by the DefenceCommittee without reference to the Cabinet. An embarrassingsituation was now developing in the Labour Party and in Parlia-ment and it might be difficult for the Government to secure undividedsupport for their present policy. In particular, it seemed difficultto justify withholding any longer our de facto recognition of the israeli Government, especially when many other countries hadalready recognised that Government.In the discussion which ensued other Ministers expressed theview that our strategic interests in the Middle East could not havebeen secured by supporting the Jews against the Arab States. Itwas not to be assumed that Israel would be a strong State or thatit would be specially favourable to this country. Most of the Jewishpopulation in Palestine came from Central or Eastern Europe, andthe activities of Jewish terrorists during the latter days of theBritish mandate should not be forgotten. The commonwealth connection with the Moslem world made it essential that this country should support fair play for the Palestine Arabs, who had been inpossession of Palestine for centuries.It was also argued that the policy followed by the government since 1945 was not inconsistent with the Labour Party&apos;s support for the creation of a Jewish National Home in Palestine. policy must take account of the change in circumstances since the war, andalso of the new demands of the Zionists for the recognition of aseparate Jewish State.The Government had consistently tried to secure the imple-mentation of the policy of the United Nations towards Palestine.The Security C6uncil&apos;s resolution of 15th July, 1948, had beeninstrumental in securing that no fighting took place between thenand October 1948, and the present policy of the Government was tosecure acceptance of the resolution of the Security Council passed in consequence of Jewish aggression against Egypt in Novem-ber 1948. Both before and after the surrender of the mandatethe Government had made every endeavour to bring the two sidestogether with a view fr&quot; a settlement being reached.   It had been
recognised that no lasting peace could be secured unless the arabs and tJhe nfltews negetrate&amp; a Sfetfcleineht. The Conference now being held at Rhodes, whieh nnght prove to be successful, was due toBritish perseverance in seeking a settlement between the parties.The Cabinet then considered at what stage the Government of israel might toe recognised. While normally a State was notrecognised until its boundaries were defined, there were precedents for a de facto recognition of a &quot;Government -as distinct from a State.Nor did recognition necessarily imply approval of the circumstances in which the new Government had come into existence, as wasillustrated by the conditions under which the United KingdomGovernment gave de facto recognition of the inclusion, of the baltic states in the Soviet Union. The wilftngness Of the egyptian government to enter into discussions with the Government of Israelat Rhodes was also significant, since by this the Egyptian Govern-ment were in effect recognising the Government of Israel. Ourrecognition of the Government of Israel would facilitate negotia-tions on a number of subjects which had at present to be conductedindirectly with the Jewish authorities in Tel Aviv, and mightfacilitate the reaching of a settlement at Rhodes by showing tosuch of the Arab States as were still unwilling to accept theexistence of a Jewish State in Palestine that they could not hope forfurther support from us in that view. Various other governments must, however, be consulted before our recognition of Israel couldbe announced. The repercussions in the Arab States, particularlyin Saudi Arabia, would have to be considered; and a promise hadbeen given that the French Government would be consulted before we took this step. Other Commonwealth Governments should alsobe consulted.The Cabinet agreed that the de facto recognition of the Govern-ment of Israel would allay a good deal of the anxiety which wasbeing expressed in political circles. If, however, this recognitionwas to be granted, it would be preferable that it should take place before there was any Parliamentary debate on. Palestine. otherwise the impression might be created that the Government had changedtheir policy in response to Parliamentary pressure.Reference was then made to the undesirability of retaining fora longer period the 9,000 able-bodied Jews at present detained in cyprus. Now that large numbers of Jews were reaching Palestinefrom Europe and elsewhere, there was no object in refusing to allowthese Jews to be transported to Palestine. The Jewish authoritiesin Tel Aviv should now be invited to remove them.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the policy hitherto pursued on behalf of theUnited Kingdom Government in respect of Palestine.(2) Agreed that it would be advantageous if a new impulsecould now be given to that policy by according de factorecognition to the Government of Israel; and invited the Foreign Secretary to consider whether such recogni-tion could now be accorded, how it should be timed andwhich other Governments should be consulted in advanceof any public announcement.(3). Invited the Lord Privy Seal to ask the Opposition leaders in the House of Lords to refrain from discussingPalestine in the Foreign Affairs debate in that house on 19th January, on the ground that any discussion ofthis subject at the present stage was likely to prejudice the prospects of a settlement being reached in direct negotiation between the Jews and the Arab States.(4) Asked the Foreign Secretary to suggest to the opposition leaders in the House of Commons that, for similar reasons, they should refrain from raising a debate on palestine during the next week or so.
(5) Agreed that any statement which might have to bethe destruction of R.A.F. aircraft on reconnaissanceover the Palestine-Egyptian frontier should be confined,so far as practicable, to the operational aspects of this incident.(6) Agreed that the Jewish authorities at Tel Aviv might now, be informed that they were free to arrange for the-removal to Palestine of the Jews detained in Cyprus.mademeanwhile regardingCabinet Office, S.W. 1,17th January, 1949.
