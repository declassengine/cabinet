Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.Censorship ofPlays (Bepeal)Bill.(previous reference:CM. (49) 22ndConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.In discussion the following points were raised : (a) The Eeport Stage of the Agricultural Marketing Bill wasto be taken on 4th April. Clause 1 (1) (&amp;) of the Bill provided thatmarketing boards should include a specified proportion of members appointed by the Minister as persons &quot; having had experience and shown capacity in commerce, finance, administration, public affairs or the organisation of workers.&quot; Government supporters were likelyto press for the inclusion in this provision of some reference to persons representing the consumers interests, and also for an assurance that representatives of the Co-operative movement wouldbe appointed to these boards. The Minister of A gricultnre said thatthe existing wording of this Clause of the Bill was wide enough toenable him to ensure that the interests of the consumer wereadequately represented on the boards. It was, however, the view ofthe Cabinet that it would be expedient for the Minister to make some concession to the views which were strongly held by government supporters on this point.The Cabinet-(1) Invited ter of Agriculture to arrange that on theReport Stage Clause 1 (1) (6) of the agricultural marketing Bill should be amended so as to provide thatthe persons appointed by the Minister to serve onmarketing boards might also include persons qualified for appointment as representing the interests of consumers;and asked the Minister to deal sympathetically in debatewith any suggestion that members of the Co-operative movement would be well qualified for appointment in that capacity.(6) On 5th April the House would be in Committee of Supplyand the Opposition were proposing to raise a debate on the meatsituation. It was pointed out that the anxieties about our futuremeat supplies which were likely to be expressed in such a debate would increase the difficulties which our representatives were already having in negotiating a new trade agreement with theArgentine Government. In these circumstances the Cabinet agreedthat the Opposition should be pressed to choose some other subject for debate on that day.The Prime Minister recalled that at their meeting on 24thMarch the Cabinet had invited the Home Secretary to advise theHouse of Commons to reject the Censorship of Plays (Repeal) Bill.In deference to the Home Secretary&apos;s personal views they hadrefrained from asking him to defend the existing system of censoringplays or to oppose in principle the plea for the abolition of allcensorship. They had, however, understood that he would beprepared to advise the House to reject this particular Bill on thebasis of the detailed defects in its structure. In the event the HomeSecretary had said in the Second Reading debate that the Govern-menfs attitude towards the Bill was neutral; and the SecondReading had been carried by 76 votes to 37.The Home Secretary said that he was sorry if, owing to a misunderstanding, he had failed to give effect to. the Cabinefs wishesin respect of this Bill.The Cabinet-(2) Invited the Home Secretary to take steps, in consultationwith the Chief Whip, to ensure that the Censorship ofPlays (Repeal) Bill should not be passed into law.36959-1 b 2
War Crimes.Trial ofGermanGenerals inBritishCustody.(previous reference erence:CM. (48) 61stConclusions,Minute 2.)2 The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (CP. (49) 73) explaining that Field-Marshal von Brauchitsch had died in the autumn of 1948, and thata medical board composed of Army doctors and of medical officersof the British prison service had reported that Field-Marshal vonRundstedt and Colonel-General Strauss were unfit to stand theirtrial, but that Field-Marshal von Manstein was fit to stand his trial.There was general agreement that Field-Marshal von Mansteinshould be brought to trial as speedily as possible.As regards the others, it was pointed out that by UnitedKingdom practice the decision whether a prisoner was fit to be triedon a criminal charge would be taken by the prosecution. It was,however, the view of the Cabinet that it would be undesirable for theGovernment to decide the question whether Field-Marshal vonRundstedt and Colonel-GeneralStrauss were fit to be tried. If they decided that these Generals were not fit to stand their trial, thesuggestion would be made, especially in view of the long delay in arranging the trials, that the Government were unwilling to see themtried, and it would be difficult to resist pressure from the Russianor Polish Government that the Generals should be handed over tothem for trial. If, therefore, it appeared, on examination of thelegal position, that the procedure of a war crimes court would allow the court to take a preliminary decision on the question whether ornot an accused person was fit to stand his trial, the decision shouldbe taken by the court. If the two Generals were themselves unwilling to plead that they were unfit to stand their trial, the medical evidencecould be placed before the court by the prosecution. There had beenconflicting medical reports in the past on the condition of the twoGenerals and some of the details of the present reports were not veryconvincing, although the findings of the doctors had been unanimous.All this pointed to the desirability of placing the issue before thecourt.If it was decided that von Rundstedt was unfit to stand histrial and he subsequently became an important witness for thedefence in von Manstein&apos;s trial, an embarrassing position might result. Not only would it be argued that a witness who could give evidence and stand cross7examination should have been put on trial;but von Rundstedt, in the knowledge that he was not himself to be prosecuted, might be ready to take full responsibility for the crimeswith which von Manstein was charged. It might, therefore, havebeen preferable if von Manstein could have been tried before theissue was considered whether von Rundstedt and Strauss were fitto stand their trials. It was, however, desirable to settle at an earlydate whether von Rundstedt and Strauss were to be tried since, ifthe trials were to proceed, a mass of evidence must be got together and Counsel briefed. If the court had decided that von Rundstedtwas unfit to stand his trial, the considerations which had influencedthem in coming to that decision should also influence them in the weight which they attached to any evidence which von Rundstedtmight give in von Manstein&apos;s trial.If von Rundstedt and Strauss were not tried, the question oftheir disposal would arise. The Foreign Office were advised that under Article 4 of Law 10 made by the Control Council the british commander-in-Chief had full discretion to decide whether to delivera prisoner to an Allied Power, and that there could be no appeal,since the appeal tribunal (the Allied Control Authority) no longerexisted. If the war crimes court decided that the two Generalswere unfit to stand their trial, the Government could reasonably saythat this showed they were unfit to be tried in any other country.There would then be no alternative but to set them at liberty.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Secretary of State for War should ascertain whether it would be practicable for the war crimes court
to consideras a preluininary issue whether Field-Marshalvon Rundstedt and Colonel-General Strauss were fit to stand, their trial and,, if the answer was in the affirmative,should take; the necessary steps to have that issue put to. the court at an early date.Agreed that, if the war crimes court decided that vonRundstedt and Strauss were unfit to stand their trial,they should not   he handed over to any other country for trial but should be set at liberty.(3) Agreed that the trial of Field-Marshal von Manstein shouldbe proceeded with as speedily as possible.-Geneva Con- 3.   The  Prime  Minister  informed  the  Cabinet  that,  inventions on accordance with their decision of 17th March, 1949, he had discussedWar Victims, with the Ministers primarily concerned the proposals in the joint(Previous memorandum by the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of StateReference: for War (CP. (49) 59) relating to the revision of the GenevaCM. (49) 20th Conventions on war victims. Full agreement had been reached on conclusions, tne various points of policy which arose; and the United KingdomMinute 6.)&apos;     Delegation now appeared to be in possession of adequate instructions on the line which they should take at the International conference which was to open at Geneva on 21st April.The Cabinet-Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.Sale ofH.M.S.&quot; Ajax &quot;to Chile.(previous reference:C.M.(49)21st-Conclusions,-Minute 4.)4. The Cabinet had agreed on 21st March that, in view of the objection to the sale of H.M.S. Ajax to the Chilean- Government,the Admiralty should offer to sell to that Government H.M.S. Orion,a cruiser of similar type to A jax. The Cabinet now had beforethem a memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty(CP. (49) 74) explaining that, when the Cabinet were informed that.M.S. Orion was available, it had not been appreciated that the vessel had already suffered serious damage in ship target trials. Inthe First Lord&apos;s view there was no alternative offer which could bemade to the Chilean Government in place of H.M.S. Ajax.The Parliamentary Secretary, A dmiralty, said that he was sorrythat he had misled the Cabinet when they had previously discussed this matter. As Chile was still in illegal possession of British terri-tory in the Antarctic and as a large number of people in this country had a sentimental regard for H.M.S. Ajax and would be opposed tothe idea of selling the ship, he thought the better course would beto decide not to offer to sell A jax to Chile.In discussion, the following points were made : (a) The Foreign Office did not wish to raise any objection to thesale of A jax to Chile, nor did they wish to press for it. Chile hadin the past acted in a provocative way in the Antarctic, but herrecent conduct had been more satisfactory. The Chileans were ingeneral friendly to the Commonwealth and had proved helpful on various recent occasions in the United Nations Assembly. Therewas little prospect that the position in the Antarctic would be improved by delay, since the discussions for a trusteeship arrange-ment were not making very satisfactory progress.(6) The price asked for Ajax was  200,000 as she stood andthe expenditure on refit, which would probably be done in thiscountry, was likely to be substantially more. The scrap value wasabout  40,000. There were no strong reasons on balance of paymentsgrounds for pressing for the sale, since Chile was in process of becoming a soft-currency country.
144-(c) There was undoubtedly a strong body of opinion in the-country, interested in Service matters and in Service recruitment,which would be deeply offended on sentimental grounds by the saleof A jax to Chile.   The Chileans wanted this ship because of herwar-time record.The Cabinet-Agreed that H.M.S. A jax should not be offered for sale to-Chile, but that the Chilean Government should be offered,any other available vessel in substitution.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,Slst March, 1949.
