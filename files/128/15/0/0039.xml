industrial disputes.Dockers&apos;Strike.(previous reference erence:C.M.(49)38thConclusions,Minute 2.)EailwayStrike.Publicity.1. The Home Secretary said that the unofficial strike at theAvonmouth docks had continued, and the Transport and general works&apos; Union had not provided volunteer labour to unload the cargo of bananas from the Bayano. Troops had therefore beenemployed to unload this cargo. Dockers at Liverpool had declined to unload the Canadian ships which had been diverted there fromAvonmouth. Apart from this, however, the strike had not spread to other ports.Increasing traffic dislocation was being caused by the action ofthe engine-drivers and firemen in the Eastern and North-EasternRegions of British Railways, who were absenting themselves fromweek-end work in protest against duties on long-distance trainsinvolving their staying away from their homes. There were signs that this unofficial strike might spread and that it might seriously affect holiday travel at Whitsuntide. The Cabinet were informedthat the Railway Executive were that day meeting representativesof the two unions concerned to discuss means of ending the strike.It was suggested in discussion that these two unofficial strikesillustrated the need for some better arrangements for ensuring thatthe facts at issue in such disputes were more effectively hrought homeboth to the strikers and to the public generally. The Minister ofLabour said it would be inappropriate for his Department to play an active part in organising publicity about industrial disputes,since this might prove inconsistent with its primary function of conciliation. His Department could make available the information in its possession; but, if any initiative in influencing public opinion was to be taken on behalf of the Government, he considered thatthe responsibility should rest with the Department concerned withthe industry or service affected. In the current dockers&apos; strike, themain source of the trouble probably was that the dockers hadinsufficient confidence in their union. In the railway strike there might have been some failure on the part of the Railway executive to put the facts sufficiently clearly to the strikers and to the public.The Prime Minister undertook to discuss with the Minister ofTransport means of ensuring that the issues at stake in the currentrailway strike were fully presented to the public.Cyrenaica.(previous reference:C.M.(49)36thConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Minister of State said that, when the United nations assembly had decided to postpone consideration of the future of theformer Italian Colonies, the Amir of the Senussi had indicated thatat the meeting of his National Congress at the end of May he would feel obliged to proclaim the independence of Cyrenaica, to announce the formation of a national Government and to express his country&apos;swish to make a treaty with His Majesty&apos;s Government. He felt bound to take this line in order to forestall similar demands fromhis own people,&quot; who were impatient at the delays in settling thefuture of their country and were critical of his apparent inability to bring about a settlement. The position had been discussed withthe Amir, and the Foreign Secretary had also taken the opportunityof consulting in Paris with representatives of the United Statesand French Governments. As a result, it was proposed that duringthe course of the meeting of the Cyrenaican National Congress astatement should be made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe following terms : &quot; In accordance with the proposal for the independence of libya which was made on 3rd May at the recent meeting of the37129-1 b 2
General Assembly of the United Nations, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentstate (a) that they formally recognise the desire of Cyrenaicans for self-government and will take all steps compatible withtheir international obligations to promote it;(6) that they will, in consultation with the Amir, set up aCyrenaican Government with responsibility over internal affairs and that they would welcome the visit of the Amirto London for discussions on this matter;(c) that they recognise the Amir, who is the freely chosen leader of his people, as the head of the Cyrenaican Govern-ment; and(d) that in taking these steps they wish to emphasise that nothing will be done to prejudice the eventual unity of libya.&apos;&quot;&apos;Unfortunately, however, the terms of this proposed declarationhad become known to the Italian Foreign Minister, who was greatlydisturbed that he had not been consulted and said that, if theproposed declaration were made, he would have no alternative butto resign his office.In discussion several Ministers expressed their sympathy withthe reaction of the Italian Foreign Minister towards the proposed declaration. It was natural that he should expect to have been consulted, as he had joined with the Foreign Secretary in submitting to the United Nations the latest proposals for a solution of theproblem of the former Italian Colonies. Moreover, the terms of theproposed declaration linked it with the earlier discussions on thefuture of Libya as a whole; and, that being so, its recognition of thedesire for self-government in Cyrenaica could not be welcome to public opinion in Italy.As against this, it was pointed out that we had not given any undertaking to consult the Italians about the future of Cyrenaica:our obligation to consult with them was limited to the other terri-tories in Libya and, even there, we should be careful to avoid getting into a position in which we were not free to support any solution which did not command their consent. For neither they nor theFrench were anxious that any of these territories should attain inde-pendence. We, for our part, were interested to. retain the friendshipof the Arab peoples, both in Cyrenaica and elsewhere; and it was important that our policy in respect of Cyrenaica should commandtheir support.It was, however, the general view of the Cabinet that it wouldbe expedient to give the Italian Foreign Minister a formal oppor-tunity for comment on the proposed declaration and to make suchreasonable adjustments in its wording as might make it more acceptable to public opinion in Italy. Thus, it would be expedient to omit the preamble linking this declaration with the proposalsrecently submitted to the United Nations Assembly. If anypreamble were required, it might be to the effect that &quot;while itwould be inappropriate, in view of the recent discussions in theUnited Nations Assembly, for His Majesty&apos;s Government to makeany statement on the future of Libya generally, they desire, so faras concerns Cyrenaica, to make the following declaration.&quot; Again,the statement in paragraph (c) of the draft might with advantage be made at the outset of the declaration. Finally, the Amir of theSenussi might be willing to accept some modification of para-graph (d) of the draft, e.g., the substitution of &quot;the future of Libyaas a whole &quot; for &quot; the eventual unity of Libya.&quot;- The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of State to arrange for the italian foreign Minister to be given a formal opportunity forcomment on the proposed declaration in respect of
Cyrenaica; and agreed that, in order to meet the criticisms which he was likely to offer, the terms of thedeclaration might be adjusted on the lines indicated intheir discussion.(2) Agreed that, subject to the results of this consultation withthe Italian Foreign Minister, a declaration on the lines indicated above might be made on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government at the meeting of the CyrenaicanNational Congress on 1st June.Polioy. 3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (49) 124) on the relaxation of import licensing restrictions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, when the Intra-European Payments Scheme came under review at the forthcoming meeting of the Organisation for European Economic &quot;Co-operation,the participating Governments would be strongly pressed to acceptthe United States suggestion that drawing rights under the scheme should be made transferable or convertible. This proposal was unacceptable to us since it would involve us in increased liabilitiesfor gold or dollar payments, but we should be in a stronger position for resisting pressure on this question if we could at the same timeput forward some alternative proposals for freeing European tradein accordance with the general objectives of the European recovery programme. The possibility of relaxing import controls had recently been examined by an official working party, and their reportindicated that we might now safely take the initiative in proposing a general relaxation of import controls in Western Europe. It was,however, essential that any concessions granted to Western european countries should be extended, without undue delay, to the sterling commonwealth countries, and this proposal must therefore be dependant on the willingness of the United States Government to relieve us from the obligations of Article 9 of the Anglo-AmericanLoan Agreement. We should also make it clear that the Intra-European Payments Schemes must be so revised as to exclude any liability for the payment of gold or dollars. In putting forwardthese proposals, we should state that the continuance of these arrangements would depend upon the reciprocal action taken by theother countries concerned; and specific controls would be adjustedor reimposed if circumstances warranted this. There would be afurther opportunity to consider the actual adjustment which it was proposed to make in the existing system of controls.In discussion, it was pointed out that, while it had repeatedlybeen emphasised that quantitative controls on imports could not bemaintained for protective purposes, the announcement of theseproposals would cause some anxiety among the leaders of both sides of industry: the engineering industry, in particular, would be greatly concerned at the possibility of a large-scale resumption ofimports from Germany. The reasons for these proposals should,therefore, be fully explained in the announcement; and, once itwas known that they would be accepted by the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation, Ministers should have preliminary discussions with representatives of the industries most likely to beaffected by foreign competition.Some anxiety was expressed lest the proposed relaxation of import controls might result in local unemployment; and thequestion was raised whether, in case of need, it would be possible toimpose a protective tariff without excessive delay. The cabinet were informed that this question was being examined by the Boardof Trade.The Cabinet-Approved the recommendations made in CP. (49) 124.
Economic 4.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofAffaire. the Exchequer (CP. (49) 121) covering a report on the economic(Previous situation. ,  .Reference: Tne following points were made in discussion : CM. (49) 23rd While there had been a further reduction in total unemploy-Conclusions, nient, the figures of unemployed in the development areas had minute 2.) remained stable for some time, in spite of the establishment of aMan-Power. considerable number of new factories. It seemed likely that these new industries were proving particularly sensitive to the develop-ment of a buyer&apos;s market. In South Wales there was also a special problem of unemployment due to pneumoconiosis. Large numbersof men had been certified unfit on that account for further employ-ment in coalmining; and, although they were capable of undertakingother work, private industry could not find employment for them.It was suggested in discussion that in some development areas thetime might now be approaching when the Government would be compelled themselves to operate factories in order to maintain asatisfactory level of employment. The Minister of Supply saidthat, as the Royal Ordnance factories were not now working to full capacity, there was little prospect of introducing munitions production into these development areas. He understood that it was doubtful whether he had powers to undertake the production ofgoods for the civilian market.It was agreed that the Production Committee should at an earlydate examine the problem of maintaining employment in the develop-ment areas, and should, in particular, consider whether the Govern-ment should operate factories in some of those areas and, if so,whether any fresh powers would be required for that purpose. -Production. It was estimated that the increase in productivity during thepast year had been about 5 per cent. Exact comparisons with pre-war figures were not possible, but it was generally assumed that theproduction figures for 1946 were roughly equivalent to those of 1938.Building. The Minister of Health said that applicants for local authorityhouses were classified in two categories, those who were living withother people and wanted a house of their own, and those who had their own house but wanted a better one. In rural areas, all agri-cultural workers in the first category should have obtained new houses by the middle of 1950. He was doubtful whether it wouldbe right that agricultural workers in the second category should be accorded priority over the remaining applicants in the first category.He proposed to circulate a paper on this subject for considerationby his colleagues.Prices. The question was raised whether the Government ought toaccept financial loss in order to provide manufacturers with non-ferrous metals at the same prices as those paid by United Statesmanufacturers. The Minister of Supply said that the present policy was to even out the fluctuations oi price, even if this involvedacceptance of some losses. He was very doubtful,,however, whether there would be advantage in bringing prices down at once to theUnited States levels; and some manufacturers had expressed thehope that this would not be done. There was no ground for thinking that the higher prices paid by United Kingdom manufacturers were having an adverse effect on the export of their products. He would,however, discuss this question with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Bilateral The Cabinet were informed of the latest developments in theNegotiations,    trade negotiations with the Argentine Government.Agreement had been reached with the Israeli Government ona short-term financial agreement in the terms approved by theEconomic Policy Committee on 24th May (E.P.C. (49) 18th Meeting,Minute 3).
Resale price maintenance.(previous reference:C.M.(48)24thConclusions,Minute 8.)The Cabinet-(1) Took note of CP. (49) 121 and of the points made in discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theProduction Committee to undertake a comprehensive review of the problem-of maintaining employment in thedevelopment areas.5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP. (49) 116) covering a memorandum by the Parlia-mentary Secretary, Board of Trade, on the action to be taken on thereport of the Departmental Committee on Resale Price Maintenance.The Committee had recommended that nothing need be done toprevent an individual producer from fixing resale prices for hisbranded goods, but they had condemned collective action by trade associations to enforce resale price maintenance on behalf of membersof the association.The Parliamentary Secretary, Board of Trade, said that it was proposed that a statement should be made in the House of commons before the Recess expressing the Governments general agreementwith the Committee&apos;s conclusions. While it was desirable that a start should be made towards removing some of the objectionablefeatures of retail price maintenance, it was important that nothing should be said which might prejudge the findings of the monopolies and Restrictive Practices Commission on the specific cases involving&quot;price maintenance which had already been referred to it. It was proposed slightly to recast the draft statement set out inAppendix &quot; D &quot; to CP. (49) 116, but the alterations to be made would not affect its main purpose.In discussion, reference was made to the following points :-(a) Nothing should be said to imply that legislation would notbe required in this field.(&amp;) Care should be taken not to express unqualified acceptanceof price maintenance by an individual producer.(c) The statement should refer to consultation with &quot; the other ministers concerned&apos;&apos;; for the Ministers of Supply and Fuel and power, as well as the Minister of Food, were interested in thismatter.The Cabinet-(1) Accepted the general conclusions of the DepartmentalCommittee on Resale Price Maintenance.(2) Authorised the Ministers concerned to initiate discussions with trade associations to ensure that in futureindividual resale price maintenance should be operatedreasonably and flexibly.(3) Agreed that a statement should be made in the House ofCommons in the terms set out in Appendix &quot; D &quot; to cp. (49) 116, subject to amendment, to meet the points.&apos;. raised in discussion;  and invited the parliamentary secretary, Board of Trade, to settle the final form of thestatement in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer.Ireland Bill.(previous reference erence:C.M.(49)34thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordChancellor, the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations (CP. (49) 127) proposing that a Govern-ment amendment should be moved to the Ireland Bill to make itclear that a person born in Southern Ireland before 6th December,1922, but domiciled in Northern Ireland on that date, was just asmuch a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies as a similarperson domiciled at that date in England or Scotland.
The Lord Chancellor explained that, under Section 12 (4) of theBritish Nationality Act, 1948, certain persons who were Britishsubjects immediately before the date of commencement of that Actbecame citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies unless theywere &quot; citizens of Eire.&quot; By Section 2 of the Act, a citizen of Eirewho immediately before the commencement of the Act was also aBritish subject conuld continue to enjoy the status of a british subject if he made application to the Home Secretary and fulfilledcertain conditions. During the Committee Stage of the Ireland Billin the House of Lords on 26th May, Lord Simon had drawn attentionto the fact that the British Nationality Act, 1948, might operate to exclude persons domiciled in Northern Ireland from british nationality unless they made application to the Home Secretary anddescribed themselves as citizens of Eire, which they might well be unwilling to do. Enquiry had shown that, under the provisions ofthe Constitution of the Irish Free State, &apos;&apos; a citizen of Eire &apos;&apos; hadto have been born in Ireland and to have been domiciled in the areaof jurisdiction of the Irish Free State. The Constitution had comeinto force on 6th December, 1922; and, since Northern Ireland didnot exercise its option to be excluded from the Irish Free State until7th December, 1922, it was arguable that for one day (namely,6th December, 1922) after the Constitution came into force, the wholeof Ireland was within the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State. Theposition was, therefore, that a person born in Ireland and domiciledin Northern Ireland on 6th December, 1922, might be held, for thepurpose of the British Nationality Act, 1948, to be a citizen of Eirewho could not retain his British nationality unless he made anapplication to the Home Secretary in which he would have to describehimself as a citizen of Eire.There was general agreement that the Government should movean amendment to the Ireland Bill in the sense proposed by the LordChancellor. It seemed possible that the Government of the irish republic would endeavour to argue that such an amendment was a breach of the understanding reached with them before the intro-duction of the British Nationality Act, 1948, and it would benecessary, in supporting the amendment, to make it clear that theGovernment could not accept the contention that, in the negotiationsbefore the introduction of that Act, they had acquiesced in the viewthat British subjects in Northern Ireland were properly regarded ascitizens of Eire. Since it was desired to pass the Ireland Bill into law before the Whitsun Recess, time would not permit of consulta-tion with the Dublin Government, but the High Commissioner inLondon should be informed of the terms of the amendment before it was moved in the House of Lords that afternoon.It was suggested that, if the framework of the british nationality Act, 1948, allowed, it would be desirable that the wording of the new Clause should make it clear that its purpose was not to lessen the range of persons who might properly beregarded as citizens of Eire, but merely to ensure that persons whowere British subjects were not unreasonably deprived of that status.The Cabinet Approved the proposed amendment of the Ireland Bill setout in CP. (49) 127, subject to any drafting amendmentthat might be made to meet the point raised in discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,30th May, 1949.
