The Prime Minister made a report to the Cabinet on thecourse of the discussions at the Meeting of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters which had been considering India&apos;s future relations withthe Commonwealth. The discussions had shown that there was ageneral desire to find an acceptable basis for India&apos;s continuingassociation with the Commonwealth; but it had not been easy tosecure common agreement on the constitutional issues involved. Therepresentatives of all the Commonwealth Governments had in theend agreed to adopt the following declaration : &quot;The Governments of the United Kingdom, Canada,Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan and ceylon, whose countries are united as Members of the British. Commonwealth of Nations and owe a common allegiance to theCrown, which is also the symbol of their free association, have considered the impending constitutional changes in India.&quot; The Government of India have informed the otherGovernments of the Commonwealth of the intention of theIndian people that, under the new Constitution which is about to- be adopted, India shall become a sovereign independent republic.The Government of India have, however, declared and affirmed. India&apos;s desire to continue her full membership of the Common-wealth of Nations and her acceptance of The King as the symbol- Of the free association of its independent member nations andas such the Head: of the Commonwealth.&quot; The Governments of the other countries of the Common-wealth, the basis of whose membership of the Commonwealth isnot hereby changed, accept and recognise India&apos;s continuing&apos; ! membership in accordance with the terms of this declaration,-i.   :     &quot;Accordingly the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia,New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan and Ceylon hereby&apos;&apos; declare that they remain united as free arid equal members ofthe Commonwealth of Nations, freely co-operating in the pursuit;     of peace, liberty and progress.&quot;The Prime Minister of South Africa had found difficulty in accepting the description of The King as &quot;Head of the Common-wealth,&quot; since , he feared that this might be misinterpreted as implying the existence of some sort of super-State. He had, however,subscribed to the declaration on condition that it was placed on record, in the minutes of the Meeting, that the designation of TheKing as &quot; Head of the Commonwealth &quot; did not connote any change. in the constitutional relations existing between the members of theCommonwealth and, in particular, did not imply that The Kingdischarged any constitutional function by virtue of that Headship.The Prime Minister of Pakistan had at first hesitated to subscribe to that part of the declaration which affirmed that thebasis of membership of countries other than India was not changedby this declaration. He had made it a condition of his agreement that it should be placed on record, in the minutes of the Meeting,that if another member of the Commonwealth wished to continue hermembership under conditions identical with those which had beenaccepted in respect of India, it could be logically assumed (thoughit was not possible to bind future Meetings or Governments) thata future Meeting would accord the same treatment to any other member as had been accorded to India by the present Meeting. Ithad at one time been feared that, if India were allowed to remain within the Commonwealth as a republic, Pakistan would also adopta republican form of constitution. It now seemed possible that itwould be sufficient for the Pakistan Government to be able to saythat it was open to Pakistan, if she wished, to become a republic and remain within the Commonwealth. If they could say that, itmight not be necessary for them to take any steps towards adopting a republican form of government. n36962-3-a  &apos;0
In addition to the public declaration which was to be made, the-Meeting had also agreed to place it on record that (i) all Common-wealth countries would continue to regard themselves as not foreign,in relation to one another; and (ii) each Commonwealth Governmentwould take any necessary steps, whether by legislation or otherwise,to enable it to maintain the right to accord preferential treatment to-the citizens and trade of other Commonwealth countries, thougheach Government would remain free to determine the extent of thatpreferential treatment and the precise method of according it.In discussion the following points were raised : (a) It was unfortunate that the declaration made no referenceto the important question whether India would stand at the sideof other Commonwealth countries in peace and in war. the concluding words of the declaration might even be thought to throwsome doubt on the question of India&apos;s co-operation in time of war.In reply it was pointed out that these words were taken fromthe report of the Balfour Committee which formed part of the reportof the proceedings of the Imperial Conference of 1926. There was.no reason to doubt the sincerity of India&apos;s desire to co-operate with,other Commonwealth countries. It would not have been possible,however, to ask her to enter into formal commitments for mutualco-operation in defence of a kind which none of the older Common-wealth countries had ever been willing to accept.(b) India would, however, continue to be included within the-scheme for Commonwealth co-operation in defence, as described inPart V of the White Paper on the Central Organisation for Defence-(Cmd. 6923 of 1946).    This contemplated regional or bilateralarrangements between Commonwealth Governments on defence questions.  It would be necessary that bilateral negotiations shouldtake place between the United Kingdom Government and the-Government of India.  The agreement now reached on the constitu-tional issue would, however, create a favourable atmosphere for the-conduct of those negotiations.(c) In view of India&apos;s recognition of The King as Head of the-Commonwealth, would The King have any functions in relation to-India? In reply, it was stated that The King would not be Headof the Indian Republic. India would, however, recognise The Kingas the symbol of the Commonwealth association, to which she-adhered. For the present, the King would have no constitutionalfunctions as Head of the Commonwealth. But it might well be that,by the process of evolution which had characterised the developmentof the Commonwealth, new functions might at some stage become, exercisable by the Crown in that capacity. This recognition by india might be at least the foundation on which some new constitutional structure might, as time went on, be built.(d) The Attorney-General said that, from the legal point ofview, there was little content in the conception of the Crown as thesymbol of the association of the Commonwealth peoples, once the element of common allegiance had been removed. If the constitu-tional basis of lndia&apos;s membership of the Commonwealth werechallenged before the International Court, it was by no means certainthat the&apos;position could be successfully upheld.(e) A communique&quot; announcing the conclusions reached at theMeeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers was to be released for publication in the Press on the morning of 28th April. There wouldbe simultaneous publication in all Commonwealth capitals. Thiswas not an occasion on which the announcement ought first to bemade to Parliament. It seemed likely, however,, that the opposition would ask for an opportunity to debate the subject matter of theannouncement; and the Lord President should be able to give some
