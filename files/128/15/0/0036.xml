2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Postmaster-General (CP. (49) 115) on the question whether the increased ratesof telephone rentals, announced by the Chancellor of the exchequer in his Budget Speech, should be brought into effect by legislation orby notices terminating the agreements of individual subscribers.When the draft Telegraph Bill was before the Legislation Committeeon 17th May, some Ministers had expressed the view that, if themethod of legislation were adopted, the Government would be exposed to damaging criticism for interfering with contractualrights by legislation.The Postmaster-General explained that the Budget proposalsfor increases in telephone call charges could be brought into force by regulations made under the Telegraph Acts. The proposed increase in rentals could not, however, be introduced by regulations,and it had been deemed inadvisable to deal with it in the finance bill. If the existing agreements had to be terminated bycorrespondence with each subscriber, a heavy burden would be thrown on the Post Office, estimated at 25,000 man-weeks. It wastherefore proposed to give notice by statute, as had been done on theoccasion of a previous increase during the war. There was noquestion of a unilateral breach of contract by the Government sincemost of the increases would not come into effect until after the endof the period during which notice could have been given to eachsubscriber under existing agreements. It could be argued that themethod of legislation would save the subscriber a good deal of unnecessary trouble in signing fresh agreements. Legislation wasin any event needed in order to make some necessary adjustments inthe financial arrangements between the Post Office and the HullCorporation, who maintained their own telephone service.Ministers first discussed the procedure for authorising theproposed increase in telephone rental charges. Save where an agree-ment was running its initial term, it was proposed to bring the increases into effect on 1st October, 1949. If the Bill did not receivethe Royal Assent until the middle of July, the effect would be thatcontracts made before 1st October, 1934 (where three months&apos; noticeof termination was required)-would, in fact, be varied by Act ofParliament a few weeks before the subscriber could have terminatedthe agreement by giving three months&apos; notice. The Postmaster-General proposed that he should meet this difficulty by sending outintimations to subscribers in the course of June, after the Bill hadreceived its Second Reading in the House of Commons. It was,however, the view of the Cabinet that this course would be open to serious criticism as assuming the existence of powers before theyhad, in fact, been given by Parliament. The Post Office would inany event have to scrutinise each contract in order to consider theapplication of the Bill to it; and it was not clear that the additional labour of sending out formal notice of termination of contract wouldbe very serious. Admittedly, - the process of printing forms,distributing them and considering replies would not enable theBudget increases, in respect of contracts which had run-beyond theirinitial term, to come into effect by 1st October next. It was, however,the general view of the Cabinet that it was undesirable that theGovernment should proceed with a Bill which would be represented,and even more widely misrepresented, as involving a breach of contract by the Government. In view of the extent to which trading services were now being taken over by the State, and the importance37128-1 b 2TelegraphBUI.Parliament. 1.

which the Government attached to the full performance of contracts in the field of industrial relations, it was doubtful whether the gainsin proceeding with the Telegraph Bill were commensurate with theundesirable public impression which this procedure would create.In further discussion there was some reference to the political disadvantages of increasing telephone rental charges at the presenttime. The Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget Speech had estimated that the increase in call fees (which had already been madeby regulation) would yield in a full year  4,250,000 and that increases in rentals would yield  3,850,000. The Postmaster-Generalsaid that in the present financial year the increases in rentals would yield about  1 million. Ministers understood that this increasedcharge was proposed primarily for the purpose of raising revenue and reducing the demand for telephone facilities, rather than for thepurpose of meeting increased costs. In other fields the Governmentwere pressing for a reduction in the prices of goods and services;and it was arguable that a socialised industry, the cost of whose services entered into the cost of other goods, should provide itsservices as cheaply as possible.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to resume, at an early meeting at which theChancellor of the Exchequer could be present, their discussion of the proposed increases in telephone rentalcharges and of the procedure for giving effect to such increases. &quot;N(2) Invited the Postmaster-General to submit a further memo-randum showing how the proposed increases could best be imposed in the various classes of contract by notice to individual subscribers, and the extent to which revenue would be lost by adopting this procedure for introducing the increases.Employmentof communists and Fasolsts.(previous reference erence:CM. (48) 25thConclusions,Minute 1.)SecretGovernmentContracts.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence (CP. (49) 107) reporting the conclusions of theCommittee on Subversive Activities on the measures to be taken toimprove the arrangements for excluding untrustworthy persons from employment in connection with Government contracts for secretwork placed with outside contractors.The Minister of Defence explained that under the existing formof contract for secret Government work the Department couldrequire the contractor to furnish particulars of all persons whowould be employed on the secret aspects of the work, and couldrequire him not to employ on such work any person whom it decidedto be undesirable. There would, however, be serious political troubleif Communists and Fascists were summarily excluded from work atthe request of a Department, without any public announcement of ageneral policy or any provision for hearing appeals. It wastherefore proposed that a general statement should be madeexplaining the policy which was to be adopted, and that the advisory body which considered similar cases in the Civil Service should operate also in this field. The functions of this body would be purelyadvisory and final responsibility would rest with the minister concerned.In discussion the following points were made :-(a) The Service and Supply Departments had evidence thatunreliable persons were being employed on highly secret work byfirms with which the Government must place contracts because oftheir specialised knowledge and equipment.(b) Both the Trades Union Congress and the British Employers&apos;Confederation should be consulted on these proposals, through theNational Joint Advisory Council.  The Trades Unions might take
exception to the use for this purpose of the advisory body which dealt with Civil Service cases, though from this point of view it wasadvantageous that that body included a prominent trade unionistand a former official of the Ministry of Labour.(c) The procedure in industrial cases would be broadly similarto that applicable to Civil Servants. A Civil Servant had the rightto make representations to his Minister, or to an official designated by his Minister, after the Minister had received the findings of theadvisory body. Although in industrial cases the Minister would notbe the employer, it was right that the final appeal should be to theMinister since it would be an appeal against his direction that theman concerned should not be employed on secret Government work.(d) The field within which the new arrangements operatedshould be kept as narrow as possible. Care would have to be taken not to encourage employers who might be over-zealous in this matter.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the arrangements proposed in CP. (49) 107,forexcluding untrustworthy persons from participation in secret Government work undertaken by contractors,subject to consultation with the National Joint AdvisoryCouncil.(2) Invited the Prime Minister, after the concurrence of theNational Joint Advisory Council had been obtained, tomake a public announcement about the arrangements proposed.Government The Cabinet then considered a memorandum by the MinisterOutstations. of Defence (CP. (49) 108) reporting the recommendations of theCommittee on Subversive Activities regarding the application tooutstations of the Service and Supply Departments of the procedure for securing that unreliable persons were not employed on secretGovernment work.The Minister of Defence said that large numbers were employedin outstations of the Service and Supply Departments; but, if regardwere paid to the secrecy of the work on which an individual was engaged rather than to the formal classification of stations as secretor non-secret, the field to be covered was greatly reduced. Thenumbers concerned would be less than those -involved under thepresent arrangements applying to Headquarters Departments. Asindicated in paragraph 4 of his memorandum, the Committee onSubversive Activities had contemplated that in certain circumstancesan individual might have to be removed if he had access to secret information, as distinct from being engaged in secret work. TheTreasury had represented that this went too far; and, subject to theconcurrence of the other Ministers concerned, he was prepared toagree that the recommendation should be confined to persons engaged on, or in connection with, secret work.In discussion it was pointed out that it would be preferable notto adopt a form of wording different from that used by the PrimeMinister in his statement in the House of Commons on 15th March,1948, when he had referred to Civil Servants &quot; employed in con-nection with work the nature of which is vital to the security of theState.&quot; There was general agreement that this wording coveredall that was required.. The Cabinet-(3) Agreed that the security arrangements relating to Com-munists and Fascists in Government service should beextended to outstations of the Service and supply departments on the basis proposed in CP. (49) 108,subject to their being limited to persons &quot; employed inconnection with work the nature of which is vital to thesecurity of the State.&quot;
(previous reference:CM. (47) 61stConclusions,Minute 1.)4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum on Greece bythe Foreign Secretary (CP. (49) 113).The Foreign Secretary said that the Soviet Government had made tentative proposals to the United States Government for asettlement of the civil war in Greece on the basis of the rebels&apos; peaceoffer of 20th April, viz., a cease-fire under the auspices of the great powers, a general amnesty, fresh elections and the restoration of normal relations between Greece and her northern neighbours. Theseproposals were unacceptable as they stood, since they implied equality of treatment between the Greek Government and the rebels. Butthis approach might provide an opportunity for negotiating ageneral settlement of outstanding Balkan problems, and the foreign secretary proposed to discuss the whole question with the UnitedStates Secretary of State during the forthcoming meeting of theCouncil of Foreign Ministers in Paris. With this in view he had set out in his memorandum what he considered our optimum demandsshould be in respect of the various Balkan problems; but he would propose to discuss with the United States Secretary of Statewhatminimum requirements we might accept if any general settlementproved to be feasible. The Foreign Secretary explained that his memorandum was not intended to exclude the possibility of a settle-ment relating to Greece alone : if there seemed to be a good prospectof reaching a satisfactory agreement about Greece, he would not seek to make that conditional upon settlement of all outstanding Balkanproblems.In discussion the following points were raised : (a) The Governments of the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates should avoid any responsibility for supervising any freshelections in Greece. It would be preferable that this task should beundertaken by Powers, e.g., the Scandinavian Governments, whichhad not hitherto intervened in Greece.(&amp;) Would the Greek Government insist that the CommunistParty in Greece should be completely suppressed?The Foreign Secretary thought this unlikely: he believed that inan election held under fair conditions few Communist candidateswould secure election. The future treatment of the CommunistParty would be among the points to be discussed in the negotiation of the terms of a general amnesty.(c) Was it intended that individual members of the rebel forces should be required to surrender 1 In reply it was pointed out thatthis also would be a matter for negotiation in connection with theterms of the proposed amnesty. It might be necessary to dealspecially with the organisers of the rebellion and their immediatefollowers, who probably represented little more than 15 per cent, ofthe total rebel forces.(d) It should not be assumed too readily that the resistance ofthe rebels had been finally broken. The position should be carefully watched, in case this Soviet approach was no more than a ruse tosecure a breathing-space in which the rebels could reorganise. Onthe other hand it seemed clear that the Yugoslavian Governmentwere withdrawing their support of the rebels; and it might be thatthe Soviet Government foresaw the collapse of the revolt andpreferred an early settlement rather than an open victory for theforces of the Greek Government.(e) In any general settlement of outstanding Balkan problems the opportunity should be taken to secure from the Greek Govern-ment satisfactory assurances that they would refrain from interven-tion in the domestic affairs of Cyprus.The Cabinet-Took note of secretary to explof CP. (49) 113 and invited the Foreign* explore with the United States Secretary of
State the possibility of securing a satisfactory settlementof the civil war in Greece and also, if possible, of out-standing problems elsewhere in the Balkans.Nile Waters. 5.   The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that an agree-ment had been concluded with the Egyptian Government regardingthe construction of a dam at Owen Falls, which was the first stage&quot;    , in a comprehensive scheme for the utilisation of the waters of theNile. The construction of the dam would provide electric power forUganda and would lead to substantial improvements in the agri-cultural economy of Egypt and the Sudan. There would now be abetter prospect of making progress towards the conclusion of anagreement on Lake Tsana. He proposed to announce the conclusionof the Owen Falls agreement in the House of Commons that afternoon.The Cabinet took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;sstatement.Future of 6.   The Foreign Secretary said that in the United NationsItalian Assembly the previous day it had proved impossible to obtain theColonies.        necessary two-thirds majority for the proposal that the administra-(Previous       tion of Tripolitania should be handed over to Italy in 1951; and,Reference:      as a result, the whole plan for settling the future of the ItalianC.M.(49)20th   Colonies, of which this proposal formed part, had been rejected.Conclusions,        now seemed clear that no further progress towards a solution of minute 4.)&apos;     this problem could be made for the time being in the united nations; and he would have to try to devise some interim arrange-- ments which would tend to reduce the cost now falling on the british exchequer.   The United States Government might perhaps be willing to take some share in the administration of Tripolitania.The earlier project for a Greater Somalia might perhaps be revivedin some form as France had now agreed to give Abyssinia an outletto the sea near Jibuti, and the Italians, after their recent disappoint-ment in the United Nations, might be more willing to make conces-sions.   In Cyrenaica, the best plan might be for us to encourage the Emir to proclaim himself and put himself in a position in whichhe could conclude a treaty with the United Kingdom Government.The Foreign Secretary said that he would review all these possibilities and submit a considered memorandum to the Cabinet.The Cabinet took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;sstatement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,19th May, 1949.
