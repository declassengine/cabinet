western union.(previous reference:-CM. (49) 2ndConclusions,Minute 1.)The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (49) 18) covering a draft directive which the consultative Council of the Brussels Powers proposed to give to thePermanent Commission for their guidance in working out a detailedconstitution for a Council of Europe.The Foreign Secretary said that, at their meeting later that afternoon, the Consultative Council were likely to approve a directive on the lines of the draft annexed to CP. (49) 18. Thisdiffered in certain respects from the proposals which he had put tothe Council in pursuance of the Cabinefs decision of 12th Januarysand he therefore wished to take this opportunity of discussing thedraft with his colleagues before approving it on their behalf. he explained the course which the Council&apos;s discussions had taken andthe points to which special importance was attached by the otherGovernments represented.The Cabinefs discussion first turned on the procedure forselecting the national delegations to the Consultative Body. It was proposed in the draft directive that &quot; Each country shall be free toadopt the procedure it prefers in regard to the appointment of its representatives on the Consultative Body.&quot; It was pointed out that,if this formula were adopted, it would be argued in this country that it was for Parliament to decide what procedure should befollowed in selecting the United Kingdom representatives. It was important that Governments should be enabled, if they so desired,to reserve this decision to themselves.The Cabinet (1) Asked the Foreign Secretary to propose that this part of thedraft directive should be amended so as to read : &quot; each country shall be free to adopt the procedure decided by its Government in regard to the appointment of its repre-sentatives on the Consultative Body.&quot;It was pointed out that there was a formal inconsistencybetween paragraph (3) of the draft (which provided that decisionsof the Consultative Body should be by majority of those present and voting) and the preceding paragraph (which provided that decisions regarding the matters to be placed on the agenda of the ConsultativeBody should be taken by a two-thirds majority). This could be avoided if the order of these two paragraphs was reversed.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to propose that the order of paragraphs (2) and (3) of the draft directive should be reversed.The Cabinet then turned to discuss the proposals in para-graph (2) (b) of the draft directive for limiting the powers of the consultative Body to take the initiative in placing matters on itsagenda for discussion. The Consultative Body was to have the right,by a majority vote of two-thirds of its members, to place on itsagenda any questions of common interest to the member countries,with the exception of military questions; but it was proposed thatsuch a decision to place a matter on the agenda should also requirethe approval of a two-thirds majority of the Ministerial Committee.Some Ministers considered that this further requirement of approval by the Ministerial Committee would be strongly criticised as an undue limitation on the freedom of the Consultative Body to Initiatediscussion. They also argued that this additional safeguard was unnecessary; since it was reasonable to assume that the requirement that two-thirds of the members of the Consultative Body shouldassent to the placing of a matter on the agenda would in itself suffice to exclude matters which it would be inexpedient to have discussed in such an assembly. They therefore favoured the deletion of thesecond sentence of paragraph (2) (b) of the draft directive.   As a
consequential strengthening of the first part of the paragraph, itwas suggested that the majority required before a subject could beplaced on the agenda should be two-thirds of the total membership of the Consultative Body, instead of two-thirds of those present and voting at the meeting.It was, however, pointed out that the Consultative Body was notto have the right to initiate discussions on &apos;&apos; military questions&apos;&apos;and that if there were no requirement that the agenda should besubject to the approval of the Ministerial Committee, there would beno authoritative means of deciding whether a particular subject wasa &apos;&apos; military question &apos;&apos; or not. In order to meet this point, it wassuggested that the Ministerial Committee, instead of being given ageneral responsibility for approving the agenda as a whole, shouldhave power to remove from it (possibly by a simple majority) any matters of defence or related questions.The Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster expressed themselves in favour of leaving the ministerial committee with a general responsibility for approving the agenda.The other Governments represented on the Consultative Councilattached importance to this. They were anxious that governments should retain effective power to prevent the Consultative Body fromdiscussing certain questions of policy which Ministers thought itinexpedient to have discussed in such an assembly. The questionswhich they might on occasion wish to exclude w.ere not confinedwholly to matters of defence : they were also reluctant to allow freediscussion of some budgetary matters. In the earlier proceedings on the Permanent Commission the United Kingdom representatives had, by the Cabinet&apos;s directions, taken the general line that Govern-ments should retain effective control over the work of this assembly;and it would seem inconsistent if the Foreign Secretary now pressed for the removal of a safeguard which the other Governments wishedto include for the purpose of securing such control.The Cabinet-(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to be guided by the views expressed by the Cabinet in the further discussions onthe Consultative Council regarding paragraph (2). (&amp;) ofthe draft directive annexed to CP. (49) 18.The Prime Minister said that the Government were again being pressed to give their support to the International Committee of movements for European Unity. The Foreign Secretary said that itwould be premature for the Government to modify their attitudetowards this body, at any rate until the arrangements for theconstitution of a Council of Europe had been approved by theGovernments of the Brussels Powers.The Cabinet-(4) Agreed that for the time being there should be nomodification of the Governments attitude towards theInternational Committee of Movements for european unity.Cabinet Office, S.
