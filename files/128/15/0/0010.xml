1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (49) 23) on reparations from Germany and the policy for prohibiting or limiting certain German industries on security grounds.The Foreign Secretary recalled that, when the Cabinet had considered the recommendations of the Humphrey Committee on22nd December, 1948, they had agreed that he should seek to securethe agreement of the United States Government that the numberof industrial plants scheduled for removal as reparations from western Germany should be reduced, in the interests of theEuropean Recovery Programme, by 117 plants and not by 167, as recommended by the Humphrey Committee. They had at the sametime given him discretion to agree, if necessary, to the retention ofcertain further plants if this proved necessary in order to secure agreement and if it formed part of a satisfactory solution in respectof the prohibited and limited industries and the establishment ofa Ruhr Authority. A satisfactory agreement had since been madefor the establisliment of a Ruhr Authority, and preparations hadbeen made for early discussions on reparations and on the prohibitedand limited industries. The United States Government were now,however, pressing that an agreement on the recommendations of theHumphrey Committee should be reached before 12th February,when Congress would begin to discuss the second appropriation forthe European Recovery Programme. The Foreign Secretary thoughtthat from the point of view of the United Kingdom Government,and even more from that of the French and other European Govern-ments, it would be a mistake to reach agreement with the UnitedStates Government on this reparations issue alone, in isolation fromthe related question of prohibited and limited industries. If weallowed the two questions to be handled separately, concessions whichwe might make on the first could not be used to obtain safeguards which were necessary on security grounds under the second. TheForeign Secretary saw, however, considerable advantage in seeking to reach a quick agreement with the United States Government on both issues together; and he sought authority to negotiate with theUnited States and French Governments on the following basis : (i) that he should press upon the United States Governmentthe policy embodied in CP. (48) 203 and 303, as approved by the Cabinet on 16th August and22nd December, 1948, respectively;(ii) that, if necessary for the purpose of obtaining a settle-ment, he should agree to the exclusion from the repara-tions list of all the plants which the United StatesGovernment desired to retain in Western Germany otherthan the five plants listed in Annex A to CP. (49) 23;(iii) that, if essential for the purpose of reaching agreement,he should offer the concessions listed in Annex B to cp. (49) 23 regarding shipbuilding and shipping,synthetic rubber, ball bearings and roller bearings, and machine tools.The Foreign Secretary added that it was, in his view, speciallyimportant that he should resist the proposal of the United StatesGovernment that the steel plant at Hamborn (though it had not beenamong the 167 plants whose retention was recommended by theHumphrey Committee) should be retained for not more than five years in order to meet the temporary shortage of steel. TheUnited States Government were proposing that this plant shouldbe temporarily administered by the Occupying Powers and that itshould be dismantled when the steel shortage had been overcome.The Foreign Secretary said that, in his view, it would provepolitically impossible to dismantle the plant at the end of thisiemporary-period, and its permanent retention would stultify theAllied security agreement limiting the steel production of Western1 b 2
Germany to 11-1 million tons a year. In any event, there was no economic justification for the proposal, since Germany&apos;s output ofsteel was limited by shortage of raw materials, not of capacity; andthe Hamborn plant could only be kept in operation by withdrawingraw materials from other plants in Germany.The Cabinet were informed that the Chiefs of Staff had hadno opportunity to assess the strategic risks involved in making theultimate concessions indicated in paragraph (ii) above. Had these risk been considered in detail by the Ministry of Supply? TheParliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Supply, said that his department had not been able to consider in detail the security risks which would be involved if the Foreign Secretary were forced togo to the limits of these concessions. It was clear that, if he were forced to go beyond those limits, there would be no hope of main-taining any security check on Germany&apos;s war potential. TheMinistry of Supply were, however, prepared to support the general approach to this problem outlined in CP. (49) 23 and were, inparticular, ready to agree that the Foreign Secretary might in thelast resort make the concessions indicated in paragraph (iii) above.The President of the Board of Trade emphasised the importance ofthe impending discussions in Congress on the second appropriationfor the European Recovery Programme and said that, in view ofthis, he was ready to agree that any concessions necessary for thepurpose of securing agreement should be made up to the limitsindicated in paragraphs (ii) and (iii) above.As regards shipbuilding and shipping, the Cabinet were informed that the Admiralty and Ministry of Transport agreed thatthe Foreign Secretary should, if need be, make the concessionsoutlined in Annex B to CP. (49) 23. The Cabinet were, however,warned that the removal of the limitation on the radius of operationof German merchant vessels was likely to be followed, at a later stage, by a demand for a removal of the restrictions on the construc-tion of ocean-going ships. It would be advantageous if any concession on radius of operation could be limited to theMediterranean.The Cabinefs further discussion turned mainly on the questionof principle whether it was expedient to seek to prevent Germany&apos;?re-emerging as a military power by limiting her industrial war potential. On the one hand, it was argued that this was inconsistent with the Governments attempts to promote expansionist policiesthroughout the world; for an increased output of steel by germany could be of the greatest value in furtherance of these policies.Secondly, it was difficult to defend a policy of expanding steel production in the United Kingdom and restricting it in Germany.Thirdly, it was argued that the interests of military security couidbe adequately safeguarded, without interference with Germany&apos;economic prosperity, if the Western Powers established an effective system of inspection at the finishing ends of the basic industries.The proper course was, surely, to allow Germany&apos;s basic industries to expand, to the benefit of the German economy and of world trade generally, but to ensure by effective inspection that they were not used for the manufacture of armaments.On the other side, it was argued that the re-emergence ofGermany as a military power was still the greatest danger to world peace. It should not be forgotten that under Hitler&apos;s regimeGermany had rearmed in little more than six years. It would be atragic blunder if she were left with the industrial means of building up once more a war potential which would threaten the world. Itwas not yet certain that the misuse of industrial capacity could be effectively prevented by a system of inspection at the finishing endsof the basic industries. Hitherto, the French Government, at anyrate, had been unwilling to accept such a system as an effectivesafeguard for their security. This&apos;problem was now under examina-tion in the current discussions on the Occupation Statute.  In any
2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (49) 22) on the situation in Indonesia. They also had before them a note by the Foreign Secretary (CP. (49) 25)reporting his discussions on the Indonesian question with the high commissioners for India and Pakistan.The Foreign Secretary said that the Cabinet should consider what line they should pursue in the light of the Resolution onIndonesia adopted by the Security Council on 28th January. Hisown view was that the Netherlands Government would not attemptto evade the Council&apos;s ruling; indeed, the latest information fromThe Hague suggested that they were considering the possibility of transferring power in advance of any date contemplated by theCouncil. There were, however, widespread doubts about their intentions, and he feared that the Council might further complicateevent, was there a sound economic case for increasing the steel-making capacity of Western Germany? In the United Kingdom,with a population of over 50 million, steel production was running at about 15 million tons a year. Was 11 1 million tons an unreasonable figure for Western Germany, with a population of only46 million? There was certainly no justification for the UnitedStates proposal to retain the plant at Hamborn, which, if in full operation, could raise the annual steel output of Western Germanyto over 13 million tons.In further discussion, the following points were also made : (a) It was suggested that no aspect of our reparations policy should be influenced by the consideration of protecting Britishindustry against fair competition from Western Germany. Therewas general agreement with this view.(&amp;) If, as a result of the concessions contemplated in para-graph (ii) above, reparation deliveries to Western Europe were substantially reduced, was it reasonable that deliveries to russia should continue unchecked? If they did, the Soviet Governmentwould be receiving a greatly increased proportion of the totaldeliveries.The Foreign Secretary said that there might be good reason tocontinue those deliveries which were made to Russia againstpayment in goods which served to reduce the dollar imports of western Germany. For the rest, he had it in mind to negotiate anew allocation of reparation deliveries with a view to compensating,at the expense of deliveries to Russia, the loss which the western powers would suffer from the concessions which might have to bemade on the basis of the Humphrey Committee&apos;s report.(c) Was the Exchequer still bearing some part of the cost offood imports into Western Germany? Had not German exportsnow reached a point at which we should be relieved of this burden ?In reply it was pointed out that the Fusion Agreement had been greatly to our financial advantage. The revision of the agreement had been postponed for three months in order to avoid its becoming a matter of controversy in the Presidential election in the UnitedStates. Negotiations for its revision were due to begin shortly; butthere might be something to be said for a further renewal of theexisting Agreement until&apos;a date beyond the conclusion of theCongress hearings on the second appropriation for the european recovery Programme.The Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to negotiate with theUnited States and French Governments a settlement on reparations and on the prohibition and limitation ofcertain German industries on the basis set out in cp. (49) 23 and summarised in paragraphs (i) to (iii)above.
their task by insisting on a rigid adherence to the exact procedurelaid down in the Resolution. If attention was concentrated exclu-sively on the withdrawal of Dutch control, there was a risk that thetransfer of power might be followed by a breakdown of government as disastrous as had occurred in Burma. Indonesia did not possessan administrative machine such as had existed in India in 1947, andit was important that every effort should be made in the interveningmonths to restore law and order, and to create machinery of govern-ment capable of exercising effective control over the country once theDutch had withdrawn. He had urged the Governments of Indiaand Pakistan to impress on the Indonesians the overriding importance of these practical issues, and in particular the need forRepublicans and Federalists to reach early agreement on the consti-tution of the interim Federal Government contemplated by theSecurity Council &apos;s Resolution. The general policy which he proposed to pursue was outlined in CP. (49) 22, and he suggestedthat this statement of views should be communicated without delay to the Governments of the United States and the Brussels treaty powers, and to the other Commonwealth Governments.There was general agreement with the Foreign Secretary&apos;views. In discussion, some Ministers expressed concern at the prejudice which the United States and Australian Governments had shown against the Dutch in the Security Councils discussions. TheNetherlands Government had certainly shown little skill in theirhandling of the situation, but their extreme critics ignored the risks involved in a precipitate transfer of power in Indonesia. South-East Asia was gravely threatened by the recent advances of communism in the Far East, and the sudden withdrawal of Dutchpower might leave Indonesia chaotic and helpless in the face of the opposing threats of Communist infiltration or American financialimperialism of the kind mentioned in the House of Lords Debateof 19th January. On the other hand, it was pointed out that themain responsibility for the present situation rested on theNetherlands Government themselves: hitherto, they had signallyfailed to recognise the strength and implications of the localnationalist movement, or the need for swift and generous actioncomparable with that taken in 1947 by the United Kingdom Govern-ment in India. There were grounds for hope that this lesson had now been learned : in that event, it should be possible, if the indonesians adopted a co-operative attitude, to avoid a breakdown of government on the transfer of power. The Dutch had employedlarge numbers of Indonesians in their administration, and anindependent Indonesian Government would probably be prepared toretain Dutch advisers.The Cabinet-Approved the recommendations made in CP. (49) 22.EconomicAffaire.external trade.(previous reference erence:CM. (49) 5thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The President of the Board of Trade informed the Cabinetthat the provisional estimate of the value of United kingdom exports in January was  159 million, or  12 million higher than the record figures achieved in November last. In terms of volume,exports in January were some 60 per cent, above the 1938 level, andwere thus well in excess of the target rate for 1949.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the statement of the Presidentof the Board of Trade.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,8th February, 1949.
