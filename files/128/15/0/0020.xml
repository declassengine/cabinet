The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of fuel and Power (CP. (49) 41), on which they had had a preliminary discussion at their meeting on 28th February, 1949. It was recom-mended in the memorandum that a permanent increase should not bemade in the standard ration but that the petrol coupons for June,July and August of this year should be worth 180 instead of 90 milesper month. The coupons would be available when the standardration books were issued in May and would remain valid for five months after the months for which they were issued. The costof this extra allowance would be 90,000 tons of petrol.Attention was drawn to the fact that the allowance of petrolto public service passenger vehicles had been cut by 12^ per cent, atthe time when the present standard ration was reduced for privatemotorists. If this cut were restored for three months, it wouldrequire 3,300 tons of petrol.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposal in paragraph 7 of CP. (49) 41 thatthe value of petrol coupons for private cars in respect ofJune, July and August should be doubled and authorised the Minister of Fuel and Power to announce the con-cession in answer to an oral question that afternoon.(2) Invited the Ministers of Transport and Fuel and Power to&apos; agree upon a comparable concession to be made in respectof public service passenger vehicles.3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Defence (CP. (49) 43) and by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(CP. (49) 61) on the question whether the increases in officers&apos;marriage allowances agreed by the Cabinet on 22nd November, 1948,and announced in the House of Commons on 24th November, shouldbe regarded as extending to officers serving under the NationalService Acts.The Minister of Defence explained that it had been agreed inNovember between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the service ministers that the marriage allowance increases should not beextended to National Service other ranks, but the position ofNational Service officers had been left in doubt. The wording ofthe public statement could be interpreted to mean that NationalService officers should receive the increases in marriage allowances and to that extent Government faith was pledged. Many of theNational Service officers consisted of professional men over 25 yearsof age and there would be great resentment if they did not receivewhat&quot; were regarded as necessary increases in allowances. TheBritish Medical Association would almost certainly make strong representations in favour of doctors called up under the NationalService Acts.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in his view, the omission of any reference to National Service officers in the announce-ment was deliberate because no agreement had been reached on theS)oint at the time and the terms of the announcement were designed toeave the position unprejudiced pending further discussion.   In themeantime, it had been agreed that the marriage allowance increases should not be paid to National Service officers.   He was satisfied thaton merits there was no case for the proposal.36823-1 b 21. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commopain the following week.On Friday, 18th&apos;March, .the Parliamentary Under-Secretary ofState for the Home Department would indicate the objections to thePet Animals Bill and the Financial Secretary, Treasury, would ask the House of Commons to reject the War Damage (Amendment) Bill.
In further discussion the following points were made: (a) So far, the position of National Service officers in respect of marriage allowances had not been raised in an acute form. this might be because it was being accepted that National service personnel as a category were excluded from the recent concessions,but the Service Ministers believed it was due to a widespreadimpression that the question was not yet settled.(6) The Service Ministers considered that a National Serviceofficer working alongside a regular officer would have a justifiablegrievance if, under similar financial circumstances, he did not receivethe marriage allowances which were available for the regular officer.On the other hand, it could be argued that the marriage allowances were given to regular officers because of the high rents which theyhad to pay for accommodation taken for short periods in variousgarts of the country or abroad. In the ordinary way a Nationalervice officer would not change his home during his comparatively short period of National Service. Moreover, when National service was put on a regular footing after the war it had been agreed thatthe varying needs of National Service personnel would best be met bya scheme of special allowances for men whose normal pay in theForces was insufficient to enable them to meet their civiliancommitments.(c) The Service Ministers believed that any concession could be confined to National Service officers, though it was conceded that thegrant of marriage allowances to officers over 25 years of age wouldmake it necessary to give the smaller allowances available to officersunder 25 years of age. The general feeling among other Ministerswas, however, that it would be impossible to confine any concession to national Service officers and that the pressure to extend it to national Service other ranks would become irresistible. Once this extension took place the cost would rise from  50,000 a year to 800,000 a year and the value of the original concessions as a meansof inducing men to take up the Army as a regular career would be largely lost.The Cabinet-Agreed that the increased marriage allowances announced on 24th November, 1948, should not be regarded as applying to National Service officers.Future ofItalianColonies.(previous reference erence:CM. (49) 5thConclusions,Minute 4.)Distribution ofAdministrativeEesponsibilty.Future ofTripolitania.4. At their meeting on 20th January the Cabinet had agreedthat the administrative responsibility for Cyrenaica and Tripoli-tania should be transferred from the War Office to the Foreign Office.They now had before them a joint memorandum by the foreign secretary and the Secretary of State for War (CP. (49) 57) covering the report of an official working party on the administrativeimplications of that decision.,The working party recommended that, on grounds of adminis-trative convenience and efficiency, responsibility for the future administration of Eritrea and Italian Somaliland should be trans-ferred to the Foreign Office concurrently with the administrative responsibility for Cyrenaica and Tripolitania; and that this transfershould take effect as from 1st April, 1949. Detailed arrangements had been worked out for the creation of a new London establishmentof the Foreign Office to take over these duties. It was pointed outthat, if it should be found that responsibility for Eritrea and italian somaliland must remain permanently or semi-permanently with HisMajesty&apos;s Government, it would be necessary to review the distri-bution of departmental responsibility for these two territories.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendations made in the report annexed to CP. (49) 57.The Cabinet also had before them a joint memorandum by theForeign Secretary and the Secretary of State for War (CP. (49) 55)
5. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the reports ofthe Governments intention to reduce the weekly ration of carcase meat from IQd. to 8d., which had appeared in the Press that morning and on the preceding day; and it was agreed that it wouldbe advisable,&quot; in the circumstances, to make an announcement on thesubject that afternoon rather than on 18th March, as proposed bythe Cabinet on 10th March.The draft of a statement to be made in the House of Commonsafter Questions was handed to Ministers. The general view of theCabinet was that this draft, by stressing the shortcomings of theArgentine Government, laid too much emphasis on our dependence on Argentina for meat supplies. It was agreed that the draft shouldbe revised to bring out the fact that there was a world-wide shortageof meat which was likely to continue for some time to come. Whileit was right to make it known that the difficulties of the situation had been greatly aggravated by the shortfall in shipments under theAndes Agreement, something should also be said to show that theGovernment were taking energetic steps to develop alternative sources of supply, partly by expanding livestock production in theUnited Kingdom, and partly by encouraging livestock productionin other countries.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the decision to reduce the weekly ration ofcarcase meat from 10c?. to 8c?. should be announced that afternoon.(2) Invited the Lord President to settle the final terms of theannouncement in consultation with the parliamentary secretary, Ministry of Food.Food.Meat Ration.(previous reference:CM. (49) 19thConclusions,Minute 5.)proposing that a working party should be set up to review thesituation in Tripolitania and to make recommendations on social,administrative, economic and constitutional policy.The memorandum recalled that in August 1948 the Deputiesin the Council of Foreign Ministers had been informed:*by the*;United Kingdom representative that, if no decision were taken.;on the final disposal of Tripolitania, and His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere asked to continue to administer the territory as a caretaker,they would desire to be freed from the limitations imposed by theHague Conventions, to replace the military by a, civil administration,and to introduce a series of reforms. The failure of the Council ofForeign Ministers and of the General Assembly of the united nations to reach any decisions about the future of the italian colonies rendered it desirable to abandon in Tripolitania the existing system of &quot; care and maintenance&quot; in favour of a more positivepolicy; and it &quot;was therefore proposed that, in accordance with theprocedure already adopted in Cyrenaica, a working party should nowbe appointed to make detailed recommendations after a visit to theterritory.In discussion, it was pointed out that it might be inadvisable toproceed with the setting up of the working party until it was clearthat no decision on the future of Tripolitania was likely to be reached at the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in April.The Foreign Secretary suggested that action should be deferred until after his forthcoming visit to the United States. The position might be clearer by then; and he was in any event anxious to discussthe whole question of the Italian Colonies with the United states secretary of State.The Cabinet-(2) Agreed that the appointment of a working party onTripolitania should be deferred pending the foreign secretary&apos;s further consultations during his forth-coming visit to the United States.(3) Subject to Conclusion (2) above, approved the recommenda-tions made in CP. (49) 55.
Geneva .:-Conventionson WarVictims.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary and the Secretary of State for War (CP. (49) 59) indi-cating some questions of policy which arose on the instructions tobe given to the United Kingdom representatives at a conference which the Swiss Government were convening at Geneva on 21stApril, 1949, to discuss four new Geneva Conventions. The Reportof an Interdepartmental Committee which had considered certain aspects of the problem was appended to the memorandum.The Prime Minister said that he was informed that the LawOfficers had not been consulted on the recommendations of the Inter-departmental Committee or on the covering proposals by Ministers.He stressed the importance of consulting the Law Officers at anearly stage on problems of this kind, which raised major questionsof domestic and international law.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be useful if some of the Ministers more immediately concerned would consider together the problems raised in CP. (49) 59 and would indicate to the Cabinet any issues on which they were not able toreach agreement.The Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for a Committee,including the Foreign Secretary, Lord Chancellor, HomeSecretary, Secretary of State for War and Attorney-General, to consider the issues raised in CP. (49) 59 andto make recommendations to the Cabinet.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,17th March, 1949.
