private members-Bills.(previous reference:C.M.(49)9thConclusions,Minute 2.)Prohibitionof BloodSports.Government The Minister of Health explained that Mr. Peter Thorneycrof t,Assistance in M.P., who had introduced the Analgesia in Childbirth Bill, hadDrafting. been given a certain amount of assistance by his Department in the drafting of the Bill. Medical facilities were not at present availableto give effect to the intentions of the Bill and the Bill would probably have to be opposed on that ground. It had seemed inexpedient torefuse to give assistance in the technical drafting of this Bill; butthe Cabinet might like to consider as a general question the extentto which Private Members should be assisted in this way.In discussion it was pointed out that the normal practice beforethe war had been to decline such assistance until a Bill had beengiven a Second Reading, and even then there had been somedisinclination to help Members with Bills to which the Governmentwere opposed. It was sometimes useful to be able to argue that owing to defective drafting the Bill would not have the effect desired by the Mover. On the other hand, some Bills were backed by theGovernment from the start and drafted by Parliamentary Counsel.It might be difficult to lay down any firm rules on this subject.The Cabinet--(3) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the legislation committee to consider in what circumstances government assistance should be given in connection with the drafting of Private Members&apos; Bills.36597-21. The Lord President oVew attention to the Protection of animals (Hunting and Coursing Prohibition) Bill introduced byMr. Cocks, M.P., which was first order on Friday, 25th February, andto the Prohibition of Fox Hunting Bill introduced by Mr. Fairnurst,M.P., which was second order on Friday, 11th March. There were indications that both these Bills were arousing considerable feeling in the countryside, especially among farmers; and it seemed desirableon this account that the Government should declare their attitudetowards them.In discussion, it was pointed out that the cruelty of huntingand coursing was greatly exaggerated. These pursuits formed partof the traditional life of the countryside and could not be regardedsimply as amusements of the aristocracy. The Protection of Animals(Hunting and Coursing Prohibition) Bill was very widely drawn,although efforts were being made to narrow its scope so as not toprevent the occasional chasing of rabbits by dogs. If the House ofCommons were to pass these Bills, they would almost certainly be rejected by the House of Lords, and the Government might again be placed in the embarrassing position in which they had found themselves on the question of capital punishment, where the Lordshad appeared to show a better judgment of public opinion than the commons.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Minister of Agriculture should, on behalfof the Government, advise the House of Commons to reject the Protection of Animals (Hunting and CoursingProhibition) Bill and the Prohibition of Fox HuntingBill.(2) Agreed that the necessary steps should be taken to makethe Government^ views known in advance to Govern-ment supporters, many of whom were seeking guidance on the attitude which they should adopt.
Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.In connection with the Statement on Business that dayMr. Churchill intended to repeat his request that the Governmentshould give facilities for an early debate on the method of nominat-ing the United Kingdom delegation to the proposed european assembly. The Cabinet agreed that this request should be refused,on the basis that the constitution of the Council of Europe was still under international discussion and it would be premature for theGovernment to take or announce at this stage a final decision onthis particular aspect of the matter. If the Opposition wishedto express their views in the hope of influencing the Governmentsfinal decision, it was open to them to ask that the Foreign OfficeVote should be put down for discussion on a Supply Day.War Graves.(previous reference:C.M.(45)29thConelusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for War (CP. (49) 20) regarding the determination of the finalplace of burial for mixed remains or ashes of British and Americandead.The Secretary of State for War explained that United Stateslaw required that the remains of their citizens killed during thewar, including all unidentifiable remains, should be brought backto the United States. Our policy, on the other hand, was that theremains of British war dead should not be repatriated to thiscountry, either at public or at private expense. Difficulty had therefore arisen about graves where American and British dead hadbeen buried together both (i) inter-mingled ashes in mass gravesin Japan, and (ii) mixed and separately unidentifiable remains,mostly resulting from aircraft crashes, in various parts of the world.The United States Government, after putting forward other pro-posals which we had felt compelled to reject, had finally suggestedthat this difficulty should be resolved on the basis that, where Britishdead predominated, the ashes should be interred in a cemeteryselected by the United Kingdom Government, and, where Americandead predominated, in a cemetery selected by the United StatesGovernment. The Imperial War Graves Commission, with whomthe statutory responsibility rested, had been willing to accept thisproposal; but the Service Ministers had asked them to stipulate that agreement on the final disposal of the ashes should be conditional upon consultation with the next-of-kin of the British dead and that,if any of the next-of-kin withheld their consent, the bodies should remain in the nearest British or American military cemetery. TheUnited States Government had been unwilling to accept this stipula-tion; and it was now proposed that the United States proposal should be unconditionally accepted. ^ The other commonwealth governments represented on the Imperial War Graves commission had been consulted and concurred in the course proposed.The Secretary of State for War said that he recognised thedifficulty of obstructing the United States authorities in carryingout a requirement of their law. On the other hand, if we agreedthat the United States authorities should remove the ashes of british war dead to the United States without consultation with the next-of-kin, we should thereby provoke increased criticism of our own policy of refusing to allow any British war dead to be repatriatedto the United Kingdom. He was, however, prepared to maintain that policy and withstand any public criticism which it evoked. Theposition was somewhat complicated by the fact that relatives were now allowed to repatriate to the United Kingdom at their own expense the remains of Service men and women who died while serving with the Occupation Forces in Germany, but a distinctioncould be drawn between these and the war dead.
61CM. 11 (49)White Paper.(previous reference:C.M.(48)llthConclusions,Minute 5.)The Cabinet Authorised the Secretary of State for War to inform theImperial War Graves Commission that the Governmentsaw no objection to their assenting to the latest proposal of the United States Government, as set out in alternative(&amp;) in paragraph 3 of CP. (49) 20.4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister ofDefence (CP. (49) 21) covering the draft of a White Paperembodying the annual statement relating to defence.The Minister of Defence said that the most important passages in the White Paper related to the Defence Estimates for 1949-50which had been approved by the Cabinet. The Minister of Supply,on consideration, thought that the analysis of expenditure on research and development in Annex II was too detailed and shouldbe dealt with on more general lines, such as had been adopted inthe previous year. The President of the Board of Trade had suggested a slight amendment of paragraph 6 to avoid givingdetailed information about Service strengths. He had agreed withthe Treasury an amendment of paragraph 47 to explain the reasonsfor the greater use of civilian man-power in the Services.In discussion the following points were made :-*(a) While expenditure on the Armed Forces was largely deter- -mined by current needs and requirements for research and develop-ment, there should be a critical examination of the potentialwar-time strengths of possible enemies. Thus, in terms of steel production, Russia and the countries coming under her influencewere by no means so strong as they appeared in terms of populationor territory. An appreciation of this kind might indicate that thenecessary scale of war preparations by the Western Powers was by no means as great as was currently assumed.(6) The extended use of civilian personnel, including disabledmen, on routine and household duties in barracks and camps would increase the amount of time available for military training bycombatant troops and would enhance their keenness and efficiency.The process of introducing civilians for work of this charactershould not be retarded by the pruning of the Service Estimatesunder this head.(c) It would be useful if some of the additional productionrequired for Service needs could be placed in areas such as Mersey-side and Clydeside where unemployment was beginning to appear.This problem was being considered by the Distribution of IndustryCommittee and the Production Committee.The Cabinet -(1) Approved the draft White Paper annexed to CP. (49) 21,subject to the amendments indicated by the Minister ofDefence and to such other minor or drafting amendments as he might find it necessary to make.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the point noted in paragraph(a) above.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,10th February, 1949.
