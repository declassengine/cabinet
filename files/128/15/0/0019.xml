North Atlantic l. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignSecurity Pact. Secretary (CP. (49) 56) submitting for approval the final text of the(Previous North Atlantic Security Pact in the form in which it had been agreedReference: at Washington between the United States Secretary of State and cm. (49) 14th representatives of the United Kingdom, Canada, France and theConclusions.)   Benelux countries.Text of Pact. The Foreign Secretary recalled the circumstances in which theUnited States Government had been brought to consider proposalsfor a close defensive agreement between the countries in the north atlantic area. The final text (and, in particular, Article 5, dealingwith mutual assistance) was in accord with the views expressed bythe Cabinet at their meeting on 22nd February, 1949.   The Govern-e ment had every reason to be satisfied with the results of the longnegotiations over the text, and the Pact would give great encourage-ment to Western Europe. A number of drafting amendments hadbeen suggested by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee since the circulation of the text in CP. (49) 56, but they in no way affected the substance of the agreement and were intended to make itsmeaning clearer at various points. It was desired that the partiesto the Pact should indicate their approval of the text by 11thMarch, and that the text should be published on 15th March. the pact would probably be signed on or about 4th April, and would come into force, on ratification, about two months after that. Whenthe text had been approved, it would be sent to the Governments of norway, Italy, Denmark, Portugal and Iceland with an invitationthat they should become associated with the Pact. It was not yetclear whether this association would be by signature or by accession.The present indications were that it would be by accession announcedsimultaneously with signature by the seven countries which wouldsign the Pact. France had pressed strongly that Italy should beinvited to accede to the Pact, although her accession might raisedifficult internal problems for the Italian Government. It seemed likely that Denmark would accede to the Pact and she was importantbecause the defence, of Greenland was vital to Canada and theUnited States. If recent events had taken a more leisurely course,it was conceivable that Sweden might have joined the Pact; she wasin fact now taking stock of her position and the outcome was not clear.The Cabinet expressed warm appreciation of the successfulefforts made by the Foreign Secretary to secure the Pact, which intheir view, would make a notable contribution to the security of theWest and the maintenance of world peace.Parliamentary The Cabinet then discussed the arrangements for informingProcedure and Parliament and the country generally of what was proposed. the publicity. text should now be sent without delay to other commonwealth countries for information. The time of publication on 15th Marchshould, if possible, be so arranged as to enable the Foreign Secretaryto make a statement after Questions in the House of Commons,.a corresponding statement being made in the House of Lords. Thestatement should be of some length to mark suitably the importanceof what had been achieved. The text of the proposed Pact should bepublished at the same time as a White Paper, and the Governmentshould indicate that it proposed to table a formal motion welcomingthe Pact. The Foreign Secretary would broadcast a statement on the significance of the Pact on the evening of 15th March.Declaration The Foreign Secretary reminded the Cabinet that, as he hadabout Greece, indicated when the subject was last discussed on 22nd February,Turkey and it had been proposed that the parties to the North Atlantic PactIran. should sign a declaration, when the Pact was being signed, toindicate that any armed attack on Greece and Turkey would be amatter of grave concern to them; and the United States Governmentwere anxious that, the declaration should also cover Iran. Therewere arguments for and against the issue of this declaration. It was36822-2 b 2
important to give assurances to Greece, Turkey and Iran that their security remained a matter of major importance; but at the fametime there was a^ danger that the declaration might appear to weaken existing commitments by the United States and this country.It was, in any event, doubtful whether some of the other signatories to the Pact, notably France, would be prepared to sign thedeclaration..The general feeling was that the declaration might be open tothe interpretation that the security of Greece, Turkey and Iran was of less importance than the security of the North Atlantic area, andit might also seem to throw doubt on the vital interests of the UnitedStates and this country in other threatened States, such as austria and Iraq; There was general agreement that the Foreign secretary should discuss the matter further with the United States Governmentto see whether it would not be preferable that the President of. theUnited States and the Foreign Secretary, on the Occasion of the signing of the Pact, should make statements about the vital interestsof the United States and this country in other areas. In speeches ofthis kind it would be easier to get the right balance ana to avoid creating false impressions. Thereafter, it might-be desirable thatthe United States and this country should make some form of generaldeclaration relating to the Middle East, but not in a way whichwould suggest any comparison between the relative importance ofthe Middle East and the North Atlantic area.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to indicate the approvalof the United Kingdom Government to the north atlantic Security Pact and, in due course, to sign the pact.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for statements tobe made in both Houses on the day on which the text ofthe Pact was published, and to issue the text as a white paper.(3) Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should discuss with theUnited States Government the form in which assurancesmight be given to Greece. Turkey and Iran, otherwise than by a declaration signed at the time of signature ofthe North Atlantic Pact.parliamentary business.Business inthe House ofCommons.Prohibition ofFox HuntingBill.2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord President said it had been agreed that, if the Pro-hibition of Fox Hunting Bill was discussed on Friday, 11th March,the Government should recommend its rejection. The position hadto some extent been complicated by the tabling of a motion asking for an inquiry into the law relating to cruelty to wild animals. Therewas some support for this inquiry among members who had not supported the Protection of Animals (Hunting and Coursing Pro-hiMtion) Bill or the Prohibition of Fox Hunting Bill, and he under-stood that the Prohibition of Fox Hunting Bill would be withdrawnif an inquiry were promised.There was general agreement that some aspects of field sportsand of the treatment of wild animals generally merited investigation by a committee.   Its membership would have to be carefully selected.The Cabinet-9 (1) Agreed that the Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland should set up a departmental committee toexamine the law relating to cruelty to wild animals, andthat the Governments intentions should be made knownto the promoters of the Prohibition of Fox Hunting bill and, if necessary, announced in the course of the SecondReading debate on that Bill.
Analgesia inChildbirth Bill.The Lord President drew attention to a motion put down by many members asking the Government to facilitate the passage ofthe Analgesia in Childbirth Bill. The Bill was primarily a piece of propaganda, since the objects would be secured by the Governmentin the ordinary administration of the National Health Service, andthere was objection on general grounds to Private Members&apos; legisla-tion which endeavoured to create priorities in the working-out ofGovernment schemes. Moreover, the Bill would require a moneyresolution, and it had been agreed that Private Members should notbe encouraged to promote Bills which involved expenditure by theState or local authorities.The Minister of Health said that he was satisfied that he could secure, under his existing powers, all the objects which the promoters of the Bill had in mind and could possibly do so by an earlier datethan they had suggested. If further powers were required, theyshould be sought by Government legislation amending the national health Act and not by Private Member&apos;s Bill. If his colleagues agreed, he proposed to make a statement to this effect at an earlydate.The Cabinet-(2) Agreed that facilities should not be afforded for the passageof the Analgesia in Childbirth Bill and that the Ministerof Health should make a statement on the subject at anearly date.parliamentary procedure.Effect of LocalGovernmentAct, 1948.(previous reference:CM. (49) 12thConclusions,Minute 2.)western union.(previous reference:CM. (49) 15thConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Minister of Health said that he had examined, with theLord President and the Treasury, the question whether private members were, under the existing rules of procedure, undulyrestricted in putting down amendments to Bills which, imposed a charge on local authorities. The difficulty had come to notice inconnection with the Landlord and Tenant (Rent Control) Bill, butthat Bill was very exceptional, since it had not required a moneyresolution. In the ordinary way, legislation relating to localauthorities requiring a money resolution was worded in a way which would not prevent a Private Member from putting down an amendment which imposed a charge on local authorities. He pro-posed to make a statement to this effect at the earliest convenientoccasion, which would probably be at the opening of the committee stage of the Housing Bill.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Minister of Health.4. The Cabinet were informed that the Leader of theOpposition had put down a Private Notice Question, for reply that afternoon, asking for information on the Governments intentions in regard to the United Kingdom representation in the consultative assembly of the Council of Europe.It was pointed out that it would not be possible to determine the composition of the United Kingdom Delegation to the Assemblyuntil the Governments concerned had reached final agreement on theconstitution of the Council itself; and a Conference for this purpose would be held in London at the end of March. In these circum-stances, it should be made clear to Mr. Churchill that the Governmentwould not be in a position to make any statement on the question ofUnited Kingdom representation until the constitution of the council had been finally settled.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would reply to thePrivate Notice Question on the lines agreed in discussion.36822-2b 3
5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (CP. (49) 49) recommending that the ration of carcase meatshould be reduced immediately from lOd. to Sd. a week.The Minister of Food said that the meat supply position had further deteriorated since the decision to reduce the ration to lOd.had been taken on 17th January. The monthly rate of imports of meat from Argentina in 1949 had so far barely exceeded 20,000 tons.At the present rate of consumption stocks would fall, by the end ofMarch, well below the minimum working requirement of 45,000 tons.In the circumstances he considered that a further reduction in the ration of carcase meat was now unavoidable. He proposed to main-tain the supplementary allowance of 2d. worth or canned meat forthe present, but the whole position would have to be reviewed before easter in the light of the progress of the Argentine negotiations.For the present, the effects of the proposed reduction would be partially offset by the increased supply of eggs and milk, but therewas a seasonal decline of such supplies in July, and he suggestedthat, for that month, the weekly cheese ration should be increasedby 1 oz. at a cost of $4-8 million.Ministers were agreed that the shortfall in the shipments of argentine meat rendered unavoidable a further temporary reduc-tion in the carcase meat ration.In discussion, the following points were made : (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he could not accept the proposal in CP. (49) 49 for the expenditure of$4-8 million on cheese. An additional $28 million had alreadybeen allocated for the purchase of United States cheese. Ifnecessary, the July ration could be increased by some postponement of the higher ration scale next winter.(&amp;) Ministers thought that any seasonal surplus of milk should,as far as possible, be used for the manufacture of cheese; and theMinister of Food undertook to consider how best to give effect tothe Cabinefs wishes in this matter.(c) The fall in Argentine meat supplies had been largely dueto the policy pursued by Senor Miranda, and a steady improvementmight now be reasonably expected. But recent events had emphasised the dangers of our excessive dependence on. Argentinesupplies, and the need for the vigorous development of alternative sources of supply. It was important that the Ministry of food should explore exhaustively the possibilities of securing additional supplies from Commonwealth and other soft-currency countries; andconstant pressure should be maintained on the Governments con-cerned to develop production for the United Kingdom market.(d) As a result of recent discoveries in the immunisation of cattle against trypahosomiasis, there were hopeful prospects in thelong term of developing tropical Africa as a source of meat supplies.But difficulties regarding the import Of meat from Africa on accountof the risk of disease would still have to be overcome, and theMinistry of Agriculture had not so far been able to agree that suchimportations might be permitted.(e) It was suggested that increased supplies of food and other commodities^might be obtained from countries with which we hadnegotiated bilateral trade agreements, if they would accept help in developing effective procurement machinery. Departments were already collaborating with a number of foreign Governments inprocurement arrangement; but there should be closer attention thanin the past to the arrangements for implementing trade agreements.(/) Attention was drawn in. CP. (49) 49 to the lack of progressin the trade negotiations with the Mexican Government; some addi-tional meat supplies might be expected from this source. TheForeign Secretary undertook to take this up with the MexicanAmbassador in London.
109 CM. 19 (49) . .     72(g) Public opinion would be very critical if the United Kingdom- meat ration should fall below the level of the meat ration in theAnglo-American Zone of Germany. It was also pointed out thatdollar purchases of Argentine meat had recently been made for germany; and the Foreign Secretary undertook to investigate thispoint.The Cabinet next discussed the form and timing of theannouncement of the proposed reduction in the carcase meat ration.It was suggested in CP. (49) 49 that, in order to maintain meatstocks at an adequate level, this reduction should take effect from20th March. It was, however, agreed that, for political reasons,it would be desirable to defer an announcement on this subject untilFriday, 18th March; and the reduction should therefore take effect from 27th March. The terms of the announcement would need careful consideration: it was important that the public should be fully informed of the reasons for the reduction, and in particular of the extent to which Senor Miranda&apos;s personal policy had been responsible for the present situation. It would be advantageous if,at the same time, some information could be given regarding theGovernments long-term policy for the development of alternative sources of supply.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the weekly ration of carcase meat should bereduced from lOd. to 8d., as from 27th March, and thatthe supplementary allowance of 2d. worth of canned meatshould be maintained for the present.(2) Agreed that the decision recorded under Conclusion (1)above should be announced on 18th March, and invited the Minister of Food to consult with the Lord president on the terms of the announcement.(3) Invited the Minister of Food to circulate a paper on theprospects of reducing the United Kingdom&apos;s dependence on Argentine meat supplies by the development of alternative sources of supply.(4) Invited the Foreign Secretary to take up with the MexicanAmbassador in London the lack of progress in thecurrent trade and financial negotiations with the mexican Government and the prospects of securing meatsupplies from Mexico.(5) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to consider,in consultation with the other Ministers concerned, thepossibility of improving the procurement arrangements in countries with which bilateral trade agreements hadbeen concluded.(6) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies and theMinister of Agriculture to submit a report to the PrimeMinister on the restrictions imposed on the import ofcarcase meat from Africa.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (49) 50) covering an abridged version of the basic law (Provisional Constitution) drawn up by the German Parlia-mentary Council at Bonn. They also had before them a further memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (CP. (49) 53) on the Germanelectoral law.The Foreign Secretary recalled that the report of the Six-power conference on Germany (CP. (48) 143) had made provision forthe convening of a Constituent Assembly to draft a constitution for Western Germany; and Annex H of that report had contained the text of a Letter of Advice to the Military Governors setting out certain requirements which that constitution would be expectedGermany.(previous reference:C.M.(48)81stConclusions,Minute 4.)Basic Law.
noto satisfy. The German Parliamentary Council, who had been engaged since September in the preparation of the- Basic Law,had now produced a provisional draft, and he suggested that itshould be approved provided that the amendments already proposedby the three Military Governors, which were set out in Annex Bto CP. (49) 50, were accepted by the Council. He was satisfiedthat,&apos; subject to these amendments, the draft Basic Law gaveadequate effect to the principles laid down by the Six-Power Con-ference; and it had been possible to secure this result withoutimposing undue restrictions on the CounciFs freedom to devise a constitution suited to the national tradition and habits of thought.In discussion of the draft Basic Law, the following points weremade: (a) Some doubt was expressed whether the Military Governors&apos;Statement did not tend to lay too great emphasis on the need forsome reallocation of powers between the Federal Government andthe Lander Governments. There was a risk that any attempt toimpose an excessive measure of decentralisation on western germany might provoke an irredentist reaction which might ultimately endanger the whole constitution. The general view ofMinisters was, however, that the powers of the Federal government under the draft Basic Law were not unduly restricted; and that itwould be necessary to insist on the amendments proposed in the. Military Governors&apos; Statement if the Lander Governments were tobe able to function adequately.(6) Attention was drawn to the stipulation made in the military governors&apos; Statement that the powers contained in Article 118cof the draft Basic Law should not be exercised until specificallyapproved by the Occupation Authorities. Was there not a risk that, by imposing this restriction on the exercise of the powers givento each Land to call in the aid of the police force of another Land,the Occupying Powers might jeopardise the position of the democratic Lander Governments and complicate their own task of preserving internal security? Some delay would inevitably result from an appeal to the Occupation Authorities, and the advantages of speedy action would have been forfeited. Against this, it waspointed out that it was essential to maintain adequate safeguards against the risk of an attempt by the German Federal Governmentto centralise the control of the&quot; police force throughout western germany. Experience in Eastern Europe had shown that acentralised police force could constitute a dangerous threat to a democratic Government; and neither the United States nor theFrench Government would, for this reason, be prepared to withdraw the stipulation put forward in the Military Governors&apos; Statement.(c) The Cabinet were informed that some difficulty had been encountered in persuading the German Parliamentary Council tomake provision in the draft Basic Law for the independence ofthe Judiciary. In this connection it was pointed out that experienceelsewhere had shown that the Executive was sometimes disposed toattempt to exercise some control over the Judiciary in countries where the latter had the responsibility of interpreting theconstitution.(d) Attention was drawn to the provisions of Article 129-1 ofthe draft Basic Law under which a Federal judge might be removedfor infringing the principles of the Basic Law. This provisionneeded some elucidation, and it was noted that the military governors had themselves drawn attention to the point in their statement.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendations made in CP. (49) 50.Electoral Law. The Cabinet next discussed the recommendations made in cp. (49) 53 on the question of the electoral laws for western germany.
The Foreign Secretary said that the German Parliamentary-Council had also prepared a draft electoral law for the three western Zones of Germany. The enactment of electoral legislation was, however, a matter for the Landtage, and the ParliamentaryCouncil&apos;s action in drafting a law on this, subject was thereforeultra vires. The Military Governors had informed the Council tothis effect; but they had indicated that it would be open to thevarious Ministers-President and Landtage to. base their legislation on the Council&apos;s draft. This draft made provision for a systemof proportional representation and, if it was strictly adhered to,there was ix risk that the new German constitution would reproducethe central weakness of the Weimar constitution. He was hopeful,however, that some at least of the individual Landtage would adopta system closer to direct election; and he thought that, for thisreason, it would not be advisable to attempt to secure complete uni-f ormity between the electoral arrangements adopted in the individualLander.There was general support for the recommendations in cp. (49) 53. The hope was expressed that in some Lander pro-portional representation would not be adopted and reliance placed-on single-member territorial constituencies. Even if there wereproportional representation and lists of candidates, it might bepossible to discourage the creation of splinter parties by requiringeach party to make some deposit, which would be forfeited if itfailed to obtain a minimum number of votes.The Cabinet-(2) Approved the recommendations made in CP. (49) 53.Cabinet Offuse, S.W. 1,10th March, 1949.
