Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed that on 25th March Mr. E. P.Business in Smith, M.P., would move the Second Reading of the Censorship ofthe House of Plays (Repeal) Bill. This Bill would have the effect of abolishing the commons. existing system of censorship by the Lord Chamberlain, and wouldprovide that any person proposing to bring proceedings in respectof a play should first obtain leave to do so from a Judge in Chambers.A motion for the rejection of the Bill had been tabled. discussion in the Legislation Committee had disclosed some division of opinion between Ministers on the attitude which the Government should taketowards the Bill. Some Ministers had thought that the House ofCommons should be advised to reject it; but others had been un-willing that the Goverment spokesman should defend the existing system of censorship and the Home Secretary, within whose depart-mental jurisdiction the subject fell, was opposed to censorship inprinciple.In discussion, it was pointed out that the existing system for the censorship of plays, although it had been responsible for some seriouserrors of judgment in the past, had not in recent years given riseto any volume of public criticism; and in these circumstances it wouldbe inexpedient for the Government to involve themselves in un-necessary controversy over this issue. It should be possible for theHome Secretary, without discussing the general principles of censor-ship, to advise the House to reject this particular Bill on accountof detailed defects in its structure. Thus, the proposed requirement that aii order should be obtained from a Judge in Chambers beforeproceedings could be commenced would have the effect of givinggratuitous publicity to an undesirable play during the interval before a prosecution was successfully completed.The. Cabinet-(1) Invited the Home Secretary to advise the House of commons to reject the Censorship of Plays (Repeal) Bill on thebasis of the detailed defects in the structure of the Bill.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.Business in The Cabinet were informed that Lord Mancroft was that day the House of moving in the House of Lords a Marriage (Enabling) Bill designedLords. to make lawful, with certain exceptions, marriage with a divorcedwife&apos;s sister and analogous marriages. Although this Bill would command considerable measure of support, its proposals were con-controversial. Meanwhile, in the House of Commons the promoters ofthe Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill were being urged by the Government to avoid enlarging the scope of that Bill so as toinclude controversial proposals. In these circumstances the lord privy Seal proposed that the House of Lords should be urged not togive a Second Reading to the Marriage (Enabling) Bill on theground that the Government would not be able to find time for thediscussion of such controversial legislation by the House of Commons.The Cabinet-(2) Agreed that the House of Lords should be advised not togive a Second Reading to the Marriage (Enabling) Billon the grounds indicated by the Lord Privy Seal.The film industry.(previous reference:CM. (47) 69thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade (CP. (49) 66) tracing the history of the film-production industry in this country since the end of the war,indicating the main causes which had contributed to the presentreduction in the production of films, and setting out the measureswhich were being taken to put the industry on a more stable footing.36824-1b 2
The President of the Board of Trade said that he proposed toreduce from 45 per cent, to 40 per cent, the quota under the Ginema-tograph Films Act for British first-feature films shown in thiscountry. The industry had failed to take advantage of the oppor^tunity afforded by the higher quota, but he was satisfied that therewas a greater margin of production over the lower quota require-ments than there had been over last year&apos;s quota requirements,though some small cinemas might have difficulty in fulfilling the quota requirements and legislation might at some stage be requiredto relax in some respects the provisions of the Act. Under presentconditions the aim should be to build up a healthy film-producingindustry rather than to prevent unemployment. The industry was over-staffed at present and undesirable restrictive practices were sup-ported both by employers and workers. A working party under thechairmanship of Sir George Gater was examining film-production costs; and the opportunity should be taken to ensure that the indusrty was purged of its extravagant tendencies. It was unlikely that the rank organisation would continue to occupy the predominantposition in the industry which it had recently held, and its programme had fallen from sixty films a year to twenty-five films of low average cost. Much now depended on the initiative shown byother producers and, in that connection, the National Film FinanceCompany, shortly to be replaced by the National Film finance corporation, was doing good work in assisting new producers.In discussion, the following points were made  (a) Would it assist independent producers if the government took an active part in ensuring that they could secure studio spaceat reasonable charges? The Gater Committee had some time agoexamined the question of studio space and had come to the conclusionthat action by the Government was not necessary. At thattime, however, the Rank organisation was using most of the two-thirds of the studio space which it owned, and the remaining one-third was sufficient for the needs of the independent producers. now the Rank organisation was only using half the studio space in itspossession and was likely to charge large rentals to any producerwho wished to use the unoccupied space. It had been suggested thatthe State might requisition one or two studios and hire them at reasonable rents to producers, though the legal basis for this aptipnwould have to be carefully examined. Alternatively, the Govern-ment might buy existing studio space or construct new studios, withthe object of getting some measure of control over the industry andfacilitating the work of the independent producer.(6) The distribution of films presented a greater problem to theindependent producer than the securing of finance or the hiring ofstudio space. A departmental committee under the chairmanship of Lord Portal of Laverstoke was examining the present structure of the industry and the relationship between producers, renters andexhibitors.(c) The arrangements for showing British films abroad pre-sented various unsatisfactory features. The methods adopted bythe Rank organisation for securing a substantial share of the UnitedStates market had not proved successful and it was suggested thatthe Italian film industry, with much smaller material resources at its disposal, had been relatively more successful in the United States.Moreover, the British film industry, from whatever causes, was.;failing adequately to support the efforts of the British Council andother similar organisations in building up British prestige abroad.The link between the film industry and organisations such as theBritish Council did not appear to be sufficiently-strong.(d) Unlike the companies responsible for producing featurefilms, the companies producing documentary films and the CrownFilm Unit had been very successful in producing satisfactory filmswhich now played a considerable part in the educational system ofthis country.
(e) At some stage there should be a general investigation ofthe relationship which should exist between the State and the film industry, With a view to devising measiires by which the State couldexercise any necessary control and give the required support to theindustry.The Cabinet-(1) Took note Of CP. (49) 66.(2) Invited the President Of the Board of Trade, on receipt ofthe report of the Portal Committee on the structure of.the film industry,&apos; to submit a full factual report on theindustry to the Cabinet, with recommendations on theaction which the Government should take to increasethe efficiency of the &quot;industry and to secure any necessarymeasure of control.U.N.S.3.G.G.Report onThird general conference.(previous reference:CM. (48) 11thConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofEducation (CP. (49) 69) covering a report by the United kingdom delegation to the Third General Conference of the United nations educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation and proposing that the report should be published as a Command Paper.The Minister of Education said that, in the light of the views expressed by the Cabinet on 5th February, 1948, when they con-sidered a report on. the Second General Conference, the UnitedKingdom Delegation at the Third General Conference had endeavoured, with a considerable measure of success, to secure thatthe organisation did not spread its activities as widely as hitherto,but concentrated on a relatively limited number of practical pro-jects. Steps had also been taken to increase the efficiency of the secretariat and to prevent its further growth. Agreement had been secured that a full Conference should be held every second year, andthat the Conference in 1950 would be a small business meeting inParis.In discussion, Ministers, while expressing appreciation of thework done by the United Kingdom Delegation, took the view thatthis organisation still tended to spread its work into fields whereit could not, in present circumstances, make an effective practicalcontribution. There was always a danger that organisations of thiskind would attempt to cover too wide a field, and there should bemore effective machinery under the aegis of the United Nations forco-ordinating the activities of the specialised agencies. Admittedly,the unco-operative attitude of the Soviet Government and theirassociates had made it difficult to secure this; but it was understoodthat a co-ordinating committee, consisting of chairmen of specialised agencies and members of the United Nations Secretariat, had recently been set up, and this committee should be encouraged todo what was practicable to curb specialised agencies whichendeavoured to cover too wide a field. Otherwise, the specialised agencies would continue to make claims on the time and energiesof experts who, under present world conditions, would be betteremployed on their regular duties.Ministers approved the proposal to hold full conferences lessfrequently than once a year, and pointed out that the small con-ference in Paris should require a much smaller British Delegationthan had attended the Third General Conference at Beirut.An endeavour should be made to secure a more uniform policyin regard to the publication of documents relating to the united nations and the specialised agencies. The publication of a reportby the United Kingdom Delegation was an unusual procedure.Having started, the practice in this field, however, it might bedifficult to break it and the balance of advantage probably lay in publishing the report as a Command Paper rather than simply as aStationery Office publication.
The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Minister of Education to publish the reportof the United Kingdom Delegation to the Third general conference of U.N.E.S.C.O. as a Command Paper.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to examine the arrangementsfor publishing documents connected with the united nations and specialised agencies, with a view to con-Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,24th March, 1949.
