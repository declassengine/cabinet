Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in     the House of Commons in the following week,the House ofCommons.Tribunals of inquiry(Evidence)Act, 1921.Inquiry intoAllegationsagainstMinisters and officials of theBoard ofTrade, &amp;c.(previous reference erence:CM. (49) 6thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Cabinet were informed that the House of commons would debate the Report of the Lynskey Tribunal on 3rd February,on a Motion that the Report be accepted. The Prime Minister wouldmove this Motion and the Lord President would reply to the debate.The Prime Minister said that Mr. Belcher would presumablywish to make a personal statement in the course of this debate. Itwas to be hoped that he would then announce that he was resigninghis seat. If he were unwilling to do so, there were precedents whichhe could cite, e.g., that of Mr. R. J. G. Boothby; but the attitude ofthe House of Commons in such matters had recently become morestrict, as was evidenced by the expulsion of Mr. Garry Allighan.If Mr. Belcher did not resign, a motion for his expulsion mightwell be tabled, and the Government would find it very difficult toadvise the House to reject such a motion. He therefore had it inmind to see Mr. Belcher and advise him to resign his seat.There was general agreement with the line which the PrimeMinister proposed to take. While it might be said that the matter should be left to Mr. Belcher&apos;s constituents, and while the Houseof Commons should obviously consider with great care the grounds on which it expelled a Member, there was a strong feeling among government supporters in the House of Commons that Mr. Belchershould resign and, if he failed to do so, many Members would support a motion for his expulsion.The Cabinet-(1) Approved   the   Prime   Ministers   proposal   to   adviseMr. Belcher to resign his seat.The Prime Minister said that in the proceedings before theTribunal reference had been made to the activities of agents, someof whom had previously been employed in Government service, whooffered to act as intermediaries between business firms and Govern-ment Departments in such matters as applications for licences,permits, &amp;c. Some newspapers had commented unfavourably on this development; and it seemed desirable that further inquiries shouldbe made to ascertain whether such activities were liable to giverise to abuses. He suggested that a small Committee should beappointed to make a report on this question. If the cabinet approved this suggestion, he would announce in the debate that suchan inquiry was to be held.After discussion it was agreed that such a Committee should beappointed. It was thought important, however, that its terms ofreference should not refer specifically to applications for licences orpermits, since this might invite the criticism that these agents hadbeen called into existence by the complexity of the economic controls.The terms of reference should also be so drawn as to confine the inquiry to agents who offered these services for payment.The Cabinet-(2) Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for the appointmentof a Committee to consider how far persons were offeringtheir services, for payment, as intermediaries between government Departments and the public and to report whether such activities were liable to give rise to abuses.The Prime Minister also suggested that further consideration might be given to the procedures adopted in handling applicationsor representations made personally to Ministers or senior officials.The Tribunal had drawn attention to this point in paragraph 336 of
their Report but had expressed no views upon it. This was admit-tedly a difficult question. On the one hand, Departments shouldhandle expeditiously representations made to Ministers by Membersof Parliament; and the attention which a Minister gave to mattersbrought to his personal notice by Members of Parliament or friendssometimes led him to make alterations in policy or procedure whichmight not otherwise have been made. On the other nand, there was some danger that a Minister&apos;s personal interest might cause con-cessions to be made which would not have been granted on anapplication addressed to the Department in the ordinary course.This was largely a question of Civil Service procedure, which could appropriately be examined by a small body of senior officials whoserecommendations would be submitted for the approval of Ministers.It might be desirable to announce in the debate that this aspect of departmental procedure was being looked into, but the inquiry should be regarded as domestic to the Civil Service and no under-taking should be given that its findings would be made public.In discussion emphasis was laid on the fact that Ministers wereoften able to obtain from personal friends and acquaintancesinformation which their official advisers were unable to provide.It was most important that nothing should be said which mightimpair the value of these personal contacts or reduce the information which Ministers obtained from them. Nor should anything be said which might imply that personal contacts between Ministers orofficials and business men were to be regarded with suspicion: theywere in fact essential to the efficient conduct of public business.The Prime Minister said that he had no intention of sayinganything which might imply any limitation of the proper discretionexercised by Ministers in such matters. The inquiry which he had proposed would relate primarily to Departmental procedures.The Cabinet-(3) Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for the appointmentof a small Committee of senior officials to review, andreport to Ministers upon, the procedures for handlingapplications or representations made personally to ministers or senior officials.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,27th January, 1949.
