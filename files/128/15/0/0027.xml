Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.1*3London DoeliStrike.(previous reference;CJl.(48,)4SthConclusions,Minute 1.)36962-2.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda-(i) by the Minister of Labour (CP. (49) 89) setting out theposition regarding the strike in the Port of London whichhad been called by the Executive of the National Amal-gamated Stevedores and Dockers and joined by some-6,000 members of the Transport and General Workers&apos;Union;(ii) by the Home Secretary (CP. (49) 88) reporting the recom-mendations of a meeting of the Emergencies Committeewhich had been held to consider what action the Govern-ment should take in connection with the strike.The Cabinet were informed that this was an official strike, since it had been called by the Executive of the National AmalgamatedjStevedores ,and Dockers, but it was illegal because the procedure laiddown in the Conditions of Employment and National ArbitrationOrder had not been followed. The National Amalgamated Stevedoresand Dockers were under Communist influence. Apart from their political motives, the Executive of the Union were also hostile tothe Transport and General Workers&apos; Union and were quite ready to welcome the ending .pf the de-casua!is,ation scheme in the london docks, since they were confident that stevedores would be assured of regular employment even if the system of casual employment wererestored in the docks. The organisers of the strike, who aimed atdislocating essential services and impeding the delivery of marshall aid, hoped to bring about strikes in other ports and to keep the stoppage going for at least eight weeks. Their efforts to extend thestrike to Glasgow had failed, but it was believed that delegateswould shortly be sent to all the principal ports to secure a nation-wide stoppage. It was probable, however, that these efforts wouldbe unsuccessful.The Transport and General Workers&apos; Union were strongly opposed to the strike and could be relied upon to bring pressure onsuch of its members as had gone out on strike in sympathy with thestevedores. The Union had agreed to suspend for the time beingthe continuity rule, under which the same gang completed a jobwhich it had started, so that members of the Union would beavailable to make up fresh gangs where gangs were depleted throughthe absence of stevedores on strike. Notwithstanding a recommenda-tion by the Executive of the Lightermen&apos;s Union that they should join the strike, a mass meeting of London lightermen had on theprevious evening voted against strike action.The Cabinet endorsed the recommendation of the emergencies committee that arrangements should be made for Service men andtransport to begin work in the Port of London on the morning ofWednesday, 20th April, if &quot;the strike had not been settled in themeantime, and agreed that this decision should be announcedforthwith.Ministers then.considered what steps should be taken to induce the members of the Stevedores&apos; Union and of the Transport and-1 b 2. 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the week immediately following the easter recess.The Cabinet discussed the line which the Government shouldtake in the discussion that afternoon of the motion-fey Mr. QuintinHogg, M;P., relating to the conduct of the Chairman of Ways and means in handling the situation which had arisen in the House ofCommons on 5th April in the debate on the meat situation. Itwas agreed that the Prime Minister should speak on behalf of theGovernment and should advise the House to reject this motion.
General Workers&apos; Union who had supported them to return to work.There was general agreement that the Minister of Labour shouldbroadcast that evening, drawing attention to the flimsy grounds forthe strike, to the political motives of the organisers, to its seriousnational consequences and to its illegal character. Attention might also be drawn to the danger that a continuance of the strike might lead to the abandonment of the de-casualisation scheme, to which theordinary dock worker attached importance.The Emergencies Committee had considered whether legal pro-ceedings should be taken against the strikers or their organisers.They had been inclined to favour civil proceedings being brought by the National Dock Labour Board as the employer of the menconcerned, but they had asked the Attorney-General to examinethe position. The Attorney-General said that he did not think itwas practicable to contemplate proceedings, either civil or criminal,against the general mass of the strikers. It would, however, be practicable for the National Dock Labour Board to take civil pro-ceedings against individual strike leaders, if it could be shown thatthey were continuing to incite the men to break their contract ofservice. Alternatively, an attempt might perhaps be made to secure an injunction to prevent the Stevedores&apos; Union from giving strikepay in respect of an illegal strike. A third possibility was thatthe Attorney-General himself should seek an injunction &quot;againstindividual strike leaders on the ground that their action was causinginjury to the public interest. On the whole, he was doubtful aboutthe value of civil proceedings, unless it was thought that a decision by a court that the strike was illegal might impress the strikers andinduce them-to return to work. If proceedings were to be taken,he favoured summary criminal proceedings under the defence regulations for counselling and procuring a breach of theConditions of Employment and National Arbitration Order, 1940.He assumed that it would be possible to collect evidence showing that individual strike leaders had incited their members to break theOrder. A charge of criminal conspiracy, which would be taken onindictment, would be more difficult to sustain. The decision whether to take criminal proceedings would rest with him; but he would welcome an expression of view by Ministers on the question whetherthe prosecution of the leaders would be likely to stiffen or to weaken the resolution of the strikers.In discussion it was pointed out that the action of the lighter-men in refusing to come out on strike, and the failure of dock workersin other ports to come out in sympathy, might help to bring about an early collapse of the strike, which would discredit its organisersin the eyes of the members of their Union. If prosecutions were launched at that juncture, they might have the effect of stiffeningthe attitude of the rank and file. At the same time, the Governmentcould not appear to condone illegal action by a Trade Union. Itwould be more difficult to prosecute in any later case if proceedings were not taken in this case where the breach of the law had beenWanton and so clearly based on political motives. There was generalagreement that it would be undesirable to express a final view onthe desirability of a prosecution at that juncture; but it shouldbe stated publicly that the question of taking proceedings was beinglooked into. Material should be collected so that, if the strikecontinued, the way.would be clear to launch prosecutions about thetime when military assistance was brought into the docks.Attention was drawn to the need for a clear understanding withthe National Dock Labour Board about the manner in which thestrike should be ended, if the strikers began to drift back to work.It would probably be impracticable to exclude the stevedores from work, but regard should be paid to the fact that on several occasionsin the past illegal strikers had been able to secure undeserved benefits from their action.
There was general agreement with the view of the emergencies committee that there should be a thorough investigation into the underlying causes of the recurring labour trouble at London Docks,and that means should be devised to bring the unrest to an end.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Minister of Defence should arrange to moveService men and transport into London Docks onWednesday, 20th April, if the strike had not been settledbefore then^ and that an announcement to this effect should be made forthwith.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour to make arrangements withthe Transport and General Workers&apos; Union to facilitate the Unloading before next week of the banana boat inLondon Docks.(3) Agreed that the Minister of Labour should broadcast later that day an appeal to the strikers to return to work.(4) Took note that the Attorney-General Would arrange for theDirector of Public Prosecutions to collect evidence^ sothat, if the Attorney-General decided to prosecutecertain strike leaders, proceedings could be institutedwithout delay.(5) Advised the Attorney-General that a prosecution at thepresent juncture might stiffen the determination of the strikers, but that Ministers would probably take adifferent view when Service men and transport had been moved into the docks.(6) Invited the Minister of Labour to ascertain the intentions of the National Dock Labour Board in regard to theterms on which strikers would be allowed to return towork.(7) Agreed that, when this strike was over, the Minister ofLabour should initiate an investigation into the under-lying causes of the unrest in the London Docks and themeans by which it might be remedied.Pood.Meat Ration.(previous reference:CM. (49) 20th&apos; Conclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the&apos; Ministerof Food (CP. (49) 84) on meat supplies.The Minister of Food said1 that it should be possible to maintainthe existing ration&apos; of carcase meat until the end of May by supplies from home production and from countries other than the Argentine;but imports of an additional 30,000 tons would be needed in Mayand June if a further reduction at the end of May was to be avoided.Since CP. (49) 84 had been circulated, there had been some improve-ment in the Argentine situation : in Buenos Aires about 8,500 tonsof meat had been loaded, though not shipped, this month. Negotia-tions were still proceeding for the purchase of United States frozenpork out of Economic Co-operation Administration funds. Hewould circulate a further report after Easter, when it would benecessary to decide whether the weekly issue of two pennyworth ofcorned meat should be continued.In discussion, the following further points were made : (a) Information had now been received that the mexican government would be prepared to consider the sale of Mexican meat for sterling.(b) The Prime Minister of Australia had been informed that united Kingdom Ministers would wish to take the opportunity ofhis visit to London to discuss plans for developing Australian meatproduction; and the hope was expressed that it might be found

The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister-of Labour (CP. (49) 80 and 81) on the action to be taken by the-United Kingdom Government on the Convention and Recommenda-tion concerning the organisation of the employment service, and on.the Convention concerning Freedom of Association and the Rightto Organise, which had been adopted at the International LabourConference in 1948.In a preliminary discussion, some anxiety was expressed at thepossible consequences of ratifying the Convention on Freedom offAssociation and the Right to Organise.  This Convention had been drafted in very, general terms, and it might be found that it undulyrestricted the Governments freedom of action in dealing with illegalstrikes inspired by political, rather than industrial, objectives.Ministers also thought that it would be inadvisable to -communicate-to the Director-General of the International Labour Office a detailedexplanation, as suggested in Annex B to CP. (49) 81, of the reasons^for excluding Northern Ireland from the scope of the ratification-,by His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume consideration of CP.
