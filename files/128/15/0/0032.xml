Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in     the House of Commons in the following week.the House of When the Third Reading of the Iron and Steel Bill was takenCommons. on 9th May, the debate would be opened by the parliamentary secretary, Ministry of Supply (Mr. J. H. Jones, M.P.), and theMinister of Supply would reply to the debate.On the Second Reading of the Ireland Bill on 11th May theGovernment spokesmen would be the Prime Minister and the lord president. The Attorney-General would also speak if legal points were raised on which a Government reply was required. The HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relationswould speak for the Government on the Committee and remaining stages of this Bill.The Cabinet approved the terms of the motion welcoming theNorth Atlantic Treaty, which the House of Commons would beinvited to pass on 12th May. The Foreign Secretary would open thatdebate; and the concluding speech on behalf of the Governmentwould be made, according to the course of the debate, either by thePrime Minister or by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of StatefOr Foreign Affairs.Business in The Cabinet were informed that the House of Lords proposed tothe House of devote two days to the debate on the Second Reading of the Iron andLords. Steel Bill.  It now seemed likely that the Opposition would not seek to reject this Bill on Second Reading.The Cabinet agreed that, subject to consideration of the precedents by the Chief Whip, it should not be necessary for theHouse of Lords to pass a formal motion approving the north atlantic Treaty.China.Despatch ofReinforcementsto Hong Kong.(previous reference:CM. (49) 30thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister(CP. (49) 100) covering an appreciation by the Chiefs of Staff of theextent of the threat which was likely to develop against Hong kong and of the forces which would be required to meet that threat.In discussion the following points were made : (a) The Chiefs of Staff had set out the reinforcements whichwould be required to deal with any internal unrest or sporadicguerilla attacks, and they had indicated further reinforcementswhich would be required if a large-scale Communist threatdeveloped. In making these appreciations they had it in mind that,although the Communist armies in China were greatly superior toformer Chinese armies, they were not likely to constitute a threat of the kind which would develop if a major Power, such as Russia,attacked the Colony.(6) The British community in Hong Kong felt great uncertainty about the Governmenfs ultimate intentions in regard to the colony and the morale of the Chinese in Hong Kong was low. In thesecircumstances the Governor of Hong Kong and the Commissioner-General for South-East Asia had both urged that the Governmentshould go as far as practicable in the direction of declaring their intention to maintain Hong Kong as a British Colony. Any sugges-tion that the United Kingdom Government might abandon HongKong would have profound repercussions in Malaya, Siam and burma.(c) Ministers felt, however, that they could not ignore the advicethey had received that Hong Kong could not be held against attack by a major Power operating from the mainland. The government must be careful to avoid drifting into a position in which, afterpouring valuable resources into Hong Kong, they had at the end towithdraw with great material loss and loss of prestige. The aim37011-3 B 2
should be to reinforce the defences of the Colony for the purpose of protecting it against present dangers, but to avoid giving explicitlong-term commitments which the Government might be unable to fulfil. From this point of view it was important that ministers should keep under close and continuous review any developments ofthe situation in Hong Kong and Southern China.(d) Other Commonwealth coutries had been kept in touch withthe development of United Kingdom policy in the Far East andwould be informed of the decision to reinforce the garrison of hong Kong. There would, however, be no advantage in attemptingat this stage to induce Australia, or. New Zealand to assist in thedefence of Hong Kong. Nor would it be wise to stress in any public statement our consultations with other Commonwealth Governments,since this might be open to the misinterpretation that we were preparing for serious consequences. The United States Governmentwere being kept generally in touch with developments in Hong Kongbut could not be associated with specific decisions relating to troop movements.((?) In the public statement about the reinforcement of the hong Kong garrison, the balance of advantage was in favour ofgiving fairly specific information about.the nature of the reinforce-ments which were being despatched. This information wouldreassure those who might be inclined to underestimate the force which was being sent, and would at the same time indicate that therewas no question of sending forces on the scale required for operations on the mainland.(/) The decision that newly-recruited National Service men should not normally be included in drafts sent to the Far East wouldmean that some of the reinforcements sent to Hong Kong might be slightly below strength.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to send to Hong Kong as early as possible theremainder of the brigade group whose despatch had beenapproved in principle by the Cabinet on 28th April, 1949.(2) Agreed to augment the fighter squadron which was being sent to Hong Kong from 8 to 16 aircraft, and to collectand arm additional local patrol craft.(3) Instructed the Chiefs of Staff to report from time to time on military developments in South-East Asia, withparticular reference to the scale of the threat to HongKong, and to consider how additional reinforcementscould be provided if a large-scale Communist threat to hong Kong developed.(4) Agreed that the Minister of Defence should announce that day in the House of Commons that the garrison of HongKong was being reinforced and should give an indication of the nature of the reinforcements that were being sent.3. The Lord President asked whether the Cabinet consideredthat Parliamentary time should be made available for the discussionof a motion which had been tabled in the House of Commons byMr. C. N. Shawcross, M.P., . and others, suggesting that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should propose to interested european governments the institution of a joint examination of the project for constructing a tunnel under the English Channel.It was the view of the Cabinet that the proposers of this motion should be informed that it was not practicable to find parliamentary time for a debate on this subject. Before any question arose of undertaking joint discussions with European Governments, HisMajesty&apos;s Government should first take steps to define their ownattitude towards this project.
The Cabinet--(1) Agreed that no facilities should be afforded for Parlia-mentary discussion of the motion tabled by Mr. C. N.Shawcross, M.P., and others.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would take steps toappoint a suitable Committee to consider the strategic,economic and social aspects of the project for the con-struction of a Channel Tunnel and would arrange for theCommittee&apos;s findings to be brought before the Cabinet.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordChancellor (CP. (49) 97) reporting the results of his special enquiry into the question whether Field-Marshal von Rundstedt and Colonel-General Strauss were physically fit to stand the strain of a war-crimes trial.The Lord Chancellor said that he had examined the medicalwitnesses in consultation with the Attorney-General and ProfessorSir Henry Cohen, Professor of Medicine at Liverpool University.Their unanimous conclusion was that Field-Marshal yon Rundstedtand Colonel-General Strauss were unfit to stand trial. For thereasons set out in CP. (49) 90 he thought that the Governmentshould themselves assume the responsibility for deciding this issue;and he recommended that in the debate on war crimes policy in tbeHouse of Lords that afternoon he should announce that the Govern-ment had decided that these two Generals were not physically fit tobe put on trial. He thought it would be advisable to make it clearthat this decision had been reached on the strength of a report whichhe had made to the Cabinet in which the Attorney-General and professor Cohen had concurred. He proposed to indicate at thesame time that the indictment against Field-Marshal von Mansteinwould be served in the near future.The Cabinet accepted the Lord Chancellors recommendations.In further discussion, the following points were made : (a) These officers should now be released from custody. It was recognised that there would then be no means of preventing them from giving evidence for the defence in the trial of Field-Marshalvan Manstein.- (6) There would be no advantage in publishing the indictmentagainst von Rundstedt and Strauss. If he was asked why they hadbeen detained for so long, the Lord Chancellor might repeat thestatement which he had already made in the House of Lords aboutthe general nature of the case against von Rundstedt.The Cabinet^-(1) Agreed that in view of their physical condition Field-Marshal von Rundstedt and Colonel-General Straussshould not be put on trial and should be releasedforthwith.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to announce this decision inthe debate in the House of Lords that afternoon on war crimes policy.General Policy. The Cabinet were informed that the proposals regarding war crimes policy set out in CP. (49) 94 had now been discussed withthe ,United States and French Governments. They had beenaccepted subject to two points: (i) we had accepted the UnitedStates view that, in the case of crimes against humanity involving an allied or United Nations victim, the accused should be tried by german courts only; and (ii) we had agreed with the United StatesGovernment that, in order to meet the views of the French Govern-ment, extradition should continue provided that it was limited toWar Crimes.Trial ofGermanGenerals inBritishCustody.(previous reference:C.M.(49)30thConclusions,Minute 3.)
exceptional cases. In practice this would mean that extraditionwould only take place where there were prima facie grounds for a charge of murder and good reason could be shown for failure toapply for extradition before 1st September, 1949.The Cabinet^-(3) Endorsed the proposals in CP. (49) 94, subject to amend-ment on the two points noted above, and agreed that theyshould be announced in the debate in the House of Lordsthat afternoon.Western 5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordUnion. President (CP. (49) 98) submitting recommendations regarding the(Previous basis of British representation on the Consultative Assembly of the reference:      Council of Europe.CM. (49) 3lst This proposed that, for the first meeting of the Assembly,Conclusions, British representation should be divided between the politicalMinute l.)&apos;    parties in proportion to their strength in the House of Commons.Most of the representatives should be drawn from the House ofCommons, but it should be open to the Government to include in theBritish Delegation suitable members of the House of Lords.Persons who were not in either House of Parliament should not be nominated, nor would members of either of the Houses of Parliamentof Northern Ireland be eligible. It was suggested that all theBritish representatives should be formally appointed by the PrimeMinister, but that in practice he should not question the nominationsmade by the Opposition. The question whether Ministers shouldbe included among the Government representatives should be leftover until the Opposition list of nominations had been received. Itshould be publicly stated that the Government would not regardparties which are anti-democratic or opposed to the objects of western Union as eligible for inclusion in the british representation.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendations in CP. (49) 98 regardingthe basis of British representation in the consultative assembly of the Council of Europe; and took note that,in the general statement to be made in the House ofCommons that day regarding the Statute of the Council. of Europe, it would be made clear that the opposition parties would be represented in the British delegation to the Consultative Assembly.The Foreign Secretary handed round copies of the final text ofthe Statute of the Council of Europe. He explained that this met allthe points in which the Cabinet had shown special interest. TheStatute was to be signed at 3 p.m. that day.The Cabinet (2) Took note with approval of the final text of the Statute ofthe Council of Europe.Germany. 6.   The Foreign Secretary said that final agreement had now(Previous been reached, on behalf of the Governments of France, Russia, the reference- United Kingdom and the United States, on the conditions which M (4913lst were to govern the raising of the blockade on Berlin.

Foreign Affairs. 7. The Prime Minister said that in the last few weeks theyhad been able to welcome the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty,the adoption of a constitution for the Council of Europe and thelifting of the blockade on Berlin. These three events marked thesuccessful termination of many months of skilful and patient nego-negotiation by the Foreign Secretary; and he felt sure that his colleagues would wish to express their gratification at the success which hadcrowned the Foreign Secretary&apos;s efforts.The Cabinet Warmly endorsed the Prime Ministers remarks.Wages Policy.Police Pay.(Previous&quot;Eef erence:C.M.(49)16thConclusions,Minute 5.)8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (49) 96)recommending that effect should be given to the recommendations inthe first report of Lord Oaksey&apos;s Committee on Police Conditionsof Service.The Home Secretary said that the problem of maintaining acontented and efficient Police force had been causing him. great anxiety. In&apos; England and Wales recruitment for the police was good, but there was great difficulty in retaining in the force asufficient number of trained and experienced men. The increases in pay recommended by the Oaksey Committee were less than hehad expected, and he thought they were the minimum amounts whichwould bring contentment among the police. There was a special responsibility on the Government to see that the police were fairlytreated, since they could not form trade unions and had noorganisation by which they could make effective their views on conditions of service. He had ascertained that the Chancellor of theExchequer had no objection to the main body of the recommenda-tions, but had expressed doubts about a recommendation regardingwidows&apos; pensions and about the date on which the increases in chief constables&apos; pay should become effective. The Home secretary thought it important, however, that the Government should acceptthe report as a whole since, if they rejected some of the recommenda-tions, the police would be entitled to -question others, such as theproposal that pensions should be calculated on an. average of pay for the last three years.The Cabinet were informed that the Chancellor of theExchequer was concerned about the substantial increase in the costof the police service which the adoption of the Committee&apos;s recom-mendations would entail, but he realised the need to bring the police forces up to strength and hoped it would be possible to regard policepay as something exceptional which would not constitute a precedent for other State employees. In this connection it was pointed outthat it would not be possible for the Minister of Education toprevent the Burnham Committee, in their reassessment of teachers&apos;salaries, from having regard to increases which were granted to theof Foreign Ministers would be held in Paris to consider questions relating to Germany and problems arising out of the situation inBerlin, including the question of currency in Berlin.The Cabinets(1) Agreed that the ending of the blockade on Berlin should be formally announced to the House of Commons by theForeign Secretary that afternoon.(2) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would arrange thatat the appropriate moment a suitable message should besent to all who had been responsible for the British partin the air-lift to Berlin expressing the Government^appreciation of the skill and efficiency with which their work had been carried out.
police. Moreover, there would probably be pressure on behalf ofthe Services for the appointment of an outside committee to examineService pay in the belief that the outcome of an enquiry of this kind would be favourable to the Services. It was also pointed out thatthe various allowances given to police officers substantially increased their total emoluments thus, the schedules of pay annexed to cp. (49) 96 showed the starting pay of a constable under the Oakseyscales as  330 a year, whereas, in fact, he would be receiving the equivalent of  480. The general view was, however, that in the exceptional circumstances of the police service and the time whichhad passed since their present scales were fixed, it was desirable togive effect to the main increases proposed by the Oaksey Committee.The Cabinet then discussed whether the particular recommenda-tion relating to widows&apos; pensions should be accepted. At presentthe pension payable to the widow of a police officer varied between 30 and  50 according to his rank, and the Oaksey Committee had recommended pensions from  50 to  70. They had gone on to saythat some further increases would probably be required later, andthat these should be met in part by increased contributions frompolice officers. At present police officers made a small contributionto their various pension schemes, and they had pressed for the grantof an increase in widows&apos; pensions without any corresponding increase in their contributions. The general policy, applied to CivilServants and to industrial workers in respect of schemes supple-mentary to National Insurance pensions, was that about half of thecost should be recovered from contributions. On this basis, aconstable would contribute about 6rf. a week. In view of the undesirability of making exceptions to the general acceptance.of therecommendations of the Oaksey Committee, the general feeling among Ministers was that the Committee&apos;s recommendations shouldbe accepted; but an endeavour should be made to show that policewidows&apos; pensions were in part covered by contributions, and thegeneral policy in future should be to insist on contributory schemes.Finally, the Cabinet considered whether the proposed increases in the pay of Chief Constables should be deferred and introducedgradually from the date taken for the introduction of the approvedincreases for the higher ranks of the Civil Service. There was general agreement that the balance of advantage lay in favour of granting the increases without delay. These increases in chief constables&apos; pay had been delayed because of the issue of the white paper on Personal Incomes; and the understanding at that time had been that the delay would not be longer than a few months.Here, again, it was felt that it would be inexpedient to reject oneof the recommendations of the Committee and thus risk reopeningdiscussion of them all.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that one. or two police authorities in Scotland might be opposed to the new scales for chief constables and that the application of the new scales in these cases would be a matter for negotiation.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that effect should be given to the recommendations in the first report of the Oaksey Committee, as from 1st July next.(2) Recorded their view that all future pension schemes supple-menting those provided under the National InsuranceScheme should be on a contributory basis.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,5th May, 1949.
