Parliament.Business inthe House of..Commons.1. The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the business to be taken in the House of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet also discussed the attitude which the Governmentshould adopt towards the Private Members&apos; Bills which were down for Second Reading on Fridav, 18th February, and on the followingFriday.parliamentary procedure.Effect of LocalGovernmentAct, 1948. .(previous reference :CM. (48) 53rdConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Minister of Health drew attention to the refusal ofthe Chairman, during the Committee Stage of the Landlord and tenant (Rent Control) Bill on the previous day, to call an amend-ment by Mr. E. Fletcher, M.P., which would have required localauthorities to keep a register of all dwellings coming under the rent restriction Acts. The grounds for his decision were that, by reasonof the operation of the rates equalisation grant, any amendmentimposing a charge on local authorities would involve expenditure by the Exchequer and that the amendment was outside the moneyresolution on the Bill. The Cabinet had on 22nd July, 1948,discussed this position in relation to private Bills and it seemed tobe desirable to review the situation to ensure that Private members who wished to move amendments to public Bills dealing with localgovernment were not unreasonably hampered.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord President to arrange for the point raisedby the Minister of Health to be considered by the lord presidents Committee.SupplementaryCivilEstimates.national health service.366183. The Prime Minister suggested that it would be useful ifthe Cabinet considered the main items of the supplementary civil estimates, amounting to  221 million, and discussed the lines onwhich they should be, defended in debate.The Minister of Health said that, of the supplementary estimateof  52 million required for the National Health Service in Englandand Wales,  10 million was due to a reduction in the original estimate made, at the suggestion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,on the understanding that this amount could be taken subsequentlyin a supplementary estimate if that proved necessary. The extra 22 million required for the hospital services were due primarily to the state of neglect into which the hospitals had fallen and to various necessary increases in wages which had been granted. Theincreased payments to local health authorities, amounting to 5 million, were due to the increased cost of the ambulance serviceand to certain increases in wages. The increase of  4 million forthe pharmaceutical services had not been as much as had at onetime been feared. Similarly, it was remarkable that the general medical services had&apos; cost only  2 million more than estimated; andmany general practitioners were now earning less than before thescheme came into operation. The two figures which caused him mostanxiety were those relating to general dental services (an increase from  7 to  18 million) and supplementary ophthalmic services (anincrease from  2 to  13 million). There was no question but thatthe dentists were over-paid under the scheme, owing to the recom-mendations of the Spens Committee. He had already taken stepsto cut the remuneration of dentists who were drawing over  4,800a year, and he was now discussing a 20 per cent, reduction in allthe items on which a dentist could base his charges. It was doubtfulwhether the dental service would ever operate satisfactorily on thepresent basis, and he believed that the ultimate solution would beto employ dentists in health centres on a salaried basis. As regardsopticians, a large proportion of the population had undoubtedly been in need of properly prescribed spectacles and this accountedb 2
for a considerable part of the cost. At the same time there would always be a tendency for opticians to provide spectacles for people who did not really need them, unless arrangements could be madefor their recommendations to be checked by oculists who had nofinancial interest in the provision of spectacles.The Secretary of State for Scotland explained, as regards the supplementary estimate of  5,600,000 for the National health service in Scotland, that a good deal of the additional liabilitiesin respect of hospital services, both in Scotland and England, was for capital charges which would be recovered next year out ofendowments. At the same time, there was an immense potentialclaim by the hospitals for modern equipment, of which they had beenstarved in the past, and the Minister of Health and he werediscussing with regional hospital boards how these claims mightbe scrutinised and placed in order of priority. The latest figuressuggested that there was now a steady decline in the number ofspectacles being supplied, and that the swollen expenditure of thefirst few months had been due to a backlog of unsatisfied need inthe past. It was estimated that in Scotland there had been anincrease in the average net annual remuneration of general medical practitioners from  1,000 pre-war to  1,250 or  1,300. Somedoctors serving middle-class areas were, however, earning consider-ably less than before, on account of the unexpected extent to whichthe middle-classes had come into the scheme.In subsequent discussion it was pointed out that, after thescheme had been in operation for a year,, it should be possible tosecure figures of comparative costs which should enable the health ministers to grapple with examples of extravagant administration.In some services, such as the hospitals, where there could beenormous demands for capital expenditure, it would be necessaryfor the Government to decide how much expenditure the State could afford in present circumstances. It was desirable that the Houseof Commons should scrutinise the supplementary estimates on the health Services with some care, since this would assist ministers in dealing with the many claims upon them for the expansion of services and consequent higher levels of expenditure.The Minister of Food said that his supplementary estimate of 52 million was very largely explained by the decision taken in the spring of 1948, and subsequently maintained, not to reduce food subsidies. On 11th December, 1947, the Cabinet had decided(C.M. (47) 94th Conclusions, Minute 5) that the subsidies on tea,meat, eggs, bacon, cheese and butter should be stabilised, and theprices to the public allowed to rise. Increases in respect of eggs andbacon had accordingly been made at the beginning of 1948, but afterthe publication in February 1948 of the White Paper on personal incomes, Costs and Prices (Cmd. 7321) the Chancellor of theExchequer had asked that price increases on the other commoditiesshould be postponed on the ground that a rise in the cost-of-living index would make it difficult to maintain the stabilisation of wages,and this policy had been maintained up to the present.In discussion, it was pointed out that there might be somedebate in Parliament on the question whether the subsidies imposed a greater burden on the community than would have been imposed by wage increases consequent upon a rise in the cost-of-living index.The main burden of any attack on the Minister of Food was, how-ever, more likely to be in respect of bulk buying. Bulk buying hadin fact proved very profitable, but it was not possible to press this argument too far, since this would be embarrassing to the other commonwealth Governments with whom we had concluded bulkcontracts.The Secretary of State for the Colonies explained that theprincipal items in his main supplementary estimate of  13 million were for terminal charges in respect of Palestine, a grant to the
Government of Hong Kong and a final payment to Malta to taperoff the reduction in the food subsidies. In addition, there was anestimate of  13 million in respect of the West African ProduceControl Board, which was in the nature of a bookkeepingtransaction. He did not expect any serious criticism from theOpposition, since they had supported some of the expenditure whichwas now under review.The Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the Minister of Health, the-   Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of Food andthe Secretary of State for the Colonies.Jnder-Seail In theersian Gulf.^previous reference:.M.(48)68thConclusions,minute 5.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (49) 26) on the alternative courses which were opento the Government in connection with the exploitation of the oil which was believed to exist under the sea-bed of the Persian Gulf.In discussion, there was general agreement that, while it wouldhave been useful to have secured general acceptance of the medianline scheme outlined in paragraph 8 (2) of the Foreign Secretary&apos;smemorandum, it was preferable on practical grounds to proceed by stages on the lines indicated in paragraph 8 (3) of the memorandum.This latter course was less likely to create difficulties with thePersian Government, with whom difficult negotiations were atpresent being conducted.The Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to handle the questionof the exploitation of oil under the sea-bed of the persian gulf in the manner outlined in paragraph 8 (3) of cp. (49) 26. v cabinet Office, S.W. 1,17th February, 1949.
