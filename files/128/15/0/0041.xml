industrial disputes.(previous reference:CM. (49) 40thConclusions.Minute 4.)Dockers&apos;Strikes.RailwayDisputes.1. The Minister of Labour said that members of the Steve-Union, had declined to unload two Canadian ships in london docks and, as a result, 300 men had been suspended from employ -ment in the port. The Secretary of the Union, who was reportedto have favoured the course taken by these men, was being seen atthe Ministry of Labour that day. If the stevedores could not be persuaded to work these ships, other steps would have to be takento get them unloaded. The situation in other ports was nowsatisfactory.The difficulties on the railways had now been narrowed down tothe wages claim, and on this representatives of the two sides weremeeting in conference that afternoon.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Iron and steel bill.(previous reference:C.M.(49)40thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofSupply (CP. (49) 132) on the attitude which the Government should adopt towards an Opposition amendment providing that the Ironand Steel Bill should not be brought into operation until 1st October,1950, and that the industry should not be transferred to public ownership until 1st July, 1951.The Cabinet were informed that the leaders of the opposition in the House of Lords were resolved to carry against the Governmentsome amendment ensuring that the Bill could not be brought into effective operation until after the General Election. Discussiontherefore turned on the question whether the Government should attempt to reach some compromise with the Opposition on this point,or whether they should allow the Bill to be rejected by the Lords andrely upon the Parliament Act procedure to enforce its passage inits present form.In favour of seeking an agreement with the Opposition, it waspointed out that it would not be practicable to transfer the industryto public ownership by 1st May, 1950. The Bill already providedthat the transfer might take place at such later date withineighteen months from the Royal Assent as might be determined bythe Minister, and it was not in fact contemplated that the transferwould take place until after the General Election. Thus, in what-ever form, the Bill was passed, the question whether its provisions should be brought into effect was bound to be one of the issues at theElection. The Government would have to announce at some stage that they were not proposing to transfer the industry to public ownership on the earliest date mentioned in the Bill; and it might prove less embarrassing to allow this to become known in the nearfuture, as the result of an agreement with the Opposition in theHouse of Lords, rather than be compelled to disclose it shortly beforethe Election. If agreement were reached with the Opposition aboutthe vesting date, the Bill could become law by the end of July. If,on the other hand, the Government resisted the Lords&apos; amendmentand had recourse to the Parliament Act procedure, the Bill mightbe lost altogether, or at least seriously delayed, if for any reason it became necessary to hold the General Election early in 1950.On the other side, it was argued that the workers in the steelindustry, and Government supporters generally, would be greatlydiscouraged if the Government made any such concession to theHouse of Lords on this Bill. Whichever course was taken, theGovernment could not carry into effect before the Election their intention to nationalise the steel industry; and it would not be ofany great practical advantage to them to have carried the Bill ifthey did not win the Election. The issue should therefore bedetermined by reference to political advantages at the Election; and,from that point of view, the preferable course was to avoid making
any compromise with the House of Lords. The Government should leave themselves in the position of being able to lay upon the Houseof Lords the whole of the blame for the delay in nationalising the steel industry. And they should do nothing which might be thought to imply acceptance of the Opposition claim that this industry shouldnot be nationalised without a fresh mandate from the electorate.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Government should decline to accept any amendment moved in the House of Lords with the objectof providing that the Iron and Steel Bill could not bebrought into effective operation until after the GeneralElection.Import Policy.(previous reference:C.M.(49)39thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (CP. (49) 137) on the relaxation of import restrictions.The President of the Board of Trade said that the MinisterialConsultative Group of the. Organisation for European economic co-operation had now endorsed the proposals for the removal of restrictions on intra-European trade which the Cabinet had approved on 30th May, and had submitted a resolution on the subjectto the Council of the Organisation. It had been proposed that this resolution should be published on 20th June, and he had therefore thought it advisable, in view of the widespread interest which itwas likely to provoke, to circulate with CP. (49) 137 the draft ofa general explanation of these proposals which might be given atonce to Parliament in reply to an arranged Question for writtenanswer. He had since learned, however, that the resolution wasnot now to be published before the meeting of Finance ministers to be held in Brussels later that week, and it might therefore bepossible to defer a statement until the results of that meeting were known. Unfortunately, information about these proposals had appeared in the Press on the previous day, and he might be pressed to make an early statement on the matter in the House of Commons.He hoped, however, that Ministers could first consider what shouldbe said in such a statement about the Governments future tariff policy, and he proposed to submit a further paper on this point.This delay would also make it possible to give consideration to the comments of the United States and Canadian Governments on thedraft which had already been communicated to them.The Cabinet agreed that, if the matter were raised in the Houseof Commons, the President of the Board of Trade should promise to make a full statement on Thursday, 23rd June.In further discussion, the following points were made : ,(a) These proposals should be presented to Parliament as a constructive s contribution towards the economic integration of western Europe. Emphasis should also be laid on the points that united Kingdom industry would benefit from the reciprocal relaxation-tion of trade restrictions, and that greater freedom of trade mightbe expected to produce some reduction in the cost of living in thiscountry.(&amp;) The draft statement annexed to CP (49) 137 seemed to imply that the Government were opposed to all forms of protection.It was important to avoid any suggestion that the Government were committed to a free trade policy.(c) It was agreed that some alternative words should besubstituted for &quot; liberalisation &quot; and &quot; liberalising &quot; in futurepapers and statements on this subject.
political activities ofCivil Servants.(previous reference:.CM. (49) 16thConclusions,Minute 2,;)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (49) 129) recommending theacceptance of the proposals made by a Departmental Committee,under the chairmanship of Mr. J. C. Masterman, which had examined the extent to which civilian employees of the government might engage in political activities.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in his view this wasa sensible report, which the Government should adopt as a whole.While the Committee recommended that the existing rule againstactive participation in politics should be maintained in respect ofthe main grades of the Civil Service^ they proposed that much greaterlatitude should be allowed to the minor and manipulative grades andto industrials.There was general agreement that the proposals made in thereport should be accepted. In discussion, reference was made to thefollowing points(a) There was at present a good deal of confusion about theextent to which civil servants might engage in local governmentaffairs. The Masterman Committee had had it in mind that the heads of Departments should agree on a list of Civil Service postswhose holders should not participate in local government and that,for the rest, a civil servant should be free to stand for election to alocal authority and even, if necessary, to stand as a Party candidateprovided that he exercised discretion in his association with party politics. There was general agreement that this went as far as was practicable to meet the objection that a rule permitting civil servants to stand only as &quot; independents &quot; would give one of the main political Parties an advantage over the other.(&amp;) The adoption of the report would involve some amendmentof the Servants of the Crown (Parliamentary Candidature) Order,1927, but most of the recommendations would be carried into effect by Treasury regulations or instructions. Departments would be consulted in the preparation of these instructions and would havean opportunity to comment on Treasury proposals for dealing with matters which the report left to be worked out adminstratively.(c) Departments had been advised that the provisions of the servants of the Crown (Parliamentary Candidature) Order, 1927,applied in law to members of New Towns, Corporations and other public boards. When the Order was amended the opportunity should be taken to exclude from its operation members of publicboards, to whom it had never been intended to apply.(d) The Service Departments had been considering the questionof political activities by members of the Forces, and their proposals were likely to be on lines similar to those which the MastermanCommittee had recommended for the Civil Service. Final decisions had yet to be taken, however, by the Minister of Defence and theService Ministers. If they decided that serving officers should notsit in the House of Commons, it would be necessary to bring to anend the House of Commons (Service in His Majesty&apos;s Forces) Act,1939, by virtue of which two Regular Army officers on theunemployed list were now sitting in the House of Commons.The Cabinet; Invited the President of the Board of Trade to circulate a revised draft of a Parliamentary statement on theproposals for relaxing import controls, together with proposals for handling any supplementary questions ontariff policy.
The Cabinet-Agreed that the report of the Masterman Committee shouldbe published, and that the Chancellor of the exchequer should state at the time of publication that the Governmenthad decided to accept its recommendations.Western 5.   The Lord President said that he understood that a union. committee of officials, which had been working for the Preparatory(Previous       Commission, were proposing that a Press communique should be reference:      issued shortly on the arrangements for the forthcoming meeting ofC.M.(49)40th  the Council of Europe.    This would state that the ConsultativeConclusions,    Assembly would meet on 11th August and that, in addition to minute 2.)      accommodation for the public and the Press, facilities would be afforded for radio transmissions and the taking of cinematograph films.   While he saw no objection to a broadcast of the openingceremony and the taking of news-films at that time, it seemed most undesirable that any impression should be created that the pro-ceedings of the Assembly would be regularly broadcast or made thesubject of news-films.   He also understood that the arrangements proposed for the seating of the Assembly were not likely to be satis-factory: further efforts should be made to avoid the adoption ofarrangements which would lead to the development of the practiceof speaking from a rostrum.The Cabinet-Invited the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to endeavour to secure the deletion, fromany Press communique&apos; issued on behalf of the Prepara-tory Commission, of any reference to broadcasts and filmsof the forthcoming meeting of the Consultative Assembly.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,20th June, 1949.
