Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in     the House of Commons in the following week.the House ofCommons.Common- 2.   The Lord President said that, in pursuance of the Cabinefswealth decision of the previous day, he had informed the Opposition leadersRelations.       that it was not proposed to announce in Parliament the conclusionsConstitutional   reached at the Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers; but that,Developments   m connection with the usual Statement on Business, he would bein India.        ready to indicate that the House of Commons would be enabled to(Previous       debate those conclusions at some subsequent date.

Mr. churchill had also suggested that, if such a statement were made at once,it might be easier to avoid subsequent questions and friction : inany event, he was inclined to deprecate a debate on a motion, ashe thought it desirable, if possible, to avoid the likelihood of a division.  In these circumstances the Prime Minister, who had hadto leave London to fulfil a public engagement in North Wales, had asked the Lord President to make on his behalf in the House ofCommons that afternoon a short  statement incorporating thesubstance of the announcement which had been published in thePress that morning.In further discussion it was asked whether the decision reached by the Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers would involve any amendment of the Statute of Westminster. The Cabinet were informed that some legislation would be required at some stage, butthat it had hitherto been thought that this need not take the form ofan amendment of the Statute of Westminster. It was agreed thatthe opinion of the Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers should in due course be taken on this point.War Crimes. 3.   On 31st March the Cabinet had invited the Secretary ofTrial of State for War to ascertain whether it would be practicable for aGerman war crimes court to consider as a preliminary issue whether Field-Generals in Marshal von Rundstedt and Colonel General Strauss were fit to standBritish their trial.   The Cabinet had now before them a memorandum byCustody. the Secretary of State for War (CP. (49) 90) stating that a Field(Previous       General Court-Martial had no power under the Army Act to decideReference:      the issue of physical fitness to stand trial, and that the procedureCM. (49)24th   of a war crimes court followed that of a Field General Court-Conclusions,     Martial.  In any event the Secretary of State for War saw objectionMinute 2.)       to placing the responsibility for determining physical fitness on acourt composed of British military officers, or on the General OfficerCommanding-in-Chief, and recommended that the Cabinet should themselves take a decision on the issue.The Cabinet were informed that the Lord Chancellor and theLaw Officers were satisfied, on further consideration, that in lawthe question whether Field-Marshal von Rundstedt and ColonelGeneral Strauss were fit to stand their trial could be brought before a war crimes court, since the King&apos;s Regulations need not be appliedto such a court. It would be for the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief to decide whether to convene a court and, if he were informed that the Government thought that the issue of physicalfitness should be determined in this way, he would doubtless beprepared to do so. The two Generals would have to be indictedbefore the court and full charges would have to be prepared. Themedical evidence could then be placed before the court and the court
would have to submit their views on the question of physical fitnessto the convening officer, with whom the final decision would rest.The issue might be complicated by a plea on behalf of the twoGenerals that they were fit to stand their trial. Moreover, it seemedto be undesirable to place the final responsibility upon the GeneralOfficer Commanding-in-Chief.In discussion, it was pointed out that public criticism had hitherto been directed at the long delays in bringing these Generalsto trial and at the undesirability of trying them at this late date.A decision not to place them on trial might, however, provokecriticism on the ground that they were being dealt with too leniently,especially since many of their subordinates had already sufferedsevere punishment for offences carried out on their instructions. Ifthe Generals were set at liberty and if von Rundstedt then gave evidence in von Manstein&apos;s defence, opinion in this country and evenmore in Germany would be highly critical of the decision not to putvon Rundstedt and Strauss on trial. The Foreign Secretary wasgravely embarrassed by the failure to try the Generals, There hadbeen conflicting medical reports in the past. Even now there seemedto be a conflict of view between the mixed Medical Board which had examined the Generals and the medical officer of the prison wherethey, were at present detained, who regarded them as fit to standtheir trial. Doubts had been expressed whether the detailed findings of the Medical Board supported the view that the Generals werephysically incapable of standing their trial. The Attorney-general would have found some difficulty in deciding, upon all the medicalevidence now available, whether he would be justified in orderinga stay of proceedings in a comparable criminal trial in this country.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord Chancellor, with the assistance of the LawOfficers and a medical assessor or assessors, to hearevidence from the doctors who were in a position toexpress a view on the question whether Field-Marshal vonRundstedt and Colonel General Strauss were physicallyfit to stand trial, and to make recommendations to theCabinet, if possible for consideration by 5th May.General Policy. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (49) 94) indicating the line to be taken by the Govern-ment spokesman in the House of Lords in replying to a Motion bythe Bishop of Chichester on war crimes policy and intimating his intention to try to secure at an early date agreement on policy withthe United States and French Governments.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of CP. (49) 94.China.Despatch ofReinforcementsto Hong Kong.(previous reference:CM. (49) 28thConclusions.)4. The Secretary of State for War informed the Cabinet thatat their meeting on the previous day (D.O. (49) 12th Meeting) theDefence Committee had considered whether the garrison at HongKong should be reinforced. They had decided, subject to theapproval of the Cabinet, that one infantry battalion and brigade headquarters should be sent to Hong Kong at once and that theremainder of a brigade group should be sent as soon as practicablethereafter. In addition, certain naval and air reinforcements wouldalso be sent. The Chiefs of Staff considered that, so far as could before seen at present, the immediate danger to the security of theColony was likely to arise from internal unrest, from a large-scaleinflux of refugees or from external aggression by guerilla bands; andthey considered that the reinforcements proposed would suffice to
enable the garrison to deal with these threats. The Defence Com^mittee had expressed. the hope that it would not be necessary- tosend young and untrained National Servicemen to Hong Kong, andthe War Office would keep this consideration in mind in determining the composition of the brigade group. The despatch of reinforce-ments to Hong Kong would reduce the strength of the. strategic reserve in the United Kingdom to one infantry brigade.In discussion, the following points were made : (a) Was it not likely that reinforcements on the scale proposed would be inadequate against a serious attack ? And, in that event,were we not endangering these men to no purpose ? Against this,it was pointed out that it was not suggested that the proposedreinforcements would be sufficient to enable the garrison to resista major attack. The Chiefs of Staff considered, however, that theywould be adequate to meet any threat that could at present before seen.In the light of past experience there was no reason to thinkthat the Communist forces would attack Hong Kong: Communistpolicy in China had so far been to preserve the existing connections with the non-Communist world. The Cabinet agreed, however, thatthe Chiefs of Staff should keep.the development of events in theFar East under close and regular review so that, if there should beany significant change, Ministers would be able to consider urgentlywhat should be their future policy in regard to Hong Kong.(b) It should not be assumed that Chinese Communists wouldnot be able to launch a full-scale attack on Hong Kong from the mainland. While the Communist forces might not possess themilitary equipment of a first-class Power, they could exert pressure on Hong Kong by other means, such as a mass movement of refugees,which would be as effective against the Colony as a major direct attack.(c) There was general agreement that the announcement of thedecision to reinforce the Hong Kong garrison should be made in the* course of the debate on the situation in China in the following week,unless circumstances made it necessary to announce it earlier.Ministers thought it would be inadvisable to refer in this announce-ment to communism or to the threat of &quot; external aggression,&quot; butmention might be made of the risks arising from any great influx of refugees into the Colony. Care should be taken to avoid the use of words which might endanger the position of the British communities in China.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the Defence Committee&apos;s decision that one infantry battalion and brigade headquarters should besent to Hong Kong at once, and that preparations shouldbe made for the despatch of the remainder of a brigade group as soon as practicable.(2) Agreed that the decision to reinforce the garrison at HongKong should be announced during the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons on the situation in China,unless circumstances made it necessary to announce thisearlier.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to settle, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for War and the Minister of Statefor Colonial Affairs, the precise terms of the announce-ment of the decision to reinforce the garrison at HongKong.
western union.(previous reference:CM. (49) 19thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the foreign secretary (CP. (49) 92) covering the final report of the PreparatoryConference for the establishment of a Council of Europe, togetherwith recommendations on a number of unsettled points on the draftStatute of the Council.The Foreign Secretary explained that his proposals were basedon the conclusions of a meeting of Ministers, under the Chairman-ship of the Lord President, which had made a preliminary examina-tion of the outstanding points.The discussion covered the following points: -(a) The Foreign Secretary&apos;s redraft of Article 20 (a) of thedraft Statute followed the wording of the Charter of the united nations. It was, however, open to the criticism that it appearedto contemplate undefined &quot; important matters &quot; which required a unanimous vote of the Committee of Ministers. While it was desirable not to depart unduly from the phraseology of the Charter,the ambiguity could be removed by substituting &quot;namely&quot; for&quot; including &quot; in the second line of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s redraft.Item (vi) might make explicit provision for a decision of the Com-mittee of Ministers by common agreement, as well as by a two-thirds majority.(6) In regard to Article 25, it was recognised that argumentscould be adduced in favour of excluding Ministers from the Consul-tative Assembly, but the general view was that Governments should as proposed by the Foreign Secretary retain the power to sendMinisters if they wished. Some very small States might find difficulty in constituting a suitable delegation, if Ministers were excluded; and the Governments of the larger States might wishto include Ministers in order to balance the weight of representationfrom Opposition parties.(c) The intention of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s redraft ofArticle 27 was that, in suitable cases, the Committee of ministers might be able to send a single representative, or several representa-tives, to the Consultative Assembly to express their collective views.The Cabinet-Approved the draft Statute of the Council of Europe andthe draft Agreement for a Preparatory Commissionannexed to CP. (49) 92, subject to the amendments proposedby the Foreign Secretary and to his further considerationof the points noted in paragraph (a) above.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,28th April, 1949.
