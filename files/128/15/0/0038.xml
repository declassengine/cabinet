Parliament.-Business inthe House ofCommons.Business inthe House ofLords.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Report Stage of the Superannuation Bill was to be taken on 31st May. During the Committee Stage an amendment had beencarried against the Government which would have the effect thatestablished Civil Servants would be able to count for superannuationpurposes the whole of any period of unestablished service afer 1919.This provision would impose an additional annual charge upon theExchequer of nearly  2 million, rising eventually to  5 million,and would also have serious repercussions outside the Civil Service;and the Cabinet agreed that the Committee&apos;s decision must be modified on the Report Stage. In view, however, of the strength of feeling which had been shown during the Committee Stage, it wasagreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should move on Reportan amendment having the effect that, from the date of the passingof the Bill, any unestablished service by a Civil Servant subsequentlyestablished would rank as established service for purposes of superannuation.The Cabinet expressed their appreciation of the efficient servicerendered by the Government Whips in the Divisions on the IrelandBill.The Cabinet took note that the House of Lords had passed,without a division, the Second Reading of the Iron and Steel Bill.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Opposition would doubtless bring forward a number of amendments during the Committee Stage butit seemed unlikely that they would insist on pressing many of these to a Division. It was, however, clear that they were determined tocarry against the Government an amendment designed to secure thatthe Bill could not be brought effectively into operation until after theGeneral Election.Dockers&apos; 2.   The Home Secretary drew&quot; attention to the serious situationStrike. which was arising as a result of the action of the Canadian Seamen &apos;union in calling a strike affecting ocean-going vessels trading fromthe eastern seaboard of Canada. Members of this Union were refusing to work back to Canada ships which had already arrived in thiscountry; and, in support of their action, members of the transport and General Workers&apos; Union were refusing to unload Canadian shipsarriving in United Kingdom ports. The situation was complicated by the fact that some Canadian ships were manned by members ofthe Seafarers&apos; International Union, which was not a party to thisstrike, and United Kingdom dockers were also refusing to unloadships manned by members of that Union. There was one such ship,the Montreal City, at Avohmouth; and a specially acute situation had arisen there since the port employers had announced that theywould not engage labour for any other ship in the port until workbegan on the unloading of the Montreal City. This had involveddelay in unloading a banana boat, the Bayano, and the Ministry ofFood had advised that its perishable cargo would be lost unless itwere unloaded within the next few days.The position had been reviewed the previous day by theEmergencies Committee and, after consultation^with the Secretaryof the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union, Ministers had reached the conclusion that the port employers and the Union shouldbe asked to arrange for the Bayano to be unloaded by volunteerlabour. The Secretary of the Union had agreed that, if the unofficialstrike was not brought to an end as a result of a meeting which wasbeing held at Avonmouth that morning between the representativesof the port employers and the Union, he would call for volunteers tounload the perishable cargo. If these volunteers were forthcoming,it was proposed that the port employers should be pressed on behalfof the Government to allow this particular cargo to be unloaded.37128-3 B 2
The Cabinet-- (1) Agreed that, if the meeting which was being held that morning did not result in a general.resumption of work at the Avonmouth docks, the Minister of Labour shouldon the Government&apos;s behalf press the port employers toagree that the cargo of bananas should be unloaded fromthe Bayano if volunteer labour for that purpose were provided by the local branch of the Transport andGeneral Workers&apos; Union.In further discussion it was suggested that more effective steps should be taken to bring home to the dockers in the United kingdom ports mainly affected the true facts and significance of this strike of Canadian seamen. The Canadian Seamen&apos;s Union was controlled by Communists, and there was little doubt that the strike was designed to interfere with the shipment )of supplies under theEuropean Recovery Programme. The strike had not been extendedto Canadian vessels engaged in the coastwise trade or to vesselssailing from ports on the western seaboard of Canada. It wasanomalous that dockers in this country should by their actionssupport a Canadian union controlled by Communists against a rivalunion which was not so controlled. It would be helpful if the truefacts of the situation could be explained to the Avonmouth dockersby some trade unionist with an established local reputation in an address broadcast on the West Regional Programme.This incident also illustrated the need (for a more generalcampaign to put the dockers and other workers in this country ontheir guard against this sort of Communist exploitation. It was unsatisfactory that counter-action on the Governments behalfshould always have to be taken from a defensive position: theGovernment should seek to capture the initiative in this struggle.The Prime Minister said that he was considering whether anyadjustment was necessary of the Government machinery for handlingthese questions. Meanwhile, it would be useful if considerationcould be given to the possibility of producing a general pamphlet forthe information of dock workers in this country.The Cabinet *(2) Invited the Minister of Labour to arrange for a broadcast to be made in the West Regional Programme explaining the true facts and significance of the Canadian seamen&apos;strike.(3) Took note that the Minister of Transport would shortlysubmit to the Cabinet a memorandum on the general questions arising from unofficial strikes by dock workers.China. 3.   The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Prime MinisterDefence of (CP. (49) 119), the Minister of Defence (CP. (49) 118) and the hong Kong. Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. (49) 120) on the defence(Previous        of Hong Kong.Reference: The Prime Minister recalled that on 5th May the Cabinet had. (49)33rd authorised the despatch to Hong Kong of reinforcements sufficientConclusions, to secure the Colony against internal unrest or sporadic attacks by minute 2.) guerillas. Since then the Communist forces in Southern China had made substantial progress, and the question now arose of sendingfurther reinforcements in order to secure Hong Kong against therisk of direct attack by these forces from the mainland. The Chiefsof Staff had advised that such an attack might be delivered at anytime after September; and that, if it was to be resisted with success,an immediate decision should be taken to despatch to Hong Kong thefurther reinforcements set out in the memorandum by the Ministerof Defence (CP. (49) 118).
The Prime Minister said that, from consultations which hehad held with the Commissioner-General for South-East Asia andthe Commanders-in-Chief of the Land and Air Forces in the far east he was satisfied that failure to meet this threat to the securityof Hong Kong would damage very seriously British prestigethroughout the Far East and South-East Asia. Moreover, the wholecommon front against Communism in Siam, Burma and Malaya was likely to crumble unless the peoples of those countries were convinced of our determination and ability to resist this threat to Hong Kong.In their earlier discussions the Cabinet had been reluctant to commit themselves to any long-term policy in respect of Hong Kong;and the Prime Minister had therefore considered, in consultationwith the Foreign Secretary and other Ministers directly concerned,how a decision to defend the Colony could be presented in such a way as to command the support of public opinion in the democraticcountries of the world. He had come to the conclusion that it shouldbe presented as a decision to resist aggression; and he recommendedthat support for such a policy should be enlisted from the Govern-ments of other Commonwealth countries and of the United States.The following points were made in discussion of the political considerations involved: (a) Policy must take account of-the fact that Hong Kong wasvaluable to us mainly as a centre of trade. In the short term, trade would be seriously interrupted, if not entirely brought to an end,if preparations for the military defence of the Colony were counteredby measures of blockade from the mainland. In the long term, ifa strong Communist Government established itself in control overthe whole of China, it would be impossible for us to maintainHong Kong as a trading centre unless that Government acquiesced in our continuance there. These considerations seemed to suggestthat the aim of our policy should be to find a basis on which a communist Government of China could acquiesce in our remaining in Hong Kong. If we made it a point of prestige that we should retain Hong Kong as a British possession, it might become a matter&quot; of prestige for the Communists to force us to withdraw from it.As against this, attention was drawn to the importance of our being able to argue from a position of strength in any negotiationswith a- Chinese Government about our future position in Hong Kong.If we showed no determination to defend the Colony, the risk ofits being attacked would be increased; and, if we were forced towithdraw from it, we should have little prospect of persuading aChinese Government to allow us to return. In the short term, ifwe showed ourselves determined to remain there, the Communistswere unlikely to maintain an economic blockade for any length oftime; for the continued interruption of the normal flow of trade between Hong Kong and the mainland was likely to be asembarrassing for the Communists as it would be for the Colony. Thetemporary interruption of that trade, during a period of tension oractual hostilities, would not do it any lasting injury : it could soon be revived thereafter, as it had been revived since the end of the war.(b) Practical evidence of our determination to defendHong Kong would have important consequences. First, it mightwell deter the Communist forces from making a direct attack on theColony. Secondly, it would rally to our side the wavering elementsamong the local population and would substantially reduce the threat to internal security. Thirdly,- it would strengthen the anti-Communist front throughout South-East Asia. The maintenance ofour trading position in Hong Kong was doubtless important; but even more important at the present time was the political questionwhether we must not somewhere make a stand against Communistencroachment in the Far East. If we failed to make this stand in hong Kong, should we not find it much harder to make it else wherein South-East Asia ?
(c) There were, however, dangers in making at this stage anyforthright declaration of our determination to defend Hong Kong.Apart from the risk that such a declaration might be regarded asprovocative by the Chinese Communists, there was also the danger that a unilateral declaration by the United Kingdom Governmentwould be interpreted, however it was phrased, as a relic of&quot; Colonialism.&quot; We should find ourselves in an awkward position if, having made the declaration, we failed to enlist a sufficient number of our friends in its support. Although it was fairly clearthat we should gain the support of Australia and New Zealand, theattitude of some other Commonwealth Governments was uncertainand it would be unwise to count on the support of public opinion inthe United States. Should it not rather be our aim to mobilise as many Governments as possible in support of a policy of resistingaggression against Hong Kong, so that we might appear to be acting as the instrument of an international policy rather than pursuing a selfish policy of our own? There was general support for theview that no declaration of policy should be made until consultationshad been held with the Governments of the other commonwealth countries and of the United States.(d) The High Commissioner for the United Kingdom in Indiasaid that there seemed little prospect of persuading Pandit Nehruto make any public declaration of India&apos;s support of a policy of defending Hong Kong against aggression by Chinese Communistforces. First, he might think this inconsistent with his generalopposition to &quot; Colonialism.&quot; Secondly, he would be mindful ofthe French and Portuguese possessions in Pondicherry and Goa;and he would not wish to say anything which might preclude him from objecting, at some later date, to any proposals for strengthening the French or Portuguese garrisons in those places.Thirdly, he had stated that India would not associate herself with power blocs, and the declaration made at the end of the AprilMeeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers had already been criticised by his political opponents and by some of his politicalsupporters on the ground that it might limit India&apos;s freedom ofaction in international affairs. These critics would be greatly strengthened if, within so short a time after that declaration, pandit nehru publicly voiced his support of a United Kingdom policy forthe military defence of Hong Kong. In these circumstances our best hope was to persuade Pandit Nehru to refrain from making any public statement which was critical of our proposed policy in hong Kong. So long as our action was limited to suppressinginternal disorders, he might well be willing to refrain from anysuch comment. If, however, we were compelled to resist an armed attack by forces operating under the auspices of a Chinese Govern-ment, he would find it more difficult to remain silent. From thepoint of view of avoiding public criticism in India, it would be preferable that we should avoid making any formal declaration ofpolicy.The Commissioner-General for South-East Asia said that, fromhis point of view, he would welcome a public declaration of our determination to defend Hong Kong against aggression. he recognised, however, that the question whether any such declaration should be made must be decided by reference, not so much to localneeds, but rather to the wider considerations which had been mentioned in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion. From the point of view of strengthening morale in Hong Kong and in South-East Asia itwouid perhaps be sufficient that we should despatch to Hong Kongreinforcements sufficient for its defence.The following points were raised in discussion of the military implications of defending Hong Kong: (e) To what extent wouid the successful defence of the Colonybe frustrated by failure to control an influx of refugees from the
mainland? This had proved a serious difficulty in 1941. TheGabinet were informed that, although the &quot;movement of refugeescould not be satisfactorily controlled while trade continued betweenthe Colony and the mainland, no insuperable difficulty should arise in a state of siege. Full preparations had been made for dealingwith this situation, and the Governor was satisfied that any large-scale influx of refugees could be prevented.(/) Was it clear that adequate water supplies would beavailable under conditions of siege? The Cabinet were informedthat, as the leased territories would be included within the defencearea, the water supply should be sufficient to meet the requirementsof the population and of the increased garrison, provided that control was maintained over consumption. It would not be difficultto take precautions against damage by sabotage.(g) It was hoped that by September the situation in Malayawould have improved sufficiently to allow the Guards Brigade to be moved to Hong Kong without undue risk.(h) The Secretary of State for Air said that he was not inagreement with the proposal (paragraph 6 of CP. (49) 118) toinclude, in the reinforcements to &quot;be sent to Hong Kong, a long-rangefighter squadron from the United Kingdom. He was reluctant toaccept this reduction in the strength of Figher Command; and hesuggested that on this point no final decision should be taken until it was known whether the squadron of Australian Mustangs couldbe transferred to Hong Kong from Japan.(i) Some Ministers took the view that it would be undesirable,for political reasons, to proceed with the proposal (paragraph 9 (b)of CP. (49) 118) to call up Section &quot; A &quot; of the Army Reserve.(j) The Minister of Defence said that a working party of officials had prepared detailed proposals for finding the shippingrequired for the additional reinforcements set out in CP. (49) 118.(k) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he proposed toarrange for a representative of the Bank of England to proceed atonce to Hong Kong to advise the Governor on currency problems.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposal to send to Hong Kong the further reinforcements described in CP. (49) 118, subject tofurther consideration by the Defence Committee of theproposals (i) to send a squadron of long-range fightersfrom the United Kingdom and (ii) to call upSection &quot; A &quot; of the Army Reserve; and authorised theService Departments to proceed at once with thepreliminary arrangements for all these movements savethose affected by (i) and (ii).(2) Agreed that for the time being no public announcement should be made that any fresh decision of policy hadbeen taken in respect of Hong Kong or that any further reinforcements were to be sent there.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations and the Foreign Secretary, respectively, to inform theGovernments of the other Commonwealth countries andof the United States of the development of the situationin Hong Kong and of the decision to reinforce thegarrison still further; arid to ascertain whether those governments would be prepared to support a policy of defending Hong Kong against aggression by Communistforces from the mainland and, if need be, to make at theappropriate stage public declarations in support of that policy
(4) Agreed that final decisions regarding the basis of UnitedKingdom policy in respect of Hong Kong, and the formand timing of any announcement regarding it, shouldbe taken by the Cabinet in the light of the views expressed by the Governments of the other Common-wealth countries and of the United States.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,26th May, 1949.
