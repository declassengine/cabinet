NorthAtlanticSecurityPact.(previous reference:C.M.(48)68thConclusions,Minute 3.)Text of Pact.procedure for Signing.MediterraneanCountries.The Cabinet had before them two memoranda by the foreign secretary (CP. (49) 34 and 37) on a number qf outstanding pointsregarding the North Atlantic Security Pact.The Foreign Secretary said that, since he circulated CP.(49) 34, the United States Secretary of State had held informal discussions with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and therewas every reason to believe that the. committee would accept aversion of Article 5 of the Pact, dealing with mutual assistance,which would be acceptable to the Brussels Treaty Powers. Thelatest draft made it clear, as the United Kingdom Government had always wished, that this was a matter of mutual assistance and notmerely of United States support of Europe. It substituted thewords &quot;action, including the use of armed force &quot; for the phrase&quot; military or other action &quot;; and another amendment recognised the right of each party to determine what action was necessary inany given circumstances. The Senate Committee wished to see aseparate Article added to the Pact to the effect that the fulfilmentby a signatory of obligations under the Pact should be &quot;in accord-ance with established constitutional processes.&quot; The Committeewere doubtful about Article 2, which dealt with cultural links, butthe Canadian Government still attached importance to this Article.In discussion the following points were made : (a) The revised version of Article 5, which the United states secretary of State had provisionally agreed with the Foreign Rela-tions Committee of the Senate, was satisfactory from the UnitedKingdom point of view and in some ways was an improvement onthe original draft. It was much stronger than the draft, on whichit seemed possible at one time the Senate might insist.(6) The Canadian Government were anxious that the Pactshould not appear to be confined entirely to military matters, andit was desirable that the United Kingdom Government should support them in their claim that Article 2 should be retained. Itwas recognised, however, that this Article was unlikely to have any practical effect.(c) The additional Article dealing with constitutional pro-cesses might give rise to difficulties at some later date, for it mightbe invoked by unfriendly elements in the United States with a viewto stressing the freedom of action of the parties in time of emergency.It was, however, preferable that this reference to constitutional pro-cesses should be embodied in a separate Article, rather than included as a further qualification to Article 5, and it would be expedient toaccept the Article, if it were pressed, rather than run the risk of controversy in Congress.The Foreign Secretary pointed out that, at present, the brussels treaty Powers were being consulted on Article 5; and the UnitedKingdom Government would not be committed to the Pact until theyhad seen and approved it in final form. Thereafter, the Pact mighteither await further negotiation and agreement with all interestedcountries, or it could be signed by the United States, Canada and the brussels Treaty Powers, leaving any other States to adhere to itlater. He favoured early signature by the smaller number ofPowers in the first instance, since otherwise there would be longdelays while negotiations were conducted with other Powers who might wish to insert in the Pact further provisions affecting their particular interests. ....There was general agreement with the Foreign Secretary&apos;views.The Foreign Secretary drew attention to the proposed declara-tion by the signatories of the North Atlantic Pact designed to affordsome protection to Italy, Greece, Turkey and Persia. While there might be two views about this, his general impression was that thedeclaration would appear to weaken the obligations of this countryto Turkey under the Anglo-Turkish Treaty of 1939, and president truman&apos;s declaration of interest in Turkey and Greece.
There was general agreement with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s.pointof view. It might well be that the North Atlantic Pact would befollowed by Mediterranean and Pacific Pacts; and, meanwhile, itwould be better not to make the rather vague declaration nowproposed. If some declaration had to be made; it would be preferable to link it more clearly with existing commitments.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to give general approval to the revised version of Article 5 of the draft Pact,which the United States Secretary of State hadinformally agreed with the Senate Foreign relations committee.(2) Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should continue tosupport the request of the Canadian Government for theinclusion of Article 2, dealing with cultural links.(3) Agreed that the additional Article dealing with constitu-tional processes should not be included unless its inclusion was necessary to meet political difficulties inthe United States.(4) Agreed that the Pact should be signed in the first instance by the United States, Canada and the Brussels treaty powers, and that other States should be left to adhere to it subsequently.(5) Agreed that every effort should be made to avoid addingthe proposed declaration relating to Italy, Greece,Turkey and Persia.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,22nd February, 1949.
