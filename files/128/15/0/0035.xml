1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (49) 104) submitting for approval a provisionallegislative programme for the 1950 Session.The Lord President explained that the Future legislation committee were not yet in a position to frame a definite programme as a basis for The King&apos;s Speech at the opening of the new Session.The proposals in his memorandum were put forward with a viewto making a start with the drafting of Bills whose policy had beenapproved. The position was complicated by the fact that it mightnot prove possible to introduce this year a number of the Billspreviously proposed for the current Session, including Bills dealingwith the British Tourists and Holidays Board, films, customs duties,business premises leases, leasehold enfranchisement, the enforcement of maintenance orders and dock amenities. For this reason he wouldlike to have some discretion in deciding the order in which bills should be drafted. It might prove possible for the draftsman tomake progress with the preparation of Bills relating to ferries andthe law of defamation, although legislation could not be introduceduntil the next Parliament. It was not proposed to allow any timefor Private Members&apos; Bills in the short 1950 Session.In discussion, the following points were made : (a) There would probably be not more than thirty days availablefor legislation in the 1950 Session.(o) The Minister of Transport, with the support of the twoAgriculture Ministers and the agreement of the Treasury, wishedto introduce a ten-clause Bill authorising highway authorities toconstruct cattle grids on roads. The general view was that this Billshould be considered for introduction in the programme when a more definite view could be formed of the probable size and content of theprogramme as a whole.(c) An Austrian Treaty Bill and a British Museum Bill might also be required.(d) The salary of the Comptroller and Auditor-General was determined by Parliament, and legislation would therefore berequired to authorise its being raised to the new level proposed forHeads of Departments. Any increase in Judge&apos;s salaries wouldalso require legislation. The timing of such legislation would haveto be carefully considered in view of the Parliamentary oppertuinities which it would afford for discussing the continuing validity of theprinciples set out in the White Paper on Personal Incomes, costs and Prices.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, where policy had been approved, work should proceed on the preparation of the Bills for the 1950Session listed in paragraph 5 of CP. (49) 104 and ofthe Ferries Bill and Law of Defamation Bill referred toin paragraph 4 of that paper.(2) Authorised the Committee on Future Legislation to reviewfrom time to time the progress made with the prepara-tion of legislation for the 1950 Session and to adjust theprovisional programme in the light of the progress madewith the programme for the current Session.(3) Agreed that time should not be made available in the 1950Session for Private Members&apos; Bills.2. The Cabinet were informed that some Members of Parlia-ment had been asking whether they could be considered for appointment as members of the United Kingdom delegation to theCouncil of Europe.It was agreed that Ministers who were approached by such members should content themselves with advising the applicant to address himself to the Chief Whip, and should be careful not to say
anything which might be construed as a promise to support theapplication. The choice of the Government supporters to be includedin the delegation would not be made until the nomination of theOpposition Parties were known. At this stage Ministers should be careful to avoid saying anything which might increase the PrimeMinisters difficulties in determining, when the time came, the composition of the United Kingdom delegation.AdministrationTerritories,of Overseas(previous reference:CM. (49) 5thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister(CP. (49) 77) covering the report of a working party of officialswhich had examined the distribution of departmental responsibilityfor the administration of overseas territories. The broad effect ofthe report was that no change should be made in the presentallocation of responsibility between Departments save that, ifEritrea and Italian Somaliland were to remain under British control for more than a short period, it would be necessary to examine further the arrangements for their administration.In discussion attention was drawn to the recommendation ofthe working party that there should be interchange of staff betweenthe Foreign Office and the Colonial Office in respect of branchesconcerned with Arab problems. It was suggested that the responsi-bility of the Commonwealth Relations Office for India, Pakistan and ceylon made it desirable that there should be some similar inter-changes between the Foreign Office and the Commonwealth relations office in order to ensure that the officers dealing with Asiaticproblems, in Whitehall and in those countries, had a wide knowledgeof Eastern conditions and problems. If any such interchange ofstaff were to be made effective, the general basis on which it shouldbe conducted would have to be settled in agreement between the two ministers concerned.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the conclusions  of  the report attached to cp. (49) 77.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations to.consider what arrangements might be made for an interchange of staff between their. two Departments.Sir oswald mosley.Applicationfor BritishPassport.(previous reference:CM. (48) 13thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Foreign Secretary said that Sir Oswald Mosley had applied for a British passport for the purpose of travelling to thesouth of France for reasons of health. The Foreign Secretary saidthat he had come to the conclusion that he would no longer bejustified in withholding passport facilities from Sir Oswald Mosley,and that he proposed to grant this application. He had, however,thought it right to mention the matter to his colleagues, as it involved political considerations and had been discussed by theCabinet on an earlier occasion.Discussion then turned on the question whether Sir oswald mosley was likely to apply on medical grounds for a special allow-ance of foreign currency, and on the political difficulties which might arise if he received an allowance in excess of that normally grantedto the ordinary traveller. The Cabinet took note that their views onthis point would be brought to the notice of the Chancellor of theExchequer on his return to London.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,\$th May, 1949.
