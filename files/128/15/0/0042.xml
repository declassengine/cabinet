1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Third Heading of the Hairdressers (Registration) bill would be taken on Friday, 1st July. After consideration of the precedents it was not proposed to have recourse to the GovernmentWhip for the purpose of ensuring the rejection of the Bill. TheHome Secretary would, however, make a strong appeal to the house to reject the Bill-In discussion it was pointed out that it would be damaging tothe Government if it were left to the House of Lords to prevent this objectionable Bill from passing into law. government supporters should therefore be made aware of the importance ofattending the debate and voting against the Third Beading. TheCabinet were informed that the Whips were taking special steps toexplain the position to Government supporters.Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.Local 2.   The Minister of Health said that he had seen the ChairmanGovernment    of the Local Government Boundary Commission and had communi-Boundary       cated to him the decision of the ministerial Committee on LocalCommission.    Government that the work of the Commission should be brought to(Previous       an end.   Sir Malcolm Trustram Eve had stressed the need for an reference:     early intimation of the Governments decision in order that localCM. (49) 34th authorities might understand why current work on which theConclusions,    Commission were engaged was being suspended.   The MinisterMinute &amp;.),&apos;    therefore wished to make a statement on this subject in the Houseof Commons as soon as possible, preferably in answer to an arrangedQuestion-After discussion it was agreed that this announcement shouldbe deferred until the following week, so that the other ministers concerned might have an opportunity of considering its terms.   Itwas also agreed that the announcement should include an appro-priate expression of appreciation of the work done by  theCommission.The Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to settle, in consultation withthe Lord President, the Minister of Health and theMinister of Town and Country Planning, the form of theannouncement to be made in Parliament of the Govern-menfs decision to bring to an end the work of the boundary commission.Import Policy.(previous reference:CM. (49) 41stConclusions,Minute 3.)3L The President of the Board of Trade said that, contrary toearlier expectations, no demand had developed for a public statement about the proposals for relaxing restrictions on intra-Europeantrade. The Canadian Government were anxious that the statement should, if possible, be deferred until after their Election on27th June. This postponement would have the advantage that theterms of the statement could be revised in the light of any develop-ments at the meeting of Finance Ministers to be held in Brusselslater in the week. In these circumstances he proposed to defermaking any statement in Parliament until 28th or 29th June.Meanwhile, the Board of Trade would give the Ministry ofAgriculture and other interested Departments an opportunity to comment on the terms of the draft statement.3722ft-2The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the Presidentof the Board of Trade.b 2
Mountbatten 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordEstate Bill. Chancellor (CP. (49) 125) suggesting that the Government should support the principle of a general Bill releasing married women from the disability arising from restraints on anticipation, and thatthey should therefore support the Mountbatten Estate Bill on theground that it merely anticipated general legislation which wouldnave their support.The Lord Chancellor explained that the Law Reform (MarriedWomen and Tort Feasors) Act, 1935, had abolished the device ofrestraints upon anticipation in respect of married women, but hadnot affected restraints imposed by settlements executed before 1936or restraints imposed by wills of testators dying before 1945. Therestriction which the Mountbatten Estate Bill proposed to remove from Lady Mountbatten was, therefore, an anomaly which in time would disappear; but it was arguable that, if any concession wereto be made, it should be general in form. He understood that theChancellor of the Exchequer would not wish, on financial grounds,to object to the removal of a sex disability which Parliament hadregarded as undesirable in 1935. As a matter of procedure, he was anxious that the House of Commons should not oppose a PersonalBill which had been passed by the House of Lords : these Bills, were subject to a quasi-judicial procedure in the House of Lords and itwould be unprecedented for the House of Commons to reject sucha Bill after it had been passed by the House of Lords.In discussion, there was general agreement that the preferablecourse would be for the Government to introduce this Session a Billto abolish generally the restraints on anticipation which had beenretained by the Act of 1935. It was believed that between fifty andone hundred people were affected,&quot;not all of whom were rich people;and a general Bill of this kind could be justified as abolishingdiscrimination against married women, rather than affordingfinancial relief to a few rich people. Legal opinion in the Houseof Lords would support a measure of this character, and there was reason to believe that the Opposition would also favour it. Whenthe general Bill had been introduced, the promoters of theMountbatten Estate Bill would doubtless withdraw that Bill.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for the preparation and introduction in the House of Lords of a Bill to release married women from the remaining disabilitiesattaching to them by reason of restraints on anticipation.(2) Agreed that the Lord Chancellor should inform interestedMembers of the House of Lords and the Opposition ofthe policy which the Government were adopting. rCnma- 5.   The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda on defence of      Hong Kong : Hong Kong. CP. (49) 134: by the Minister of Defence, reporting on(Previous the visit which he had paid to Hong Kong from 6th to reference: 9th June;CM. (49)38th C.P. (49) 135 : by the Secretary of&quot;State for the Colonies,Conclusions, commenting on certain questions which had been raised by the minute 3.) United States Secretary of State when he was asked whether his Government would support a policy of defending Hong Kongagainst aggression;
CP. (49) 136 : by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations, summarising the response of other commonwealth governments to the enquiry whether they would support such apolicy.The Minister of Defence and the Secretary of State for theColonies informed the Cabinet that action was already being takento give effect to the specific recommendations made in paragraph 25of CP. (49) 134.Discussion then turned on the attitude of the other Common-wealth Governments. Whole-hearted support, moral as well asmaterial, would be forthcoming from New Zealand; and SouthAfrica had given a firm promise of moral support. The other commonwealth Governments were, however, reluctant to commit themselves in advance, and evidently entertained misgivings aboutthe long-term prospects of our position in Hong Kong. It wasspecially disappointing that the Australian Government shouldhave been unwilling to assume any share of responsibility for with-standing Communist encroachment in a part of the world whichthey professed to regard as being of special concern to them. TheCabinet were, however, informed that, since CP. (49) 135 was.circulated, the Prime Minister of Australia had given a categoricalassurance that his Government would not raise the question of hong Kong at the Security Council without first consulting theUnited Kingdom Government; and he had also indicated, in confidence, that if an attack were actually made upon Hong Kong,his Government might well adopt a different attitude on the questionof giving material assistance in its defence. The Prime Ministerof New Zealand had made it clear that, despite representations fromthe Australian Government, he was not prepared to withdraw hisoffer to send three or four frigates to help in the defence of hong Kong; and, indeed, he was now considering whether he couldnot also make available some aircraft with crews and ground staff.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said that itmight be helpful if he now sent to the Australian Government afresh appreciation of the position in Hong Kong, which would take account of the impressions which the Minister of Defence had formed during his visit. -; &apos; -Discussion then turned on the questions raised by the UnitedStates Secretary of State, which were considered in CP. (49) 135.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that, although he had put forward in his paper some tentative suggestions about the reply which might be returned to these questions, he felt that they raised the whole problem of long-term policy in respect of Hong Kong andhe thought the time had now come when Ministers must review thatproblem afresh in the light of the changed conditions in China.The Foreign Secretary said that he would propose to avoid sendingeven an interim reply to Mr. Acheson&apos;s questions. He would prefer to undertake at once a thorough review of long-term policy in respectof Hong Kong. From the response to the approaches which hadbeen made to the other Commonwealth Governments and to theGovernment of the United States, it now appeared that the UnitedKingdom Government would have to bear the main responsibilityfor devising effective means of safeguarding British interests in hong Kong; and he considered that Ministers should lose no timein formulating a positive policy for dealing with the situation.There was general agreement with this view.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to arrange for his Department to prepare, in consulta-tion with the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence,a fresh appreciation of the situation in Hong Kong forthe information of the Australian Government.
China.Protection ofBritish Ship-ping in the Yangtse River.(FveviousReference:C.M.(49)28thConclusions.)-China.H.M.S.Amethyst.(previous reference:CM. (49)28thConclusions.)(2) Took note that no reply would be sent for the time being tothe questions raised by the United States Secretary ofState, as reported in the telegram annexed to cp. (49) 135.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies to submit to the China and South-east asia Committee proposals on long-term policy in respectof Hong Kong.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the First Lordof the Admiralty (CP. (49) 133) on the protection of british shipping in the Yangtse river.The recent attacks on the s.s. Anchises by Chinese Nationalistaircraft rendered it necessary to review the existing instructionsto British warships operating in the Yangtse river. Under thepresent instructions H.M. ships on Yangtse Patrol were not at liberty to go to the help of British shipping in internalChinese waters, and no help had therefore been given to thes.s. Anchises. The First Lord of the Admiralty considered thatin the circumstances British warships should now be instructedto provide salvage or other humanitarian assistance to british shipping, even in internal waters. H.M. ships could not,however, enter the Whangpoo. river without risk of attack unlessthe Communist authorities in Shanghai had first agreed that theywould not be molested, and it was proposed that negotiations onthis point should .be initiated without delay. The Cabinet were asked to endorse the order, issued by the Commander-in-Chief,Far East, that H.M. ships on Yangtse Patrol should fire ataircraft either (a) for self-defence, or (b) because they had attackedBritish or other neutral merchant vessels, whether inside or outside territorial waters.The Foreign Secretary said that the Chinese nationalist government had now tendered an apology for the attack on thes.s. Anehises, which, they said, had been made in error and wasunconnected with their decision to blockade Communist-held ports in China. He thought that the proposals in CP. (49) 133 ought tobe further examined by officials of the Departments concerned before a final decision was. taken by Ministers^.In further discussion the following points were made : (a) The Chief of the Air Staff said that he felt some doubt whether it would be advisable to confirm the order to H.M. ships to fire at aircraft which had attacked British or other merchantvessels. It was not easy to identify aircraft with accuracy; and this order involved the risk that action might be taken against civil orother inoffensive aircraft.(b) Ministers doubted whether H.M ships need render assistance to neutral vessels in Chinese internal waters.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for officialsrepresenting the  Departments  concerned  to consider further the proposals in CP. (49) 133 with a view tosubmitting agreed recommendations to Ministers.7. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that no settlementhad yet been reached in the negotiations for the release ofH.M.S. Amethyst. Hitherto, the Communist authorities had insisted that His Majesty&apos;s Government should first admitresponsibility and tender an apology for the incident, and should agree in principle to pay compensation for any Chinese casualtiesincurred in the attack. But the Chinese General commanding thelocal Communist forces had now indicated that the ship might be
SovietIndustrialPotential.(previous reference:O.M.(49)HthConclusions,Minute 4.)8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP. (49) 123),which the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Defence had prepared, in response to the Cabinefs request of 10th February,on the industrial and economic war potential of the Soviet Union.In discussion, the following points were made : (a) The information given in CP. (49) 123 revealed the extentto which the general welfare of the Soviet people was subordinate to the requirements of military policy; and it was desirable that the widest publicity should be given, in this country and overseas, to theeffects of an aggressive Communist policy on the standard of life ofthe Soviet people. It would be specially advantageous, if it were possible, to bring this home to people in the Soviet Union and thesatellite States.(6) In the absence of published statistics, the collection ofeconomic and industrial information about the Soviet Unionpresented great difficulties, and the figures contained in the memoranda annexed to CP. (49) 123 should be accepted with reserve.The importance of obtaining adequate information about the soviet union was fully recognised, but the difficulties were very great.(c) Attention was drawn to the wide disparities between thefigures of steel production in the Soviet Union and its satellitecountries and in the rest of the world; and it was suggested thatthese figures provided the most effective indication of the real natureof the Soviet war potential. In modern war, no country could hope for ultimate military success unless its armed forces were adequatelysupported by productive resources; and the figures given in cp. (49) 123 revealed the weakness of the Soviet Union in thisrespect. Against this, it was pointed out that comparisons of steel production in this context might prove misleading; it was necessaryalso to analyse the comparative figures of steel consumption. for various reasons, the proportion of steel output in the Soviet Unionallocated to military uses was substantially higher than in thiscountry or the United States. The Soviet Union was ready and ablereleased without delay if the British representatives were willing,in an exchange of notes, to &quot;acknowledge the basic facts that aBritish warship had intruded indiscreetly into. the CP.L.A.Frontier Area without their permission &quot; and to give an assurance that negotiations would be continued later. In view of the serioushardships suffered by the crew of H.M.S. Amethyst, every effort should be made to take advantage of this change of attitude on thepart of the Communist authorities. On the other hand, he had been advised that the admission that H.M.S.. Amethyst had &quot;intrudedindiscreetly &quot; into these waters was likely to prejudice the positionof His Maiesty&apos;s Government in making a claim for compensationagainst a Communist Government in China or in resisting any claim which that Government might bring against them.While there was general agreement that every effort should bemade to take advantage of any change of attitude on the part ofthe Communist authorities on this question, Ministers thought itwould be undesirable to accept any form of words which wouldunduly prejudice the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government in any subsequent claim for compensation.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider, in consultationwith the First Lord of the Admiralty, the terms of the reply to be sent to the message from the commanding officer of H.M.S. Amethyst.
to offset her relative shortage of steel in war by expending her vastman-power resources to an extent which would not be regarded astolerable by the Western countries. The events of the last war had revealed the difficulties of estimating the military strength of theSoviet Union.The Cabinet-Took note of CP. (49) 123 and of the points made in discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,23rd June, 1949.
