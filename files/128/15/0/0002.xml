1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (49) 3) outlining a draft constitution for a. Councilof Europe which he proposed that the British delegates to the Com-mittee on European Unity should put forward as an alternative tothe proposals prepared by a sub-committee of that Committee.The Foreign Secretary explained that the sub-committee of theCommittee on European Unity in their proposals had endeavoured to find common ground between the different views which had beensubmitted to the Committee. In addition to a small Council ofEurope consisting of Ministers, the sub-committee proposed a european Consultative Assembly which would consist of memberschosen by the various European legislative chambers. This ideahad been sponsored by the French Socialists, who had it in mind that the European Consultative Assembly might be used to bringpublic pressure to bear upon their Government. In his view it was important that the larger body, meeting in public, should representGovernments, quite as much as the smaller Council or Committeeof Ministers. He had accordingly framed alternative proposals under which the Council of Europe would consist of a Conference,composed of national delegations nominated by Governments and each led by a Minister, and a smaller Committee of Ministers whichwould meet in private. He hoped that the proposed Council ofEurope would provide a focal point under which the various bodies which had been set up under recent international arrangementsrelating to Europe might be co-ordinated and, if necessary,reorganised.The Cabinet endorsed the general approach proposed by theForeign Secretary. In detailed discussion of his proposals, thefollowing points were made : (a) While there should be sufficient difference in size to differ-entiate the Conference from the Committee of Ministers, the Confer-ence should not be too large. Large national delegations (such as,say, twenty-five from the United Kingdom) would make it difficultto avoid bringing in members of the Opposition and would leave anumber of delegates with no useful functions to perform. On theother hand, if the Conference were,small, the delegations from the lesser Powers would be so few in number that difficulty might befound in comprising within each the various necessary elements,particularly where Coalition Governments were represented. Thebest compromise would be to provide that the larger Powers shouldhave a representation of twelve each, and to regard this as amaximum which should not be exceeded.(&amp;) In describing the functions of the Conference reference should not be made to further work on European unity, since thiswould tend to encourage academic debates on federalism. It would,however, be undesirable to preclude the Conference altogether fromdiscussing matters other than those placed before it by the Coni-mittee of Ministers. Urgent issues might arise after the Committeeof Ministers had agreed upon an agenda for the Conference, andin any event the Conference should not appear to be tied too tightlyin its agenda. A provision should accordingly be included-that a subject might be put on the agenda if it were supported by two-thirds of the votes at the Conference.(a) In view of the large number of international conferenceswhich Ministers had to attend, the Conference should not ordinarilymeet more than once a year, though it might be necessary from timeto time to hold extraordinary sessions.id) Voting in the Conference by national delegations should bein proportion to their size, votes being cast by the heads of delegations.(e) While it was desirable that the Conference should have afull-time Secretary-General, every endeavour should be made tokeep the permanent staff as small as possible.
(/) The Foreign Secretary said that he did not think that theCouncil should meet in London or Paris. He himself favouredStrasbourg.   The Cabinet supported this suggestion.(g) The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that at theCommittee on European Unity he would propose to put forward theForeign Secretary&apos;s proposals as a carefully considered schemewhich had to be regarded as a whole and on the essentials of whichhe was not prepared to compromise. If other schemes were pressed,the various alternatives would have to go forward for examination by the Foreign Ministers.The Cabinet (1) Approved the draft heads of a constitution for a Councilof Europe set out in Appendix B to CP. (49) 3, subjectto the modifications noted above.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to arrange for theseproposals to be put before the Committee on european unity at its next plenary meeting.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (49) 7) on the Indonesian question.The Foreign Secretary outlined the developments which hadtaken place since he made his last report to the Cabinet on 22ndDecember. He was convinced that the right course for the dutch government to pursue was to give to the Security Council satis-f satisfactory assurances about the cease-fire and the release of political prisoners and to put before them a plan for the immediate formationof a comprehensive interim Government (including the Republic),the early holding of elections and the transfer of power to an inde-pendent sovereign Indonesian Union on a fixed date. Subject tothe Cabinet&apos;s views, he proposed to continue to press the dutch government to take this course. The United Kingdom Representa-tive on the Security Council had been instructed to concentrate onurging the Dutch Government to carry out the resolutions alreadypassed by the Council and to adopt a constructive approach towardsthe final settlement of the problem. He had also been instructedto be critical of the past failure of the Dutch Government to carryout the CounciFs resolutions. It was, however, important that weshould do nothing to provoke a direct collision between the dutch government and the Security Council; for if the Dutch made theclaim that, in view of their sovereignty over Indonesia, the security council were not competent to deal with this matter, we should find it difficult to contest that claim.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the australian government were likely to press for the immediate withdrawal ofthe Dutch troops in Indonesia. We should find it difficult tosupport such a suggestion. Apart from the practical point thatthe Dutch forces were now widely dispersed over the whole territory,there was evidence that the anxieties of the local inhabitants hadbeen largely allayed by the arrival of the Dutch troops. No regular forces were opposing the Dutch troops; and it seemed likely that even guerilla activities would not be widespread.The Cabinet-Approved the policy outlined in CP. (49) 7.3. The Foreign Secretary said that President Chiang Kai-shekhad asked whether the Governments of the United Kingdom, theUnited States, the Soviet Union and France would be prepared to mediate between himself and his Communist adversaries in China.The Foreign Secretary had ascertained that the United StatesGovernment were proposing to decline this invitation.   He had
suggested that, before such a reply was sent, it might be expedient to enquire how the Governments of France and the Soviet Unionproposed to reply; but the United States Government were unwilling to make such an enquiry. The Secretaries of State for Common-wealth Relations and the Colonies both felt that our relations withthe Asiatic peoples within the Commonwealth might well be pre-prejudiced if we intervened in the Chinese dispute at the present stage.The Foreign Secretary said that, from his own point of view, hewould much prefer not to intervene.In discussion it was recognised that the Soviet Government were likely to accept this invitation from President Chiang Kai-shek,and to exploit to the full the opportunity which it would give themfor extending their influence throughout China. It was, however,agreed that it would be inexpedient for the United Kingdom to intervene in this matter.The Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to inform PresidentChiang Kai-shek that the United Kingdom Governmentwere not prepared to mediate between his Government andthe Communists in China.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,12th January, 1949.
