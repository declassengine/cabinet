23 CM. 34 (49)&quot;        131Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in     the House of Commons in the following week.the House ofCommons.Amendmentof the parliament act.(previous reference erence:CM. (48) 39thConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The Lord President recalled that, in order to comply withthe Parliament Act Procedure, the Parliament Bill could not be sent up to the House of Lords for the third time before 11th November,1949, when two years would have expired from the date of its firstSecond Reading in the Commons. Even so, he and the Lord privy seal were inclined to think that it would be wise if the SecondReading of the Bill were taken in the House of Commons in thecourse of the summer, so as to make plain the Governments intentionto secure that the Bill was passed into law by the end of the year.After discussion, the Cabinet Agreed that the Second Reading of the Parliament bill might be taken in the House of Commons at such date afterthe beginning of July as might prove most convenient forthe arrangement of legislative business in the House ofCommons.Ireland.(previous reference:CM.(49)21stConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Cabinet were informed that a small number of Govern-ment supporters had abstained from voting in the Division on theSecond Reading of the Ireland Bill on the previous evening. Therewas some anxiety about the provision in Clause 1 (1) (6) of the Bill,guaranteeing the territorial integrity of Northern Ireland, byreason of a lack of confidence in the fairness of the electoral arrange-ments in force in Northern Ireland. Doubts were being expressed about the wisdom of leaving the powers of veto conferred by that clause in the hands of a Parliament which might not fairly reflect the people&apos;s will. In the Cabinefs discussion the suggestion wasmade that, after the Bill had been passed, the United KingdomGovernment might take steps to satisfy themselves that the NorthernIreland Parliament was, in fact, so constituted as to reflect fairlythe views of the electors. It was, however, the general view ofMinisters that the United Kingdom Government would be ill-advised to appear to be interesting themselves in this matter, which fellwholly within the jurisdiction of the Northern Ireland Government.The Home Secretary said that he had received informationsuggesting that the Dublin Government might be intending to relaxsuch efforts as they had hitherto been making to check illegal drillingand other activities of the Irish Republican Army. This might involve an increased risk of outbreaks of violence in NorthernIreland and even in Great Britain. Such precautionary measures as could be taken were being put in hand.In this connection the Lord President recalled that the cabinet had agreed on 12th January that, if the question of defendingNorthern Ireland against aggression was raised in the Parlia-mentary discussions, the Government spokesman should say that northern Ireland would be defended against aggression just likeany other part of the United Kingdom. He had refrained from making any such statement in replying to the debate on the previous day, since that question had not been directly raised in the debate.He wondered, however, whether it would not now be expedient to seek an opportunity for giving this assurance by arranging that thequestion should be raised in the course of the further proceedings on the Ireland Bill.37127-2b 2
The Cabinet, after discussion, reaffirmed their view that, while this assurance should be given if the question were raised, theGovernment should not themselves take any initiative either involunteering the assurance or in arranging for the question to beraised in debate so that the assurance might be publicly given.4. The Foreign Secretary said that the blockade on Berlin hadbeen raised that morning, in accordance with the agreement reached between the four Powers.The Soviet authorities had, however, sought to change in onerespect the arrangements for rail transport which had been in opera-tion before the blockade. They had suggested that engines shouldbe changed when trains passed a zonal boundary, whereas previouslythe engines had remained unchanged. It was possible that theymight seek to found some point of principles upon such a change ofprocedure; and he had therefore thought it right to instruct theMilitary Governor to raise objection to the proposed change with theSoviet authorities.The Cabinet took note of the Foreign SecretaryVstatement.5. The Foreign Secretary said that the Dutch Government andthe Indonesian leaders had now been able to reach a provisional agreement on the basis of the Djokjakarta draft, and arrangements were being made for a conference to be held at The Hague. Thiswas a promising development, and it was to be hoped that it might prove the prelude to a final agreement on the Indonesian problem.It was understood that, if the Indonesian leaders were allowedto return to Djokjakarta, the Indian Government would be willingto send an Ambassador to The Hague, and would remove the existingban on the use of Indian airports by Dutch civil aircraft.The Cabinet took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.6.   The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda : CP. (49) 82: by the Minister of Health, proposing theappointment of a Royal Commission to report on the functions and structure of local government in England and Wales,including London;CP. (49) 101 : by the Lord President, outlining the objec-tions to the appointment of a Royal Commission and suggesting that an inter-departmental committee of officials should be setup to present the current problems in local government forconsideration by Ministers;CP. (49) 102 : by the Minister of Town and country planning, suggesting that on planning grounds an early decisionon the future pattern of local government was required and thatthis seemed to weigh against the appointment of a RoyalCommission.The Minister of Health said that, in view of the controversialnature of the subject, there should be no legislation on local govern-ment before the General Election. In his view, this ruled out any suggestion that the duties of the Local Government boundary commission should be enlarged to include London&apos;s problems.Indeed, in view of the unsatisfactory character of the task which now fell to the Boundary Commission, he desired that their work should be suspended. There were profound differences of opinion in local government circles about the future organisation of localgovernment and these differences were likely to be reflected in theviews of Ministers. He thought that, in the long run, the mostexpeditious course would be to refer the problem to a Royal
Commission. A unanimous report by a Royal Commission would carry such a weight of authority that it would enable the Govern-ment to over-ride any dissentient voices in local government circles.If, as was perhaps more likely, the members of the Commissionfailed to agree, this would strengthen the hands of the Governmentin imposing their own solution. On further consideration sincesubmitting his memorandum, he had reached the conclusion that theneed to modify the functions and structure of local government wasnot so urgent as was generally supposed. The present pattern,though untidy, worked reasonably well; and a Royal commission could be allowed to examine the subject without haste. The result might well be that the Government would not have to take firm decisions on the subject until after any General Election in 1955.His Department was heavily pressed with other work, and the delay would be welcome from that point of view. It might be useful tohave an inter-departmental committee of officials to recommend whatterms of reference should be laid down for a Royal Commission.The Lord President said that he thought the Government, onthe mass of information available, should, be able to make up their minds on the future of local government and should then discuss their proposals with local authority representatives and othersbefore framing legislation. In order to assist Ministers in formulating proposals, he favoured the appointment of an inter-departmental committee &quot;of officials which could privately andspeedily collect the facts and offer comments on constructivesuggestions such as those contained in the 1947 Report of the boundary Commission. It might also be useful to ask the boundary commission to consider simultaneously the organisation of localgovernment in Greater London. There were urgent problems of localgovernment including boundary extensions, and the present Govern-ment had had the 1947 Report of the Boundary Commission with itsfar-reaching recommendations since March 1948. He did not thinkit desirable to contemplate the postponement of major legislation on this subject until some time after 1955.The Minister of Town and Country Planning said that, fromthe point of view of his Departmental responsibilities, the reorganisation -sation of local government was urgent. It was not practicable to implement the Greater London plan while the present structure oflocal government in that area remained as it now was; and planning and development throughout the country were being distorted by the uncertainty about the future functions and boundaries of localauthorities.In further discussion the following points were made : *(a) Ministers could not evade their responsibility for taking decisions on the future functions and structure of local government.Even if a Royal Commission were appointed, the Government oughtto express a view to the Commission; and, when the Commission^report had been received, it would be necessary for the Governmentto resolve any differences of opinion which might exist between ministers on the subject and to take final decisions.(b) A new situation in local government had been created bythe transfer of the trading services to public boards, of hospitals tothe Ministry of Health and of various functions (such as town and country planning, education and fire services) from one class of localauthorities to another. The situation had greatly altered since the boundary Commission was set up in 1945.(c) The main issue for decision was whether the reorganisation of local government was urgent or not. The appointment of a RoyalCommission would be primarily a delaying device, since the mainfacts and the views of the various authorities and organisations concerned were known and could be brought together for considera-tion by Ministers.
(d) The procedure contemplated by the Minister of Healthassumed a succession of five-year Parliaments. If there were a succession of relatively - short Parliaments, the appointment of aEoyal Commission might lead to an indefinite postponement ofGovernment decisions on this subject.(e) It was by no means clear that the pattern of local governmentshould be uniform throughout the country. London had always been treated exceptionally. The time had probably come when other areas, notably Lancashire and Glamorgan, should also be treatedspecially.The Prime Minister said that it appeared to be the general viewof the Cabinet that Ministers should first endeavour to reach agree-ment on the main principles which should govern the reorganisation of local government. In his view, the best course would be for aCommittee of Ministers to discuss the underlying principles; and,when agreement had been reached, to refer the matter to an inter-departmental committee of officials to fill in the details. One of theearliest problems which any such Committee of Ministers should consider was the future of the Boundary Commission.The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister to constitute a committee ofMinisters, under his chairmanship, to consider the main principles which should govern the reorganisation of localgovernment in England and Wales.New Town 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordCorporations. President (CP. (49) 86) on the remuneration of members of newRemuneration town corporations. The Lord Presidents Committee had consideredof Members. this question on 5th April and had been unable to reach agreement.The Minister of Town and Country Planning said that the main question at issue was whether new town corporations should beregarded as similar to the public boards which operated gas and electricity services or as similar to local authorities. The corpora-tions were engaged in constructing towns of 60,000 inhabitants, eachof which might cost as much as  35 million to build. While someof the members could be drawn from neighbouring local authorities,it was essential to have some professional and business men on the corporations, and the services of people of the necessary competencecould not, in his view, be obtained unless a salary was paid.In discussion, the following points were made : (a) Some members of local authorities, particularly the chairmen of the more important committees, undertook without pay duties which seemed to some Ministers to be as heavy as those falling on themembers of new town corporations. The members of regional hospital Boards were not paid. Everything possible should be done to maintain the principle of voluntary public service and to avoid the multiplication of paid appointments at the disposal of theGovernment.(b) The Economic Secretary, Treasury, said that the Treasurysaw no sufficient reason to oppose the payment of members of newtown corporations. Very large sums of money were to be spent onthe new towns, and it was expedient that the members of the corporations should be competent persons who could see that themoney was spent to good advantage.(c) The present system of payment had been in force for threeyears and was related to the payments made to the part-time members of public boards. If a fresh start had been.possible in allthe arrangements for the boards and corporations, differentprinciples might have been applied in some cases
(d) When a new town was being established careful considera-tion should be given to the question whether it could not be run by a local authority in the manner in which Manchester wasaccepting responsibility for the development of Mobberley.(e) There appeared to be a case for reducing the salary paidto the vice-chairmen of new town corporations from  1,000 to 750 a year.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the salary paid to future vice-chairmen of newtown corporations and to existing vice-chairmen onre-appointment should be reduced from  1,000 to  750a year, but that no change should, be made in the salary of  400 a year paid to ordinary members of corporations.(2) Invited the Minister of Town and Country Planning to give special consideration, on the establishment of each newtown, to the question whether the work might appro-appropriately be entrusted to a local authority rather than toa new town corporation.Food.Meat Ration.(previous reference:CM. (49) 27thConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (CP. (49) 103) on the meat ration.The Minister of Food said that, in view of the latest forecasts of prospective supplies, he would feel justified in increasing the weekly ration of carcase meat from lid. (8d. at the old prices) toIs. Id. (lOd. at the old prices). At the same time, in order to avoidencroaching further on strategic reserves of meat, he felt bound torecommend that the supplementary ration of canned meat should cease to be issued.The Cabinet-Approved the recommendation in CP. (49) 103 that, asfrom 22nd May, the weekly ration of carcase meat shouldbe increased by 2d. and the supplementary ration of2d. worth of canned meat should cease to be issued.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,12th May, 1949.
