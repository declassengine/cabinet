1. The Cabinet had before them memoranda on the progressof the National Health Service prepared by the Minister of Health- (CP. (48) 302) and by the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (48)308) in December, 1948, together with supplementary memoranda(CP. (49) 105 and 106) &quot;by those Ministers reporting on develop-ments since the submission of the earlier memoranda.The Minister of Health said that he presumed that- hiscolleagues would wish to devote their attention mainly to the costof the National Health Service and he wished to draw attentionto the difficulties of fitting this new service into the system of annualbudgeting during its early formative stages. These difficulties hadbeen increased by the lack of complete information about the finances of voluntary hospitals and even, to some extent, of the local authoritymedical services. The Estimate for 1948-49 had necessarily been to a large extent conjectural; and even for the second year the regional Hospital Boards had had to submit their proposals within six weeks of being appointed. The Treasu^ had asked that theoriginal proposals for the 1949-50 Estimate should be cut by 28 million, and the boards had been asked to review their proposals on that basis. But, as a result of their further review, the Boardshad found that they had substantially under-estimated their probable expenditure. If the Boards were to be compelled to keepwithin the Estimate given in the Budget, they would have to reducethe number of hospital beds to a level below that obtaining beforethe National Health Service came into operation. Meanwhile, theMinister said that he had reduced the fees paid to dentists, andto ophthalmologists and opticians; and he was proposing to make some reduction in the allowances paid to chemists for containers.These reductions would yield an economy of  13 million in a full. year; but there would be little benefit this year, since it wouldtake some time before the reductions were reflected in the accounts.Suggestions of extravagance in administrative overheads were, inhis opinion, unfounded since administrative costs amounted to no more than 2-1 per cent, of the total cost of the service (3-5 per cent.in Scotland). This low percentage figure was partly due to theunpaid service rendered on Regional Hospital Boards and other bodies by between 10,000 and 11,000 individuals throughout thecountry. The need for a Supplementary Estimate this year (which,so far as could be foreseen at present, might amount to  52 million for England and Wales and  57 million for Great Britain as awhole) would arise primarily from the cost of running the hospitals,and salaries and wages accounted for 54 per cent, of the hospitals&apos;expenditure. In his view, it was unthinkable that a supplementary estimate should be avoided by closing down beds which were urgently required; nor did he consider that Ministers should entertain theidea of imposing a charge for services, particularly for hospital treatment. The imposition of a, charge would greatly reduce the prestige of the National Health Service and the need to waive itin necessitous cases would introduce many complications and an expensive administration. Against the increased cost of the service to the Exchequer must be set the benefit to the community of thefacilities which it was providing and the gains to the national economy of a.higher level of national health.The Secretary of State for Scotland agreed with the views expressed by the Minister of Health. There were some signs thatin Scotland the demand for spectacles and dentures was beginning to fall off. In his view it was out of the question to attempt to cut costs by reducing hospital accommodation, particularly in viewof the rising incidence of tuberculosis in Scotland. A system of charges for services would cause endless administrative troubles,and he would rather see a higher rate of national insurance contri-bution. It might be necessary to review the salaries paid to-2 b 2
specialists, who were thought to be receiving about 50 per cent,more than they received before the service came into operation.There might be some extravagance in the issue of medical supplies which would have to be dealt with by disciplinary means; but themain cost of the scheme as a whole lay in wages and salaries,particularly in the hospital service.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the prospect of alarge Supplementary Estimate for the National Health&apos; Servicepresented him with a serious problem, particularly since the needcame to light so soon after the preparation of his Budget and afterthe specific statement in his Budget speech that only in special cases,such as major changes of policy, could any Supplementary Estimatebe considered. He could not see his way to agree to accept at thisstage the need for a Supplementary Estimate. Pressure should stillbe brought to bear on those responsible for running the national health Service to induce them to bring costs within the figurementioned in the Budget. At the same time he thought it was reasonable that the Cabinet should give the Health Ministers an assurance that vital hospital services would not be cut down: he recognised that any pruning of vital features would greatly impair the value of the whole National Health Service. As regards thefuture, he thought that there was need for an examination of themachinery for controlling the expenditure of the Regional hospital boards. The arrangements for scrutinising their annual estimates of expenditure might be adequate, but there seemed to be no effective means of ensuring that the Boards did not, in fact, spend morethan they had budgeted for. This arose partly from the fact thatthe Boards had no responsibility for finding any of the money andpartly because they had the independent position which flowed fromtheir voluntary status. When pressed to reduce expenditure, theywere perhaps a little apt to claim that, if reductions were made,it would be the essential services which would suffer. The regional hospital Board system had been quite novel, so far as concerned the relations between Ministry, Board and hospitals, and he wasnot satisfied that financial control by the Ministry was likely to growwith the passage of time unless the system was examined andpossibly altered to secure the minimum requirements of theGovernment.In subsequent discussion, the following points were made: (a) There was general support for the view that the relationsbetween the Health Departments and the Regional Hospital boards in matters of finance merited examination. The Boards werenominally under the complete control of the Health Ministers, butin fact both the Boards and the management committees were ina strong position, since they could enlist a good deal of public support by representing that central control was operating to deprive the public of essential services. If Regional Hospital Boards were left in a position of considerable freedom, local authorities would soon claim that they too should be emancipated from close financial control by the central Government.(b) The scales of remuneration for specialists fixed by the SpensCommittee appeared to be unnecessarily generous, particularly tojunior clinicians. The scales had also had an unsettling effect on other professional salaries in the Universities and among localauthorities. .(c) Although the cost of administering the National health service was low expressed as a percentage of the total cost of theservice, there was a widespread impression that some regional hospital Boards and other bodies were extravagantly, staffed interms of numbers and scales of pay. This caused discontent amonglocal authority staffs.
45CM. 37 (49)        144(d) A measure of extravagance in the supply of spectacles,dentures, surgical appliances and medical supplies could probably not be wholly checked until health centres were established andserviced by whole-time officers. The dilemma with which the health ministers were faced was that the capital cost of establishing suchcentres would greatly increase the total expenditure on the health service at the outset, even though they would lead ultimately to asubstantial annual saving. Special care would have to be taken thathealth centres were not planned on too extravagant lines.(e) There had been some public criticism of the fact thatforeigners visiting this country could make full use of the facilities offered by the National Health Service. The Health Ministers, in informing persons visiting this country of the facilities which wereavailable, had had primarily in mind British sailors and Britishsubjects resident abroad who were visiting this country. Ultimatelyit was hoped to arrange for these services to be provided by a numberof countries on a reciprocal basis, and the subject seemed to be asuitable one for discussion in the Council of Europe.(/) The Cabinet also discussed some other specific allegationswhich were being made of extravagance in the Health Service, and reference was made to the political difficulties to which these were likely to give rise. It was pointed out that some anomalies andirregularities were inevitable in the first few years after the intro-duction of a comprehensive service of this magnitude; and it was recognised that even isolated examples of extravagance were likelyto be emphasised by persons who were opposed to the scheme. Thenumber of these cases would, however, be progressively reduced,&apos; as time went on, as a result of disciplinary action.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of CP. (48) 302 and 308 and CP. (49) 105and 106.(2) Agreed that it would not be practicable to meet any risein the cost of the National Health Service by cutting down essential hospital services.(3) Agreed that the need for a Supplementary Estimate for theNational Health Service in the current financial year should not yet be accepted in principle, and that allpossible endeavours should be made by those responsiblefor the administration of the Service to bring the costwithin the figures given in the Estimates.(4) Invited the Health Ministers, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to examine the adequacy of the existing methods of controlling the expenditureof public funds by Regional Hospital Boards.NationalInsuranceSchemes.(previous reference erence:C.M.(46)6thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof National Insurance (CP. (49) 14) reporting on the progress whichhad been made in carrying into effect the provisions of the national insurance Act, 1946, and the National Insurance (industrial injuries) Act, 1946.The Minister of National Insurance said that there was one point on which he wished to supplement the information given inhis memorandum. His Department were now obtaining for the first time complete information about accidents and injuries in industry;and it was noteworthy that one-third of the claims for disablementbenefit were in respect of pneumoconiosis and industrial dermatitis.While the number of serious accidents seemed to be going down(though the total number of accidents reported showed some increase)it was disturbing to find how heavy was. the toll of industrial
diseases, notably of dermatitis and similar preventable complaints.In consultation with the Medical Research Council, arrangements were being made for a determined campaign to reduce the incidence of preventable industrial disease.There was general agreement that the National insurance schemes had been brought into effect with smoothness and efficiency.The Cabinet^-Took note of CP. (49) 14.Telegraph 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Postmaster-Bill. General (CP. (49) 117), prepared in the light of the Cabinefs(Previous discussion on 19th May, showing how the proposed telephone rentalReference: increases could best be imposed by notice to individual subscribersCM. (49)36th and the extent to which revenue would be lost if this procedure were conclusions,     adopted instead of legislation.Minute 2.) The Cabinet first considered whether it would be expedient towithdraw the Budget proposals for increasing telephone rentalcharges. The simplified procedure for giving individual notices,proposed by the Postmaster-General in CP. (49) 117,&apos; would probablycost about  200,000 and subscribers would be faced with increased charges beginning with the period between January and July 1950.The Lord President and other Ministers felt that these increases were inexpedient on political grounds, and attention was drawn tothe undesirability of increasing the charge made by a socialisedindustry at a time when other industries were being called upon to cut their costs and prices. It was also awkward that the increasedrentals could not yet be justified on the score of increased costs of installation and maintenance. Against these considerations, itwas pointed out that the revenue to be derived from the increasein rentals, amounting to almost  4 million in a full year, was wellworth the administrative cost of bringing them into operation andthat no new considerations of a kind which could be used in debatehad been brought to light since the Budget statement was made.The possibility of increased Government expenditure in variousdirections made it difficult at this juncture to abandon any source of revenue which had entered into the Budget calculations.There was general agreement that, if the increase in telephonerental charges were proceeded with, the balance of advantage layin varying individual contracts, rather than in proceeding by legisla-tion, particularly since there was now no prospect of bringing theincreased charges into operation, even by legislation, before 1st January, 1950. Legislation would, however, be necessary to make some necessary financial adjustments between the Postmaster-General and the Hull City Council in respect of its telephoneundertaking.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, if the proposal to increase telephone rentalcharges were proceeded with, the increases should beeffected by a variation of individual contracts and not by legislation.(2) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the Speaker andthe Opposition Leaders to be informed that legislation would not be introduced to authorise any increase intelephone rental charges, and that the question could therefore be discussed during the debate on telephonecharges which was to be held in Committee of supply in the House of Commons that afternoon.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,23rd May, 1949.
