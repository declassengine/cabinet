defence estimates.(previous reference:CM. (48) 1stConclusions,Minute 1.)The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofDefence (CP. (49) 16) proposing that the Defence Estimates for1949-50 should total  760 million. The First Lord of theAdmiralty and the Secretary of State for Air had accepted thecomponents of this total which concerned their Departments, butthe Secretary of State for War wished to press for  306 million for the War Office, instead of  304-7 million.The Minister of Defence explained that the original estimates of requirements had totalled  833 million, and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer had at that stage indicated that he was unwilling tomake more than  700 million available for defence. Three down-ward revisions and further discussions with the Chancellor of theExchequer had reduced the figure to  760 million, which included 2,350^000 for the Berlin air lift. This drastic pruning of service requirements meant that, while the emergency programme ofSeptember last would be maintained, there would be some postpone-ment of the re-equipment of the Services and of the long-termplans for improving living conditions. A start would, however, bemade with production for re-equipping the three Services with modern weapons and with the building-up of Service stocks of oil.The Secretary of State for War said that the figure of 304-7 million for the War Office was not founded on a revised estimate of the various detailed items. He thought it would bedifficult in practice to avoid spending less than  306 million; and,if he were to accept the figure of  304 - 7 million, he could only hope to keep within it by increased appropriations-in-aid derived frommore intensive efforts to sell surplus stocks.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was satisfied,after a scrutiny of requirements, that in present circumstances atotal amount of  760 million was needed if the fighting services were to be effective instruments. If this figure was approved bythe Cabinet, he must ask that the War Office should take special steps to keep their expenditure within the limit of  304-7 million.It was essential that approved estimates should not be exceeded. Asregards the future, the Services had failed so far to work out a properly co-ordinated scheme of defence and he had agreed withthe Minister of Defence that a co-ordinated plan, which might bringgreat financial savings, should be prepared by May next.In discussion, the following points were made : (a) The need to enable the Services to be used effectively in any emergency in the near future, coupled with the need to reorganiseand re-equip them for more effective use in some future emergency,involved a heavy financial burden, as did rising costs of produc-tion and the need to rely more and more on fresh production, dueto the dwindling and obsolescence of war-time stocks.(&amp;) A high proportion of Defence expenditure representedoverheads and similar expenditure which was not susceptible ofquick reduction.  Further cuts, if imposed, would have to fall onEroposals for re-equipment and modernisation, where they wouldave a disproportionate effect on the efficiency of the Services.(c) The Army still absorbed a higher proportion of theestimates than the Admiralty or the Air Ministry. The Royal AirForce might become the largest component in the future, but thiswould depend on further work which had to be done on the balance between the three Services. The Fleet Air Arm already accountedfor one-third of the man-power and almost one-third of the moneydevoted to the Navy.[d) The reductions which the three Service Ministers had had toaccept would seriously affect the works programme for married quarters and other living accommodation. Army Commanders athome and abroad had stressed the danger of substantial discontentbecause of the scarcity of adequate married quarters.   The same36527-2b 2
was true of the Royal Air Force, where the recruitment of long-servicemen would be greatly eased if better living quarters couldbe provided.(e) The Service Ministers had instituted various enquiries, inwhich the assistance of outside experts had been enlisted, for theimprovement of Service organisation.   Further opportunities foremploying  persons  experienced  in  large-scale  organisation  in.reviews of Service administration should not be overlooked.(/) It was suggested that the accumulation of reserve stocksof oil and other stores might be distinguished from other Serviceexpenditure, since it represented expenditure on materials whichwould not be used until required and, if not required, could be(g) The higher Service Estimates would not necessarily require a reduction in the sums available for social services, since it was likely that the increase could be met out of the higher national income which was expected in 1949-50.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the Defence Estimates for 1949-50, totalling 760 million, outlined in CP. (49) 16.(2) Took note that the Minister of Defence would submit areport to the Defence Committee by May next on theresults of an investigation which was being made intothe future shape and size of the defence forces.Palestine.(previous reference;O.M.(49)4thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that, since the Cabinefsmeeting on 17th January, further consultations had been held with commonwealth and Western Union Governments about the de factorecognition of the Government of Israel. The Prime Ministers ofAustralia and New Zealand had asked that no announcement shouldbe made until they had been able to consult their Cabinets later in the week. The Governments of Pakistan and Ceylon were opposed to the grant of recognition; but there were signs that theGovernment of India, while still unwilling to accord recognition,might shortly adopt a more favourable view. The French Govern-ment were ready to grant recognition if they could conclude a satis-factory agreement on certain questions which they were discussing with the Government of Israel, and it was possible that these discussions might be successfully concluded later that day. the benelux Governments were anxious that all the Western UnionGovernments should accord recognition simultaneously and had suggested that the question should be discussed at the meetingof the Consultative Council to be held later in the week. In thesecircumstances the Foreign Secretary thought it would be a seriousmistake for the United Kingdom Government to proceed forthwith to accord recognition of the Government of Israel. If we actedindependently, we should give offence to Commonwealth and western Union Governments who were not opposed in principle to the grant of recognition; and it was right that we should act in concert with those Governments in view of the strategic importanceof the Middle East to the defence of the Commonwealth and western Europe generally. There were other arguments againstmaking too hasty a move. By acting alone, we should be widelyregarded as having condoned the action of the Government of Israelin breaking the United Nations truce and disregarding the security council&apos;s rulings. We could not afford to alienate Moslem andAsiatic opinion by appearing indifferent to our obligations both tothe Arabs and to the United Nations. It would, however, be neces-sary for him to make some announcement in the debate on palestine in the House of Commons on 26th January; and he therefore proposed to include in his speech a general statement to the effectthat the United Kingdom Government had decided to consult
immediately with the Commonwealth Governments concerned andwith the Governments of Western Union with a view to the de factorecognition of the Government of Israel, having in mind the impor-tance of establishing direct relations with that Government at anearly date.After discussion it was agreed that in the circumstances described it would be inexpedient for the Foreign Secretary to go beyond the formula which he had suggested in the debate on26th January. It would, however, be embarrassing if the FrenchGovernment took independent action in advance of the meeting ofthe Consultative Council, and it was agreed that every effort shouldbe made to dissuade them from doing so.In further discussion, the following points were made: (a) If the results of the Israeli elections were satisfactory, theUnited States Government might decide to accord de jure recogni-tion to Israel and Trans Jordan simultaneously. It had not, how-ever, been found possible to proceed with the proposal, which theForeign Secretary had put to the Cabinet on 17th January, foran announcement of Anglo-American agreement on Middle Eastpolicy as a whole.(b) The Foreign Secretary said that he was being strongly pressed by some of the Arab Governments to provide limited quantities of military equipment and spare parts which were urgently required for internal security purposes. He thought that,subject to proper safeguards, some of these requests might be met.We had undertaken obligations to these Governments, and weshould be open to criticism if we allowed the embargo on the sale ofarms and equipment to make it impossible for them to maintaininternal order.It was pointed out that an unfavourable impression would be created if it became known that we were sending arms to arab states while the discussions on the recognition of the Governmentof Israel were still proceeding. The Foreign Secretary undertook to submit to the Defence Committee detailed recommendations regarding the action to be taken on these requests.(c) The Prime Minister said that he had been concerned at&quot; thefurther reports which had appeared in the press about the cabinet&apos;s earlier discussions on Palestine. He felt it necessary once again to ask that Ministers should observe the greatest discretion inregard to the proceedings of the Cabinet.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should announce in theHouse of Commons on 26th January that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment proposed to consult with the other Common-wealth Governments and with Western Union Govern-ments with a view to the de facto recognition of theGovernment of Israel.(is) Invited the Foreign Secretary to ask the French Govern-meni to defer announcing their recognition of Israeluntil the question had been discussed by the western union Consultative Council.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to submit to the DefenceCommittee detailed proposals regarding the requests for arms and equipment received from Arab Governments.
Treaty forAustria.(previous reference:CM. (48)27thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C.P. (49) 15) regarding the proposed resumptionof the negotiations on the draft Treaty for Austria.At the beginning of December 1948 the Austrian Governmenthad invited the Four Occupying Powers to seek a basis on which theTreaty negotiations could usefully be resumed; and, as a result, itwas proposed that the Foreign Secretaries&apos; Deputies should resume their discussions in London on or about 7th February. The repre-sentatives of France, the United Kingdom and the United states had indicated their readiness to fall in with this proposal; andthe Soviet Government, though they had not yet replied, were alsoexpected to agree.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, that the discussions on the draft treaty for Austria were likely to be resumed in the nearfuture.tribunals of Inquiry(Evidence)Act, 1921.Inquiry intoAllegationsagainstMinisters and officials ofthe Board ofTrade, &amp;a.(previous reference:CM. (49) 5th1 Conclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet were informed that copies of the Report of theLynskey Tribunal would be available in the Vote Office of the Houseof Commons at 6 p.m. on 25th January. Ministers who wished toobtain a copy of the Report without personal attendance at the vote Office could obtain a copy from the Home Office, at or after that hour, on application to the Home Secretary&apos;s Private Secretary.The Lord President was likely to be asked, in connection withhis Statement on Business on 27tn January, whether the Govern-ment would provide facilities for an early debate on the Reportin the House of Commons. The Cabinet&quot; were inclined to thinkthat, if a debate were requested, there would be advantages in holding it at the earliest convenient date.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,24th January, 1949.
