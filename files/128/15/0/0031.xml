The Foreign Secretary said that he had been unable to persuade the Governments of the United States and France to agreewith the view, which had been endorsed by the Cabinet on24th February, that the Austrians ought now to be free to establishnew political parties without first securing the consent of the occupying Powers. Meanwhile, Government supporters in thiscountry were showing interest in this matter, and notice had beengiven that a Question would be put to him about it in the House ofCommons that afternoon. He was anxious to avoid having to disclosethat there was disagreement on this question between the occupying powers; and information had just reached him to the effect that37011-2 b 21. The Foreign Secretary said that the further discussions atthe Preparatory Conference for the establishment of a Council ofEurope did not make it necessary for him to bring back to theCabinet any of the major points which they had considered on28th April. He was having some difficulty over the suggestion thatthe revised draft of Article 20 (a) (vi) should refer to decisions by common agreement as well as decisions by a two-thirds majority.The general feeling at the Conference was that the reference to a two-thirds majority covered cases of common agreement; and, inthe light of experience of similar wording in the Charter of theUnited Nations and other international organisations, he proposedto accept this interpretation. The French Government, which had previously opposed the admission of Greece and Turkey to theCouncil, had now suggested that these countries should be brought in before the constitution was settled. He proposed to press theConference to decide now to invite Greece and Turkey to jc-in theCouncil, but not to delay agreement on the constitution by invitingthem to join as original members.As the constitution of the Council was likely to be published inthe course of the week, the Cabinet had a preliminary discussion about the composition of the British delegation to the consultative assembly. There was general agreement that there should be somerepresentation of Opposition parties, though it would probably be wise to make it clear, for the sake of Continental countries, thatthere was no question of including representatives of any anti-democratic parties. The Government would probably be pressed toagree that the representation of parties should be proportionate totheir strength in the House of Commons, but it was thought that forthe present it would be enough to say that the basis of representationwould be discussed through the usual channels. On the questionwhether representation should be confined to elected members of theHouse of Commons, it was pointed out that the Government might find themselves in difficulties if they allowed persons who were not members of Parliament to be nominated for the British delegation.At the same time it might be useful to include some members ofthe House of Lords, so long as there was no question of havingregard to the strength of parties in that Chamber. Claims would doubtless be pressed for special representation for Scotland, wales and Northern Ireland, but here again any specific promise of repre-sentation might lead to difficulties and it might be enough to saythat the advantage of including a Scot, a Welshman and possiblyan Ulsterman among the members of the delegation would not be overlooked.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement on the resultsof the discussions on the Preparatory Conference for theCouncil of Europe.(2) Invited the Lord President to submit a memorandum, forconsideration by the Cabinet on 5th May, on the basis onwhich British representation on the consultative assembly should be settled.
the Austrian Minister of the Interior had satisfied himself that therewere good legal arguments for regarding as no longer operative theoriginal decision of the Allied Council that new political parties should not be established without the CounciFs consent. The foreign secretary said that he was arranging for the Question to be post-poned until he had been able to have these arguments considered and, if they seemed sound, brought to the notice of the other membersof the Allied Council.The Cabinet took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Germany. 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that, as the result of the discus-(Previous       sions which had been proceeding between the Soviet and united reference:      States representatives on the Security Council, it seemed possibleCM.

The foreign secretary had thought it expedient that this latest Soviet approach should be handled with caution, for he thought it essential that nothing should be done which might prejudice the early establishmentof a Government of Western Germany.  He was, however, satisfied,from special enquiries which he had made, that the political leaders in Western Germany were determined to go forward with theestablishment of that Government, and were not now likely to inter-pret the holding of a further meeting of the Council of foreign ministers as a sign of weakening on the part of the Western Powers.The Foreign Secretary added that, although this approachindicated that the Soviet Government might for the present be moredisposed to seek some accommodation with the Western Powers, there could be no assurance that this attitude of mind would be maintained for any length of time. Another sudden reversal of policy might take place at any moment.  This was a further reason for caution.The Cabinet took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Trade with 4.   in connection with the discussion recorded in the precedingRussia and minute the President of the Board of Trade said that the SovietEastern Government had recently shown a more accommodating spirit inEurope. the negotiations for a new Anglo-Soviet trade agreement.The Foreign Secretary said that he hoped that no unduepublicity would be given to any new trade agreement with Russia.It was embarrassing for him that the Press should give so much moreprominence to our trade with Russia and her satellites than theygave to our trading arrangements with friendlier countries. TheSecretary of State for Commonwealth- Relations said that this kindof publicity was specially harmful to Anglo-Canadian relations.The Prime Minister said that he would ask the other ministers concerned to do anything they could to discourage the Press from giving undue publicity to our trade relations with Russia and hersatellites.north atlantic Pact.(previous reference:CM.(49)25thConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Foreign Secretary said that he had been informed thatthe French Government Would not be able to ratify the north atlantic Pact until 20th June. The Secretary of State for Common-wealth Relations said that the Canadian House of Commons hadratified the Pact on 30th April, and it was significant that all thepolitical parties in Canada had declared their support of the Pact.The leader of the Canadian Co-operative Federation Party had explained that the local opposition voiced by his followers in BritishColumbia would not affect the national policy of his party.   The
InternationalLahou?Conference,(previous reference:-C.M.(49)27thConclusions,Minute 4.)Organisation of-Employment^Service.Freedom of6. The Cabinet, resumed their discussion of memoranda by theMinister of Labour ^.P. (49) 80 and 81) on the action to be takenby the United Kingdom Government on the Convention and Recom-mendation concerning the organisation of the employment service,and on the Convention concerning Freedom of Association and theRight to Organise, which had been adopted at the InternationalLabour Conference in 1948.Discussion turned first on the provision in paragraph 12 of theformer Convention that &quot; the employment service should . not,in referring workers to employment, itself discriminate againstapplicants on grounds of race, colour, sex or belief.&quot; It was pointedout that the effect of this provision was merely to preclude discrimination -nation at the discretion of the employment service itself : it wouldnot preclude discrimination resulting from the nature of the employ-ment or the law of the land or the wish of the employer. In this context, the word &quot; belief &quot; had been intended to cover both religiousand political beliefs.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Minister of Labour to present to parliamentary White Paper, as proposed in the Annex to CP. (49) 80,announcing the Government^ decision to ratify the Con-vention on the organisation of the employment service,and to accept the Recommendation subject to a reserva-tion in regard to paragraph 12 (b).The Cabinet next discussed the Convention concerning FreedomAssociation and 0f Association and the Right to Organise set out in Annex A toRight to CP. (49) 81. Some anxiety was expressed lest Article 2 of the Con-Organise, vention, which provided that workers and employers should havethe right to establish and join organisations or their own choosingwithout previous authorisation, should be regarded as limiting the discretion of employers to refuse recognition to new trade unionsor associations. And, even if this was not its effect, might notthe Government be criticised for ratifying a Convention in terms which ignored the fact that the exercise of the right to associatemight inevitably have a direct effect on a worker&apos;s prospects of continued employment ? It was pointed out, however, that the main purpose of the Convention was to prevent Governments from restrict-ing the right of association to membership of puppet State unions;and it would be welcomed on that account by workers in many countries. Indeed, the Social Committee set up under the brussels treaty had recently expressed the strong hope that the convention would be ratified without delay by the five signatory Powers. none of its provisions was inconsistent with the law of the UnitedKingdom, and ratification would not necessitate any change in thatlaw. While the Convention safeguarded the right to join anyassociation, it did not provide that all such associations should berecognised by either the Government or the employer; and an employer would still be entitled to dismiss a worker, on due notice,if his membership of an association rendered it impossible for himto work harmoniously with his fellow-workers.In further discussion, it was agreed that it would be inadvisable to give the Director-General of the International Labour Office a detailed explanation of the reasons for excluding Northern Irelandfrom the scope of the ratification by His Majesty&apos;s Government.Ministers thought it would be enough if the communication were confined to the first three paragraphs of the draft in Annex B to cp. (49) 81.Secretary of State said that this was a striking demonstration ofCanada s willingness to accept her international responsibilities;and he was assured that there was now no reason to fear that canada would relapse into isolationist politics.
The Cabinet-(2) Authorised the Minister of Labour to present to parliamentary White Paper, as proposed in Annex C to CP. (49) 81,announcing the Government^ decision to ratify the Con-vention concerning Freedom of Association and the Rightto Organise.(3) Agreed that the exclusion of Northern Ireland from the ratification should be explained to the Director-General,of the International Labour Office in terms of the first three paragraphs of the draft in Annex B to CP. (49) 81..Wages Policy.Claim byNationalUnion of railwaymen.(previous reference:CM. (49) 16thConclusions,Minute 5f)7. At the Prime Ministers request the Minister of Labour-reported to the Cabinet on his discussions with representatives ofthe National Union of Railwaymen following the rejection of their recent wage claims by the Railway Staffs National Tribunal and.the Joint Wages Board. He had made it clear in a letter &quot;to theUnion that there could be no question of re-opening the negotiations on the rejected claims. The Union had sought clarification of certain points in that letter, and in the subsequent discussions he had explained that, if they wished to pursue the matter further, the only course open to them was to put forward a fresh application. Hehad been able to inform them that the Railway Executive had given him their full assurance that they would take steps to see that therewould be no avoidable delay on their part in dealing with any matter which the Executive of the Union might decide to bring before them through the agreed negotiating machinery of the industry. He had,however, indicated that, in his view, any new claim which theymight decide to put forward ought not to take the form of anapplication for a general flat-rate increase; and he had suggestedthat they should consider the possibility of securing some improve-ment in the conditions of the lowest-paid workers in the industry..He had taken this line because, in the present temper of their leaders,there was a grave risk that the Union might decide to call a&apos;strike-unless discussions could be maintained; and there was little doubtthat in that event there would be considerable public sympathy withthe case for increasing the lowest wages in the industry. He under-stood that the Executive of the Union had been authorised to conduct negotiations on this basis.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Minister of Labour.PoliticalProcessionsin London.May Day.(previous reference:C.M.(49)27thConclusions,Minute 5.)8. The Home Secretary said that on Sunday, 1st May, theMetropolitan Police had experienced no great difficulty in enforcing the ban on political processions in London. Organisers of the variousdemonstrations which had been arranged appeared to have acceptedthe ban; and the efforts of the Police were confined to dealing witha few sporadic efforts by groups of individuals to form processions.There had been no casualties among the Police or the demonstrators.The Cabinet-Took note of the Home Secretary&apos;s statement.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,2nd May, 1949.
