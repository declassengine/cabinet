85CM. 43 (49) .     170Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Analgesia Bill was due to come forward on Report on thefollowing day. The Bill had been substantially amended in committee, and Government supporters would raise the questionwhether this was the same Bill which had received a Second Reading.Even if this point of order was not successful, the Bill might betalked out.A short discussion followed on the time-table for the remaining stages of the Iron and Steel Bill. The Bill was expected to get a third Reading in the Lords on 20th July, and exchanges would then take place between the two Houses on the amendments introduced into the Bill in the Lords. These would take some days, and theGovernment might be faced with the alternatives of adjourninguntil after the Summer Recess the attempt to find some basis ofagreement between the two Houses, or asking Parliament to continueto sit for a few days after the end of July. There was generalagreement that, if this situation should arise, the preferable coursewould be to defer until the autumn the completion of the discussions between the two Houses on the Lords&apos; amendments.2. The Cabinet were informed that a. debate was to take placein the House of Lords on 6th July, on a motion by Earl Wavell,about the pension rights of certain European members of CivilServices in India and Pakistan which had not been under the controlof the Secretary of State for India. In November 1948 the Govern-ments of India and Pakistan had agreed that European members ofthose Services might be allowed to retire on proportionate pension;but this agreement did not apply retrospectively and did not,therefore, cover certain members who had already retired betweenthe date of the transfer of power and the date of the agreement.Lord Wavell was now urging that the United Kingdom Governmentshould provide pensions for these men. This demand would findwidespread support in the House of Lords, and it would be difficultto resist it. The numbers concerned were small, and they had strongclaims to compassionate consideration.It was the view of the Cabinet that no further attempt shouldbe made to persuade the Governments of India and Pakistan toprovide pensions for these men; but that further consideration should be given to the possibility of making some provision for them from United Kingdom funds.The Cabinet-Invited the. Lord Privy Seal to take this question up withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth Relations, before the debate in theHouse of Lords on 6th July, with a view to seeing whether some provision could not be made from United Kingdom- funds for the small number of Europeans who had resignedfrom these Services during the period between the transferof power and the agreement of November 1948.General 3.   The Prime Minister said that it was desirable that theElection. -Press should not be encouraged to speculate about the date of theGeneral Election. He asked all Ministers to be careful to avoidsaying anything, in speeches or on other occasions when they mightbe reported, which might be taken to imply that they were aware of the date on which the Election would be held. If forced to say something on this subject, Ministers should take the line that the37256 b 2India.Pensions for members ofCivil Services.(previous reference erence:C.M.(47)36thConclusions,Minute 2.)

The Cabinet were informed of further developments in thestrike of stevedores in the London docks. Earlier in the week therehad been good reason to hope that the stevedores would decide toreturn to work; but, owing mainly to an announcement by theemployers that labour would not be assigned to other ships until thetwo Canadian ships were unloaded, the strike still continued in theSurrey and Royal Albert Docks. For the present, no special actionneed be taken to unload perishable cargoes; but the emergencies committee would continue to watch the position.The Cabinet were informed of the course of events leading tothe decision of the National Union of Railwaymen to order a goslow&quot; campaign throughout the railway system from 3rd July.Representatives of the railway unions were meeting the railway executive Committee that afternoon, and negotiations were proceeding.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Parliament.Offices of profit.(previous reference:CM. (46) 18thConclusions,Minute 9.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president and the Home Secretary (CP: (49) 142) explaining thatit had been brought to notice that Mr. J. B. Hynd, M.P., who was recently appointed a member of the General Medical Council, andMr. J. J. Robertson, M.P., who had previously been a member, mighthave prejudiced their position as Members of Parliament by reasonof section 24 of the Succession to the Crown Act, 1707.Mr. Albert Evans, M.P., had also jeopardised his position by reasonof small sales of electrical equipment to the Home Office by a.firmin which he held a partnership. It was proposed to introduce anIndemnifying Bill in respect of these three Members of Parliament.The Lord President explained that Members of the House ofCommons had served on the General Medical Council since 1926 andno difficulty had been raised until the appointment of Mr. Hynd,when a member of the Council had suggested that he was not qualified to serve. The question had now been raised whetherindemnities would be required in respect of Mr. J. Diamond, M.P.,who was appointed to the General Nursing Council in 1948, andMr. W. M. Snadden, M.P., and Mr. P. H. Collick, M.P., who were appointed members of the Council of the Royal College ofVeterinary Surgeons in the present year. All these examples drew attention once more to the vague and unsatisfactory nature of thelaw relating to offices of profit, and it seemed to be desirable that ageneral investigation into the modernisation of the law, which theLord Presidents Committee had instituted in 1946, should nowbe resumed and brought to a conclusion.In subsequent discussion the following points were made : (a) It was a matter for argument whether membership of theGeneral Nursing Council and of the Council of the Royal college of Veterinary Surgeons should be regarded as an office of profit under the Crown. Members of these bodies were entitled tosubsistence allowances, and earlier Law Officers had advised thatin the ordinary way a subsistence allowance could not be regardedas yielding profit. The test was not whether money passed but whether there was profit, or an expectation of profit. It might bedesirable   in   the  Indemnifying   Bill  to  cover   the  cases   of
Messrs. Diamond, Snadden and Collick, unless it appeared that thiswould cast doubt upon the position of other Members of Parliamentholding rather similar appointments.(b) The Solicitor-General was reasonably satisfied that another member of Parliament who had been concerned in the sale ofaeroplane parts had not placed himself in danger since the transaction-tions had been conducted by a joint stock company.(c) A Select Committee of the House of Commons had made recommendations in 1941 about the law relating to offices of profit.This report had not, however, fully covered the field since it did notdeal, for example, with Members of Parliament appointed to panelsfrom which umpires were drawn under social service legislation.It was arguable that the subject should be looked at afresh by a select Committee, since it concerned the relations of the executive tothe legislature.0) The enquiry instituted by the Lord Presidents Committeein 1946 had reached the stage of the drafting of a Bill listing officeswhich disqualified for membership of the House of Commons andthose which did not. It had not been carried further at that time since it had been felt that many offices then existing were of atemporary character and would disappear when conditions became more normal.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that an Indemnifying Bill should be introduced inrespect of Mr. J. B. HyncTs and Mr. J. J. Robertson&apos;s membership of the General Medical Council and inrespect of the transactions of Mr. Albert Evans, M.P.,with the Home Office; and that, if necessary, the bill might also cover Mr. J. Diamond, M.P., Mr. W. M.Snadden, M.P., and Mr. P. H. Collick, M.P.(2) Invited the Lord President to discuss with the Oppositionthe position of Members of the Opposition who had served on the General Medical Council before 1945.(3) Invited the Lord President to bring before the lord presidents Committee the general question of the stepsto be taken to bring up to date the law relating to offices of profit.Civil Servants 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Homeand Industrial Secretary (CP. (49) 143) raising the question whether, in the eventDisputes. of a widespread strike, civil servants should be allowed to refuse toundertake work different from, though anaVgous to, that on whichthey were ordinarily employed, on the ground that by doing this work they would be taking sides in the dispute. The matter had arisen because the Emergencies Committee had been faced with the. problem whether, in the event of a railway strike, postmen whoordinarily conveyed mails in road vehicles over short distances could properly be required to carry long-distance mail by road, or toprovide emergency transport&apos;to carry telephonists to the exchangesat which they worked.The Postmaster-General explained that Post Office workers who were instructed during a railway strike to carry mail whichin the ordinary way would have gone by rail would probably considerthat they were being asked to act as blacklegs. In 1926 this matter had been the subject of prior negotiations and the then Postmaster-General had given the Union of Post Office Workers a writtenassurance that they would not be asked to undertake work different from that on which they were ordinarily employed. Extra duties which had fallen on the Post Office, in order to keep essential servicesgoing, had been performed by volunteers drawn from Post Officestaffs and from outside. The Post Office workers would undoubtedlyexpect the precedent of 1926 to be followed in any future strike.
Anglo-NorwegianFisheriesDispute.(previous reference:CM. (49) 4thConclusions,Minute 4.)social services inWesternEurope.(previous reference:CM. (48) 35thConclusions,Minute 9.)In discussion, it was suggested that the arrangements adoptedin a general strike need not be regarded as applicable to a strikeaffecting a single service, such as the railways. The employmentof volunters might cause as much friction as a request to Post office workers to assist in keeping the Post Office services running. Itwould be undesirable to approach the staff in advance of anystoppage and thereby suggest that it was for the staff to define what were properly the duties of Post Office workers in emergencyconditions.   It seemed reasonable to expect Post Office workers to perform duties of the kind that had been mentioned in discussion,f from time to time arrangements could be made for mails to becarried by road over considerable distances, something might bedone to break down the impression that these duties in time ofemergency were highly exceptional.The Cabinet-Agreed that, in the event of an industrial dispute, civilservants might be expected to undertake work different from, though analogous to, that on which they wereordinarily employed, where this was necessary for themaintenance of essential services, and that  the Postmaster-General should therefore proceed on the lines indicated inparagraph 4 (1) of CP. (49) 143.7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (49) 140) proposing that the dispute with theNorwegian Government over the fishing limits claimed for the exclusive use of Norwegian fishermen should be referred to theInternational Court of Justice, unless agreement could be reached on a modus vivendi by the end of July.The Foreign Secretary said that efforts to reach a settlement ofthis dispute by negotiation had failed : the Norwegian Governmenthad refused even to agree to an acceptable modus vivendi, and norwegian fishery cruisers had arrested British vessels fishing inthe disputed areas. When the Cabinet last discussed the question on 17th January, it had seemed possible that a settlement might bereached on the basis of a new line approximating closely to the boundary established by the modus mvendi of 1933. These hopeshad, however, been frustrated by the inability of the norwegian government to persuade the Norwegian Parliament to modify their decision to bring into operation the Royal Decree of 1935, whichprescribed limits for the Norwegian fisheries far more extensivethan any that His Majesty&apos;s Government could accept. There wasa serious risk that, if the present situation continued, there mightbe further incidents seriously prejudicial to Anglo-Norwegianrelations. He therefore thought that the Norwegian Governmentshould now be informed that, unless they were prepared -to accept our proposals for a modus vivendi by the end of July, we should refer the whole question to the International Court, if necessary byunilateral application.The Cabinet-Approved the recommendation made in CP. (49) 140.8. The Cabinet considered a note by the Foreign Secretary(CP. (49) 131) covering a report by the Official Committee on social services in Western Europe on the work done in the past year togive effect to Article II of the Brussels Treaty.The Foreign Secretary said that he thought that encouragingprogress had so far been achieved in the development of co-operationbetween the Brussels Powers in the social field. He did not thinkit would be advisable to make any change at that stage in themachinery established under the Treaty for the discussion of social
questions, though it would in due course be necessary to review its relation to any corresponding machinery which might be set up bythe Council of Europe. He also recommended that the official committee should continue in existence in order to ensure theco-ordination of United Kingdom policy.The Cabinet were in general agreement with the foreign secretary&apos;s recommendations. In further discussion the Ministerof Health said that there was scope for more vigorous action inconnection with the health services. In this country foreign visitorsor residents were entitled to benefit by the National Health Service,and we might reasonably press for reciprocal concessions by the otherBrussels Powers. He would submit definite&quot; proposals to the foreign secretary on this point.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendations made in CP. (49) 131.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Health, to consider what proposals might besubmitted to the other Brussels Powers on the grant of reciprocal facilities for medical and dental treatment.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,  &apos;30th June, 1949.
