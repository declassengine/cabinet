CabinetCommittees1. The Prime Minister said that it had been brought to hisnotice that the existence of the Food Distribution Committee hadbeen made known to the Trades Union Congress. He wished to remind all his colleagues of the general rule against disclosinginformation about Cabinet Committees; and he asked that ministers should explain to their Parliamentary Secretaries the importanceof observing this rule.PoliticalActivitiesof CivilServants.Candidaturein LocalGovernmentElections.(previous reference:CM. (49) 15thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Lord President said that he had been asked for rulingson three subsidiary points arising from the Cabinefs decision of24th February that officers of the Central Office of information should not stand for election to local authorities. First, would thedecision preclude such an officer from being elected an Alderman?He thought it must. Secondly, would it prevent such an officerfrom being co-opted to serve on a local authority committee? Hethought it need not. Thirdly, he now understood that a few officersof the Department were already serving as members of local authori-ties, and it seemed unnecessarily harsh to require them to resign.He thought it would be reasonable that officers who had been elected to a local authority before the introduction of the new rule shouldbe allowed to continue to serve on that authority, and to stand forre-election, until such time as they lost their seats.The Cabinet-Endorsed the proposals made by the Lord President.Housing.married quarters forthe armed forces.(previous reference:CM. (49) 11thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Minister of Defence said that, in the forthcoming debate on the Defence White Paper, there would be pressure for higher pay and other amenities for regular members of the armed forces. It would assist him in dealing with this if he could saythat the Government were considering sympathetically what couldbe done to provide additional married quarters and were preparedto give the Services priority for housing similar to that accorded to coalminers and farm-workers.The Minister of Health said that he saw no reason why theGovernment should not commit themselves to making a special effort to provide further married quarters as part of their policy of meeting the general demand for houses. The demand for married quarters arose, however, in particular areas and must be considered in relation to the available building resources in those areas. HeWould wish, therefore, to discuss with the Minister of Defence the exact form of.the statement to be made. It was, in general, desirablethat Ministers should no longer speak of the shortage of houses,but rather of the demand for more houses.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that in the forthcoming debate on the Defence white paper the Minister of Defence might give an assurance that the Government would make a special effort toprovide additional married quarters for the Services.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to discuss the Wording ofhis statement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Minister of Health.economic survey for1949.(previous reference:CM. (48) 16thConclusions,Minute 3.)367224. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (49) 29 and 38) covering the draft of theEconomic Survey for 1949. They also had before them a memo-randum by the Minister of Labour (CP. (49) 40) commenting onthe passages in the draft relating to the man-power needs of thecoal-mining industry in 1949.The Cabinet first considered what man-power figures for thecoal-mining industry should be shown in Table XX and para--2 b 2
graph 93 of the Survey. The Government had incurred criticism on earlier occasions when industries had not attained the man-powertargets prescribed; and the Production Committee had therefore thought it advisable that the figures for man-power distribution in1949 should be given in terms of &quot;requirements&quot; rather than&quot; targets.&quot; Some difficulty had, however, been found in determiningwhat figure should be inserted for the coal-mining industry. AnOfficial Committee had estimated that it would not be possible toincrease the total man-power of the industry beyond 788,000 bythe end of 1949; and for this reason the Minister of Labour thoughtthat the inclusion of any higher figure would give rise to difficulties:On the other hand, the industry had already publicly anounced thatits total requirements of men on the colliery books at the end of1949 would be 736,000; and this was equivalent to a total man-powerfigure of 795,000. In these circumstances it was suggested in cp. (49) 38 that a figure of 795,000 should be included in Table XXof the Survey, but that it should be made clear in paragraph 93that, if this figure was to be attained, intensive efforts would haveto be made to reduce wastage and to increase recruitment,particularly of foreign workers.The Cabinet agreed with the recommendations on this pointmade in CP. (49) 38, but -they thought it might be possible tostrengthen further the references in paragraph 93 to the difficultieswhich were likely to be encountered in satisfying the industry&apos;s fullman-poWer needs in 1949.In further discussion of the draft Economic Survey, the follow-ing points were made : (a) It was suggested that it would be advantageous if specificfigures could be included to illustrate the steady expansion of colonial imports and exports, and the substantial contribution madeby the Colonial territories towards the balance of payments of the sterling Area. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the separation of the figures of Colonial trade from those of the restof the Sterling Area might have an unfortunate effect on publicopinion in the United States. There would, however, be no objectionto the inclusion of a paragraph indicating in general terms theimportant part which the Colonies were playing in the struggle for economic recovery.(b) The question was raised whether it was advisable to abandonon this occasion the practice of setting production targets: in thepast such targets had been found useful in encouraging particular industries to make special efforts to increase output. It was pointedout, however, that great difficulty was found in practice in determining at what level a production target might appropriately be set. Moreover, experience had shown that when a productiontarget was attained it was often criticised as having been set too low.(c) A reference to the Committee on Industrial Productivityshould be inserted in the section in Part III on the need for greater productivity.(d) The additional paragraph on balance of payments proposedin CP. (49) 38 would be acceptable to Canadian opinion. It wassuggested, however, that it would be helpful if some reference couldbe made in it to the restoration of multilateral trade; and it wassuggested that this point might be met by substituting the phrase&quot; normal pattern of world trade &quot; for &quot; normal trading methods,&quot;which might in any event be interpreted as a criticism of the policyof long-term contracts and bulk purchase.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should have discretion to make final adjustments in the text of theEconomic Survey for 1949.(2) Subject to conclusion (1) above and to the points made in discussion, approved the early publication of the Survey.
5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour (CP. (49) 28) indicating the main movements in wages which had taken place in 1948, and a supplementarymemorandum (CP. (49) 42) describing some recent increases in wage rates which had been granted or were under consideration.The Minister of Labour said that in his first memorandum(CP. (49) 28) he had described the general atmosphere in industry as favourable to a period of comparative stability in wages, thoughthe danger of unfavourable developments could not be dismissed.Since that memorandum had been prepared, however, there had beenvarious developments indicating that a fresh cycle of wage increasesmight be opening. It was for consideration whether a White paper should be published indicating such success as had been achieved in1948 in the policy outlined in the White Paper on Personal Incomes,Costs and Prices (Cmd. 7321). The Government were at leastentitled to draw attention to the growing steadiness in industrial relations which had led to fewer days being lost in industrial disputes and a smaller number of unofficial strikes.In discussion, there was general agreement that the Minister&apos;ssupplementary memorandum (CP. (49) 42) disclosed a serious situa-tion and that, unless action was taken to arrest the present trend,there would be a new cycle of wage increases which would imperil the stabilisation policy and might lead to serious and uncontrollableinflation.The position in a number of individual industries was thendiscussed : (a) The proposals of the Agricultural Wages Board for anincrease of 4s\ in the minimum rate for men related in form to the minimum wage and had been argued before the Board interms of the minimum wage. In fact, however, most agricultural workers earned more than the minimum wage, if only because ofthe extent to which overtime was worked. The increase would infact be applied to all farm-workers, whether or not they were onthe statutory minimum rate, and the cost would be about  10 million a year. Not only would this raise the cost of food-stuffs, but theincrease in agricultural wages would provoke other rural workers,including railway workers and postmen, to apply for an increase intheir rates. The claim of these other workers would be strengthened by the fact that many of them did not work overtime and were,therefore, on minimum rates substantially below the wages earnedby agricultural workers.(b) The statutory minimum rates which were proposed by theWages Council covering various retail trades would representincreases of 4s\ to 6s. a week above the current minimum rates agreed on by the Joint Industrial Councils. Here again, the increases would tend to apply to all grades and not merely to workers onminimum rates, and the cost was estimated at about  20 million ayear. There were at present too many persons employed in retail distribution, and the wages increase would operate against thegeneral Government policy of drawing man-power from distributioninto more essential occupations. Moreover, the increase would leadto higher prices, and it would be difficult to resist claims by retailersfor reconsideration of food margins in view of this latest additionto their costs.(c) The tribunal which had considered the claim on behalf, ofthe bus workers for time and a half pay on Saturday afternoon,though they had declared themselves opposed in principle toenhanced rates of pay for Saturday afternoon working, had in factmade an award which breached the principle in this particular case. It seemed unfortunate that the trade union concerned andthe London Transport Executive had felt it necessary to agree thatclaims made by London bus men, during an unofficial strike enteredupon contrary to their agreements, should be taken to arbitration.
Moreover, it was difficult to find any logic in the tribunals findings,which appeared to be based simply on splitting the difference betweenthe claims of the London Transport Executive and of the leadersof the unofficial strike. The award would be likely to have reper-cussions on other industries (e.g., the railways, retail distribution and public utilities) in which shift-working during the week-endwas unavoidable.(d) Claims for substantial increases were under consideration in both the cotton and wool industries and some increases were likelyto be given. This would increase the price of British textiles inforeign markets at a time when lower prices were required to meetforeign competition.(e) The Home Secretary expected shortly to receive the reportof the Oaksey Committee on police pay, and he had reason to believethat the Committee would recommend substantial increases in the pay of the rank and file.The Cabinet then held a general discussion on the steps whichmight be taken to prevent the development of a fresh cycle of wage increases. It was recognised that, in framing policy on this subject,regard must be paid to te extent to which the settlement of wageswas determined by voluntary agreements between employers andemployed or by reference to arbitrators over whom the Governmenthad no direct control. One suggestion was that in any endeavourto give fresh impetus to the policy which had been laid down in theWhite Paper on Personal Incomes, Costs and Prices, it should nolonger be necessary to make any exception for undermanned indus-tries. The wage levels in those industries had been substantiallyimproved in the last twelve months, and a reasonable relativitybetween the main occupations had now been achieved. Anothersuggestion, was that an endeavour should be made to freeze wagesby voluntary agreement at their present levels, with an under-standing that, if the cost of living went up, some increase of wages would be allowed.There was general agreement that, when Ministers had agreedupon the broad lines on which the situation should be handled,informal discussions should be held with the General Council of theTrades Union Congress Thereafter it might be desirable to holddiscussions with the Executives of individual unions.It was also felt that material should be got together with a viewto giving workers generally some indication of the grounds on which government policy was based. It could be shown that stability of wage rates was at present essential if inflation was to be avoided,and attention could be called to the effects of inflation on old-age pensions and on the social services in general. It would also be use-ful if an analysis could be prepared of the proportion of the national income which was devoted to net profits.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Labour to prepare for the economic policy Committee, in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion and in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, amemorandum on the steps which should be taken to forestalla fresh cycle of wage increases.petrol rationing.(previous reference:CM. (48) 64thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Cabinet had preliminary discussion of a memorandumon the petrol ration by the Minister of Fuel and Power (CP.(49) 41).The Cabinet decided to resume their discussion of this paperat a meeting in the following week.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th February, 1949.
