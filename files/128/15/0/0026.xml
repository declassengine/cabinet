Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.remuneration of TrainedNurses.(previous reference:C.M.(49)16thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Cabinet considered a joint memorandum by theMinister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland (C.P. (49)75) proposing increased rates of pay for enrolled assistant nurses,staff nurses and ward sisters, and drawing attention to a difficulty which would arise from the application of these increased rates tomale nurses in view of the Governments attitude towards thequestion of equal pay for men and Women.The Minister of Health said that there was general agreement that the pay of trained nurses should be increased in order to stimu-late recruiting. The increases which he proposed were considerablylower than those suggested by the Staff side representing the nurseson the Nurses&apos; and Midwives&apos; Whitley Council. He believed that hehad adequately safeguarded the position of the Minister of Educa-tion in regard to teachers, who at all points would receive highersalaries than trained nurses. The difficulty on which he particularlyWished to consult his colleagues was in regard to equal pay for menand women. Hitherto, there had been no systematic differentiation between the scales for male and female nurses; but the men receivedmore than the women in the lower and middle ranges of pay. he proposed to preserve this differential by giving male nurses a slightly higher starting-point on the scales for enrolled assistant nursesand for staff nurses, but under his proposals the maxima for thesetwo grades and the whole scale of the ward sister grade would bethe same for both sexes. If male nurses were to receive more thanwomen in the higher ranges of pay, this could only be achieved by giving them more pay compared with women than they had receivedhitherto, since he could not contemplate any depression of the scalesapplicable to women.In discussion, the following points were made : (a) The principle of equal pay in the higher ranges of remunera-tion might have awkward repercussions for the Minister of Educa-tion. The Burnham Committee would be considering early nextyear the scales of pay for teachers to be negotiated in 1951, andthe teachers would undoubtedly press for equal pay for men andwomen. Hitherto, local education authorities had resisted this pressure because of the attitude which the Government had taken up on the general question of equal pay, but a concession by theGovernment in the pay of nurses would compromise this situation.The position would be the more difficult because it was in the fields of teaching and nursing that it could be argued most forcibly that women were doing equal work with men and should therefore receivethe same pay. If equal pay were conceded to teachers (i.e., equal pay at the scales applicable to men) the cost would work out at between  14 and  18 million a year. From this angle it would be useful if the Health Ministers, while granting some increase in pay to the nurses, could give rather smaller increases in the higher rangesof pay and so preserve some differential between men and women.This lesser increase would also preserve the greater attractivenessof the teaching profession, which drew from the same sources asnursing.(6) The Service Departments were faced with almost as acutea shortage of nurses as the Health Ministers, and a working party was at present discussing improving terms of pay and conditions ofservice for Service nurses. The existing pay of Service nurses wasrelated to the civilian scales, and the new proposals would have totake account of the increases now suggested for civilian nurses. Inthe Services no problem arose in regard to equal pay.36959-3 b 21. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
(c) The experience of the Ministry of Labour was that, of thegirls who made enquiries about the nursing profession, only one inten in fact undertook the necessary training. Most girls had to spend a short time in other employment between leaving school and taking up nursing, and the present scales of pay were not sufficiently attractive to induce them to transfer to nursing. The proposed increases were very necessary for the purpose of recruitment.(d) The Ministers&apos; proposals would almost certainly involve a supplementary Estimate, since it had not been practicable, whenthe main Estimates were being prepared, to anticipate the result ofthe negotiations which would now take place on the Nurses&apos; andMidwives&apos; Whitley Council.(e) While the Treasury accepted the Health Ministers&apos; pro-posals, subject to the point about equal pay, the Chancellor of theExchequer had not been able to consider the matter personally, andhe should be given an opportunity to comment, in view of the probability that a Supplementary Estimate would be required.The general feeling of Ministers was that the Health ministers had made out their case for the increased remuneration of trainednurses which they proposed, and that the Government could accept this limited application of the principle of equal pay for men andwomen. The Government had said that they accepted the principleof equal pay for equal work, but could not implement it over thewhole field because of the cost involved. The danger of repercussions in the teaching profession and elsewhere did not seem so great as tojustify the taking of special steps to preserve the differential by increasing the higher ranges of pay for male nurses beyond whatwas necessary for a successful conclusion of the wages negotiations.The Cabinet- :&apos;Agreed that, subject to the concurrence of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, the proposals in CP. (49) 75 for increasingthe remuneration of trained nurses should be approved.Germany.occupation statute andTripartiteControlAgreement.(previous reference:CM. (48) 81stConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet considered a note by the Prime Minister(CP. (49) 79) covering a Foreign Office memorandum on new proposals put forward by the United States authorities for an occu-pation statute and tripartite control agreement for Germany.The Prime Minister said that, as the Foreign Secretary and theFrench Foreign Minister were both in Washington, the opportunityhad been taken to try to reach a final agreement between the Occupy-ing Powers of the Western Zones on the terms of a occupation statute and control agreement. The earlier draft of the occupation statute bad included a large number of specific safeguards desired by the Occupying Powers, and as a result had become a very compli-cated document which would have given little encouragement to anew German Government. The United States authorities had now put forward an entirely fresh draft, which proceeded on the oppositeprinciple of transferring power to the German Government subject only to the reservation of a limited number of specified powers andto a general right of the Occupying Powers to intervene by way of veto in other matters. The latest text of this new draft was embodied in Washington telegram No. 2028 of 6th April. For the draft control agreement the United States authorities now proposed to substitute a set of principles, the text of which was contained in washington telegram No. 2027 of 6th April. These included three entirely newfeatures. First, the conception of military government would dis-appear entirely and, except in security matters, Allied control wouldbe gradually withdrawn. Secondly, all financial assistance toGermany would be provided through the agency of the economic co-operation Administration.    Thirdly, as soon as a German
(d) The Solicitor-General suggested that, if there were anopportunity to suggest drafting amendments, it might be preferableif the word &apos;&apos; desirable &apos;&apos; were substituted for &apos;&apos; essential&apos;&apos; inparagraph 6 of the draft occupation statute.Government was established, all the governmental functions of the occupying Powers would be transferred to civilian High Commis-sioners, and only the military functions would be exercised byCommanders-in-Chief.The Prime Minister said that he had had a telephone conversa-tion with the Foreign Secretary about these proposals. It appeared that the French were prepared to accept them; and the foreign secretary thought that, although they differed very markedly in formfrom the earlier proposals which the United Kingdom authorities had favoured, it should be possible to ensure that our main require-ments were met under the new system. On general political groundsthe Foreign Secretary was most anxious not to miss this opportunityof securing final agreement between the three Occupying Powers, sothat a German Government could be established in Western germany without further delay.In discussion the following points were made : (a) From later telegrams it now appeared that the new proposals regarding the control agreement would not, as had been stated inparagraph 4 of the memorandum annexed to CP. (49) 79, dispose of the question of weighted voting on economic questions.The President of the Board of Trade said that, if more time had been available, he would have liked to see a further attempt madeto obtain a more satisfactory agreement on this point. He feared that, even after military government had given place to civilianadministration, the United States authorities might be disposed toencourage industrial developments in Germany which were not inaccordance with the views of the United Kingdom Government. he also regretted the disappearance of specific safeguards againstGermany&apos;s adopting unfair trade practices in international tradeand measures discriminating within Germany against Britishindustry. He hoped that, even at this late stage, a further attemptmight be made to secure satisfactory assurances on these points.(6) The Secretary of State for War asked whether it was clearthat under the new proposals we should retain power to exactpayment from Germany in respect of our occupation costs. TheCabinet were informed that this point was fully covered under thenew proposals.(c) The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster asked whetherthe new proposals would deprive us of the right to exact repayment of the sterling expenditure which we had incurred on Germany&apos;behalf. Very large sums had been expended under this head in thepast, and a substantial sterling expenditure was still continuing.The Cabinet were informed that this point did not appear tobe specifically covered in the new proposals. In discussion It wassuggested that there was little practical prospect of our being ableto recover any substantial part of the expenditure already incurred on Germany&apos;s behalf; but it was agreed that we should not be precluded from making the attempt or committed to further expenditure in the future. On this last point it was explained thatthe proposal to provide financial aid for Germany through the agency of the Economic Co-operation Administration should havethe effect of limiting our sterling expenditure on Germany in thefuture.
The Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to inform the Foreign Secretaryof the Cabinefs anxieties oh the particular points raised in the discussion, but to make it clear that the Cabinet werecontent to leave it to his discretion to decide how far these points could be pressed in negotiation without imperillingthe prospects of securing early agreement between the threeOccupying Powers.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.7th April, 1949.
