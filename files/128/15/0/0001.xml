Census of distribution.(previous reference:C.M.(48)82ndConclusions,Minute 4).2-41. At their meeting on 22nd December the Cabinet had agreedthat, before they decided whether the first census of distributionshould be held in 1950, they ought to have further information about (i) the questions which small shopkeepers would be expectedto answer and (ii) the extent to which policy on distribution couldbe framed without waiting for the results of the census. they now had before them a memorandum on these points by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (CP. (49) 1) and a memorandum by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (CP. (49) 2) on the political aspects of the question.The President of the Board of Trade said that the form foruse by small shopkeepers had been prepared by a special AdvisoryCommittee on the basis of experience gained from the pilot censusheld last year, and had been accepted as reasonable by the unofficialbodies consulted by the Board of Trade. As the result of specialinvestigations which had already taken place, material already existed on which some progress could be made in framing policyin certain fields of distribution, such as food and building materials;but over a large part of the distribution system no such information was available and the scope for effective Government intervention was therefore very limited. Apart from the question of distributionpolicy, it was important that adequate statistics of the distributiveservices should be available for the purposes of estimating thenational income and expenditure and showing how far the figuresof retail sales and stocks which were at present collected wererepresentative of different branches of distribution and how theymight be improved. The political objections to holding the censusin 1950 might be mitigated by allowing shopkeepers a longer period&apos; in which to complete their returns, so tnat no pressure need be placedon them before the General Election; and the forms might be accom-panied by a leaflet drawing attention to the fact that the censuswas based on the unanimous recommendations of a committee setup by the Caretaker Government, which had been accepted byParliament without opposition. Nevertheless, he recognised thatit Would not be possible to escape some political embarrassment onaccount of the census.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that he did not dissent from the arguments in favour of obtaining regular informa-tion about wholesale and retail distribution. But he thought itwould be a serious political blunder to hold the first census in 1950.The completion of the form annexed to CP. (49) 1 would presentreal difficulty to many small shopkeepers, whose shops, particularlyin rural areas, were often centres of political discussion. Postpone-ment of the census might involve some immediate political embarrassment; but there would be much greater risks in holdingit in the same year as a critical General Election.In discussion, it was argued that the w8rk of economic planningwas seriously hampered by the lack of statistics relating to distri-bution, and that the proposed census would enable the Governmentto form a more accurate picture of the general pattern of consump-tion throughout the country and of the distribution pf the national income. While it was true that some progress could be made, inadvance of the census, in framing a policy for particular aspects,of the distribution problem, the Government would invite political criticism if they snowed themselves reluctant to take the steps necessary to secure the statistical material which was the essentialbasis for any comprehensive distribution policy. It should notbe impossible to rebut political attacks on the census; and a Partywhose policy was based on effective economic planning should beprepared to maintain a firm attitude on such a point. There had recently been signs of a campaign against the census of production,and this would be strengthened if the Government now decided to postpone the census of distribution.   As regards the difficulties of
small shopkeepers, they would not be asked to furnish any informa-tion which was not already required for income-tax purposes.Arrangements had been made to use for this census staff who would otherwise be released by the Ministry of Pensions at Cheltenham;and postponement of the census might involve the dispersal of thisstaff and consequential difficulties in obtaining office accommodation at a later date.On the other side it was argued that, however strong the argu-ments for a census of distribution, it would be a serious politicalerror to hold it in the same year as a General Election. Whateverassurances were given, small shopkeepers would easily be induced to believe that the information wt;s required for political purposes has a first step towards the socialisation of the retail trade. the census could in any event have no bearing on the Labour Party&apos;programme for the General Election and, by holding it in 1950,much political odium would be incurred without any immediatepractical advantage. While many small shopkeepers would find difficulty in answering some of the questions proposed, the informa-tion which they were required to provide was so general that itwas hard to see what useful conclusions could be drawn from it.One of the questions of greatest public interest was the questionhow far reductions might be secured in the cost of living by reducingdistributors&apos; margins, but it did not appear that the census wouldprovide material on which an effective policy on this question couldbe framed. The purposes and aims of the census could not easily be explained on political platforms at a General Election.The preponderant view in the Cabinet was that it would be inadvisable for political reasons to hold the first census of distribu-tion in 1950. It had previously been argued that, if the censuswere postponed on this account, it would have to be postponed for two years, since shopkeepers would have to be given notice one year in advance of the intention to hold the census, and this notificationWould in itself afford material for political criticism. On furtherconsideration, however, the Cabinet took the view that the politicalrisks of giving the preliminary notice before the General Electioncould be accepted, and that arrangements could be made to hold the census in 1951.The Cabinet-Agreed that the first census of distribution should notbe held until 1951.^and- 2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Prime(Previous       Minister (CP.

Since legislation was necessary, the Northern Ireland Government had pressed thatstatutory force should be given to the undertaking that the consti-tutional status of Northern Ireland would not be altered withoutNorthern Ireland&apos;s agreement.   When he had given this undertaking in the House of Commons, no disagreement had been expressedand he believed that a statutory declaration to this effect would meet with general acceptance.
The Minister of Civil Aviation said that he thought it wouldbe a mistake to give any guarantee of the territorial integrity ofNorthern Ireland. In two Northern counties there was a majority in favour of an ending of partition and, if the issue of partitionever came before an international court, the view might be expressed that these counties should be transferred to Eire. He believed thatthe right solution lay in the political unity of Ireland and the strategical unity of Ireland and the United Kingdom.The general feeling of the Cabinet was, however, in favour ofa statutory declaration in the form of Clause 1 (1) (&amp;) of the draftBill annexed to CP. (49) 5. It was by no means certain that ahinternational tribunal, if the issue were brought before it, would consider that the two counties of Tyrone and Fermanagh shouldbe transferred to Eire : recent discussions on the partition of Indiaand Palestine provided examples of the arguments which might beused in favour of treating these counties as essential to the viabilityof Northern Ireland. Unless the people of Northern Ireland feltreasonably assured of the support of the people of this country,there might be a revival of the Ulster Volunteers and of other bodiesintending to meet any threat of force by force; and this would bringnearer the danger of an outbreak of violence in Ireland. From thepoint of view of Great Britain, experience in the last war hadamply proved that Northern IrelancTs continued adhesion to theUnited Kingdom was essential for her defence. There was nothing in past experience to give any reasonable assurance to Great Britainthat Eire would not be neutral in a future war. In 1940 Eire hadjeopardised her chances of ending partition by remaining neutral,and her recent legislation had shown that she laid more store onformal independence than on the union of Ireland.The Prime Minister said that, in view of the anti-partitioncampaign which was being fostered by the Eire Government, hemignt be asked whether British troops would be used to defendNorthern Ireland against aggression. The Cabinet agreed that itwould be inexpedient for the Prime Minister to take the initiative in offering an assurance on the lines suggested in paragraph 3 of cp. (49) 5. If, however, he was questioned on this point, he wouldhave no alternative but to say that Northern Ireland would be defended against aggression just like any other part of the UnitedKingdom though, even then, it would be wise to preface such astatement by expressing the hope that the differences between theNorth and the South would never give rise to the use of force. this reply might provoke enquiries about the application of NationalService in Northern Ireland. On practical grounds, however, itwas desirable to maintain the present arrangement by which theNational Service Acts did not extend to Northern Ireland.The majority of the working party had recommended that northern Ireland should be known as &quot;Ulster&quot; and that Eireshould be known formally as &quot;the Republic of Ireland&quot; andcolloquially as &quot; the Irish Republic.&quot; The Prime Minister pointedout, however, that the use of the title &quot;Ulster&quot; might provokecontroversy among Irishmen in other parts of the Commonwealth,since the province of Ulster had included counties now within Eire,and it had also been ascertained that the Northern Ireland Govern-ment did not attach great importance to the use of the term&quot;Ulster.&quot; He had just heard that the Northern Ireland Govern-ment still favoured the use of the term &quot; Irish Republic,&quot; even instatutes, as a description of the South. The &quot; Republic of Ireland &quot;was, however, the term adopted by Eire in the recent Republic ofIreland Act and it would be difficult for us to avoid using thatterm as a statutory description.The Cabinet agreed that the North should continue to be described as &quot; Northern Ireland,&quot; and that the South should be described by statute as &quot; the Republic of Ireland &quot; but in officialusage as &quot; the Irish Republic.&quot;
Boundary oiNorthernIreland.Irish LightsCommission.ExtraTerritorialPowers.WestminsterFranchise.There was general agreement that it would be inexpedient toraise with the Eire Government at this stage any questions whichmight provoke legal argument about the boundary between the Northand the South.It was agreed that the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations, after consultation with the First Lord of. the admiralty and the Minister of Transport, should submit to the Eire authoritiesproposals for securing representation of United Kingdom interests on the Irish Lights Commission.The Home Secretary said that, subject to the concurrence ofthe First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister of Transport, hewould like to include the regulation of harbours among the matters which, under Clause 6 of the draft Bill, the Parliament and theGovernment of Northern Ireland could handle in concert with the eire Government.There was general agreement that the Home Secretary&apos;proposal, if acceptable to the other Ministers concerned, should beadopted, and that a provision on the lines of Clause 6 of the draftBill should be included in any legislation. Attention was, however,drawn to the undesirability on general grounds of adding substan-tially to the powers of the Northern Ireland Parliament in matters which might more properly be dealt with by the United kingdom parliament. It was also desirable that, in matters affecting NorthernIreland and Eire, the Commonwealth Relations Office shouldcontinue to communicate with Northern Ireland through the HomeOffice.The Prime Minister said that the Northern Ireland ministers were seriously concerned about the effect in Northern Ireland of theprovision in the Representation of the People Act, 1948, by whichthe qualification for the Westminster franchise, both in GreatBritain and in Northern Ireland, was simply residence on a quali-fying date. They believed that Eire citizens might get their nameon the electoral register by paying a short visit to Northern Irelandaround the qualifying date, and that this strategem might be usedon a scale which would falsify the representation of NorthernIreland at Westminster. The Northern Ireland Ministers had pressed for a six-months&apos; residence qualification, and it had beensuggested to them that the United Kingdom Government might seeits way to propose a three-months&apos; residence qualification, providedthat the residence qualification for the franchise for the NorthernIreland Parliament was reduced from seven to, say, three years.He had, however, just heard that the Northern Ireland Government,on consideration, did not see their- way to reduce the residencequalification for the Northern Ireland franchise.In discussion, it was pointed out that the proposal to retain a residence qualification in Northern Ireland for the UnitedKingdom franchise had been put forward when the Representationof the People Act, 1948, was passing through Parliament, and had then been rejected without a division. If it were now proposedto impose a three-months&apos; residence qualification without any con-cession by the Northern Ireland Ministers in respect of the NorthernIreland franchise, there would be much criticism in Parliamentabout the manner in which Northern Ireland elections were saidto be conducted.In support of a residence qualification in Northern Ireland,it was argued that before the Act of 1948 there had been a differencebetween the law in Northern Ireland and Great Britain on thispoint. In the Commonwealth generally -the franchise was normallyconfined to British subjects, and there was usually a substantialresidential qualification. The control on immigration into GreatBritain and the fairly long sea-route from Ireland meant that inpractice there was no danger of the register in Great Britain beingflooded by foreigners and citizens of Eire, but the position in
Northern Ireland with a long land frontier was very different.Moreover, the situation had altered since the Act of 1948 waspassed, since Eire was now leaving the Commonwealth. It was understood that Eire was unlikely to give reciprocal rights toBritish subjects to vote in Eire elections.While it was recognised that the Northern Ireland ministers might not regard the time as propitious for lowering the NorthernIreland residential qualification, the general feeling of the cabinet was that the Prime Minister should make a further attempt to persuade the Northern Ireland Government to reduce the residen-tial qualification for the Northern Ireland franchise from sevento, say, five years, before a final decision was taken whether to propose a three-months&apos; residential qualification in NorthernIreland for the Westminster franchise.Membership of There was general agreement that it was undesirable to dealNorthern in the Ireland Bill with certain minor points regarding the member-Ireland ship of the Northern Ireland Parliament which had been raisedParliament. by the Northern Ireland Government, and that accordingly Clause 7should be omitted from the draft Bill.Commonwealth With reference to paragraph 33 of CP. (49) 4, The ChancellorCommittees. of the Exchequer said that he was anxious that Eire should remain a member of the Sterling Area Statistical Committee. Althoughnone of the foreign countries included in the sterling area, was infact represented on it, this was not in form a Commonwealth Com-mittee; and it was to the advantage of this country that Eire shouldcontinue to be represented on itThe Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the introduction of legislation onthe lines of the draft Bill annexed to CP. (49) 5, subjectto further consideration of Clause 5, to the possibleamendment of Clause 6 mentioned in discussion and tothe omission of Clause 7.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to make a further attempt to persuade the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland toreduce the residential qualification for the NorthernIreland franchise, e.g., from seven to five years, in returnfor the introduction of a residential qualification ofthree months for the exercise in Northern Ireland of the westminster franchise.(3) Approved the other proposals put forward in CP. (49) 5as noted above.(4) Approved the recommendations made bv the working partyin paragraphs 3-9, 12-13, and 32^37 of CP. (49) 4,subject to the point noted above regarding Eire&apos;s member-ship of the Sterling Area Statistical Committee.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,12th January, 1949.
