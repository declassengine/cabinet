CABINET 33 (49)contents minute no. subject      Prevention of Corruption2      China     ................Defence of Hong Kong.3      Leakages of Information
1, The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Attorney-General (CP. (49) 78) proposing that where gifts or other induce-ments had passed between a person seeking a licence or a permitfrom a public authority and a public employee, the inducementshould be deemed in criminal proceedings to have been given and received corruptly unless the contrary was proved. A similar rule of criminal procedure had applied to public contracts since the passingof the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1916.The following arguments were adduced in favour of theproposed change in the law : (a) Corruption was an exceedingly difficult offence to prove. Ina recent case in which a civil servant had received substantial giftsfrom persons interested in the grant of import licences, a prosecu-tion had failed because there was no direct evidence to show that thecivil servant had been influenced by the gifts in the conduct of his official duty.(6) Corruption in the Civil Service and among local authorityemployees was rare, but there had been a significant rise in thenumber of cases reported to the Director of Public Prosecutions inrecent years. It was essential for the maintenance of the standards of public administration that corruption should be ruthlesslystamped out; and those who might be tempted to resort to corruptpractices should be strongly deterred.(c) Although admittedly it was contrary to the general principles of English law to place the onus of proof on the defendant, the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1916, had made an exception which was generally accepted. To extend the provisionsof that Act to the grant of licences and permits was merely torecognise the expanded scope of Government activities, without making any further serious infringement of the general principle.Moreover, there remained a general obligation on the prosecution to prove their case : the onus was transferred to the defendant only inrespect of certain transactions which, if they were honest, he shouldhave no difficulty in explaining.(d) The Attorney-GeneraFs proposal had the approval of theLord Chief Justice and the Director of Public Prosecutions. Publicopinion would welcome this proof that the Government were endeavouring to prevent corruption, and there was no reason to fear that opponents of the Government could make political capitalout of the proposal since the results of the Lynskey Tribunal had shown that a resolute handling of issues of this kind redounded tothe credit of the Government.Against the proposal it was argued : (e) The proposal would give the impression that corruption was more widespread in the Civil Service, and in local government thanin fact it was; for it would be assumed that the Government wouldnot take this grave step without serious cause. In fact the relaxation of controls was narrowing the field within which licences and permitswere granted and so lessening the need for a measure of this kind.(/) Contracts were the subject of a fairly elaborate procedure and a defendant could discharge the onus of proof under the Act of1916 by showing that he had observed the rules governing the grantof the contract. He would find it much more difficult to discharge the onus of proof in a case involving the grant of a licence or permit,since these were largely discretionary and there were fewer objectivetests by reference to which the defendant could prove to the courtthat he had exercised his discretion honestly.(g) Heavy punishment could, be inflicted upon civil servantsunder their disciplinary code, and to that extent recourse to the criminal courts was less necessary.(h) While the Attorney-GeneraFs proposal might be directedlargely at maintaining the integrity of the Civil Service, its effects on local government would be closely scrutinised in Parliament andPrevention ofCorruption.(previous reference:CM. (49) 7thConclusions,Minute 2.)
elsewhere. The local authority associations had not asked for thesewide powers, nor had they been consulted on the subject. Neitherthe Act of 1916 nor the Attorney-General&apos;s proposal affectedmembers of local authorities, but the question would be raised duringthe passage of any Bill through Parliament whether corruption was confined to the employees of local authorities. There might be pressure to extend both the Act of 1916 and the present proposal to members of local authorities.(i) As the authorities in Scotland were not in favour of the attorney-General&apos;s proposal, the Attorney-General had been pre-pared to restrict his proposal to England. It would, however, bedifficult to have different laws on this subject in England and scotland, particularly as the Act of 1916 applied to both countries.(?) The time was not opportune for a measure of this characterThe Civil Service had successfully withstood the strains of the war-time system of controls and had emerged with credit from the investigations of the Lynskey Tribunal. Moreover, the Governmenthad not yet received the report of the Committee which had beenappointed on intermediaries between Government Departments andthe public. The introduction at this stage of a Bill dealing withcorruption might give the impression that corruption was prevalentin the public service and that the Government had felt obliged torush through urgent legislation on that account.The Prime Minister, summing up, suggested that in the lightof the discussion and of the division of opinion which it had dis-closed the Cabinet would be well-advised to adjourn considerationof this question.The Cabinet-Agreed that they should not proceed further at the presenttime with the proposal put forward in CP. (49) 78.China. 2.   The Minister of Defence drew the attention of the cabinet defence of      to a telegram from the British Defence Co-ordination Committee in hong Kong.     the Far East suggesting that, as the Commissioner-General for(Previous       South-East Asia and the Commanders-in-Chief of the Land andEeferenee:      Air Forces in the Far East would shortly be in London, the ChiefsCM.(49)32nd  01 Staff should take this opportunity of discussing with them theConclusions,    effects which recent developments in China were likely to have in minute 2.)      India and South-East Asia.   The Committee suggested that therewas urgent need for diplomatic, economic and military action toform a containing ring against further Communist penetration; andthat this ring should be formed by the co-ordinated action of many countries, including India, Burma, Siam, French Indo-China andthe Dutch East Indies.   The Minister added that the Communistforces seemed to be making rapid progress south of the Yangtse, and. the need for a co-ordinated policy in respect of Hong Kong mightbe more urgent than had been assumed in the Cabinet&apos;s earlier discussions.The Cabinet were also informed that Mr. L. D. Gammans, M.P.,had put down a Question for answer by the Prime Minister, askingwhat approaches had been made to the Governments of other commonwealth countries regarding the possibility of their con-tributing towards the defence of Hong Kong. The AustralianMinister of Defence was reported to have stated, in reply to questions at a recent Press Conference, that the United Kingdom Governmenthad not yet suggested that Australia might assist in the defence of hong Kong.
In discussion the following points were made : *(a) Other Commonwealth Governments had been kept informed of developments in China and of our decision to reinforce thegarrison at Hong Kong. The time had probably come to send thema fuller appreciation of possible future developments and to mentionto some of them the possibility of their making some contribution towards the defence of Hong Kong. The Commonwealth relations office had been inclined to advise that in the first instance thisquestion should be raised with the older Commonwealth Govern-ments only; and. it was agreed that material support in the defenceof Hong Kong was more likely to be forthcoming from Australiaand New Zealand than from any of the other commonwealth countries. On the other hand, it was pointed out in the discussion that the first aim of our policy should be to deter the Communistforces in China from making an attack upon Hong Kong and to convince world opinion that it was expedient that the british position there should be maintained. From this point of view it was perhaps even more important that the Commonwealth countries in asia should express at least their moral support of our policy in hong Kong. India&apos;s support, in particular, would have a powerfuleffect on public opinion throughout Asia.(6) It would be preferable if Mr. Gammans could be persuaded to withdraw his Question, on the ground that it would not be possible at the moment to make any public statement about the attitude ofthe other Commonwealth Governments on this question.(c) The Cabinet were informed that the proposal made inthe telegram from the British Defence Co-ordination Committeein the Far East was consistent with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s general desire for closer political co-operation between the various countries of South-East Asia. In discussion, however, doubts were expressed about the expediency of attempting to make common cause on this issue with French Indo-China and the Dutch East Indies. TheColonial policies of the French and the Dutch were regarded withgreat suspicion by the Asiatic peoples; and there would be little prospect of persuading the Government of India to join in discus-sions on China in which the French and the Dutch were to berepresented.If, therefore, any approach were to be made to the Governmentslisted in this telegram, it should be related to the situation in South-East Asia generally and should not give prominence to our anxietiesabout the future of Hong Kong.(d) Ministers should also treat with reserve any suggestion thatHong Kong could be used by the Western Powers as a rallying-point for anti-Communist forces in Asia. The Government of India were convinced that in Asia Communism was most dangerous when itcould ally itself with nationalism; and they would regard it asplaying into the hands of the Communists to represent Hong Kongas an outpost of western democracy in the Far East.(e) The suggestion was made that in the long run it would prove impossible to preserve Hong Kong as a British Colony, and thatserious consideration ought now to be given to the possibility ofgiving it the status of an international port on the analogy of trieste. It was, however, the general view of the Cabinet that thiswas not an opportune time to consider so radical a change of policy.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the United Kingdom Government must make every effort to carry the other Commonwealth Govern-ments with them in their policy in respect of Hong Kong;and took note that the Secretary of State for Common-wealth Relations would at once formulate, in the light ofthe discussion, and submit to the Prime Minister, specific proposals about the timing and method of the approach
and the basis on which other Commonwealth Govern-ments should be asked whether they would be preparedto assist in the defence of Hong Kong.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for mr. Gammans, M.P., to be asked to withdraw his question from the Order Paper.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence to consult with the foreign secretary, on his return to London, regarding the scopeof the discussions to be held during the forthcoming visit to London of the Commissioner-General for South-east asia and the Commanders-in-Chief of the Land and AirForces in the Far East.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to enquire into the suggestion that Chinese Communists deportedfrom Malaya were finding their way into Hong Kong.(5) Asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies to circulate,for the information of the Cabinet, a factual apprecia-tion of the present situation in Hong Kong, covering suchpoints as the composition of the population bynationalities, the value of British commercial interestsand the importance of the Colony from the point of viewof British interests in China generally.3. The Lord President drew attention to an article on the ironand Steel Bill published in the Observer of 8th May. This articlesuggested that the political correspondent of the Observer was able to inform himself of the course of the confidential discussions in which Ministers formulated their policies.After discussion, the Cabinet Invited the Lord Chancellor to make enquiries on their behalf with a view to tracing the source from whichconfidential information of this kind became known to thepolitical correspondent of the Observer.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,9th May, 1949.Leakages ofInformation.(previous reference:CM.
