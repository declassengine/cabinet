commonwealth relations.ConstitutionalDevelopmentsin India.(previous reference:CM. (48) 71stConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Prime Minister made a report to the Cabinet on therecent course of the discussions on India&apos;s future relations with theCommonwealth. . ,When the Cabinet had last discussed this matter on 12th.November, 1948, the position had been reached that Pandit Nehru&apos;s&quot; Ten-Point&quot; memorandum had been found by the Law officers to afford, from the strictly legal point of view, an insufficient basis for India&apos;s continued membership of the Commonwealth, and theCabinet had agreed that the substance of the Law Officers&apos; opinion should be communicated to Pandit Nehru and to the Prime ministers of Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Since then Pandit Nehruhad sent a further &quot; Eight-Point &quot; memorandum, which provided,if anything, even less in the way of a connection with the Crown;and talks with Ministerial representatives of Canada, Australia andNew Zealand had shown that there was general agreement that thismemorandum could not be regarded as a sufficient basis for India&apos;sfull membership of the Commonwealth. Pandit Nehru was so informed, but was told that the United Kingdom and other Common-wealth Governments welcomed India&apos;s desire to remain in associa-tion with the Commonwealth and were considering what form ofspecial association could be devised. Opposition leaders were informed at that stage of the position which the negotiations had reached.Since then there had been no direct reply from Pandit Nehru,but indirectly it had bdeh learned that India would hot be satisfied with any form of association which implied a two-tier CommOn-wealth and fell short of full membership. India desired either tobe in the Commonwealth or out of it, and was not prepared to accept any intermediate position in which her constitutional status Wouldbe inferior to that of Pakistan or Ceylon.It thus appeared that India was not likely to be willing toaccept any substantial link through the Crown, but would still desireto remain within the Commonwealth. If that situation arose,Commonwealth Governments would be faced with the questionwhether the constitutional basis of the Commonwealth connectionshould be so adapted as to enable the CommonWealth to include a republican country which owed no allegiance to the Crown. Thiswas not a question which could be decided by the United KingdomGovernment alone. It was clearly one on which all the Common-wealth Governments must, if possible, reach a common view. Itwas, therefore, proposed that a special meeting of commonwealth prime Ministers should be held at the end of April or the beginningof May to discuss the situation. It was not an easy time to arrange a conference, since General Elections were impending in Canada,Australia and New Zealand, but present indications were that itwould be practicable to hold a meeting in. London then, at which allthe Commonwealth Governments would be represented and most ofthem would be represented by their Prime Ministers. In prepara-tion for that meeting personal emissaries were being sent in thefollowing week to the Commonwealth capitals to explain to the otherPrime Ministers the position reached in the discussions here and thevarious considerations which, in the opinion of United Kingdom\iim-i.--r-  must be taken into account in reaching a decision.was  going  to  Australia  and  New Zealand;Ministers,Lord  ListowelMr Gordon-Walker to Pakistan and Ceylon and subsequently toIndia; Sir Percivale Lieschmg to South Africa and Sir NormanBrook to Canada. ^Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in     the House of Commons in the following week.the House ofCommons.
The Cabinet need not at this stage take any final decision onthe question whether the constitutional nature of the commonwealth should be so adapted as to enable it to include a republican India-United Kingdom Ministers should reserve their final view on thisuntil they had heard the opinions which would be expressed by other commonwealth Prime Ministers at the forthcoming conference,including their views on the probable reaction of public opinion inthe various Commonwealth countries. He would, however, be glad if he could have the general endorsement of his colleagues to the viewthat the political advantages of retaining India within the Common-wealth were so great that Commonwealth countries would, if it proved necessary for that purpose, be justified in making some concessions from their traditional point of view about the Common-wealth connection, and taking some risks, with a view to keepingIndia with them. The threat of Communist encroachment in South-East Asia was very real and, from the political angle as well as fromthe strategic and economic angles, there were very great advantages in retaining India within the Commonwealth. At the same time, he did not wish to underestimate the difficulty of devising an adequatelink if India ceased to owe allegiance to the Crown. Wisestatesmanship would be required if a satisfactory solution was tobe found.The King had been fully informed of the progress of thediscussions and of the steps which were now proposed. TheOpposition leaders had also been informed in confidence.In discussion there was full support for the policy which thePrime Minister had outlined.  It was recognised that on political,strategic and economic grounds it was important that India shouldbe retained within the Commonwealth.   There was general agree-ment that if in the last resort the choice were found to be betweenallowing India to leave the Commonwealth or adapting the constitu-tional basis of the Commonwealth in such a way as to enable a republican India to remain within it, every endeavour should bemade to devise a satisfactory link which would retain India withinthe Commonwealth. Although the Crown had been the bond of unityin the Commonwealth, it would be a disservice to the Crown ifCommonwealth Ministers allowed a position to develop in which theCrown was made to appear a stumbling-block to the continuedcohesion of the Commonwealth.   At the same time Ministers were impressed by the advantages of India&apos;s preserving some links withthe other Commonwealth countries through the Crown. The develop-ment of the Communist threat in South-East Asia, the lesson of burma, the general world situation and a growing feeling of goodwill towards this country were all factors which might operate to induce India to make some concessions for the sake of continuedassociation in the Commonwealth.  If, as seemed possible, the asso-ciation of India with other Commonwealth countries grew closer as time went on, links with the Crown which might seem tenuous inpresent circumstances would grow stronger with the passage of timeand with a growing desire to stress the bonds of unity.    It wassuggested in this connection that Commonwealth countries might beprepared to allow the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council tocontinue as the supreme court of appeal in certain classes of case.The Cabinet-Endorsed the policy outlined by the Prime Minister for handling the question of India&apos;s future relations with theCommonwealth.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,Zrd March, 1949.
