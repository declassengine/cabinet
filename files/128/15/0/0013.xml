1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by&apos; the Ministerof Defence (CP. (49) 32) proposing that decisions on some of the- major recommendations of the Lewis Committee on Army and AirForce Courts-Martial Procedure should await the report of a com-mittee on naval courts-martial which was being set up under thechairmanship of Mr. Justice Pilcher. A draft announcement was appended to the memorandum.The Minister of Defence said that the Government had imple-mented, or were in process of implementing, several of the reeom-mendations of the Lewis Committee, and they would be pressed tointroduce also some of the more far-reaching proposals in the Com-mittee&apos;s report, e.a., the creation of the proposed courts-martialappeal court and the reconstitution of courts-martial with civilianJudge Presidents. These changes would, however, affect the basicstructure of the administration of justice in the Services; and it seemed reasonable to suggest that they should not be introduced inthe Army and Air Force until the extent to which they should beadopted in the Navy had been examined.In discussion, the following points were made : (a) There would be criticism of the Governments failure to initiate an inquiry into naval courts-martial at the time when the lewis Committee was set up or, alternatively, immediately after thereceipt of their report in May 1948.(b) The Admiralty considered that the enforcement of dis-decipline in the Navy involved considerations different from those inthe Army and Air Force, a,nd the working of the Naval discipline act had not given rise to any recent complaints. They had noobjection, however, to the holding of the inquiry into the procedure of naval courts-martial though it seemed doubtful whether itcould be completed in three months, as was suggested in the draft announcement annexed to CP. (49) 32. It was agreed that noforecast need be given of the date on which the inquiry was likelyto be completed.(c) Commonwealth Governments were interested in courts-martial procedure and should be kept in touch with developments.(d) The Prime Minister proposed certain changes in the word-ing of the third paragraph of the draft announcement designed tomake it less defensive in tone.   These were approved..The Cabinet-(1) Approved the procedure for handling the reform of courts-martial procedure outlined by the Minister of defence in CP. (49) 32. -(2) Authorised the Minister of Defence to make a statement onthe subject in the House of Commons on the lines outlined in the draft annexed to CP. (49) 32, subject to the amendments proposed by the Prime Minister.2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (49) 30) covering a report on the economicsituation.The following points were made in discussion : The collection of steel scrap in this country continued at athe target, but the target had probably been set rather high. Whileworsted cloth found a ready market, there was some difficulty inselling woollen cloth.
Food.Export Trade.Balance ofPayments.Prices.The table in paragraph 18 of CP. (49) 30 showed that there hadbeen a substantial increase in consumption per head of certain foodsin the United Kingdom, as compared with pre-war consumption.The number of calories per head was only slightly less than beforethe war. Much less protein was being eaten in the form of meat oreggs, though more was being eaten in the form of fish and vegetables.The record level of exports in January of about 160 per cent,of the 1938 volume was a notable achievement, though January wasusually a good month. Exports to the western hemisphere were not,however, so satisfactory. Although the value of the exports to canada and the United States had risen, the percentage of total exports going to these markets had, if anything, declined.The latest figures of European requirements of coal suggestedthat Western Europe would nOt need all the coal that this country was planning to export. In order to get a realistic picture, however,it was necessary to analyse coal requirements in terms of qualities :there would, for example, be large demands for coking coal. Europe&apos;s requirements for coal might also be increased by failure to obtainall the oil for which she was asking.Attention was drawn to Russian offers to export tractors to egypt and to the need to ensure that Middle East markets weregiven a high priority in the export of British goods.During the first six weeks of 1949, the dollar deficit had been running below the average forecast for the first quarter. It was,however, impossible to count on this improvement being maintainedover a longer period.There seemed to be definite signs of a general fall in prices.Thus, in the United States, the recent fall in commodity prices was likely to go further than the corresponding fall last year. InFrance, there had recently been a considerable fall in the price ofgold, which suggested that the peasants were ceasing to hoard gold,and commodity prices were falling. The success of the recent Frenchloan suggested greated confidence in the franc. Cairo cotton prices had fallen and this would not only reduce the cost of our cotton imports but would improve our competitive position for sellingcotton goods in difficult markets, such as Canada. There was general agreement that a careful watch would have to be kept on themovement of world prices in order to ensure that, in so far as theycould, be controlled, they did not fall to a point which caused ageneral trade depression.The Cabinet-Took note of CP. (49) 30 and of the points raised in the-discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st February, 1949.
