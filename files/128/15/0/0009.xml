The Prime Minister outlined to the Cabinet the speech which he was proposing to make in the House of Commons that afternoon in the debate on the report of the Lynskey Tribunal.The Prime Minister recalled that at their earlier discussion on 27th January the Cabinet had agreed that a committee shouldbe appointed to &quot;consider the activities of persons who offered their services, for payment, as intermediaries between business firms and government Departments. Since then he had received some evidenceof similar activities by persons having access to Ministers and members in the House of Commons. Mr. Speaker, who had been consulted, had taken the view that the particular case on whichdefinite evidence was available was not sufficiently recent to warrantreference to the Committee of Privileges; but he had suggestedthat he should himself take up the general question by reviewing,in consultation with a few Members representing the main political parties, the existing rules regulating the admission of strangers tothe precincts of Parliament and their use of the facilities thereprovided. The Cabinet welcomed this suggestion, and took note thatthe Prime Minister would refer to it in the course of the debate.The Cabinet had some discussion on the risks attendant uponprocedure under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, andalso on the attitude adopted by the Lynskey Tribunal towardsallegations, brought to their notice in anonymous letters. It wasagreed that the Attorney-General might intervene in the debateif Parliamentary criticism was directed against the Tribunalsconduct of; the inquiry.The Cabinet-...&quot;Took note, with approval, of the statements which thePrime Minister proposed to make in the debate on thereport of the Lynskey Tribunal.iParliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in     the House of Commons in the following week,the House of The Cabinet noted that Friday, 11th February, would be-Commons devoted to the discussion of Private Members&apos; Bills and had a preliminary discussion on the Safety of Employment (EmployersLiability) Bill, the Second Reading of which would be moved that day by Mr. P. Piratin, M.P. They were informed that the bill would be considered in detail by the Legislation Committee on 8th February, and any points of principle which arose could bebrought to the notice of the Cabinet on 10th February.Newfoundland.(previous reference erence:CM. (45) 56thConclusions,-Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum bv the Secretaryof State for Commonwealth Relations (CP. (49) 17) outlining the steps which had been taken in connection with the admission of new foundland to the Canadian Confederation, and asking for authority to introduce the North America Bill, 1949 (of which adraft was appended), when an Address asking for the Bill had beensubmitted to The King by the Parliament of Canada.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said thatthe alternatives before the people of Newfoundland were fully discussed by the Cabinet on 27th November, 1945. The procedure which had then been agreed upon had led to the measures whichwere now being taken to incorporate Newfoundland in the CanadianConfederation. The people of Newfoundland had been fully con-suited by referenda and by the convening of a National Convention,and it was clear that a majority was in favour of incorporation inCanada. His information was that the minority which favoured the restoration of responsible government independenwas steadily losing strength.
RussianForeignPolicy.(previous reference :CM. (48) 19thConclusions.)CountyAgriculturalExecutiveCommittees,In discussion^ it was pointed, out that the critics of the bill would argue that, when the Commission, of Government wasisefrupjthe United Kingdom Government had promised: that responsible government would be returned to Newfoundland on request.. Theprocedure now to be adopted would have the effect that that requestcould now never be made. Moreover, the British North AmericaAct, 1867, had contemplated that union, with. Canada,would requireapproval by- a Newfoundland Parliament, and no steps, had-: beentaken to convene a Parliament under the old constitution so that, theissue might be decided by that Parliament!.The general feeling, of the Cabinet was; that all practicable steps had been taken to consult the people of Newfoundland on. their future, and that the United Kingdom. Government could not havebeen -expected&apos; to; force the old constitution. 0m the- people of New-foundland against their wishes as expressed! in the referenda.Moreover, it could not properly be argued that incorporation inCanada represented a loss, of democratic government; Any attemptto depart from the policy hitherto, followed) would cause grave difficulties in Newfoundland and with; the Canadian Parliament.The Cabinet--Agreed that, on receipt of a request fromi the canadian parliament, the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations should introduce the British North America Billin the terms, of the-draft annexed to. CP; (49) 17.4 The Prime Minister said that the. Foreign Secretary had arranged for Speakers&apos; notes to be prepared, setting out in some detail the history of the unwillingness of the Soviet Government toco-operate with other nations in international matters These werebeing circulated to Ministers. He hoped that his colleagues wouldmake use of them in their speeches for the purpose of counteringthe allegations. made by Communists, and: others that it., was; theWestern Powers who had if ailed to co-operate with a willing Russia.5. The Minister of Agriculture said: that, in constitutingCounty Agricultural Executive: Committees. under- the provisionsof; the Agriculture Act;?; 1947, he was. obliged to - appoint some members from lists drawn up by associations representing certaininterests. Both the National Union of Agricultural Workers andthe Transport and General Workers&apos; Union were showing atendency to deprive him of his power of selection by submitting no more names than there were vacancies to fill. This was the more serious because in two recent cases the Transport and general works&apos; Union had submitted, for a single vacancy, the name, oftheir local organiser, who happened in both cases to be a Communist.The Cabinet,agreed that,in such a,case a-Minister should insist on sufficient names: being, submitted to preserve his. power, of selection.Cabinet.
