Bamobilioation        i.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of clothing for Defence (CP. (49) 68) recommending that National Service menNational should receive on demobilisation a grant of  5 a head towards theSendee Men. provision of civilian clothing.The Minister of Defence said that it had been announced at thetime that National Service men called up after 1st January, 1947,would not be eligible for the special demobilisation outfit which hadbeen provided for men who had served during the war and had been released under the &quot;age and length of service&quot; scheme. this announcement had occasioned no protest at the time; but, now that men called up early in 1947 were beginning to be discharged, therewas a growing volume of discontent in the Services which wasreflected in representations by Members of Parliament. after discussion with the Service Ministers he recommended that eachNational Service man should receive on discharge a grant of  5towards the cost of civilian clothing. The cost of this concession would be over  1 million in the coming financial year, and he asked that this should be accepted as an addition to the approved service estimates.   The cost would be less in subsequent years.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was not preparedto authorise any supplementary Estimate for this purpose. If the concession had to be made, the cost must be met by savings under other heads in the approved Estimates.In discussion it was argued that the Government would have astrong case for declining to make any provision from public fundstowards re-equipping National Service men with civilian clothingafter eighteen months&apos; or two years&apos; service with the Forces. Theyhad much less claim to special consideration than the men demobil-ised after war service under the &quot;age and length of service&quot;scheme. If account were taken of all that they received in kindduring their period of service, they should be able to save enoughduring that period to make good any deficiencies in their civilianoutfit. i They should be in at least as good a position as many youngmen in civilian employment to find money to buy clothes. And, ondischarge, they received pay and ration allowances for at leasteighteen days; they were allowed to keep some part-worn Serviceclothing; and they could buy battle-dress and Service great-coats atreduced prices. It was also pointed out that, if the principle wereconceded, it would be difficult to resist the inevitable pressure thatthe grant should be increased to something substantially more than 5 a head.On the other hand, some Ministers felt that it would be difficultto continue to resist the Parliamentary pressure for some concession though it was generally agreed that, if any concession had to bemade, the cost must be met within the total of the -approved service estimates.As regards the method of the concession, it was generallythought to be preferable that, if any assistance was to be given, itshould be given in kind. If the administrative cost of reinstatingthe earlier scheme was thought to be too great, the Services mightbe able to introduce a system by which a man would receive, insteadof a cash grant, an order exchangeable for a suit by one or other ofa small number of large firms with whom bulk purchase arrange-ments could be concluded on advantageous terms. Alternatively,Service Ministers might consider a scheme by which National Servicemen could allot one or two shillings a week from their pay towardsthe cost of a civilian outfit on the basis that the State would bringthe total of their savings up to, say,  10 on their discharge.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that no addition should be made to the approvedService Estimates for the purpose of assisting NationalService men to provide themselves with a civilian outfiton discharge.36824-2   . b 2
(2) Invited the Minister of Defence and the Service ministers to consider, in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion,whether any such assistance should be given within thelimits of the approved Service Estimates and, if so, in what way it could best be provided.economic affairs.(previous reference:CM. (49) 13thConclusions,Minute 2.)Man-power.Production.external trade.Balance ofPayments.Prices.EuropeanRecoveryProgramme.2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (49) 70) covering a report on the economicsituation.The following points were made in discussion : Good progress had been made, through the Ministry of Labourindustrial rehabilitation centres, in reducing the numbers of un-employable persons, but there still remained a hard core ofunemployables.The persistence of seasonal unemployment in holiday resortsimposed a heavy charge on the community. The possibilities of attracting industries to such resorts had been carefully examined,but it was not easy to find industries which could operateeconomically on a seasonal basis.The steady increase in absenteeism in the coal industry gavecause for anxiety. This was mainly due to involuntary absenteeism^and the possible causes of this development were still being examined by the Minister of Labour and the Minister of National Insurance.There had, however, been a notable increase in output per man-shift,amounting to about 5 per cent, over the past year. The high figuresof coal stocks were somewhat misleading, as a large proportion ofthem consisted of poor-quality coal.The production of pig iron had remained stable for somemonths, and the estimate of future pig iron stocks given in para-graph 12 of CP. (49) 70 might be rather over-optimistic. It was understood that the negotiations which the Iron and Steel Federa-tion were conducting with the Indian Government for the exchangeof steel for pig iron had reached a deadlock, and the Minister ofSupply undertook to consider, in consultation with the Secretaryof State for Commonwealth Relations, whether anything could bedone to facilitate an agreement.No firm conclusions could be drawn from the export figuresfor February, which showed the normal seasonal decline. our overseas trade would inevitably encounter increasing obstacles asnormal conditions returned, and the January figures were likely to prove exceptional.There had recently been a fall in the demand for British carsin the United States; but the manufacturers were making great efforts to expand their sales in other hard-currency markets.Substantial dollar payments had been made to Belgium inJanuary and February, but this was inevitable so long as we were dependent on Belgium for supplies of steel and flax. The attitudeof the Belgian Government on this question had been much morehelpful in recent months.There had recently been a significant fall in zinc prices, whichmight be the first sign of a general decline in metal prices. As theresult of the fall in the prices of farm products, there had been asubstantial reduction in the cost of living in the United States inrecent months. This fall could not, however, be reflected in theUnited Kingdom cost-of-living index as we were no longer buyingany large quantity of food-stuffs in the United States.Attention was drawn to the probable effects of the Bland Bill,which was at present before Congress. The purpose of this bill was to ensure that some 70 per cent, of the commodities bought underthe European Recovery Programme were shipped in United Statesvessels. This would inevitably lead to delays in shipment, since theUnited States mercantile fleet was inadequate to meet these additional requirements; and. in the absence of competition, the
United States shipping interests would have no incentive or obliga-tion to charge reasonable freight rates. By depriving the participating countries of this carrying trade, and thus forcingdown tne general level of freight rates, the Bill would have effectsdirectly contrary to the accepted objectives of the EuropeanBecovery Programme. A reduction of 10 per cent, in Britishfreights would mean a loss equivalent to $120 million. At thesame time, we were being pressed by the United States authoritiesto relax the restrictions imposed on the German shipbuilding1  industry.Dollar The information given in CP. (49) 70 revealed the extent to earnings of which Colonial dollar earnings were dependent on United StatesColonial demands for rubber, tin and cocoa.  In the circumstances, it mightCommodities, be difficult to reach the estimates of Colonial dollar earnings givenin the United Kingdom long-term programme. Emphasis was laid on the importance of making every effort to persuade the UnitedStates Government to reduce the p tion of synthetic rubber witha view to allowing a larger import of natural rubber.The Cabinet-Took note of CP. (49) 70 and of the points raised in thediscussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,28th March, 1949.
