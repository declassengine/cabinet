Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in    the House of Commons in the week following the Whitsun Recess,the House of One of the first of the Private Members&apos; Bills to pass throughCommons. Committee Stage would be the Hairdressers Bill; and the cabinet would have to consider whether the Government Whip should beused for the purpose of ensuring that this Bill was rejected onThird Reading. The Chief Whip was examining the precedents,and a further report would be made to the Cabinet in due course.Business in The Lord Privy Seal said that, in the light of conversationsthe House of which he had held with the Opposition leaders, he now had goodLords. reason to believe that the proceedings in the House of Lords on theIron and Steel Bill would be completed by 21st July. The opposition had tabled an amendment providing that the vesting date under theBill should be postponed until July 1951. The Minister of supply would submit to the Cabinet a memorandum on the issues raised bythis amendment.western union.(previous reference erence:C.M.(49)35thConclusions,Minute 2.)37129-22. The Prime Minister said that of the six persons nominated by the Conservative Party for inclusion in the United kingdom delegation to the Council of Europe three (Mr. Churchill, Mr. HaroldMacmillan and Sir David Maxwell Fyfe) were members of theOpposition Front Bench. After consultation with the lord president, the Foreign Secretary and the Chief Whip, he had cometo the conclusion that the Labour Party representatives in the delegation should include some Ministers; and he had invited theLord President, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and theChief Whip to join the delegation.Some Ministers were inclined to doubt the expediency of including Ministers in the delegation. They considered that theviews of Governments should be expressed through the Committeeof Ministers and that there was some risk of confusion if other ministers expressed views as delegates in the Assembly. If &apos;Ministers supported, as delegates, a point of view which wasoutvoted in the Assembly, this might be represented as a diplomatic&quot;defeat for the Government. Opinions expressed by Ministerialdelegates would be assumed to reflect Government policy and might in practice prove binding on the Government . An embarrassingsituation would arise if Socialist representatives of France or Italyused the Assembly as a forum for attacking the economic policies ofthe Catholic elements in their Governments; for Labour ministers in the United Kingdom delegation would wish to support their fellow Socialists, but might find themselves opposing the policies of Governments with whom other United Kingdom Ministers hadto co-operate in international agencies such as the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation.On the other side it was argued that the United kingdom delegation would not carry sufficient weight in the Assembly unless it included people of high standing in the political life of thiscountry. The Opposition representatives should not be allowed toexercise undue influence over the delegation, and it was desirablethat the delegation should include Labour Party representatives ofat least equal standing and authority. Moreover, it was important that at this first meeting the Assembly should be guided aright inmatters of practice and procedure; and the composition of theUnited Kingdom delegation should be such as to enable it to exercisedue influence in these matters. The Assembly might eventuallydevelop into a federal Parliament of Europe, and the UnitedKingdom Government should do all it could to ensure that itdeveloped on right lines. There should be no difficulty in main-taining contact between the Foreign Secretary, as the Government^representative on the Committee of Ministers, and the Ministersforming part of the delegation. It was not essential that the threeMinisterial representatives should remain in Strasbourg for theb 2
whole month during which the Council was to be in session: therewas provision for alternates, who could relieve the Ministerialrepresentatives when the more important part of the session&apos;business had been completed. It was, however, preferable that the ministerial representatives should be present in the initial stages ofthe session: it would be more difficult to send Ministers out at alater stage as alternates. Finally, the fact that the United kingdom delegation to this first session of the Council included Ministerialrepresentatives need not be a binding precedent for the future : theCouncil was in an experimental stage, and the composition of theUnited Kingdom delegation at later sessions could be varied in thelight of experience.The preponderant view in the Cabinet was that, withoutprejudice to the composition of the United Kingdom delegation atfuture sessions of the Council, it was right that on this first occasion the delegation should include some Ministers.The Lord President said that he was anxious that there shouldbe no ambiguity about the respective responsibilities of the foreign secretary and the Ministers appointed as members of the delegation.On all matters of foreign policy he and his Ministerial colleagues on the delegation would be guided by the Foreign Secretary, and they hoped to have the assistance of advisers from the Foreign Office. Inmatters of procedure in the Assembly, however, and in all questions relating to the management of the United Kingdom delegation, hewpuld regard himself as responsible and would expect to be con-suited, as the senior Minister in the delegation.The Cabinet Approved the Prime Ministers proposal that the lord president, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster andthe Chief Whip should be appointed members of the UnitedKingdom delegation to the Council of Europe.The NationalInsuranceSchemes andSicknessAbsence in industry.(previous reference:C.M.(49)23rdConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (CP. (49) 85) on the effects on absenteeism in industry ofthe increased rates of sickness benefit under the National insurance schemes. They also had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Fuel and Power (CP. (49) 122) on the recent increase ininvoluntary absenteeism in the coalmining industry.The Minister of Labour recalled that he had been asked by theCabinet on 9th December (CM. (48) 79th Conclusions, Minute 6) toconsider whether the increase in the rate of sickness benefit in July1948 had resulted in any increase of absenteeism in industry.Information had been obtained from a number of representativeundertakings, from which it appeared that, while rates of absencethrough sickness were subject to marked seasonal variations, therewere no grounds for supposing that any abnormal increase had occurred since July 1948 in manufacturing industry.The Minister of National Insurance supported the conclusionsset out in CP. (49) 85. As regards the position in the coal industry,he thought that the tendency towards increased absenteeism onaccount of sickness or minor injuries had been offset by the fall in therate of absence through serious injuries. In his view it would be premature to reach a decision on the proposal in CP. (49) 122 for aspecial enquiry into the problem of involuntary absenteeism in the coalmining industry until Ministers had received the report of theCommittee which was examining the effect of the introduction ofthe Industrial Injuries Scheme in that industry. In any event, itwas essential that the National Union of Mineworkers should be associated with any such enquiry, since the Colliery Workers&apos;Supplementary Scheme had been established by an agreementbetween the Union and the National Coal Board.
The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the conclusionssummarised in CP. (49) 85 ignored the serious increase ofinvoluntary absenteeism in the coalmining industry which had takenElace since July 1948. The number of shifts lost on this accountad increased from 5-4 per cent, in May-June 1948 to 7-4 per cent,in March-April&apos; 1949 : during the eight weeks to 14th May last, theaverage number of miners absent through sickness or injury hadbeen 49,600 as compared with 32,500 in the corresponding periodof 1948. The economic consequences of this situation were veryserious, since an increase of 2 per cent, in the rate of involuntary absenteeism meant a loss of 4 million tons of coal a year. Hispreliminary conclusions were that the factors mainly responsible forthis increase were the revised benefits payable under the industrial injuries Act and the Colliery Workers&apos; Supplementary Scheme, theP.A.Y.E. system and the Five-Day Week Agreement; and his impression was that the position had been aggravated by the changein the system of medical certification in cases of industrial accidentor illness. He thought that the situation was so serious as to call for immediate investigation, and he was not, therefore, in favour of postponing the appointment of the Committee proposed in cp. (49) 122 until the present enquiry into the operation of theIndustrial Injuries Scheme had been completed.The Cabinet agreed that, in view of the serious positiondisclosed by CP. (49) 122, it would be advisable to proceed at once with the, appointment of the Committee proposed by the Ministerof Fuel and. Power. There was general agreement that it would be wise to enlist the co-operation of the National Union of Mineworkersin this enquiry.In further discussion, the following points were made : (a) The Minister of Supply said that involuntary absenteeismin the Royal Ordnance Factories had increased very seriously sincethe introduction, in September 1948, of a scheme of sickness leavewith pay for Government industrial employees.(b) The Minister of Health said that there was no evidence ofany relaxation in the standards of medical certification by general practitioners. There had, of course, been a change in the attitudeof employers towards certification in industrial cases, since theyceased to be liable for workmen&apos;s compensation; but he hoped thatthere would be no attempt to restore the system of colliery doctorsas a check on medical certification.(c) The employer had little incentive to discourage involuntary absenteeism among workers whose sickness benefit was a charge on public funds. On the other hand, he had a direct interest in ensuring that his salaried employees were not absent from work without adequate reason.(d) The proposed Committee could consider the possibility ofmaking use of the Social Survey and the Human Factors Panel ofthe Committee on Industrial Productivity in connection with theirenquiry into involuntary absenteeism in the coalmining industry.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of CP. (49) 85.(2) Approved the proposal in CP. (49) 122 that a Committeeshould be set up to investigate the causes of the recent increase in involuntary absenteeism in the coal mining industry, and to submit recommendations forremedying it.(3) Invited the Minister of Supply to circulate a paper on therecent increase in the rate of involuntary absenteeism inthe Royal Ordnance Factories.
4. The Home Secretary said that there was no improvement inthe position at the docks. The unofficial strike at Avonmouth stillcontinued, and at Liverpool, where the local branch of the transport and General Workers&apos; Union appeared to support the strike, 6,000dockers had come out in sympathy with the forty-five men who hadbeen suspended for refusing to unload the British ship Dromore,which had been diverted from Avonmouth. The emergencies committee recommended that the troops at Avonmouth should proceed to unload all the ships at the port, including the MontrealCity, which had been the original cause of the strike there, and thatthe Minister of Labour should endeavour to secure the isolation ofthe Dromore at Liverpool pending an examination of the factsrelating to her cargo. It was believed that if the Dromore was puton one side, the men would probably return to work. There seemedto be some danger that the strike might spread to other ports,including London. The Emergencies Committee had been advised that, with the troops available, the Government could not hope todeal with more than two closed ports at any one time.In discussion, the following points were made : -(a) The Transport and General Workers&apos; Union were under-stood to be trying to arrange for a ballot to be held among the dockers at Avonmouth on the question whether they should returnto work. It was expected that the ballot would be held before theunloading of the Montreal City was begun.(b) The employers and the Dock Labour Boards seemed to beadopting different policies in different parts of the country. AtAvonmouth the employers had decided to make no fresh requestsfrom the Dock Labour Board for labour until the Montreal Citywas manned and worked; whereas at other ports, such as Leith,by agreement between both sides, Canadian ships were being leftunworked until the present dispute was settled.(c) While it was true that only a proportion of the Liverpooldockers had come out on strike and that the Glasgow and Leithdockers had declined to strike in sympathy, it was still uncertain whether the strike would spread. There was, for example, some danger that men at the London docks might come out on strike.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Home Secretary to arrange for the militaryunits at Avonmouth to proceed with the unloading of theships in the port, including the Montreal City.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour to endeavour to secure theagreement of the employers that the Dromore should beisolated at Liverpool, pending an examination of thefacts relating to her cargo.Railway The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Minister of disputes. Transport (CP. (49) 130) indicating the steps which the railway executive had taken to present to the public the facts relating tothe current railway strikes about lodging turns and the present stateof the negotiations on the wage claim of the National Union of railwaymen.The Minister of Labour said that representatives of the NationalUnion of Railwaymen, in discussion with his Ministry, had said thatthey proposed to recommend to their Executive that they should endeavour to secure a resumption of normal working and the renewal of discussions with the Railway Executive about lodging turns.The Cabinet-(3) Took note of CP. (49) 130 and of the statement by theMinister of Labour.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,2nd June, 1949.industrial disputes.(previous reference:CM. (49) 39thConclusions,Minute 1.)Dockers&apos;Strikes.
