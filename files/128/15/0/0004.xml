OlCM. 4Food. i;   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of meat Eation. Food (CP. (49) 11), recommending that the ration of carcase meat(Previous should be reduced from Is. to lOd. a week from 23rd January, butEeference: that for the ten weeks from 23rd January until 2nd April thereCM. (48) 79th should be a supplementary allowance of 2d. worth of canned meat.Conclusions, It might not prove to be possible to maintain this supplementaryMinute 6.) allowance of canned meat after 2nd April without reducing the stocks of canned meat to a dangerously low level.The Minister of Food said that he did not suggest that theCabinet should take a decision now on the position which might arise after 2nd April. The position could be reviewed again before that date in the light of the progress made in the negotiations withthe Argentine Government for a new agreement.In discussion, it was pointed out that the public statement about the reduction in the carcase meat ration which would operate-from 23rd January, and about the possibility of a further reductionby way of stopping the proposed canned meat ration, should be care-fully framed from the point of view of its effect on the Argentinenegotiations and on public opinion in this country. The minister should issue a carefully considered statement, after consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and should give general guidance to the press through a conference with Lobbycorrespondents.A short discussion followed on the effect of the food subsidies on meat and fish. The subsidy on meat kept the price low and thedemand high, as compared with the price and demand for fish. TheCabinet felt that it would be inexpedient to carry out the presentreduction in the ration by increasing the price of meat; but notedthat it was for consideration whether any extra cost incurred in thepurchase of meat under new agreements should not be passed on tothe consumer.The Cabinet-Approved the proposal in CP. (49) 11 that the weeklyration of carcase meat should be reduced from Is. to lOd.as from 23rd January, but should be supplemented forten weeks from that date by 2d. worth of canned meat.Palestine.(previous reference erence:CM. (49) 3rdConclusions.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that he had been considering how best to give effect to the desire expressed by the Cabinet at their meeting earlier in the day that de facto recognition should be accorded to the Government of Israel. He thought it would be advantageousif, in discussing this with the United States Government, he could. arrange that they would simultaneously accord recognition toTrans Jordan and authorise him to state that the Governments ofthe United Kingdom and the United States had reached a commonunderstanding on Middle East policy as a whole. Jewish interestsin the United States had steadily opposed the recognition of Trans-jordan, but it seemed reasonable that this country&apos;s recognitionof Israel should be accompanied by United States recognition ofTransjordan. He had over a considerable period been discussingMiddle East problems with the United States, and it would be helpful if it could now be announced that the two Governments had reached an understanding on this general problem. This announce-ment, together with the recognition of Transjordan by the UnitedStates and the recognition of Israel by the United Kingdom Govern-ment, could be represented as components of a general policy designedto secure the pacification of the Middle East. In view of theParliamentary considerations involved, he would aim at reaching agreement with the United States Government and completing his consultations with the other interested Governments by24th January,36526-23 2
The Cabinet were informed that preliminary discussions TOththe Opposition leaders in the House of Lords gave good igroundsfor believing that they would refrain from raising the Palestinequestion in the debate on Foreign Affairs on .19th January.The Cabinet-Approved the approaches to the United States government proposed by the Foreign Secretary and invited him toreport progress at the Oabinet&apos;s meeting on 24th January.Anglo-NorwegianFisheryDispute.(previous reference:CM. (43) 73rdConclusions,Minute 4.)3. On 15th November the Cabinet had invited the foreign secretary (i) obtain the opinion of the Law Officers on the strengthof the British case in the Anglo-Norwegian fishery dispute; (ii) to explore further the prospects of arriving at a satisfactory settlement by negotiation; and (iii) to take all necessary preliminary steps fora reference to the International Court of Justice, if negotiationsfor a direct settlement should be unsuccessful. They now had beforethem a further memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (OP. (49) 9)covering an Opinion by the Law Officers and summarising subse-quent i s-?elop&quot;2ents in the negotiations with the NorwegianGovernmeThe Ik. .u.:ster of Agriculture said that, since this memorandum was circulated, agreement had been reached with the NorwegianDelegation in London on a fresh delimitation of the area of Nor-way&apos;s exclusive fishing rights. This boundary, which was knownas the &quot;Yellow Line.&apos;; did not differ substantially from the &quot;RedLine&quot; which had been agreed as.a modus vivendi in 1933. Hesuggested that this Line should be. accepted as a modus vivendi until it was known whether it was acceptable both to the United Kingdomfishing industry and to the Norwegian Government. In that eventsteps could be taken to embody it in a permanent agreement andit would be unnecessary to have recourse to the.International Court.The Cabinet-Agreed that, subject to the views of the United Kingdomfishing industry, the &quot;Yellow Line&quot; agreed between united Kingdom and Norwegian Delegations in the recent discussions in London on the Anglo-Norwegian fisherydispute should be accepted as a modus vivendi pending further consultation with the Norwegian Government.North-westAtlanticFisheriesConvention.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries(OP. (49) 8) covering the draft of an International Convention forthe North-West Atlantic Fisheries. This explained that the UnitedStates Government had convened a conference in Washington on26th January to draw up a convention for the investigation, pro-tection and conservation under international control of fishing inthe North-West Atlantic. These fishing grounds were of potentialimportance to the British fishing industry, and it was important that the United Kingdom Government should not be excluded fromthe discussions.In discussion there was general agreement that a UnitedKingdom Delegation ought to attend the proposed conference, butMinisters expressed some concern at the action of the United StatesGovernment in initiating a project for the establishment of anInternational Commission for the North-West Atlantic Fisherieswhich would be independent of the Food and Agriculture Organisa-tion. This proposal, while no doubt inspired by the desire to securethe participation of Spain, involved an indefensible duplication of
international authorities. The United Kingdom Delegation ought,therefore, to be instructed to argue that the proposed commission should be brought within the Food and Agriculture Organisation.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendations made in OP. (49) 8.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to instruct the UnitedKingdom Delegation to ask that the proposed Inter-national Commission on the North-west atlantic fisheries should be brought within the Food and agriculture Organisation.Divorce Laws.(previous reference:CM. (47) 32nd-Conclusions,-Minute 5.)5. The Prime Minister said that Mr. G. W. Odey, M.P., wasto address to him on 18th January a Parliamentary Question asking whether the Government proposed to set up a Royal Commissionto examine the divorce laws.There was general agreement that the time was not opportune for such an enquiry.The Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to reply that the Governmentwere not prepared at present to institute an enquiry intothe divorce laws.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,17th January, 1949.
