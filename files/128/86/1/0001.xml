2.      THE SECRETARfc^P^TATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE said that media

reports of the extwfo%&gt;^ industrial action by teachers had been

exaggerated.    One 1 &lt;Qi&amp;y/ &amp;nt of schools had been affected during the

period of industrial w ^o)ximmediately before Easter and over the

period of industrial act |l^s a whole two-thirds of teachers in the

areas affected had contlrfwea^working normally.    The unions intended to

continue taking sporadic ac^*fjlNfrom Monday 27 April, though they were

expected to bring any d i s rufc&lt; &quot;i^rtv  o a halt in the event of a General

Election being called.    It ws^e^^Aar that many teachers felt aggrieved

by the removal of their negotraVMjg^rights.    Their feelings had been

whipped up by the teachers&apos; uniwm. _^jNor whom the negotiation of pay and

conditions was the only reason fo^^ex^tence.    He had taken every

opportunity to set out the Governm^^^S-^sosition.    He would use the

debate on the Order on teachers&apos; paj ^5$3&apos; conditions, which was likely to

take place the following month, to reqzp&amp;ir it in detail and would inform

colleagues in advance of what he propoMw to say.    He had emphasised

that the interim arrangements for the settlement of teachers&apos; pay and

conditions had been made necessary by the manifest failure of the

previous negotiating machinery, which had deli&apos;vexed a negotiated

settlement in only four of the previous twelvrfvye&quot;\Vs.    The present

arrangements were indeed only temporary and tRA- a  xnment were intent

on establishing permanent machinery for the detenffinytion of pay and

conditions.    The willingness of local education a^Ju^e^ties to enforce

teachers&apos; contracts would remain a key issue.    The^^c}j*rs&apos; unions and

others had complained to the International Labour Org m^&amp;tion (ILO)

about the removal of negotiating rights.    The Paymast v&apos;Sje&apos;^ral had

recently written to colleagues proposing that the GovernmVa^*^ response

should be issued in time for it to be considered at the T%2&gt;rs\\neeting in

November rather than at their forthcoming meeting in Ma^&apos;^-^^\

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR1 EMPLOYMENT, reporting on the industrial

action being taken by members of the Society of Public and Civil

Servants and the Civil and Public Servants Association employed in

^Department of Employment offices, said that about 50,000-60,000 persons

Oin Scotland had been paid benefit late as a result of the industrial

^^ction there, but that all these arrears would probably have been

/pj&amp;bxed.    Industrial action in the current week was targeted on

C^focx^aire and Humberside and the North-East.    In Yorkshire and

HjjriDepraide it had been supported by fewer than one-half of those who had

be &lt;^^aJrled out on strike,  though the figures were somewhat higher for

the&lt;5WOTn-East region.    He hoped that it would not affect the

unemp^^H^nt benefit count for April, to be published on 14 May. There

was asM(et no end in sight to the present industrial action.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that the industrial

action in the NpJ^th-East region was being supported by more than 70 per

cent of Depar/yrieim of Health and Social Security staff in the targeted

offices.    ActVjJon^Bt^ected to be taken by staff at the Newcastle Central

Office that day XrouTjq affect claims for retirement pensions and child

benefit.    This sx g*^As*ause little or no inconvenience, either

immediately or in ^^TLajig-term, since order books were issued three

weeks in advance.    WsJ*^^? r Hing programme of industrial action

reached London and th&lt;^*^touih-East region, the National Unemployment

Benefit System computer a-^jheading could be put at risk.

Prisons

THE HOME SECRETARY said that i^jptfer of matters concerning prisons were

likely to attract public attent^^ra irk the following few weeks.    The Home

Affairs Select Committee Report c^^tti&amp;vState and Use of Prisons

(HC 35 - 1) was being published tha^^ay-    The prison population

projections would be published the &amp;ffij&amp;&amp;ing day.    The police were

mounting a campaign against the use ozv^a^ice cells for remand

prisoners:    on the previous night, 299^pisoners had had to be

accommodated in police cells.    The PrisoJi Officers&apos; Association ballot

on the Government&apos;s Fresh Start proposals would take place during the

week beginning 4 May; there seemed to be a fairprospect of a favourable

outcome.    In general, he was able to report a/ eTTs&gt;pnably satisfactory

position in what was inevitably a difficult slfcuaM^jn.

Her Majesty&apos;s

Inspectors&apos;

Report on

Education

in Brent

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE said^^^Her Majesty&apos;s

Inspectors&apos; report on education in Brent would be publishcJjKUie

following day.    It revealed an appalling situation:    de&amp;rtcype of the

highest levels of expenditure per pupil in the country an\^o*p /fl^f the

lowest teacher/pupil ratios, pupils were being sent home ova^^U^putes

about cover.    The report was a vivid illustration of the nee^rwjOnany

of the measures that he proposed to bring forward in his Educa^iy^^yill

in the following Session.    He would make arrangements for it toyje jpfS^en

full publicity.

Hrwp^&amp;CRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that he had attended in

BVlfcrf^ the first meeting since the change of Government in the Republic

ofv]^ri3a)id of the Intergovernmental Conference established under the

AngloyirLgrh Agreement of 1985.    In contrast to some earlier meetings of

the Core^rence,  the protests in Belfast had not been significant. The

meetingohad gone well.    The new Ministers of Foreign Affairs and of

Justice in the Republic had adopted a helpful approach.    There were

signs that progress might be made in co-operation in the field of

security.    Tha^g^jbad recently been three finds of explosives by the

Royal Ulster Krans^abulary (RUC) and the Garda Siochana.    The terrorist

activity of tNe2kPf3&amp; isional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) was increasing,

partly because rfroyilaipnal Sinn Fein had lost political credibility in

the Irish electio  j &gt;ajnd the republican movement evidently felt the need

to demonstrate thaVyl^^remained active in terrorism as well as in the

political field.    In^jJcvNkern Ireland, the marches at Easter, notably

the sensitive Protesranc^cxpe at Portadown, had been the least

troublesome for some ye^j^g^oJTie RUC were handling the situation

3.    THE MINISTER OF STATE,  FOREIGN AnV^J(MONWEALTH OFFICE (Barnoness

Young) said that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had attended a

meeting of the North Atlantic Council on 16 April at which the United

States Secretary of State, Mr George Shultz, had outlined various

options for next steps in nuclear arms contrroL-following his visit to

the Soviet Union.    Specialists from the allieiycowitries would now

consider the way ahead, notably the question VJf^h^s^shorter range

intermediate nuclear forces should be covered irj/an^arms control

agreement eliminating longer range intermediate forces in

Europe. The matter deserved careful thought and f$^7(x nsultation.

It was essential to maintain cohesion among the Alli^^^^She United

States was likely to wish the decisions reached by th^A^Kes to be

conveyed to the Soviet Union in about the third week of^M^^N.

THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE said that there

had been revolts in two army units in Argentina at Easter and a third

&quot;oone on 21 April.    All three revolts had ended without bloodshed and with

^jjke rebels surrendering to the authorites.    The President,

^pfRaul Alfonsin, had had to intervene personally to achieve this

/rjjSrtrame.    He had made certain concessions, the extent of which was not

^ye^e^ar.    The Army Chief of Staff had been replaced.    It was possible

twat^^ne officers charged with human rights abuses might be treated

morC^^tfkently than had been intended.    There had been considerable

publTy^&apos;Tmoort for President Alfonsin and for democracy during these

THE MINISTER riflimTE,  FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE said that there

had been thred^tiya^jTK terrorist incidents in Sri Lanka in the past week.

In the first, onj/17Jwpril,  127 civilians and off-duty servicemen had

been killed.    InvtJteJ/J&amp;cond, on 20 April, 15 civilians had been killed.

On 21 April, a bomi^aY^he main bus station in Colombo had killed up to

150 people and injur^d^ ^least as many.    There had been no British or

European casualties i^r^e^e incidents.    The Tamil militant organisation

known as the Tamil Tigep^^kd denied responsibility for these incidents,

but was probably the cule ft)j British citizens were being advised not

to travel to Sri Lanka un^^J^bis was essential.    The reaction of the

Sri Lankan Government to th^ft^a* tacks had been responsible. Some

successes had been achieved ^w^uiyevent ing inter-communal violence. But

in response to political presYfn^^br counter action, a military

offensive against the Tamil Tig^fs^ftad begun in the north of Sri Lanka.

The end to the ceasefire in Sri l^ftc^meant that the peace process

sponsored by India was unlikely to^^ume in the near future. The

effect of these events on the quest&lt;^i^&amp;T Tamils wishing to remain in

Britain was uncertain. \^^^

Spring

Meetings of

the

International

Monetary Fund

and the

World Bank

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he i^S^isited Washington

before Easter for the spring&apos;meetings of the WnteVim Committee of the

International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the DeverawtfeTyi Committee of the

World Bank, as well as meetings of the Finance MAa^^eys of the Group of

Five (the United States, the United Kingdom, Franc^^tme Federal

Republic of Germany and Japan) and the Group of Sevarir^J^tte five with

Canada and Italy).    It appeared that the problem of T^ ^\f

sensitivities about the work of the Group of Five had bearf^jvercome.

The Ministers had agreed to maintain the Louvre accord vf^eyruary 1987

on the stabilisation of international currencies.    Presst&amp;e^^i been

exerted on Japan and as a result two points had been recorcI J^a^the

Communique on the meeting of the Group of Seven:    that Japa^^und^Ytook

to introduce further meassures to stimualte domestic demand a^ayYjjAt

Japan reaffirmed its commitment to open up its market to import^xJrVv

goods and services.    Following discussion of exchange rates, the^j^^^ad


increased in value, and this seemd to have had the effect of calming

\ international exchange markets.    The pound was firm and relatively

Testable, although the dollar remained somewhat vulnerable.    During the

 ^meetings in Washington he had put forward a new British initiative to

, Vp^rieviate the debt problems of the poorest countries of Sub-Saharan

&lt;^k r&gt;ca.    Most of the debt of these countries was owened to government

Ag^fu&amp;es rather than banks.    The three points in the British proposal

wer^AWt certain aid loans should be converted to grants,  that there

shouLd^Oe generous rescheduling arrangements including extended grace

perrodrs^r^d that interest rates on rescheduled debt should be low. This

proposaywrf&gt; subject to two important conditions:    that all the creditor

countrrer^would participate in the scheme and that the Sub-Saharan

countrie^concerned would follow prudent and sensible economic policies.

The response to the British proposal had been good, not only from the

Sub-Saharan countries themselves but also from the United States which,

in the past, ha&lt;p3&gt;een wary of ideas of this kind.    The British proposal

might be discus&apos;s eqjat the Economic Summit meeting in Venice in June. He

had put forwar*^Kj2~3&gt;ritish plan before France had had the opportunity

to advance its ri^aj/ilan on the same matter.    The French plan was

similar in some way^va the British but presented disadvantages, for

instance that it wouLq^&amp;stort certain lending facilities of the IMF.

If the British plan *^^k^W&gt;ted, there would be some effect on the

timing of public expendiMj^ outgoings in Britain, but it would not be

on the Single European Act and would be holding a referendtw^pxjf) May.

All the main political parties were in favour of ratificatioo^^Tmere

PAY REVIEW

BODY REPORTS

1987

5.^/&apos;jP  Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet

(C($$0^\ about the recommendations of the Pay Review Bodies.

THE CHMej&amp;LOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the paper was the outcome of a

discussXan among Ministers directly concerned with the Review Body

reports.    The Review Bodies had recommended some very expensive

increases, especially for the National Health Service (NHS) groups, and

most of all for^ti^e nurses, who would get an average increase of 9.5 per

cent.    MinisteroSraad considered whether in order to reduce the cost in

1987-88 to rec&apos;qmsj&amp;ftd^eferment of implementation of the recommendations,

but on balance h/ T rakched the view that, except in the case of the Top

Salaries Review iJQd^^^fjSRB) report,  the recommendations should be

accepted in full, ij^5i^jfcj&gt;e due date,  1 April 1987.    In the case of the

TSRB groups, a speci^J^^rablem was created by the link with the Civil

Service pay negotiatidtffs^ j fhe offer made to most civil servants

provided,  for the grades-^rmi^diately below the TSRB groups, an increase

of 4.25 per cent from 1 uS   There would also be further speical

increases raising the costs^&amp;i^ghe offer to 5.2 per cent over the whole

year, but these would not c^eVato payment until later in the year.

Ministers had therefore conciQme^/that the TSRB award should be staged

to reflect this offer, with 4.MT&gt;%^Ncent paid from 1 April, and the

remainder from 1 October.

As to financing, there was no probLeJj^wjjth the TSRB award.    In the case

of the award by the Armed Forces PayCft^rew Body, the Secretary of State

for Defence had indicated that he wouW^J/^prepared to absorb the full

cost in 1987-88 within his current all&lt;5^tion.    He had discussed the

financing of the awards for the NHS groups with the Secretary of State

for Social Services.    The cost of these awards was  426 million in

excess of the current provision for pay increases for the Review Body

groups.    He and the Secretary of State had agD^e&quot;3\\ sub jec t to

confirmation by colleagues,  that the NHS shou\At&gt;rpiude  30 million of

this.    On the normal formula basis,  this would m/rffTSn contribution of

 24 million from England,   3 million from ScotlafiiiLf^iyaillion from

Wales and  1 million from Northern Ireland.    The rartj^fiwg  396 million

would come from the Reserve.    This was a large sum, /jjjK&amp;tould

considerably reduce the scope for agreeing to other c^ik vn the

Reserve. ^^^\

The proposal was that the Cabinet&apos;s decision should be aiv^siroW in a

Written Answer by the Prime Minister that afternoon.    A dra^^H^this

Answer was attached to C(87)7, but he and the Secrejtary of^tjft^for

Social Services were still discussing the presentation of the &lt;&amp;&amp;yfion

on NHS financing. C^/\


In discussion the following main points were made -

\&gt;\       a.      The substantial increase agreed for the nurses would raise

.&lt;^Vv     morale in the NHS, and ease problems of recruitment and retention.

v^/*0   The case for the increases recommended for doctors and dentists was

&lt;^^^much less clear; but it would be difficult to seek to differentiate

/^^yetween the nurses on the one hand and doctors and dentists on the

y^dwer hand.

^^r^^yThe phasing suggested for the TSRB award might cause some

r^ Vnt&lt;J&gt;ent in the Civil Service and would produce only marginal

sav^g.    But the phasing was not proposed for the purpose of

reducing the cost:    if the top grades of the Civil Service were to

be paid the full award from 1 April, there could well be a sense of

grievance among those below them, who would be getting less, and

the managmg^il^f the Civil Service pay offers would be made more

difficult^ &lt;)

c. It wouln(be^/alleged that the Government had decided to approve

these expens rVe^urirds because of the imminence of a General

Election.    It woyM^e important to take the line that the sums

involved could b ^ 5ftfrded only because of the Government&apos;s prudent

managment of the ecOHp*^.

d. The TSRB report\snjjirliamentary secretarial allowances could

not, for printing reastnprVye published until the following week.

Meanwhile,  it was right\\oOm)ake no reference to it in the

statement. &lt;///xs

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up tKe&gt;^9^ussion, said that the Cabinet

endorsed the proposals set out in %\83^, and the method of financing

described by the Chancellor of the S^bjfl^er.    She would announce this

decision by Written Answer that afternywi.&gt;*The Answer would be along

the lines of the draft attached to C(8VK^subject to the further

discussions between the Chancellor of tft k Exchequer and the Secretary of

State for Social Services, the outcome or which should be reported to

her as soon as possible.
