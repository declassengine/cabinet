^T^/^E SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that industrial action

byMnem#&amp;rs of the Society of Public and Civil Servants and the Civil and

PubK  ^jg\vants Association was continuing.    In the following week the

natiotTir^^ipemployment benefit system computer at Reading could be put at

risk, M^yfiich event up to 100,000 people in London might fail to

receive^Senefit, with a particularlyu severe impact in inner city areas.

He would issue a statement to the press at the beginning of the

following week setting out the Government&apos;s position and emphasising

that the greate^-t-vimpact was on the unemployed.

THE PRIME MINI5^B&lt;^&gt;umming up a short discussion, said that the unions&apos;

action was aimed fit Me most vulnerable members of the society. That

message should coiitWwy to be driven home.    It was important that any

comments which Miniv^l^apmade publicly on the facts of the dispute

should be absolutely{^%nte.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHE^^^id that, following the agreements

between the major trading couAj&gt;  #s in Paris and Washington earlier that

year designed to bring about a^rap^^d of greater currency stability,

there had in fact been continuin^f d^Anward pressure on the United States

dollar and recently a marked imprv^ma*pt in sentiment about the

prospects for the United Kingdom ec^Jronui-vwhich had led to upward

pressure on sterling.    It was not iriC^Jyinterests of British exporters

that sterling should rise too strongl) /4ijjPit had been right at the end

of the previous week to offset the pres^^re by a i per cent reduction in

interest rates.    The pound nonetheless remained firm.

Northern

Ireland

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that^t^&amp;had been a

sharp increase in terrorist activity within Northern IreL^jfj. including

the murder on 25 April of Lord Justice and Lady Gibson. XsrfrtsY\had

followed a period of comparative calm, which had been due\k*o d\t to the

Irish Republican Army&apos;s (IRA&apos;s) concern not to prejudice th*Op\o^pect of

Sinn Fein candidates in the Irish general election on 17 FebS^aW/ The

IRA might also have been waiting to see whether Unionist oppoM&apos;opjjfVto

the Anglo-Irish Agreemenmt would be successful and whether the fewV\

Government of the Irish Republic would pursue a less co-operat i-ve^jy\

a&quot;UUde Prede&quot;SS rBritiSh &quot; ^


over Northern Ireland.    Neither eventuality had materialised: indeed,

there were signs that Unionist leaders were contemplating fresh

approaches to the British Government following the next General

^Election.    A further factor prompting the current resurgence of violence

vwas Sinn Fein&apos;s humiliating performance in the Irish elections, in which

^flt had secured only 1.5 per cent of the total vote, and its wish to

^i^onstrate that the organisation remained effective.    It was possible

/ch^rt^vthe latest upsurge would be limited by a wish to avoid jeopardising

^jire J&amp;ance of Mr Gerry Adams retaining his Parliamentary seat, loss of

whj^fi^would be presentationally damaging for the IRA.    Planning of the

mu*3^^of Lord Justice Gibson would have been helped by the fact that no

attei^jtt^Jad been made to conceal the arrangements for his return journey

to Nor^rfiern Ireland when they were made some months previously. Other

recent^ierrorist incidents had occurred in normally safe areas.    In the

light of the latest developments, he was considering a number of

additional security measures.    He was also in touch with the Secretary

of State for/to^nce on how best to meet this latest change in IRA

tactics. v-vi^s.

THE PRIME MINlSSEJ^/^umming up a short discussion, said that it was

important to avoij^^cnnmenting on the details of the latest terrorist

incidents in Northew/^tveland or on possible additional security

measures. ^x\^

FOREIGN

AFFAIRS

Visit by the

Foreign and

Commonwealth

Secretary to

Thailand,

Australia and

New Zealand,

20-27 April

1987

3.    THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH ^^^lARY, reporting on his visit to

Thailand, Australia and New Zealana\rVojp^20 to 27 April, said that he

had been struck throughout by the hrwOfegard in which the United

Kingdom was held, due to its successful economic and financial policies

and its role in East/West relations.    While in Thailand, he had visited

a Cambodian refugee camp.    This had been welcomed by the Thai

Government, which had also expressed its appc&lt; &quot;iation at the Prime

Minister&apos;s having raised the issue of Camboaia during her recent visit

to Moscow.   There was much goodwill towards vHfe/^JJSivted Kingdom on which

to build.    In Australia, the opposition Liberal^Cojlmtry Party coalition

was in disarray, and it was likely that the pre^wj^Dabor Government,

led by Mr Hawke, would win the general election vJny^p^as due within the

next year.    The Australian Government was a stauncH^emwer of the

Australia-New Zealand-United States Pact (ANZUS) an*^wWB^Aismissive of

New Zealand&apos;s attitude to defence.    It was alert to the^^^Van threat in

the Pacific.   Australia was pursuing a robust policy on^fntMrnational

trade in agricultural products.    It remained a significas^^tacket for

United Kingdom goods and services.    The Prime Minister ofM(e^^p.aland,

Mr Lange, was standing by his position on visits to New Zea^a^a/by

warships which he was still seeking to reconcile with New ZeaL^Htp^N

membership of ANZUS.    He had warned Mr Lange that adherence by^New&gt;\


Zealand to its present defence policy could harm its future trade

prospects in the European Community.    In the economic field, however,

the New Zealand Government was pursuing a policy broadly similar to that

v of the British Government, although the level of inflation, while

Vfalling, was still relatively high.

China

CC(87) 13.2

TJ^^QREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, while in Thailand, he

haS^J^l&apos; a further meeting with the Chinese Foreign Minister,

Mr W^O&amp;dequian.    There had been a useful exchange, which had carried

forwavtfdiscussion of the issue of direct elections in Hong Kong.

Arms Control

Previous

Reference:

CC(87) 15.3

THE FOREIGN Alro/C7)MM0NWEALTH SECRETARY said that intensive discussion

was continuingV^u^b^tv the Alliance on arms control.    The subject had

also been discusae^^l^the meeting in Luxembourg of the Western European

Union on 27-28 Apr/r^^which there had been encouraging unanimity on

the need for nuclear/d&amp;perrence and for the retention of a United States

nuclear presence in Eur^S^v    It was important that the Alliance should

reach an early positid ^nyihe latest Soviet proposals on the reduction

of shorter-range interro^dj^^/e^range nuclear forces (SRINF).

In discussion it was noteoXtlra^there was disagreement within the

Federal German Government b^ ^&amp;4jH^the Foreign Minister, Mr Hans-Dietrich

Genscher, and the Defence MinAj&amp;feK^Dr Manfred Woerner, on the question

of SRINF reductions.    This probl^a^vwhich resulted from the existence

of a coalition goverment, remained^pnmatter for concern.

Sri Lanka

Previous

Reference:

CC(87) 15.3

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, following the recent

terrorist incidents in Sri Lanka, the Government had taken military

action against Tamil areas in the north of t)r ^s.ountry. However,

despite suggestions to the contrary, the Govern^Jfent was still pursuing

its search, with Indian help, for a politicaCe^J&amp;tion, although this

would not be easy to achieve. V 

Republic of

South Africa

Previous

Reference:

CC(86) 42.3

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that membrj^^k the South

African Defence Forces (SADF) had carried out a raid itnrfTilmbia on

25 April.   Although this had evidently been intended as\i--^^aXnnaissance

operation against the African National Congress (ANC) ratro^tpan a

major strike,  four innocent Zambians had been killed and oftfe^iwured and

houses had been destroyed.    This had been a major mistake by /r^wADF,


but further action in the near future against neighbouring states could

J not be ruled out. The South African Ambassador had been called in; and

?Okcomdemnatory statement had been issued by the Twelve.

\ yd

Middle East

Previous

Reference:

|CC(87) 7.4

TH^O^IGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the meeting of the

Pale^f^e-^ational Council in Algiers from 20 to 26 April had achieved

some ^rVase in Palestinian unity, although at the price of a more

radical^m^Plcy:    the 1985 Accord with King Hussein of Jordan had been

abrogatex^Cand relations with Egypt damaged.    Overall,  the Middle East

peace proVess had suffered a setback.    The Israeli Foreign Minister,

Mr Shimon Peres, was hopeful that King Hussein would agree to

participate in ap international conference on the Middle East but there

was no early pHfospewt of this.

Italy

Reference:

CC(87) 14.3

THE FOREIGN AND COMMOl^J^foi SECRETARY said that elections would be held

in Italy on 14 June,  fWT&apos;qwJp^g the defeat of the Prime Minister, Signor

Amintore Fanfani,  in a vot^OTi confidence.    Signor Fanfani woudl act as

caretaker Prime Minister urfu&apos;iyjthe formation of a new government after

the elections.    The preparac a^ Nfor the Venice Economic Summit on

8 to 10 June would continue ^y^c^vforward.

The Cabinet - /O^V

Took note.

COMMUNITY

AFFAIRS

Future

Financing

of the

Communi ty

4.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETA^i said that at its meeting on

26-27 April the Foreign Affairs Council had had its first substantive

discussion of the future financing of the CommunLtj^.    The views of

member states were developing broadly as predic/^a^jWi th the southern

member states pressing for a very large increas ^-in)&gt;Hike resources

available to the Community.    The French,  the Germawsdnd the Dutch were,

like the United Kingdom, very sceptical of the cassb^OT^Voncerned about

the need for firm restraint in Community expendituxe^/TiuQ there was

increasing pressure for a move to a 1.6 per cent value/aj fSH tax ceiling

on 1 January 1988.    Decisions would not be taken for sow^^roe yet: the

Economic and Finance Council would be discussing the issue^/J&amp;Vits May

meeting and the Foreign Affairs Council would discuss them/&gt;ui-after at

its May and June meetings.    For the United Kingdom it was vxt2&amp; v\

throughout the next period of discussion to maximise the amou{ c&quot;vyv,.

common ground with France and the Federal Republic of Germany

Previous \&gt;,

Reference: ^

CC(87) 15.4

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY reported that against strong

Greek opposition the Turkish application for membership of the

Communities had been remitted, according to the normal practice, to the

Commission to produce an opinion.    It could well take two or three years

^for this to be forthcoming.

^^*Ud is cuss ion it was said that there were strong strategic reasons for

^^a^taining Turkey as an effective member of the Western Alliance. But

&amp;zwrt acknowledged that the cost to the United Kingdom, and indeed to

tl^^offlmunity as a whole, of Turkish membership of the Communities would

be^S^^rv substantial one; the Community was not ready to absorb another

memb^/^fc&apos;ate when it was still adapting to the recent membership of

SpainMmd Portugal; and the accession of Turkey would tilt the balance

of theXIommunity even further towards the interests of the southern

member states.    The application must be handled in the orthodox way, but

it would not besurprising if the conclusions were deferred to the Greek

Kalends. (/})

Opening the

Japanese

Market

Previous

Reference:

CC(87) 14.3

THE FOREIGN AND COMM^^&amp;ALTH SECRETARY reported that the Foreign Affairs

Council had discuss&lt;jpskh&gt;^next steps for maintaining pressure on Japan

for a more liberal appr^er^h. in key sectors of interest to the Community.

Commissioner de Clercq^h^&lt;f^Tjprcefully made the European case to the

Japanese Government on t^^Xe^ent visit to Tokyo, and the Commission had

now announced proposals fo^-yin^ surveillance of Japanese exports which

might be harmfully divertevvCjj^Qhe Community market following the

measures taken by the United^SyLp^s against Japan.    In the Council&apos;s

discussion only France and th^tfnrced Kingdom had been forthright in

their support for Commissioner d^C&amp;rcq.    During the discussions on

further measures against Japan whi^rwere scheduled for the next three

Foreign Affairs Councils, it shou^^^^the United Kingdon&apos;s objective to

ensure that all members states give^&gt;c#&amp;j^ full support to the

Commission&apos;s actions and presented a^tuted Community front to Japan.

Co-ordination

Against

Illegal

Immigration

THE HOME SECRETARY said that the co-ordinatlfoi meeting on 27-28 April

between Ministers of the twelve member stateV^Mc^rned with combatting

terrorism and illegal immigration had given unMujpoufi support for making

airlines and other carriers responsible for bogus^Wlum seekers whom

they convey and for applying penalties to them.   Th^^tion which member

states would now take was entirely in line with GoW^OTeAt policy as set

out in the Immigration (Carriers&apos; Liability) Bill. ^^^\

Agricultural

Price Fixing

THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD reported tK^^2e~

Agriculture Council had met for three days between 27 and 29  p^O\to

discuss the four most contentious items in the Commission&apos;s prop^a^,


namely those for changes in the cereals regime, in the regime for fruit

and vegetables and in the current agri-monetary arrangements, and the

proposals for the introduction of an oils and fats tax.    Little progress

had been made and the Council would meet again on 18 May for a session

^ which could last for the whole of the ensuing week.
