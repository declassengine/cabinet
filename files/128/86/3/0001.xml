THE^ e1m TARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that Third Reading in the House

of Lo/wTof the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc (Scotland) Bill would

take^jlSw on Monday 11 May.    He wished to congratulate the business

THE CHANCELLOR (t^T^E DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that recent press reports

had suggested tnayvCTrev Labour Party was proposing at the next General

Election to under $Wkje//j*\direct mailing campaign in marginal

constituencies.    It j pf&gt;eared that the Labour Party had formed the view

that candidates did npt rf&amp;$d to declare such expenditure as election

expenses even though Ctf^xe^resentation of the People Act seemed to

require this.    The issue wa^2important because, under the Representation

of the People Act, electfejitf^e&apos;Ahenses by each candidate were subject to

strict financial limits.   NQt^wo^dd be helpful if the matter could be

exposed publicly in advance o ^h\ next General Election.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up^^epft discussion,  said that the

Secretary of State for the Home c^aSbment and the Chancellor of the

Duchy of Lancaster should consult u ge*M:ly on this question, seeking an

opinion on the matter from the Law Of^cers.

2.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said tha&gt;^Rki jes ty &apos; s Chief

Inspector of Nuclear Installations (HMCINI) had SBud^AUevidence to the

House of Commons Select Committee on Energy the pr&amp;y^j)*/ day that the

Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (Nil) was so underarj^raed that it was

unable to carry out its functions properly.    These rem^k&quot;^M ad already

received some publicity and were likely to feature promineT&gt;Oy in the

Debate on Nuclear Power on Monday 11 May.    The suggestio^w srt\the Nil

was understaffed could be very damaging politically:    it o&lt;viL /S riously

weaken public confidence in the nuclear industry.    The main~^^(OOTi for

the shortfall in staff was the inadequacy of the pay comparea^wi/s

particular, with that offered by the Central Electricity Gener^kflA/y

Board (CEGB).    He had sought the agreement of the Chief Secretar/&apos;^yy

Treasury to increases in the pay of the Nil to bring their salarie^^^


into a reasonable relationship to those paid by the CEGB. The Chief

Secretary, while fully recognising the need to make up the shortfall in

^ staff, considered that the increase should be limited in view of the

^impact which a larger increase might have on other sectors of the public

 &gt;0!^rvice.    HMCINI did not believe that an increase of the size proposed

yj^)^e Treasury would be sufficient to enable him to recruit the staff

^rarcy ired.

THB^RmIE MINISTER,  summing up a short discussion, said that it was

vital^fcnat the shortfall in the Nil should be made good, and that

ever^^g necessary should be done to achieve this.    The Secretary of

State bo/r^jj&amp;ergy,  the Paymaster General and the Chief Secretary,

Treasurtf^snould consult urgently to that end,  taking account of the need

to ring-B nce any necessary awards from other sectors of the public

service.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FO^E^^^MENT, reporting on the latest phase of

the industrial action by meimfer^xftf the Society of Civil and Public

Servants and the Civil and PuQ^^yV^rvices Association, said that

100,000 people or more in Londo^gmaOthe South East would have their

benefit payments deferred until Tug^daV or Wednesday of the following

week.    Those with insufficient furras^t^y hand would be dependent on

emergency payments which some localv&amp;j^SSrity social services

departments were making.    The Unions^ractAp had been to bring out on

strike staff from unemployment benefiroi^Pfices and from linked

Department of Health and Social Securitj\offices and simultaneously to

close down the national unemployment benefit system computer at Reading.

The effect was to delay payments, thus hurting the most vulnerable

members of society. /^-^\

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES sai\blJr E^ he unions had

claimed that some 40,000 civil servants were in rfeceipt of family income

supplement.    This figure was grossly inflated. He ^j^Vd provide the

Prime Minister with the most reliable estimate whicxfyMj&amp;d be obtained

of the actual numbers concerned.

Rolls Royce

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that theW^e^vof

shares for Rolls Royce had closed at 10.00 am that day. Apprd^ifM^ly

750,000 applications for shares had been received by the previo^^^ht.

It was expected that the final total would be a little over 1 mWlL^J*^

&lt;0^&gt;


with the offer being comfortably oversubscribed.    The first day for

v   public trading would be Tuesday 19 May.    He was confident that the

flotation would be a success.

i Mr Ernest

Saunders

TflV^B^RETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that Mr Ernest

SaVnda* ,  former Chief Executive of Guinness pic, had been arrested the

pre&apos;fe^iwgib.ight, and was charged with offences of attempts to pervert the

coursey^fiystice.    It was expected that he would appear before

magistwa^B that day or the following day.    The Director of Public

Prosecutions (DPP) had not brought the police into the wider

investigation that was proceeding into Guinness affairs.    These matters

were entirely for the DPP, and Ministers should avoid commenting on them

in public. s v

3.    THE FOREIGN AND COMMa^A^TH SECRETARY said that discussions were

continuing within the Allr&amp;ae^^f the Soviet proposals on the reduction

of shorter-range intermedia^^pmie nuclear forces  (SRINF).    Most of the

smaller countries tended to r^js^Hy zero-zero reductions of short-range

forces by the United States ana /fti^Soviet Union, although the minimum

range had yet to be determined, ^eijfter France nor the Federal Republic

of Germany had yet reached a firm^/iew^but they appeared rather to be

moving towards acceptance of equal ^^Jrevels on each side. Early

agreement within the Alliance, while^^^irable, was unlikely:  it was

probable that, with differences on the^A^^ae within the governing

coalition,  the Federal Republic would DyMe its time.

South Africa

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said tll^l&amp;Sfesuits of the

white elections in South Africa on 6 May had bee/AliVcouraging. There

had been a significant shift to the two right-wing^jxrfoies, which had

captured one-third of the vote and were likely to (fydpLpfoe the

Progressive Federal Party, which had suffered severe^^s, as the main

Parliamentary opposition.    It was hard to see South A&amp;&apos;i^u^.Government

policies evolving in an acceptable direction.

In discussion, it was noted that the former South AfricanNjnfpjfekador in

London, Dr Denis Worrall, had failed to win a seat from the^wewiing

National Party by only 39 votes; this had been an exception ijW

general rightward trend. \^^$\

j 6-9 May 1987V&gt;

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the President of

Mozambique, Mr Joaquim Chissano, was visiting London from 6 to 9 May.

^President Chissano had established sensible priorities: he was pursuing

\eAnstructive economic policies, was seeking to reduce Soviet influence

y^Ljthin Mozambique and was pragmatic on the issue of sanctions against

&apos;pp*$&lt; Africa.    His Government&apos;s problems were compounded by the military

4&lt;tLvpties of the Renamo guerilla movement.    The Government had agreed

ta^Mr \$ issano1 s request for further aid.

Lebanon

THE FORE^&amp;N AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the resignation on

4 May of the Lebanese Prime Minister, Dr Rashid Karami, was unlikely to

loosen the political deadlock.    The Syrian military intervention, while

it had eased tyae^aiege of the Palestinian camps, had had little

political effewu.^Despite recent rumours, there was no further news of

the Archbishop oiVC*aa\;erbury&apos; s Special Representative, Mr Terry Waite,

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALT ^^^ETARY said that the prospects for an

international conference on^che^jAddle East had improved slightly. Some

agreement had been reached be&lt;*raera^(Cing Hussein of Jordan and the

Foreign Minister of Israel, Mr ^rtmairK. Peres, and the Americans were

active behind the scenes.    But th^^fspaeli Prime Minister, Mr Yitzhak

Shamir, was opposed to the idea, and^rae issue posed a threat to the

future of the coalition Government ^T^h^rael.    It was important that the

Belgian Presidency of the European Commonly should be dissuaded from

intervening.

Syria

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH&apos;SECRETARY said thfat &lt;&gt;here was pressure,

both within the European Community and from the^^rt^d States, to pursue

a more accommodating policy towards Syria. ThereUwj^r/^owever, no

evidence of a change in the Syrian attitude towaroTp^at/rorism; this

point had been firmly conveyed to the United Statesjg/^^nment.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEATLH SECRETARY said that there ha^15^a^i111 e

change in the hostilities between Iran and Iraq.    There hadN^e^enxso

further testing or use of SILKWORM missiles by Iran.    A Unite^M&amp;rwjns

inspection team was likely to confirm claims that chemical weapiou r Bd

been used by both belligerents.    Discussions designed to bring tha^a^


to an end were continuing within the United Nations Security Council.

The United Kingdom was prepared to support a mandatory Resolution and,

if so decided, an arms embargo against Iran.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Indian Minister of

State for External Affairs, Mr Natwar Singh, had visted London from

24 to 30 ApriLv^~He had useful discussions with the Home Secretary and

other Minister^v^ Agreement had been reached on the text of an

Extradition Treatfy^~although it was feared that the endorsement of the

Indian Governmenc^g^^r&apos;Nwhole would not be easy to secure.    India was

dismayed at the sirtyktLpn in Sri Lanka and at the rebuff by the Sri

Lankan Government of/Eraj^n offers to mediate.    She was also critical of

the failure by the Un  $A^tates to inhibit Pakistan&apos;s nuclear

BROADCASTING

OVERSIGHT OF

PROGRAMME

  STANDARDS

5.      The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretarial State for

the Home Department (C(87) 8) proposing that the Broadc&lt;&amp;^H^ Complaints

Commission (BCC) should be strengthened or replaced so a^Vtp^/ansure the

discharge of a wider range of responsibilities in relation~J* &lt;$*ogramme

standards on radio and television. \\/^)

THE HOME SECRETARY said that the remit of the BCC was confined VW^K

adjudication upon complaints, brought by the injured party, of ury* ^)r


unfair treatment or invasion of privacy.    There had long been

differences of view about the proper role of a body of this kind, which

had its origin in the report of the Annan Committee on the Future of

\ Broadcasting (Cmnd 6753), which had reported in 1977.    The Annan

^Committee conceived the Commission as a body that would consider

^/^Dmplaints of unjust or unfair treatment or of invasion of privacy, but

matters of taste, content or standards of programmes.    The then

^fat^ur Government had taken up the general idea of a complaints

c^jimiiA^ions, but had expanded it to embrace matters of programme

staajjards and the broadcasting authorities&apos; response to complaints about

the^rj^flflie present Government had taken the view in 1980 that only the

narroV^a^e was appropriate, and had legislated to establish the BCC

accoriM&gt;rgly.    The Government line since then had been that a wider remit

might confuse the responsibilities of the broadcasting authorities. It

was now   for question whether a more dynamic approach was needed in

response to widespread public concern about taste and decency generally,

including the^e^trayal of violence.    Giving the BCC, or a successor

body, formalfpoweyrs over the broadcasters would hopelessly compromise

the position c&gt;S^^e^\broadcasting authority as trustees for the public

interest, but h^J&gt;e&lt;ii ved that it would be possible to construct an

expanded indeperuhprc^yole that would avoid that pitfall while still

providing a machineV/^^r channelling the concern of the public and

offering much neede ^*Je^^\urance.    He therefore sought the agreement of

the Cabinet to his settm^further work in hand on the details of such a

scheme and to the incl^j &amp;j vin any early statement of the Government&apos;s

policies of a commitmen^^o/Taqye in the direction he had indicated. If

that were approved, he woni^ifoopose to speak informally to the

broadcasting authorities iVuy^dM to seek to allay any concerns they

might have. ^1 /SS

In discussion, some members of^hjBOS^binet expressed concern that a

commitment to new external machrwer^s^f the kind proposed might have an

adverse impact on the confidence 3( j ^a}operation of the broadcasting

authorities&apos;  top management, and drlShJ^retu their own sense of

responsibility for the maintenance ovoa^eptable standards of taste in

programme content.    It was particular^, important to maintain good

working relations with the new leadership of the British Broadcasting

Corporation.    The matter would need to be handled with considerable

finesse if damaging consequences were to be aue-ided.

Other members of the Cabinet believed that tK^d^-ri^ne in broadcasting

standards was so palpable and so much gratuitous^offlsnce was now given

to the ordinary public, that it would be unsustaiciKJ&gt;C  to stand back

from the issue any longer.    Concern rightly went y^^^jAmatters of taste

and decency; the public was much troubled by violen^a^wvere the record

of the broadcasters was very bad.    In the public minvf^^hVre was a

strong link between the portrayal of violence in the m&amp;djuj^nd the

increase in violent crime that the country was sufferin^x^wftile the

details needed to be resolved, it was likely that only a^2w &amp;Xely new

body could discharge the vigorous role that the situation ^TWin\5ed.

There was general agreement that the proposed initative shouVdy^g^-

become involved in questions of broacasters1 political impartivfityVand


that it was important that no such misleading impression should be

allowed to make any headway.

vTHE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet

Vjgreed that external involvement in the maintenance of acceptable

^^Vogramme standards on radio and television in matters of taste, decency

^raA the portrayal of violence, should be strengthened as the Home

/^&amp;cSe\tary had proposed.    While it seemed most unlikely that the present

Bj^Jkovasting Complaints Commission would be able to provide the basis

roV^rre effective machinery that was needed, that point would need to be

pur^^^^n the further work that the Home Secretary would put in hand.

It woV^oJ^ appropriate for any early statement of the Goverment&apos;s

policM^to make a commitment to the establishment of stronger and more

effecting arrangements in the areas in question.    Before such a

statement was made,  the Home Secretary should speak informally to the

Chairmen of the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Independent

Broadcasting ArfJPtority.
