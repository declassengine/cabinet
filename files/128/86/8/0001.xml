AFFAU&amp;^V.

1.      The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

of Commons in the following week and that,  subject to the progress of

business,  the House would rise for the Summer Adjournment on Friday 24

July until Wednesday 21 October.

Lloyd&apos; s

^HF^5kANCELL0R OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Finance (No. 2) Bill,

wh$en\irould be published the following day, would include provisions on

Lloyd^Tjuarkedly different from those which had been lost at the

Dissfil^Jmm.    As he had foreshadowed in his Budget Speech, these had

been ttyiject of full consultation with Lloyd&apos;s.    Although a

considerable measure of agreement had been reached with Lloyd&apos;s on the

terms orM:he revised clause, there were now some signs that they were

seeking to back away from this.    He was giving this his close personal

attention and wouild be seeing the Chairman of Lloyd&apos;s the following day.

HOME AFFAIRS

Today

Newspaper

2.      THE SECRETArV^WJATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that he had

given his consent the^j^&amp;ious day to the takeover by News International

pic of the Today newsg^pArv   He had been satisfied that Today was not

economic as a going conce^^and the Fair Trading Act 1973 provided in

respect of newspapers th^^t^im such circumstances, he was not obliged to

refer a proposed takeover\W^ h  Monopolies and Mergers Commission. As

things stood, considerationxwKl^e Monopolies and Mergers Commission of

the proposed takeover of a newsj* t)er would probably take around three

months;  in many cases this was/&apos;^s^ly to mean that a decision to refer

would have the effect of preven^^ffgpChe take-over from going ahead,

whatever its merits or demerits. X/He^would shortly circulate

to colleagues proposals for provid^a^rcy: an accelerated procedure.

Teachers&apos;

Pay and

Conditions

CC(87) 19.2

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE said that he would be

seeing the National Union of Teachers and the National Association of

Schoolmasters and the Union of Women Teachers/fert&amp;x that day. They

would use the occasion to press him to establish   ew machinery for

settling teachers&apos; pay and conditions in time ns^ftw next pay round.

He would make clear to them that there was no pros_pe/ s of this and that

instead the interim advisory committee would be res^rfwsible for advising

on the 1988 settlement.    He would circulate to colle s^\shortly a

draft Green Paper setting out proposals for a peman^jJ&amp;^mXfchinery for

determining teachers&apos; pay and conditions.

Reference:

CC(87) 21.2

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that there had been complaints from

some companies that Value Added Tax (VAT) repayments were continuing to

be delayed as a result of industrial action by Civil Service unions,

tat the same time the Inland Revenue were demanding the prompt

nt of PAYE contributions.    Following the suspension of industrial

n by the Society of Civil and Public Servants, computer operators

oeburyness, who were responsible for processing VAT, had now

hed to work.    Repayments of VAT had been made a top priority and he

-e^d the backlog to be cleared shortly.

THE&lt;w ittfi^MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that urgent

consraVryft&gt;-on should be given to the possible establishment of emergency

arrangeme^xs to help companies suffering from cash flow problems as a

result        industrial action by Civil Service unions.

Ins ider

Dealing

THE SECRETARY \9feS^SSE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that Mr Geoffrey

Collier,  the former jaint head of securities at Morgan Grenfell, had

pleaded guilty the gj^yious day to charges of insider dealing and had

been sentenced to tVeywe^months1  imprisonment suspended for two years

and a fine of  25,OOd^^^W* sentence had been criticised by some

Opposition members as ^fnaidgfauate, but the line the Government should

take was that sentencing/yjj^entirely for the courts,  subject to the

maximum penalties laid doCwi hW Parliament.    The Criminal Justice Bill

included proposals to incrVa^ yChe maximum penalty for insider trading

from two to seven years&apos;  im^jrt^pmnent.

Child Abuse

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL Sgg^XGfiS said that a team of four

members of his Social Services Insp c\5$yate had begun an investigation

the previous day following the recent^*  roversy concerning alleged

child abuse cases in Cleveland.    In adf^fcion, the Regional Health

Authority would be reporting to him early the following week. It

appeared that Cleveland Social Services Department had not been

following his Department&apos;s guidelines on child abuse cases.    He would

probably need to establish an inquiry into th^/mlmter, but he intended

to limit the scope of such an inquiry to the sWv^tand cases rather than

into child abuse generally.    There might be pres/surento bring forward

the Child Care and Family Services Bill which hevj^fppe^tly hoped to

introduce in the following Session. ^/k^

Sizewe 11

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that there would B&lt;^4r&amp;aring in

the High Court on Monday 6 July at which Friends of the Eairf$M^ ild seek

leave to proceed with their application for judicial review\ /$)^

decision to construct a pressurised water reactor at SizewellVy^^they

succeeded,  they would attempt to represent the decision as a vi^ovj\


even though the substance of the decision on Sizewell would not have

been addressed.    In that event, he would seek an expedited hearing with

a view to the matter being settled by the end of that month.

3.    &apos;CTT$^^PjREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the President of

the Repui^Wx of Korea, Mr Chun Doo Hwan, had announced his agreement to

the release of political prisoners and to direct elections to choose his

successor as President.    This change of position on the part of the

President was a surprising and encouraging development.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWE^^^fiECRETARY said that the draft resolution

sponsored in the United N&amp;&amp;o}ys Security Council by the five permanent

members, which called for^a*-^ew&gt;. to the Iran/Iraq war, was now being

shown more widely to other tjj^e^wnents.    It was not yet clear how far

the Soviet Union and China woukjWaintain their support for the draft

resolution.    The question what t^O^cercise could achieve remained open;

while a ceasefire was the main goaLAA her useful purposes might be

served. ^^^^^

4.      THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES A^-jF^e. said that agreement

had been reached on the price fixing in the Agrlfcitilt^iVre Council on

30 June-1 July.    The continued blocking of the p^ga^e^ tax on oils and

fats by the United Kingdom and some other member s^MBAn the European

Council had been helpful, since it had made apparent^jfoaJpN^his element

was no longer in the package.    The settlement produce^9^ailer savings

than we had hoped for.    The package was, however,  fimly^&gt;&lt; rl\ted in the

right direction.    It could give rise to savings of abourvM^OJaecu ( 90

million) in 1987 and about 600 mecu in 1988 ( 420 million&apos;ft^ffite

reductions in support were significant; support for cereals^*rt iM be

reduced by about 10 per cent and for oilseeds by about 14 pe&apos;oc^*/- and a

^imit had been put on the guarantee for soya.    For United Kinguop^^,.

farmers the result was satisfactory.    The change in the green pWn&lt;L&gt;\


which would benefit farmers, was greater than the green rate changes in

France and the Republic of Ireland.    For United Kingdom consumers the

^ effect on the Retail Price Index would be minimal.

U

European

Council,

29-30 June

mE^RIME MINISTER said that the European Council on 29-30 June had been

aif^rC^lt.    The United Kingdom was concerned that there should be strict

buoge^ry discipline over Community spending.    Nine member states,

howl^C^oVere net beneficiaries from the Community budget.    The Federal

RepubVyya&amp; Germany, which was the biggest contributor, supported

budgeta^P&apos;oiscipline in principle but did not practise it if it would

give ris^to difficulties for German farmers.    At the meeting of the

European Council on 29-30 June good guidelines had been produced on

budget discipline.    There had also, however, been a premature attempt to

get agreement 9* 3h text which would have instructed the Council to adopt

a new ceiling//expressed as a percentage of the Community&apos;s gross

national producs i/5 ^fhe Community&apos;s own resources.    There had also been

an attempt to ge{(agreement that every element of the current

agricultural over^waaing should be carried into a revised base for the

financial guideline^ttpr^ericulture.    The United Kingdom had not

therefore been able t&lt;^atfc pt the conclusions.    The decision of the

Chairman of the Council ,^toj&gt;sieur Martens, to curtain discussion on

important points had notc^^^vhelpful.    He had allowed, however, long

and repeated exchanges o^wipUon the proposed oils and fats tax and on

monetary compensatory amourrtr^^VThe United Kingdom and other opponents

of the proposed tax on oils\an&amp;Y ts had successfully resisted it. Some

member states had sought to pi^Wiflawn the likely effects of the proposed

tax on developing countries and/mp&apos;rbe consumer, although these effects

would be real.    She remained conceroeA that the member states blocking

the proposed tax should cont inue t&apos;o s^srnd together.    On monetary

compensatory amounts on agricultura^^jtiHucts, a very technical paper

incorporating elements agreed betwee^5*yance and the Federal Republic of

Germany had been presented at short nstme to the European Council.

Most member states had been ready to accept this,  including the

authorisation for some national aid in trie Federal Republic of Germany,

with little or no discussion.    It had been agreed, however,  that the

revised arrangements for future monetary compensatory amounts would be

reviewed   by 1 July 1988.    The European CouncWliMi also discussed and

given guidance on some questions relating to b^Jp 8J budget, although

the Chairman had indicated before the meeting th/at Wis would not be

raised.    On future financing, she remained conceNl2Sa^eft&gt;out the prospects

for the meeting of the European Council in Copenha^e&apos;a^iA December. On

the one hand,  the United Kingdom was committed to ccQj^^&amp;oring an

increase in the ceiling to 1.6 per cent value added t&gt;rx}^\&gt;n the other

hand, although all member states accepted strong guide li*$ 2&gt;Xn control

of agricultural and other spending,  it would be difficultf^fonother

member states to muster the resolve to achieve the necessi^^J^sures at


the European Council in December.    We could not simply increase the

Community&apos;s resources without agreement on an effective budgetary

\ discipline.

&gt;5\/v      In discussion the following points were made -

^//^O[.a.      A key issue was to ensure that the elements of budgetary

Ytfiscipline should be enforceable.    The existing arrangements on

^/&quot;^gwricultural spending contained the possibility of exceeding the

./guideline in exceptional circumstances.    It would be worth

CJ^jS^idering whether,  in exceptional cases where exceeding the

gV^e&gt;Pine proved unavoidable, the additional cost might fall on

na^rtonal budgets.

b. The agreement of the other member states at the European

Council to strong guidelines on budgetary discipline and on the

need for ^ffrr^Ynued reform of the operation of the common

agricultural policy was a step forward.    Preparation was in fact

going aheadyvfTradly on the lines we wanted.    The United Kingdom

would now b^vj^aVHng its own ideas on budgetary discipline and

agricultural s^aMLisers.

c. Discussions/^ ?^ be strongly influenced by elections

elsewhere in the ComsajJpJty.    The Federal German Government was

already much conceKW^sV the forthcoming election in Schleswig-

Holstein.    The PresIsaenjAal election in France the following spring

was beginning to cast jr^ftroow.    There would also be an election,

probably in November,  l^iij^rfbiark, which held the Presidency and

would at that time be pr^p^YJ^jg the European Council.

d. The United Kingdom had w^wa start in the process of

achieving reform of the operatjrtjjr of the common agricultural

policy.    The decisions on milk^ifljS^&gt;eef in December 1986 showed

that it could be done.    There wavv^jpenuine possibility of getting

the surpluses under control, whicvl^ust be steadily pursued.

Air Transport

Liberal-

isation :

Application

to Gibraltar

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said thaw&apos;th^ Community had almost

succeeded in achieving the package of measureS^i^i&amp;e liberalisation of

air traffic and fares, to which the United Kingi^mJitached much

importance.    Eleven member states had accepted tmr^aakage at the

Transport Council on 30 June.    Spain had refused vzipg^use it applied

to Gibraltar.    Without going back on the application^^bXe package to

Gibraltar,  the United Kingdom had put forward various iS^fA which might

have made it possible for Spain to accept.    These had a$ p&amp;hn refused.

For the present,  therefore, the air transport reforms we*re_^syalled. It

was not yet clear whether the Commission would put forwarch-^flepOBackage

again under the provisions of the Single European Act, whic^fcuii^ into


force on 1 July, or would seek to bring some airline practices before

the European Court of Justice.
