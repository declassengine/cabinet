?^^JCJIANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that,  subject to the agreement of

4&lt;He J3abine t, he proposed that the pay for all Ministers and for office

ha^derecovered by the Ministerial and Other Salaries Act 1974 should be

incr^reeA by  4,048, the same increase in cash terms as was being

proptfS^J^ior MPs.    This would produce a higher proportional increase for

ParliaMp^srYy Under Secretaries than for other Ministers, as the Cabinet

had suggested at its meeting the previous week.    The question of

severance pay for House of Commons Ministers and the pension

arrangements for the Prime Minister, the Lord Chancellor and the

Speaker, but notMinisterial remuneration more generally, should be

referred to thirty* Salaries Review Body.    While MPs&apos;  pay would in

future rise aiVi^najLically in line with the top of the main scale for

Senior PrincipaTiy^riythe Civil Service, a fresh order would be required

each year for Min^s^ ?^al salaries.    The presumption should be that the

pay of Ministers wo&lt; HVb  increased by the same proportion as for MPs in

order to maintain d i / fjp^^ht i a 1 s in real terms.    But no commitment should

be given publicly abo^AKJrvs, and the position would need to be reviewed

each year. Xyy&apos;K

THE PRIME MINISTER, summiV^-^^a brief discussion, said that the Cabinet

agreed the Chancellor of the^Exc^equer&apos;s proposals.

CC(87) 21.2

2.      THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Home and Social

Affairs Committee (H) had that week agreed to a package of proposals

formulated by the Home Secretary in response V^the increasingly serious

problem posed by the growing prison population^    fjt the end of the

previous week the prison population had stood ary^fN\29,  including 648

prisoners in police cells, while the uncrowded cwjoW of the prison

system was 41,688.    The increase in the population_^dmch was

concentrated among untried prisoners and those sente/rwjJ&apos;sto longer

terms, was projected to continue through the present^g^^x^and it seemed

clear that it would substantially overrun the previouslyvpj&amp;gected

growth in the following year at least.    Although 3,000 wjw^pyaces were

due to become available in the twelve months from SeptembAi&gt;dAj87, there

were very few further new places scheduled until 1991.    Thes^jCOae,

therefore, a severe immediate problem of overcrowding in the\pVj^sfc&gt;ns and

of prisoners in police cells, and there was every reason to st^yap^ that

the existing prison building programme could not be relied on tAj^restore

a manageable situation.    H had fully agreed with the Home Secreta^p^^


view that decisive action was required immediately to head off what

would otherwise be an intolerable situation for the Government over the

a coming years, and that this action should be directed both to the

f*vViumbers of prisoners and to the amount of prison accommodation. The

&apos;^/(tecessary action on the number of prisoners should, H agreed, take the

/tlloxpsL of an increase in the rate of remission for good behaviour and

/pmcMetry from one third to one half for prisoners serving 12 months and

L^^sSy These sentences were too short to enable prisoners to qualify for

ear^release under the parole scheme, and the Home Secretary proposed

to^rrfl^^ice the increased remission rate as an interim step pending the

outccffl^o^ the review of the workings of the parole system which had

been vfamised in the Conservative Party Manifesto.    The terms of

reference and establishment of that review would be announced as part of

the present package.    Provided that the increase in the remission rate

was balanced by very clear action to increase accommodation, H agreed

with the Home^JSSretary1 s view that the need for the measure would be

generally appere^jb and that this particular machinery for reducing the

population sn^Nitf^st give rise to undue problems with Parliamentary or

judicial opiniotK^/tfhe matching action on accommodation would comprise

short-term and rowf^blrm elements.    For the short term, relief for the

use of police celrtsy^Kjftld be provided by the use of Rollestone Military

Camp until the end xip/at&amp;Dber, by when substantial benefit would be felt

from the increased rwiWin rate.    For the longer term, the Chief

Secretary, Treasury ha^/J$g$vVed that the Home Secretary might announce a

substantial acceleraticw^an/y expansion of the prison building programme,

the details to be resolve^^ vthe forthcoming public expenditure round.

The Home Secretary would aJ&amp;^cik announcing administrative action to

sharpen the management of ree^afVison building programme and improve its

performance.    H believed that/t&amp;mn in the round, these proposals were

a balanced and necessary packagt^^X

THE HOME SECRETARY said that he eful to the Chief Secretary.

Treasury, and also to the SecretaryS^State for Defence, for his

agreement in making Rollestone Camp &amp;}&gt; *lable.    He could undertake that

the camp would be vacated by 31 Octoo^r.    The proposed increase in the

remission rate for short sentences was certainly the most acceptable

machinery that lay to hand for securing the necessary immediate

reduction in numbers:    the prisoners concerned-*ere, by definition, the

least serious offenders and since the most tfaacNyas involved for any

individual was two months&apos; earlier release,Vq^ beiieved that general

understanding for the measure could be securedt/^ J)

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a brief discussio&lt;/ |ftA that the Cabinet

endorsed the Home and Social Affairs Committee&apos;s aqyp^&amp;sl of the Home

Secretary&apos;s proposals to stabilise what would othervfa^^pe an impossible

situation.    The Home Secretary should announce the meaijv$&amp;i that

The Cabinet - ^^^)

1.      Invited the Home Secretary to make an announcemen&gt;^Yp^^.

approved by the Home and Social Affairs Committee and rep J^eq&gt; o

them by the Lord President of the Council. ^C^*^


Canary WJ*a \

approved by the Home and Social Affairs Committee and reported to

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the Canary Wharf

development had now been agreed between the London Docklands Development

&quot;^Corporation and Olympia and York, a Canadian property company which had

T^iken over the main interest in the scheme from the original consortium

^.m^rbers.    Without the late intervention of Olympia and York,  it was

&apos;yjU^kely that agreement would have been reached.    There might be

^lt&gt;c\ism from British developers that the late involvement of Olympia

an^/?opk was on a basis that had not given them the opportunity to make

alte-t^ra iye bids.    This was not a valid criticism since Olympia and York

wereO^ffS^only developers prepared to adopt the scheme being negotiated

by theVJoMgXnal consortium.    It was expected that the agreement would be

announc^fthe following day.    It represented a major step in drawing new

capital investment into the docklands, and he would arrange for it to

receive full publicity on that basis.

Caledonian

THE SECRETARY OF STATE^F^^ANSPORT said that British Airways  (BA) had

announced that morning C+fap&apos;lys had launched a take-over bid for British

Caledonian (BCal)    on the\ka^X \of an offer price of more than

 200 million.    BA had alrealJ^Ce^ured the agreement of more than 40 per

cent of BCal shareholders anA. t^e^Chairman of BCal had made clear that

he welcomed the proposed take-^rarc^  It would be for the Secretary of

State for Trade and Industry to^pecSle whether to refer it to the

Monopolies and Mergers Commission^^rtcV^ie had received the advice of the

Director General of Fair Trading whic^Er was expected to be forthcoming in

the first half of August.    MeanwhiT^f^r^ Government should not make any

substantive comment on the proposed tafcfe%dyer.    The parties had said

that they would not proceed if there wrfVa referral to the Monopolies

and Mergers Commission.    If the deal we^ ahead,  it might be necessary

to review the Government&apos;s airline competition policy.

In discussion the following main points were mdjREV-

a. This was the second case in a few wewks^-rnNwhich the

promoters had threatened to call off a me rgUriyr* take-over) if it

was referred to the Comission.    On the other^iwod/, a full referral

to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission woula Jrf  ssix months to

complete, and it seemed unlikely that BCal&apos;s fvr&amp;pk^ty position

would permit so long a delay.    The Secretary of Stat^for Trade and

Industry was considering urgently the possibility ^^^rthroducing

new arrangements providing for examinations to be cqmp_Letad within

a much shorter timescale. Ss^Cxi

b. If the proposed take-over went ahead, it would redaS^y/yy

I    competition especially for domestic and holiday charter flA^kcSy

BCal was perceived by the public as a successful example or t4(ev

1


to attract criticism.    The alternative, however, might be a

take-over by a foreign undertaking.    It would be important to

stress that a take-over by BA was greatly to be preferred to a

take-over by a foreign airline.

PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Government

l^Ld not comment publicly on the proposed take-over of BCal by BA

l^vthe Secretary of State for Trade and Industry was considering

rfrtgf to refer it to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

^Ih^Cabinet -

3\&gt;^Took note that the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry

wouXd consider, in the light of advice from the Director General of

Fair Trading, whether to refer the proposed take-over of British

Caledonian by British Airways to the Monopolies and Mergers

Commissions^.

Unemployment had fallen by about 300,000 since /mneS\l986, which was the

^HJ/^RETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that the marching

se^sop^in Northern Ireland was proceeding in a much less tense

atiR&amp;# bgty than for some years.    The major marches on 13 July had passed

withoO&amp;ysigtfiificant incidents.    Exploratory &quot;talks about talks&quot; between

the les4e^s of the Unionist Parties and the Northern Ireland Office had

The Government was giving them its full support.    The PriJw Hlinister

planned to speak strongly in this sense during her fortn^prnin)? visit to

4.    THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER saio^that at the Economic and

Finance Council on 13 July the Paymaster General had secured agreement

to a derogation from the Sixth Value Added Tax (VAT) Directive so that

the United Kingdom could allow small businessa^w^th turnover of less

than  250,000 to relate settlement of VAT to ^ctuiuL receipt of payment.

This was an important measure for small busineVsy^bmth in relation to

their cash flow and to any bad debts.    It was belttLgx-oA^roduced as part

of the United Kingdom budget measures.    There had TS^^/cnns iderible

difficulties with the French over the proposal which/w^prequi red

intervention at a high level to resolve.    The derogarV^O^s on an

interim basis but he was confident that it could be sustjfojAd.

In discussion it was agreed that any approximation of ffera^vlegislation

within the Community should not result in more bur dens ome\Niir^*aj&gt;gements

for business.    The impetus which the Government had given towrctts more

deregulation in the United Kingdom was playing an important &gt;AoY^Sn

promoting economic growth. ^//yy

Reference:

CC(87) 23.4 \&gt;

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Commission had now agreed

and announced its proposals on the approximation of VAT and excise

.duties within the Community.    The Paymaster General had issued a

^&quot;Satatement on 15 July making clear that the proposals required unanimity,

was important that these proposals should not be seen as only a

^jfratter for disagreement between the Commission and the United Kingdom.

/TKeOommission&apos; s package posed greater difficulties for many other

mem^if^states - it could,  for example, reduce the revenue of the Danish

Govecrtjjient up to 5 per cent of their gross domestic product - and would

runMjfctj^opposition and objections on many grounds.

In dist^^^on the following points were made -

a. There were cases where a very high level of tax on a

particular product or products (eg on whisky in Italy) had formed a

barrier to-^C^ade, but it did not follow from this that full

harmonis/fioojwas necessary.

b. The Prime ll/inister had made clear the United Kingdom&apos;s

position on &gt;A^3 ro rates during the Election campaign. These

pledges stoodyy^r^Government would not wish, however,  to go

beyond the wordV g^?ttich the Prime Minister had used, for example

on books and othe^ yu)rtication.

c. It was importal^^O^distinguish between the Commission&apos;s new

proposals and the caVe-^M^c^ady before the European Court of Justice

about the permissibili^T^rmer the present law of zero rating new

construction for VAT.    iK^United Kingdom disputed the Commission&apos;s

view on the present law.    /jrogment on this case might be given

towards the end of 1987.

THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE,  FISHERIES^^ND FOOD said that,  following the

European Council,  the Agriculture Council on 13 July had reached

agreement on the means of bridging the gap between the Community budget

provision and the expected level of agricultural^expenditure in the

Community in 1987.    This would be done by mov/ ri&apos;g\5rom advances to

reimbursement of agricultural support expenditure* Wie adjustment would

be a continuing one.    The form in which the chai/kenad been agreed

ensured that there would be no extra cost fallirrg^j^^fihe 1988 budget.

In discussion it was pointed out that, despite the^Je&amp;i^ion taken by

their Heads of Government in the European Council,  rne ^&amp; herlands and

Greece had opposed the proposal in the Agriculture Ccwth^v.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the membel^g#^

^^jfe^OREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the discussion at the

wa^itfrely to come forward shortly with further proposals on budget

diso^^ae and management and with its paper on agricultural

stabCJ^wrs.    There was a good chance that these would include elements

which *X ^?hited Kingdom had put forward at and immediately following

countries on 13 July.    m^&amp;scussion of South Africa, there had been

indications that the Daw&amp;rvvesidency would seek to put that subject on

the agenda of European Poiifc^*! Co-operation in the coming months. The

only proposal which Coimmin2pQ^oreign Ministers had approved in this

connection had been that tmnre^sHftDuld be a review of the implementation

of the measures against Soutn^fcjjj^a presently applied by the EC

countries.    The record of the I/tf^t&apos;evvKingdom in implementing the

relevant measures was good.    The^P^deJral Republic of Germany continued

Republic of Germany had given an interesting account of the recent visit

to the Soviet Union of the Federal Pn^&amp;oent, Freiherr Richard Von

the Federal Republic of Germany had been going through a notably cool

period.    The Foreign Affairs Council had decided, with regard to

relations with Syria, that the ban on high ley ^contacts with that

country introduced in November 1986 should e o b^ that the other

measures then imposed against Syria because o^ 2yC  Nsupport of terrorism

should not at present be withdrawn.
