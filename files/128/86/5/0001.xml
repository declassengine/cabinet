1.      THE PRIME MINISTER said that a slight difficulty had arisen in the

House of Commons because there would be no Prorogation before the

Dissolution of Parliament on 18 May.    On previous occasions when

Parliament had been prorogued before being dissolved,  the Prorogation

^ceremony had provided an occasion after which those members of the House

Commons who were not standing for re-election could formally take

SfehHe. of the Speaker.    The Speaker himself, encouraged by some such

&apos;WmfPfers, had publicly expressed his regret at the decision to dispense

vatJj^jNrorogation on this occasion, and had been ostentatiously looking

foO^oUrar opportunities of saying farewell to Members who were not

sta^frug-for re-election.    The decision to dispense with prorogation was

in f&amp; ^^&lt;ractical and sensible, and followed the three most recent

preced^W^(1983,  1979 and Autumn 1974)

THE HOMERSECRETARY said that the Criminal Justice Bill would be one of

the main measures lost by the Dissolution.    The only major part of the

Bill that it woujd be realistic to take to Royal Assent in the present

Parliament weo^Th\ provisions establishing a Serious Fraud Office, and

that had been wicce*s fully negotiated.    The Immigration (Carriers&apos;

Liability) Bill jjufS^Jp^en enacted without any concessions.

THE CHIEF SECRETARY^^ftE^SURY, said that the negotiations with the

Opposition on the Fip| ^\Bill had been very satisfactory.    The main

provisions that had b^tiAovppped had been those on personal pensions and

profit-related pay, and s^yjf those relating to Capital Gains Tax.

The Government had given^xc&apos;aramitment to reintroduce all these measures

in the next Finance Bil1 ^ra-^Aevnew Parliament, and had made it clear

that discussions would cont^-v^^bout the appropriate form of the

provisions on Lloyd&apos;s, whicnvhaji&apos;^lso been dropped from the Finance

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE EN $(CWMENT said that the Opposition had

agreed to facilitate the passage of/^ o financial components of the

Local Government Bill.    These were^^^Aegulation of the creative

accounting devices known as advance apd^kpEerred purchasing, and the

confirmation of education pooling arrangements.    The parts of the Bill

that had been lost related to improvements in the operation of the Land

Register and the regulation of ostensible schemes of local authority

assistance to private sector housing projects.    It was important to

maintain control on the latter point, which represented a significant

creative accounting loophole, but there shoultfbevno problem about that

since he had made it clear that his proposed oofy^trft would operate

retrospectively to the date of their announcemeiU^_yrb   Orders

designating the four new Urban Development CorporSt^tr areas at

Teesside, Tyne and Wear, the Black Country, and Mancfie^ax, Trafford had

not been opposed, and he had great hopes for the suc^/^ this

important part of the Government&apos;s urban policies. ^^^\

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Channel ^npfe^Bill

seemed bound to cause some timetable problems in the new PopK^lCTent.

Although there was no difficulty about the procedural arraireme t/SS to


carry the Bill over between Parliaments, he could not at present see

that it would be possible for the Bill to be completed in the House of

^ Lords until about 23 July.

&quot;?^HE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet

Vw^ld wish to congratulate the business managers in both Houses for

K^flluring the passage of so much of the Government&apos;s legislation, both in

Ifw^piXesent Session and throughout the Parliament.    This had been an

out^a^dingly successful achievement and she would circulate to Cabinet

membej^^a list of the major Bills that had been enacted in the

Parl^uagfiJ now ending.    The Government would make clear their firm

intentV^i  f enacting as soon as possible those provisions that it had

now be n^ecessary to drop.    The line to be taken on the provisions

relatingoto Lloyd&apos;s was that the Government would consider with

interested parties the revised form in which those provisions should be

brought back, and the Chief Secretary, Treasury should urgently prepare

an appropriate/^,otsii of words and associated guidance.

The CabineitvjK^,

1. Took noc^^&amp;Oth approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s

summing up of v^Wscussion and invited the

Chief Secretaryj^^^a\ury to be guided accordingly.

2. Congratulated JStfA^us iness managers in both Houses

upon the successful &lt;Mnd)Ljing of the Government&apos;s legislation

throughout the ParliaSnSa^^

J HOME AFFAIRS

1 and A340

Projects

2.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRAg^Nft INDUSTRY said that the

Government had been in prolonged neg^e^CSfion with British Aerospace over

their request for  750 million launchgrt^/for the Airbus A330 and

A340 projects.    After discussion with Prime Minister and other

Ministers closely concerned, he now proposed that launch aid of

 450 million should be offered,  subject to the Government securing a

real rate of return through levies on sales of the aircraft.    Subject to

the agreement of the Cabinet, he proposed to ayifomoce these decisions in

the House of Commons that afternoon.    A joint \kress- conference with

British Aerospace would be held immediately aften^fiTsj statement.

Assuming that the German and French partners in \^^Xx%bus consortium

also confirmed their intention to give support,  th^fX/na4 decision to go

ahead with the projects, would be announced during t/e^akis Air Show

starting on 11 June. &gt;\

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a short discussion, said^KatSfthe Cabinet

agreed with the recommendations of the Secretary of Statex&amp;e^j^hcade and

Industry.    His statement would require careful drafting, es^asXa^ly on

the matter of a real rate of return, and he should agree thevfc piw of

words to be used on that point with the Chief Secretary, Trea&amp;r^^^^


The Cabinet -

1.     Agreed that  450 million launch aid should be

offered to British Aerospace for the Airbus A330 and

A340 projects, subject to the conditions that the

Secretary of State for Trade and Industry had indicated.

^v2.    Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and

^Jmdustry to announce the decision in a statement in the

LKjuse of Commons that afternoon, the text of which

(VtjJteryLd be agreed in advance with the Chief Secretary,

THE SECRETARY MISSTATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE said that the series of

half-day str il/a^jyiled by the National Union of Teachers and the

National AssoaiatiiV of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers in ten

areas in recent weektei had attracted no more than local press interest

and had been a fa^rup^)from tne unions&apos; point of view.    It now seemed

probable that the (^^m Lons were about to call off the protest against

the removal of their/^k^tiating rights.    His assessment was th&lt;it the

action would cease at^^tou^the end of the following week, and that the

teachers were unlikely tjy^Jereume it after the General Election. This

was very good news for ra^Goyernment, though he thought it would be a

mistake to be seen to be x ^ra^&gt;. pleasure in the teachers&apos; discomfiture.

He believed, rather, that t^yob^t line would be to recognise that most

teachers had never wished to^la*tuge their pupils&apos;  interests.    He would

circulate advice to his collewg&apos;v^a^accordingly.

Unemployment

Reference:

CC(87) 11.2

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT^^^ that he would later that day

announce the unemployment figures for^firil.    The unadjusted figure had

fallen by 36,000 since March and 218,00v since April 1986. The

seasonally adjusted figure had fallen by 20,000 since March and

177,000 since April 1986 and had now fallen in each of the previous

10 months.    The number of vacancies had r isen/^yvS, 000 in April.

Unemployment had fallen in April in every regAon vn Great Britain except

Scotland, where the figures had been inflated nyfeobtb 4,000-5,000 in

consequence to industrial action by civil servanAs^^ficotland. There

had been a determined effort by the Opposition parjfe^raX  discredit the

unemployment figures.    In fact, the unemployment fiatn e^V)verstated the

number of people out of work, especially in the Sourl  vMf^ would arrange

for a response to a misleading article about the unemplowtrait figures

which had appeared in that day&apos;s edition of The Daily Tvj^gfyph.


Housf^^

Benefit

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that,  following the

decision taken in the Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic

^ Strategy, Sub-Committee on Local Government Finance the previous day, he

/?bad agreed with the Chief Secretary, Treasury the form of words that

,-Os^iould be used in announcing the publication of the draft Housing

^Mje&apos;ftefit Regulations that would take effect in April 1988.    The draft

^Rj^u^ations would be published the following day.

Prisons

Reference:

THE HOKy^B RETARY said that the Prison Officers&apos; Association would

announcV^ttiat day the result of their ballot on the Government&apos;s Fresh

Start pr^fcosals.    It would show a large majority in favour of the

Government&apos;s proposals.    This transformed the industrial relations

situation in the prison service, and was a good foundation on which to

build for the ftfp^ve.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FQ^Np^THERN IRELAND said that eight members of

the Provisional Irish RepubKea^Army (PIRA) who had blown up a police

station at Loughall on 8 Max\1i^jp4een killed in an exchange of fire with

the security forces.    This waw^Waior blow to PIRA following a period

when they had succeeded in carr^wg^jsut a number of attacks.

Regrettably, one civilian had be^eriiJoJJLed and another seriously injured

in the exchange of fire.    That ap^tV^he operation had been wholly

successful.    The Royal Ulster ConsGt^^a-iw had established that the

weapons recovered from the terror is5s\J&gt; a been used in each of the

murders and attempted murders which h&amp;jt/tpzen carried out by terrorists

in Fermanagh and South Tyrone in the pMwious year, as well as in

incidents elsewhere in the Province.    Irwas clear that the terrorists

who had been killed were dangerous and experienced members of the Active

Service Units of PIRA.    Responsible members of the nationalist

community,  including Mr Seamus Mallon MP, had/Vcc V&gt;ted that their attack

on the police station had been a blatantly ofS^*^Jk vact. The

Government of the Irish Republic had also reacte/VveVy responsibly. The

Foreign Minister, Mr Brian Lenihan, had made an a^mju^ble speech

attacking the PIRA&apos;s tactics as futile and immoral^yGT^ejat credit was

due to the security forces on the successful outcome/p* /Oye operation.

It would be vital to remain vigilant to guard against^rts^s^ble PIRA

reprisals. /S^K

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet would wish to coKg*^J*N.ate the

Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on a very success furJ^sVv

counter-terrorist operation and on his management of affairswn^Jne

Province during the recent very difficult period.


The Cabinet -

4.      Endorsed the Prime Minister&apos;s remarks and extended

their congratulations to the Secretary of State for

Northern Ireland.

Fiji

3.    &quot;mz FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there had been a

milx^af^^oup the previous day in Fiji led by Lt Col Sitiveni Rabuka,

third\i/p mmand of the Armed Forces.    About twenty members of the Armed

Forces stormed the Parliament and had seized the Prime Minister and

members^^f his Cabinet.    The Armed Forces were composed mainly of

Fijians whereas the ruling party, which had come to office following the

election the previous month, was made up mostly of Indians, although it

was led by a Firji^n.    Lt Col Rabuka had claimed that he had succeeded in

overthrowing the &lt;y&gt;vernment.    The Governor General had issued a

statement empha^i/ * &amp;. that the take-over was unlawful and that he would

continue to uphotfat/We. Constitution.    There were no reports of injury to

any of the 400 Brir^Ktf/citizens in Fiji.

Council of

and

Development

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEX^HL^ECRETARY said that the Ministerial Council

of the Organisation for EcOrj^fWX Co-operation and Development (OECD) had

met on 12 and 13 May.    OECDvwav a\useful organisation, especially under

its present leadership.    The^a^e^ajig had been used successfully to

strengthen the commitment of memrj^fvcovernments to reform of

agricultural support policies. ^Th-e^&lt;^had been less dissent on this

subject than had been expected; aVfa J^e language on agriculture in the

meeting&apos;s communique&quot; would provide&lt;/^g ^yl basis for further progress

at the Seven Power Economic Summit rn&gt; yfoLlowing month.    The Ministerial

Council had also provided an opportun\o^&lt;for him to advocate the

proposals on the alleviation of the dea^&gt; problems of the poorest

countries in Sub-Saharan Africa which the Chancellor of the Exchequer

had recently put forward.    There had been helpful pressure at the

Ministerial Council for a positive approach to^-frl*g Uruguay round of

trade negotiations under the General AgreemenjfcrDnHTariffs and Trade.

Discussion of the macro-economic policies of MS/fljaSor economic powers

had been inconclusive.    In the margins of the malting he had had a

bilateral discussion with the Foreign Minister d^^iwah, Mr Tadeshi

Kuranari, when he had pressed the United Kingdom&apos;svgy^p^al case for fair

trading practices on the part of Japan as well as tt^e^B^vtish position

on the specific matters at issue in this field betwee*f\JieJ^:wo

countries.    The pressure on Japan must be maintained. C^^^S

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that differences persisted

in the coalition government of the Federal Republic of Germany about the

means of covering shorter range intermediate nuclear forces in an arms

control agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States on

&apos; ^intermediate nuclear forces.    The Federal German Foreign Minister,

^Hwr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who belonged to the Free Democratic Party,

 ^hfeu-just been advocating one position during a visit to Washington while

yc*f^^oreign and Defence Spokesman of the Christian Democratic Union in

Vne^e^destag, Herr Volker Ruehe, had been urging a different one during

a VisjiVto London.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government would soon need to make its

own&lt;g^*j S.on clear on this difficult issue of policy.    It was not

certar y:h&gt;kt the allies would reach a united position in time for the

Ministsra^rl meeting of the North Atlantic Council on 11 and 12 June.

&apos; EDUCATION

1 POLICY

4.    The Cabinet coi4sKpb &amp; a memorandum by the Secretary of State for

Edcuation and Scienc4^6&gt;^7) 9) seeking authority to prepare legislation

on three proposals fofv&apos;iSpcKksion in the Education Bill to be introduced

in the autumn.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR^E^yC^XION AND SCIENCE said that the Manifesto

would include proposals to Jnifax^^.schools to opt out of management by

local education authorities (&amp;JS4 ay and become direct grant schools

funded by central Government. ^^^woposed that schools should be able

to apply to opt out on the initWti^iNpf their governing bodies, with

the agreement of a majority of pa^nts^   Opted out schools would receive

grants from the Department of Educa *^ju- nd Science under a contract

with each school.    They would be sufre-tfgZcially self-managed and employ

their own staff.    They would be encouMM^to apply for charitable

status.    Further work was needed on the\vesource implications, but the

principles were that opted out schools sSiould not be penalised in terms

of resources compared with other similar schools remaining under LEA

control in the area; and that the funding arrangements should ensure

financial neutrality between central and locaVyfaxbayers.

Secondly, he proposed that there should be finan^falYYlelegation to

Further Education (FE) colleges, broadly along th^HU^s already

announced for schools.    The arguments were much th^Syamg^ in the two

cases, in particular the need to give the bodies con/6^^greater

freedom of management, and to make them more res pons l^ef^o^the needs of

industry.    This would be no more than a logical extensiop^^\the policy

to which the Government was already committed.    He also T&amp;lerpaaed to use

the opportunity to bring the law on FE colleges up to dats^o^X

Thirdly, he proposed legislation to restrain the activities i^f&gt;^gus

degree operators. Such legislation would be generally welcomevf^fa^.

dealing with an obvious abuse.


In discussion, the following main points were made -

a.      The proposals for opting out would be widely welcomed for

allowing schools to escape from doctrinaire local government

 *\       control.    But much of the detail remained to be worked out. This

^s\     applied in particular to the opting out procedure and to the

y/j/y/\ precise financial arrangements described in principle in C(87) 9.

The Government also needed to decide how opting out would

^ &gt;^ ect the arrangements for helping pupils with the cost of

^i^a^sport to schools.    This question could become important since

^Vyptyy1 schools were likely to attract pupils from a wider area

rtvdilrbe f ore, and these pupils would therefore incur higher

transport costs.    It would not be right for the taxpayer to meet

all transport costs, although the arrangements for existing pupils

would need to be protected.    This needed further thought and work.

c. Therp wmild be questions in the Election campaign about the

GovernmenOs^w^jSention on such matters on the possibility of opting

back in; thfefeyQect on teachers&apos; pension funds; and the position of

the smaller &gt;*^mary schools, especially those in rural areas.

These would be^afc^^with in briefing notes which the Secretary of

State for Educax^fff^and Science would provide.    Generally, however,

the line to take^uvL^e that the detail had still to be decided

and would be contairaJ ^W the Education Bill to be put before

Parliament. \vL/y&gt;\

d. Similarly,  the de^ai^jW the proposal on FE colleges had not

been discussed with othe^^fe/partments and still had to be worked

out.    One important point Jt ^f&lt;\ c ons idered further was the

composition of the governing b^^es.    The present proposals

apparently allowed for only mminirj^rity of outsiders. The

Government should also cons id&lt;&lt; ^  c&quot;ther the position on tenure, and

whether more could be done to rQ&amp;rata&amp;z the responsiveness of the FE

colleges to commercial needs.    Ms^t^fmportantly, the resource

implications of the proposals wer&amp;Anot clear.

e. While it was true that the provision of bogus degrees was an

obvious abuse,  the arrangements proposed fce vres training it would

on the face of it have significant resouriCe ^Vnplications. There

could also be implications for the work K^tiTg^cour ts, and the

powerful interest involved in the Universitroworald would require

careful handling. ^^ ^&gt;f/

f. On a separate point, a paper circulated id^X^^^rance by the

Ministerial Steering Committee on Home and SociavO^r^jrs

(H(87) 20) proposed an extension of the powers of #j ^&amp;condary

Examinations Council (SEC), especially in relation &lt;^0mVm General

Certificate of Secondary Education Examining Groups,vC^^^ould

prove very controversial. vOv^X


THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet

endorsed in principle the proposals by the Secretary of State for

Education and Science on opting out, and the necessary drafting could

^ now proceed.    But important questions of implementation remained to be

/^settled and would need to be discussed after the Election in the normal

^Oway.    Meanwhile, nothing should be said to prejudge them.    The Cabinet

^s^rfV a case for the proposals on FE colleges but again several important

^&lt;Wjfcw;ions remained to be settled and further discussion would be

nff^efaary before decisions could be taken.    The proposals on bogus

dea^ev had not at that stage been accepted, and a further paper should

be bright forward in due course.    Finally, the proposals in H(87) 20 as

to Sfe^fp&amp;ieTS of the SEC raised difficulties and could not be cleared

withouvyoL^cussion.

The^abinet -

1. Agreed that drafting should proceed on the proposals

by the Seo^e^ary of State for Education and Science on

opting our  subject to the points made in discussion, and

to furthels^&amp;^Siission of detailed questions of implementation

after the Election.

2. Agreed tlraS^^decision could be taken at this time

on the Secretary^^Vtate1 s proposals for financial

delegation to CoYleg^ea^of Further Education, or on his proposals

for legislation to&lt;m?Kwith the abuse of bogus degrees, or on his

proposals to the MiA^WJial Steering Committee on Home Affairs for

extending the powers o^^l^^Secondary Examinations Council.

ENVOI

5.      THE PRIME MINISTER said that, was likely to be the last

meeting of the Cabinet during the prgwprtparliament, she would like to

express her gratitude to her colleagus^^Jr the marvellous record of

hard work and results achieved by members of the Government during the

Parliament.    It was her hope that they would be returned to office as a

result of the General Election, so that they could carry forward their

work together and build further on what had alr&gt;e dy been achieved.

THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he believed tha\^e&gt; f&lt;auld be speaking for
