HOME

AFFAIRS

&gt;&gt;&gt; ...

Sj2l.      THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was important that Ministers

/s^juld take the opportunity in discussion of Home Affairs at meetings of

C^he&gt;(S^abinet not only to report on current problems but also to draw

q^erre^on to any matters which were likely to cause difficulty in the

pe^^fa^ahead.

Prisons

CC(87) 19.2

V

THE HOME SECRETARY said that the prison population was continuing to

rise.    It had reached 50,000, with some 500 prisoners being accommodated

in police ceVta-^he previous week.    A major component was the remand

population wh^ch\now accounted for 20 per cent of the overall prison

population.    Re/^raliyarecently been in touch with the Chief Secretary,

Treasury about &gt;rae^p/p sible need to use camps and about the provision of

bail hostels.    He^3 aly also set in hand experiments on time limits for

remands in custody wi&amp;y^a view to reducing the remand population. He

would continue to ke^p\^^ colleagues in touch with developments.

Industrial

Action in the

Civil Service

Previous

Reference:

CC(87) 20.3

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHTOireR^aid that the industrial action by Civil

Service unions appeared to b^^Xjwring its final phase. Militant

members of the National Execut^A e f the Civil and Public Services

Association (CPSA) had decided tb^/pjsevious day, against the advice of

their General Secretary,  to calf^a&gt;^ilot on an indefinite all-out

strike.    It seemed very doubtful wj&amp;tjjS)? CPSA members would support a

full strike, particularly given theyact^J:hat the Society of Civil and

Public Servants (SCPS) had in the liw* /of the CPSA&apos;s decision called

off their industrial action.    They wou\d have their own opportunity of

talking to the Treasury about a grading review and about long-term pay

arrangements - matters which had always been open to them to raise with

the Treasury.    The Treasury had announced that *he Government&apos;s pay

offer would be implemented forthwith, back-dmfecnjto 1 April.    They had

also announced that they would set in train       yflgufchan i sm for enabling

them to end, should they wish to do so, the ch^ak-cJflf system, under

which union subscriptions were deducted from sata^ely and were forwarded

to the unions. ^///?

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a brief discussion, sVi%n at the Cabinet

welcomed the possibility that the threat of further ind^^ial action in

pursuit of the Civil Service pay dispute might now be reeding. It

nonetheless remained very important that Ministers shours^aJ^Nas good

employers within their Departments.    Moreover, even if th^f^jjjKite came

to an end, there would still be problems outstanding about \5ex ys of pay

in the Civil Service. C^^s\


Nurses

&lt;

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that there had been a

number of reports in the press recently about the difficulties of

y\recruiting nurses in the London area.    The London allowance for nurses

V^as significantly below that for civil servants.    It was clear, however,

/fttat pay was not the only consideration;  the problem of finding

//ap&lt; hmmodation in London was an important factor and he was considering

KjXs ^Nnatter of urgency what could be done to alleviate this.

Abolition

of Domestic

Rates

THE SECRETARY/Sr^jTATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that he should warn his

colleagues thsw: tfj&amp;y faced some exceptionally difficult decisions on the

way in which dorn^frTrc) rates were replaced by the community charge in

London.    The pro\k-effW*tes partly caused by the overspending of the Inner

London Education k\^y^Jr^ .y (ILEA) which spent markedly in excess of the

national average of /o^j^tion authorities.    In addition, however, a

number of London boro^gwe^were heavy over-spenders on their own account.

The combination of their^jrjkspending and of the ILEA component would

lead to unacceptably higf^^mmunity charges unless some new approach

could be developed.    They$ ^$As&amp;n would be further compounded by the fact

that many London boroughs wrsMAT\^n 1989 begin to meet heavy costs in

servicing the debts that the^Knawincurred through creative accounting

schemes.    These were all deepCffwpd^fems that were inherent in the London

situation:    they could not be r^o&apos;N^d by mere transitional devices.

In discussion the following main pa^Kwere made -

a. Although the London pr obi em &gt;wep &gt; wider than education, many of

the major problems centred on ILEa^ The Government&apos;s proposals to

enable schools to opt out of the control of local education

authorities were a reform that would hardly have begun to work

through the system at the time the community charge was

introduced. //V\

b. Schools that wished to opt out of ILKy^Shytol would

undoubtedly want to carry the ILEA level of\&gt; ij*Kn^g with them.

Arrangements were needed that would give Lonaajp^yocoughs and

schools the incentive to deliver better quality/e^cVtion at lower

cost than at present.    Both objectives were undo^fi^a^y attainable.

c. One of the most important factors inf luencing NJ&amp;Kcpmmunity

charge in many high spending London boroughs was the\ u Xjrts of the

non-domestic rate.    A borough such as Camden would be y^v^Tx^rd hit

when the national non-domestic rate was introduced and i&amp;sjj^ybuted

as currently proposed. ^&lt;^^^\


d. The high community charges that were predicted for certain

London boroughs emphasised the importance of securing effective

powers to cap community charges, so as to prevent irresponsible

\        authorities from imposing excessive burdens on their charge-payers.

&gt;/\

^mfe PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that it had long

yqg^^recognised that London presented particular problems for the

^^mm^ndty charge, and that much of the difficulty was due to ILEA.

DdtfzasLoJis were now needed on these issues, so that work could proceed on

the^^tfp^^ion of Domestic Rates Bill and the Education Bill. The

SecrVtsSj^fes of State for the Environment and for Education and Science

should^Ae^rbr ing forward papers urgently,  for co-ordinated discussion in

the appropriate Cabinet Committees.

The Cabinet -

2.      Invi/c&gt;earahe Secretaries of State for the Environment and for

Education\agd^g^ience to bring forward papers for urgent discussion

as the Prima;/Minister had indicated in her summing up.

Manpower

Services

Commission

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FO^^KLOYMENT said that he would be meeting

members of the Employmentc^ollfcy and Organisation Committee of the

Trades Union Congress  (TUC^t^^sN: that day.    The TUC were likely to

react strongly against the p^m^s^l to increase employer representation

on the Manpower Services CommX^won (MSC).    It was probable that they

would withdraw from the MSC,  iMwM July then almost certainly during

the TUC conference in the autuimfr would need careful handling and

it would be important to make clea^ch^ the TUC had become increasingly

unco-operative over MSC schemes. ^C?^^

In discussion the following main point4o*^e made -

a. The TUC had recently been taking a more politicised attitude

towards the MSC.    This reflected its increasing domination by

public sector unions. ^ ^

b. There were still very few Youth TraiK^g^S^heme (YTS) trainees

in the Government service.    The Department onjEmployment had,

however, taken on some YTS trainees over recairj^j&amp;^ths with a view

to this policy being extended to other Governmjtffy^e^artments in

due course. i/ysxK

AFFAIrS^^Y

Iran/Iraq ^

Previous

Reference:

CC(87) 20.4

3.     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that more military

activity was taking place in the northern sector of the war on land

^between Iran and Iraq, but this development did not seem to be of great

Significance.    Iraq had resumed air attacks on naval targets, after a

/Muse since the United States ship Stark had been hit by an Iraqi

ynrLrtile on 17 May.    At the United Nations, the five permanent members of

^he^Security Council were now consulting other members of the Council

aMxltVtheir draft resolution calling for an end to the Iran/Iraq war;

thaj^resolution might call for an embargo on arms supplies to both

ber^bS^i&apos;/snts.    Iran had suggested a moratorium on attacks on shipping in

the Guyf^teut this seemed to be a diversionary move and should not be

taken rafiously.

Meanwhile, there had been no further trouble in the run-down of the

diplomatic representation of the United Kingdom and Iran in each other&apos;s

countries.    Ip4S^toas withdrawing all staff from its Embassy in London

except the Ch^gevd&apos;Af faires.

Arab/Israel

Dispute

THE FOREIGN AND COMMe^B^JH SECRETARY said that the Foreign Minister of

Israel, Mr Shimon Peres/^h^fci had meetings on the previous day with the

Prime Minister and himse^W^\$e would be seeing the Crown Prince of

Jordan, Prince Hassan,  lrcer/Abat day, and King Hussein would be in

London in July.    The centrarJ^&lt; iAficulty in securing progesss towards

negotiations about the Aral^fs^a^l dispute was the difference between

Mr Peres and the Israeli Prlfi^Wimister, Mr Yitzhak Shamir, on the

question of an international coo^fence.    The Government were trying to

help Mr Peres as much as possibre^TO\his campaign for such a conference,

and would continue to encourage wle IKplted States to play a more active

role.    The time available for secufi^g-^iyogress was limited, with the

elections due in Israel as well as nw^Bnited States in 1988.

COMMUNITY

AFFAIRS

Preparation

for the

European

Council,

29-30 June

4.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saicfCrttofe^t the Foreign

Affairs Council on 22 June the atmosphere of crisi^Crtn^h the President

of the Commission had appeared to be seeking to creaxe^wui much less in

evidence.    There was general acceptance that the Eurdpea^^ouncil on

29-30 June should not try to settle the details of the L9j ^&quot;budget

problem or of the agricultural price fixing:    these shou2^bejfor the

specialist Councils.    It was now more widely recognised tSsg ^Jte major

part of the 1987 budget problem could be solved by a switch^lrono

advances to reimbursement of agricultural guarantee expenditure^/It was

likely, however,  that two major items which had become


deadlocked in the Agriculture Council, namely the proposed tax on oils

and fats and the Commission&apos;s proposals for changes in the agri-monetary

system, would be raised at the European Council,  though they would

probably need to go back to the Agriculture Council for settlement.

^\There was general agreement that the European Council would not take

^Mecisions on future financing for 1988 and beyond, but would give

/^guidance for the continuing negotiations on Community financing, with a

/WJew. to decisions towards the end of the Danish Presidency.    The British

v*G(3y/erqment should continue to make it clear that it would be ready to

a^nsi5^r additional resources for the Community only when clear

imjraf^ejaents in financial management and control, particularly in the

conS*^rVof agricultural spending, were assured.

In discission it was pointed out that,  in spite of the arrangements for

the abatement of the United Kingdom&apos;s contribution agreed at the

Fontainebleau European Council in 1984, the United Kingdom remained the

second largestcontributor to the Community&apos;s funds.    Moreover, the

financial con/LVoTy\measures introduced at that time had proved to be

defective.    FH&gt;tun&amp;-~systems for financial management and control must be

enforceable.    Tna^C^mmunity1s present budgetary problems provided an

ideal opportunit&gt;j --*jp^pN:ess British objectives on financial management.

Agriculture spending^&apos;m/ftarticular must be brought under control, with

much less reliance p^^edvon intervention.    It was wrong that support

levels within the Commun^^-^should be geared to the needs of small

farmers, when the argunfem^mor maintaining those farmers on the land

were primarily social orN^w^/jranmental arguments.    There was a valid

case for supporting certaip/^gi^b^ps of small farmers in all Community

countries,  including the Un^ep/lyingdom; but different measures of

support, particularly direct ^fZoja^ aids with the possibility of

national financing, should be ep*rs i\^ered.    It was important that any

such aids should not lead to an i^fh^se in production.    As a means of

controlling the Community&apos;s agricuLfcjJi&apos;al expenditure, the Commission was

committed to making proposals for i^dS*yisers, which would allow

adjustments to be made in agriculturaT/s^Aport regimes as market

conditions changed so that budgetary ^mvisions could be respected.

British ideas in this area were being o^veloped and would be put forward

for discussion in the Community.

While at the Agriculture Council on 15-16 June^Hhere had been a

qualified majority for the Commission&apos;s latesY package of prices and

market measures, which would themselves produaSyrf^eSul savings, at the

European Council it would be important to sustal^oBposition to the

proposed oils and fats tax and to seek to weakeiK-Hj^averall German veto

of the price package.    It was important to change Vh^^^rrent agri-

monetary system, which the Germans were seeking to SXfrgrffcK but which

had the effect of forcing support levels upwards. ^

The overall budgetary context was relevant to expendituf&gt;efojy/research

and development funded by the Community. ^&quot;&apos;C^v^


Counci^^X

22 June^_

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that at the Foreign Affairs

Council agreement had also been reached on a regulation on anti-dumping

duties on components which would discourage Japanese and other exporters

thad been able to find a way round Community anti-dumping duties by

mibling within the Community imported parts with minimum local

:ent.    In addition,  the Commissioner responsible for external trade

;ers had formulated in the Council a robust approach by the Community

Prds proposals for protectionist trade legislation in the United

.jJeA.    The Council had also agreed to proposals governing the types of

(Mmj/Jee which it would set up to monitor and regulate the powers of

thaC^owtfission in the execution of agreed Community policy.
