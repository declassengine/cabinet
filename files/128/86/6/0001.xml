1.    THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet would wish to welcome as

new members of the Cabinet the Lord Chancellor,  the Lord Privy Seal, the

Secretary of State for Energy and the Chief Secretary, Treasury. The

Cabinet would also wish to welcome the new Parliamentary Secretary,

/&quot;treasury, who would (like his predecessors) regularly attend the

^m^etings of the Cabinet.

fft^tfovernment: was commited to a full programme of legislation, which

WouJ^^sequire much hard work both in its preparation and in its passage

thvmigtt^Parl iament.    It would be very important that instructions for

Bil x  !^5j$ where at all possible draft Bills themselves, should be ready

for Wt&amp;n/st&amp;rial consideration before the Summer Recess.

THE LORdXpRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that all members of the Cabinet

would wisn to express their congratulations to the Prime Minister on the

Government&apos;s success in the recent General Election, the third such

victory in a rwrv They were grateful to her for the leadership she had

given through /DneQovernment&apos;s second term and during the Election

campaign, and \^gk tK^orward in the same spirit to the third term.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that a n&lt;jTFfl^nce Bill, to enact those parts

of the previous Finance Bill which ira^Jjaen lost at the Dissolution,

would need to be reintroduced and en ^M before the Summer Adjournment.

It would be introduced as soon as the  jm^ sary Parliamentary procedures

could be concluded.    The Local Government Bill would also be brought

forward in the Commons as soon as possibVe.

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that theGriminal Justice Bill

3.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the unemployment

figures for May would be published later that day.    The seasonally

adjusted total had fallefk by 64,000 since April to 2.954 million. This

|was the largest fall in a single month since records had been kept. The

^kadjusted total, which had fallen by 121,000 since April and by 259,000

ypee June 1986, was also below 3 million.    Unemployment now stood at

sy(f4 lowest level since January 1984.  It was continuing to fall in all

mf&amp;o&amp;s in Great Britain, with the greatest reductions in Wales, the

wessJXjK^dlands and the North.    In Scotland,  there had been a reduction of

17 tf0Q^&amp;nce April 1987, although this was attributable in part to

inac^t s^es in the preceding month&apos;s figures.

THE PRNffi^MTNISTER,  summing up a brief discussion, said that it was

clear thVt these very welcome and encouraging figures reflected an

increase xn employment caused by the growth in the economy.

THE CHANCELLOR OF/^f&apos;HEjJVxCHEQUER said that the Society of Civil qnd

Public Servants amt^H^Civi1 and Public Services Association were

continuing to deman^ams^bstantial pay increase.    The two unions were

considering the possi4^  Wof of further industrial action, but it seemed

doubtful whether theiivms^jiMjrs would support a full strike.    He was

writing to his colleagues^fcjwft day about the next steps in the handling

of the dispute. x\ j)

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR $6c^^ SERVICES said that 58 per cent of the

96,000 officials in his Depar^merjw had taken industrial action at some

point in the current dispute. ^T^^^made it difficult for local offices

to provide emergency payments tQu^he^Xnemployed and those on

supplementary benefits.    There wa^a  ^k that action could extend to

computers which paid retirement pen^^ns^and child benefit, which had

not previously been affected.    The cSeJngjJrer projects for converting the

supplementary benefit and family incoitfj^2&lt; pplement caseload in 1988,

when the social security reforms were to come into effect, had

already been badly affected.    It might D  necessary to bring in

additional consultants to get the family credit system ready in time,

although this could provoke an escalation in the dispute.

FOREIGN

I AFFAIRS

1 British/

Iranian

Relations&apos;

4.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that t^k&amp;b&amp;is in

Britain&apos;s relations with Iran had been triggered by the rAL^AMely

trivial matter of the arrest of an Iranian consular officiaP^^\

Manchester for shoplifting.    This had caused the Iranian auBApr^rtes to

seize a British diplomat in Tehran by force in the presence o^ajf&amp;&gt;y

family, to hold him for a day and to maltreat him.    The Governraep^^y


actions towards Iran since that time had sought to minimise the risk of

further maltreatment of members of the British Mission in Tehran. The

Government&apos;s first act had been to close the Iranian Consulate-General

in Manchester and expel its staff of five.    Iran had responded by

\expelling five British diplomats from Tehran, including the one who had

pearlier been seized.    The Government had then asked Iran to reduce by

^//wo the staff of its Mission in London, so as to establish parity

/ j v*een the staff levels of each country&apos;s Mission in the other&apos;s

^c^nXal.    The Iranian response to this had been to escalate the affair

&lt;Jye*J)elling four more British officials from Tehran.    By this stage,

al^^/^be-vkey political and commercial staff of the British Mission in

Tetft-roynad left, and only the Head of Mission and some visa personnel

remaij* d^  The Government had made clear to Iran that this situation was

intolerable.    Without breaking diplomatic relations with Iran, the

Government had moved to reduce representation in both capitals to one

caretaker official.    Iran had that morning announced that it was

adopting this nosition.    If in the future Iran became willing to treat

diplomatic r^Yatypns seriously, the Government would be prepared to

discuss the pJoay^Uin, ^ut tne nus^  ^ diplomatic relations without the

substance was notanceptable.

In a brief discus^-tS&amp;^Wihe hope was expressed that the Government&apos;s firm

reaction to the irreducible behaviour of Iran might influence that

country&apos;s attitude HJ^njIare.

Iran/Iraq War

and the

Threat to

Shipping in

the Persian

Gulf

CC(87) 17.3

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEAL^^EfiRETARY said that the threat to shipping

in the Gulf caused by the wa&amp;p&amp;J&amp;eeri Iran and Iraq had been discussed

at the Seven Power Economic Si^pafit^SLn Venice from 8 to 10 June. The

United States Administration, sprfrf^. by pressures in the Congress, had

tried to promote combined naval and^ther joint action to counter the

threat.   The Venice Summit had upr^S^raie principle of freedom of

navigation and had reaffirmed the paVJni/^pants&apos; determination to bring

the conflict between Iran and Iraq tV^m end.    The United Kingdom had

made clear at the Summit that the Arabia patrol of the Royal Navy,

which had escorted a hundred British vessels in the area in the past

year, was a proportionately higher contribution to countering the threat

to shipping than other Western countries wera^SSking.    Kuwait remained

keen to flag out its tankers to the United Slaters&apos; and to lease Soviet

ships.   The United States Administration hope^fyplP^o-operate in this,

but faced domestic opposition.    There was no eT^deJoe at present that

Iran would use its Silkworm missiles against shrptKJMr, but there could

be no certainty in matters concerning a country aVyqp^edie table as

Iran.    He would remain in contact with the SecretarV^5JTwate for

Defence about the Armilla patrol and the risks that it^a&lt;Jed.

The Government had been helping to promote in the Unitew^N^yipns

Security Council a draft resolution calling for an end tV-^few&gt;nf 1 ict

between Iran and Iraq.    This resolution might also provide\Xfwr/an arms

embargo against both participants in the conflict, but it wNra^ycertain

whether the Soviet Union and in particular China would suppor^^h^^


element. The Government were pressing for the resolution as hard as was

reasonable in the circumstances.

\

United Arab

Emirates

^HUSFOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Ruler of Sharjah,

ww^mwas part of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), had been deposed and

VepJ^a^id by his brother, Abdul Aziz.    Reactions in the UAE seemed so far

tcW)e&gt;&lt;^nfused:    the Sheikhs of Dubai appeared not to approve of the

chaire^-^ghile Sheikh Zayid al-Nahayn, the President of the UAE, seemed

to fertwy i-t-    Abdul Aziz had been educated at the Royal Military

Academ^^/^&amp;ndhurst, and was pro-British.    He might be the right man to

steer SnArjah out of its considerable financial difficulties.

  Arms Control

|CC(87) 19.3

THE FOREIGN AN^ Q^S&amp;NWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Government had had

to work hard for/Vhejsuccessful results of the meeting of Foreign

Ministers of the Ntd^xC^-tlantic Treaty Organisation on 11 and 12 June in

Reykjavik.    The mee^rtf^J^ad agreed a clear Alliance position on the

global elimination of^/j^&amp;^cmediate nuclear missiles of longer and

shorter ranges.    In ad^iS^m*   the Alliance had adopted clear priorities

for further achievements/vj^cms contr l:    50 per cent cuts in the

strategic nuclear arsenajffi^oyjthe United States and the Soviet Union;

the global elimination of^3 em al weapons; and agreement to redress the

imbalance in conventional w^^onj^in Europe.    The meeting had agreed

that,  in conjunction with theoa-^yevement of these agreements, the

Alliance could contemplate redncy^roAs to parity in United States and

Soviet nuclear missiles with raiVges^*Alow 500 kilometres, a subject on

which the Federal Republic of Gen^anV^^ight favour relatively early

negotiations.    The meeting in Reykj^Hj^kad also resolved a

long-standing difference between the^SjZted States and France concerning

the fora for negotiations about conventional forces in Europe.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE saidVhat the success of the Reykavik

meeting and the maintenance of cohesion in the Alliance on these

difficult matters had been achieved largely thanka to the efforts of the

Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.    He wishedytToyjdd two notes of

caution.    The positions agreed were not an uniA^cecjyilessing for the

United Kingdom&apos;s security.    They left a potentiaY/gky\ in the range of

weapons needed by the Alliance to maintain the aB^O^Sto respond

flexibly to any level of attack from the Warsaw ?aa^iy/Second, the

proposed measures would leave a huge disparity in favoj^^f the Soviet

Union in nuclear missiles of ranges below 500 ki lome ttje \ VJThe Alliance

might need to look further at the difficult question of ip^J&amp;vtablishing

its full ability to maintain flexible response by using weafSons not

covered by the proposed agreements between the United Stac^eo^jU the

Soviet Union on intermediate nuclear forces. ^*\\v

In discussion, it was noted that the communique&apos; of the Reykjawky^e^ting

foresaw that any future negotiations about missiles with ranges(Jmoocter


than 500 kilometres should lead to parity in this area; that various

types of nuclear weapons were not covered by the agreements now in view;

and that the Soviet Union had superiority in all the areas where

v  agreements were to be sought, which it would lose if negotiations were

Vwsuccessful.

Italy

CC(87) 16.3

REIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, in the general

el^g(rf^ in Italy on 14 and 15 June, the gap between the Christian

Demo&amp;yltM Party and the Communist Party, which in 1983 had been 3 per

cent &quot;vmo increased to 8 per cent, largely because of losses by the

communists.    The Socialist Party had moved up from 11.4 per cent to

14.3 per cent, a change which in the circumstances of Italian politics

was regarded as a success.    The election result would not determine the

composition oi^new Government; on that there would be difficult and

probably lonc( negotiations between political parties.

Fiji

Previous:

Reference:

CC(87) 19.3

THE FOREIGN AND COM^r^^LTH SECRETARY said that the constitutional

crisis in Fiji was cuntu.n^ng.    The former Prime Minister, Dr Timoci

Bavadra, had visited La6&amp;fi\in the previous week, without advance

warning.    He had sought^fo Jk)ae The Queen; on the advice of the

Governor General of Fijr^*y *K.Sir Penaia Ganilau, The Queen had not

met Dr Bavadra, but he hadu^^erpjreceived by her Private Secretary. He

had not asked to see Miniscwx^/ He did not appear to have advanced his

cause through his visit.    In^FA ^\ he Governor General had been seeking

with some courage to unravel wfeo ^6is caused by the recent military

coup.    He was trying to establis^ra^&amp;pnstitutional Council, including a

place for Dr Bavadra, which would^^g&gt;4^er constitutional change: change

would be enacted only if agreed by^^yc^Tijian Parliament.    Even after

the crisis was over, Fiji was likely^^Se a less stable country than

before.    British Ministers had no rof^Cin advising The Queen on this

matter. ^

Sri Lanka

THE FOREIGN AND COMMON WE ATLH SECRETARY said ^t^a^T^ attempts by the Sri

Lankan Government to re-establish its position V^a-^p^eN Tamil areas in the

north of the country had had some success on the ^p&amp;lnA.    India had made

air drops of supplies to the Tamil areas without tMr^jCTeeraent of the

Sri Lankan Government, and the earlier dialogue betw^OTvS^i Lanka and

India about the problem had been broken off.   The Sri Lyajw *0 authorities

were now, however, distributing the supplies from IndiajV^myV the Foreign

Ministers of the two countries would shortly be meeting^s^^h^t

dialogue between them might possibly be re-established. ^^^^




THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there had been protests

in the Republic of Korea against the decision of the President, Mr Chun

Doo Hwan, to suspend discussions on constitutional reform and about the

i death by torture of a student in January, which had caused the then

^rime Minister and three other Ministers to be dismissed.    The President

^v d nominated a successor for himself, who was likely to take over in

/^atfruary 1988.    The President was trying to keep control of the

^fp^t^tion, particularly in view of the Olympic Games to be held in Seoul

vn L^SS.    The Republic of Korea was not a democracy, but, despite the

drwla       some of the reports in the British media about events there,

was ^^-a^out to fall apart or experience a mass uprising.

Seven Power

Summit in

Venice

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that reactions in the

British media to_the Seven Power Economic Summit in Venice from 8 to 10

June had not beVnjrery favourable.    In fact, the Summit had reached

sensible conclqjs-iojte-,^ The pressure for reform of agricultural support

policies had beerVpaintained; the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s

initiative concertorrfa^rtie debts of the poorest Sub-Saharan African

countries had been ^kuafp^d; and the right sentiments about

protectionism had be nv  yN:essed.    The pressure on Japan for more

reasonable economic arffl&apos;*^ ailing policies had not been as strong as might

have been hoped; nor had J^J^eummit produced any new commitments for the

Governments of Japan, the^VfiiYtd States and the Federal Republic of

Germany on proposals to re\t2 &gt;^ iscal and trade imbalances.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQD^^id that he had been pleased that his

initiative about debt had beex^erA^sed in the Economic Declaration

issued by the Summit.    As regard^inaieRo-economic policy, steps had been

taken before the Summit to lower ^r^fecations about major new

agreements, so that the markets had^efx^eacted negatively to the

results.    The agreements on stabilis^tftjw of currencies which had been

reached in Paris in February 1987 and ^ky^ded in Washington in April

had been further extended by the VeniceMSummit;  these arrangements had

been working despite scepticism about thwn in some quarters.

In discussion,  it was noted that Japan&apos;s trade surplus had diminished

only slightly and that the Prime Minister, Mr ^rS^hiro Nakasone, would

leave office in October.    These factors suggesU^d Njjoat it would be very

difficult to make early progress on economic ma^QyT^Syith Japan. There

had however been some advances regarding the Unio^cL^AAgdom&apos;s specific

current interests.    Mr Nakasone had confirmed in th^^riUr^ins of the

Summit that there would be two competitive bids for fferJ^elJimmunications

operation in Japan, which was what the major British ^Jmaa&apos;ijiy with an

interst, Cable and Wireless pic, desired.    Japan was welX^jpaxe of the

British interest in participation in the Tokyo Stock Exdfem^ey\ British

firms had won three security licences and ten out of thirXj&amp;sW^v

applications for investment licences had been successful. &lt;^s\v

COMMUNITY

AFFAIRS

Agriculture

^ ?&lt;\ THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that the

Agjp^julture Council had ended that morning without reaching agreement on

Mfne^Jgricultural price proposals.    There were two main reasons for this.

Fw&gt;fe^the blocking minority - the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic

of TJeonajy and the Netherlands - had held together against the proposed

tax m/jiK\s and fats.    The Commission had also put forward an

alternative interim proposal for a tax for two years.    This was not

acceptable but the Presidency had invited the member states to consider

it further.    Secondly, the Federal Republic of Germany had indicated

that it woulcL-rw^t accept the proposals both on monetary compensatory

amounts and/am duts in support for cereals, oilseed rape and some other

products.    r&lt;^ya ^axpected that the proposed tax on oils and fats and

the future arrangements for monetary compensatory amounts would now be

submitted to tnetd&amp;H^&amp;pean Council on 29-30 June.   The Agriculture

Council would reej*ryn^e&gt; the package after that meeting.    He had

indicated that, sul &gt;^ ^oto the removal of the oils and fats tax, the

United Kingdom woula^sS^pjJort the package.    The savings were less than in

the Commission&apos;s origI*rJ&amp;Xbroposal, but there were nonetheless budget

savings and reductions ^1 support.    The joint meeting of the Economic

and Finance Council and^vdJ^^Vriculture Council on 15 June had been

helpful in maintaining th^fe\evements of the package.    The results would

be reasonable for the Unit^d^iBgdom: the proposal for adjustment of the

green pound was marginally friaj^e^than the changes proposed in the green

rates for France and the Repuv^ic^^E Ireland and he had indicated that

he could accept it.    The Irish ^erVwiowever, still questioning the

proposal on the green punt and, i^^exe were to be a change for the

Republic of Ireland, the United Ktngg&amp;n would need to stay ahead of

them.

In discussion it was agreed that the objections to the proposed oils and

fats tax were very soundly based.    It would add to food costs, with the

greatest effect on the poorest consumers.    It would affect trade,

including trade from developing countries, aM^ggravate the risks to

the open trading system.   To attempt to sol tn oroblem of rising

expenditure by introducing a new tax in this vJay&quot;&quot;wwe a completely wrong

approach.    It would be desirable to determine  teji^p^\the European

Council whether in the United Kingdom&apos;s view unao^y/y*. was required for

a decision on this proposed tax. ^/^S

Finance

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Economic aruK^v^nce

Council had agreed on 15 June on the reference framework 5^rJ^W38.    In a

brief discussion on the European Monetary System (EMS) the Jp&amp;pfohad

indicated that they would not be prepared to accept further /\


liberalisation of capital movements unless there were also some

technical improvements in the EMS.

Future

Financing

JK[E FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Foreign Affairs

&quot;^ypirifcll on 25-26 May had had a preliminary discussion on the future

v ^ajyoing of the Community.    The question would be dealt with again in

th^Fo&amp;sign Affairs Council on 22 June and in the &quot;conclave&quot; meeting of

Fore^fTjlinisters on 27-28 June immediately before the European Council.

The tSB^Jyoudget problem should, as far as possible, be kept separate

from tH^^nger term issues and should be settled without recourse to an

intergovernmental agreement.    In discussion it was said that the

essentiaVissue in considering the level of the Community&apos;s future

resources was the achievement of stringent financial controls.

Council (C(87) 10) to wh^^^w^e attached a draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech

on the Opening of Par 1 iame^fr^^^v

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE CO^CT^yfeaid that the draft Speech had been

prepared in the usual way by Tj*e^dja&amp;en&apos; s Speeches and Future Legislation

Committee (QL) on the basis of &lt;^c*lx ilDutions by colleagues.    It took as

its starting point the legislativa^pro^ramme that had been provisionally

approved by the Cabinet at their mee^ng on 26 March (CC(87) 12.5).

This represented a most ambitious pi^g^ftnne of legislation and he wished

to emphasise to his colleagues the imjib/^a^ce of striking the right

balance between, on the one hand, the vfe^a to proceed with politically

vital measures as soon as practicable an$, on the other hand, the danger

of attempting too much in one Session.    An overburdened legislative

programme would not only be difficult to manage in Parliamentary terms,

but would also risk producing legislation thaty^e^ylted in further

embarrassment by being insufficiently well pra&apos;flarevA and proving

vulnerable to judicial review.    The Government Tra^ireten given much

trouble of that kind by the Local Government PlasmLpB^and Land Act 1980.

The moral that QL drew from this was that it woula&quot;jS^/referable for The

Queen&apos;s Speech to be drafted in a way that avoided maWSjg\unnecessarily

detailed commitments to legislation.    That cautionaryvj/sjl^^pplied

particularly strongly to the proposed Housing Bill.    It w^Pfclear that

the entire compilation of housing measures proposed by TO^^^Xretary of

State for Environment was too great to be enacted in one Sfe^^Vc* and the

Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy, Sub-Committee on^tf^Al

Government Finance, had agreed at their meeting on 7 May (ECvF^&amp;^) 9.1)

that the phasing of this legislation would need to be consider^tjjh^h

particular care.    The Education Bill,  too, would undoubtedly be/a^Vepy


long and contentious measure.    Outstanding policy issues on both the

Education and Housing Bills would need to be settled very quickly if the

Bills were to be ready on a manageable timetable.    Bringing the main

Water Privatisation Bill back into the programme, as the Chancellor of

v the Exchequer had suggested in correspondence, had to be considered

Vagainst that background.    Even if ways could be found to prepare the

OBill more rapidly, it could be accommodated only at the cost of dropping

of the other major Bills that the Department of the Environment had

Xin^ttie programme.    Finally, a decision should be taken on whether to

^oc) d in the next Session with a Bill to implement the Warnock Report

od^frng--elleviation of human infertility, since such a Bill should be

meftfcSpSed in the Speech if it were to be brought forward in the

forttyy) J*ng Session.    In the light of the Cabinet&apos;s decisions on The

Queen^S Speech, QL would review the detailed composition of the

legislative programme and he would report the results of that review to

his Cabinet colleagues by early July.    He trusted that his colleagues

would endorse a programme that would proceed with confident efficiency,

and he be 1 ie ^ hat this was the tone that should be struck in The

Queen&apos;8 SpeeWta-^-.

The following m^iw^oNints were made in discussion -

a. A main sW&amp;ugte-Q. thrust of policy during the Government&apos;s

third term of Qpfc&amp;&amp; would be a concerted attack on the problems of

the inner cities. &gt;^&gt;$k Speech should be rearranged so as to

emphasise the con4rppfuyvions that would be made in this regard by

the proposed legisl^ -ipp^pn housing, education, and employment.

b. The proposed Hou^^^^&amp;tion Trusts would be an important

component of the overaJK ^?Dp*oach to inner cities and the

provisions enabling thei^eret&amp;blishment should therefore be

included in the Housing BiL^^rwJihe forthcoming Session, along with

provisions on private rentedsector deregulation.    The legislation

on Housing Action Trusts woul^iSSe the form of enabling powers

only, and the public expenditurSevlj ^lications should be addressed

separately.

c. The other housing matters that might be included in a Housing

Bill in the forthcoming Session were improvement grants; amendments

to the right to buy; provisions on housMjg^essociations; and

provisions to enable local authority tenant^ to change their

landlord.    The Secretary of State for tfte^EJwJronment did not

propose to bring forward legislation to aii&lt; nd/the law on local

authority housing accounts and on the locar-^^wernment capital

control system until the 1988-89 Session. I

d. The privatisation of the water and sewerage Eopjptions of the

water authorities in England and Wales would be a^avjeis component

of the privatisation programme, which remained a cy^n^ritone of the

Government&apos;s policies.    If the legislation were not T^jJa^tAd in the

forthcoming Session, and sales were consequently defe^reiij*ntil

1990, there would be a damaging gap in the privatisatiiro^OTogramme,

and in the flow of privatisation receipts.    Furthermore, vMj/w&amp;uld


mean that water privatisation and electricity privatisation would

be competing simultaneously for the available money.    There was,

therefore, a strong argument for pressing ahead with the main Water

Privatisation Bill in the forthcoming Session, even at the cost of

displacing another major Bill from the programme.    On the other

hand,  the decisions that colleagues had recently taken on a revised

approach to water privatisation would inevitably delay the

^preparation of the Bill.    In particular,  they demanded further

.^Wsultation with the industry, both in order to secure the

/necessary co-operation and support, and to avoid later risks of

/^rfdi-aial review.    When allowance was made for proper consultation,

^S^Bill could not be prepared before January 1988 at the very

eayl/^st, and that would be very late for the introduction of such

a Wlrge and contentious measure.

e. Legislation on the Warnock Report would be too divisive to be

sensibly attempted in a Session that would be filled with

mainstream^&gt;oN\itical measures.    In the absence of a Bill in

1987-88, Imwej^.  the Secretary of State for Social Services would

almost certayy^Tynneed to take some other initiative to demonstrate

Government as^ti^^try on the subject, perhaps by way of a White

Paper. ^Ilyy

f. Various draE^s^V^ianges to the Speech were agreed.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summW^ubS the discussion,  said that the Cabinet

agreed that the Bill on tn^-j ajrt&gt;ock Report should be dropped from the

programme for 1987-88.    The (Vw^ of main privatisation legislation for

the water industry was clearl^j^fjtyected by the Government&apos;s decision in

May to revise its proposals inwjr/i&apos;ftus respects that required

consultation with the water indu^rry^X It would be taking too great a

risk to assume at that stage that^fiYhese changed circumstances, a

sound Bill could be prepared in time/^or legislation in the forthcoming

Session, and The Queen&apos;s Speech shou^jt^fterefore not promise it. For

the reasons indicated by the ChancelloV/^^pthe Exchequer, however, early

water privatisation would be a consider^fele prize to win. The

possibility of introducing the main watev privatisation measure in the

forthcoming Session should not be ruled out,  in case it proved possible

to complete the preparatory consultations more rapidly than the

Secretary of State for the Environment currentl^P-ehavisaged, and both the

consultations and the preparation of a Bill sr{auld(/be taken ahead as

fast as was compatible with a prudent regard to^-\&lt; d&quot;rs,ial review. The

Queen&apos;s Speech should therefore include a form ofCwpr^X that would be

broad enough to cover water privatisation legislattctfwAut did not

commit the Government to do anything beyond the neceay^pj^paving

measure.    The Speech should also be revised to give g^$^^ prominence

to the relevance to inner cities of the Government&apos;s propp*^Ls on

education, housing and employment.    The legislative prog^m^Xset out in

the Speech was exceptionally heavy, and it was essential \x J?All the

main Bills were brought forward as early as possible.    The j3*jQ^^.on

Bill and the Housing Bill, in particular, were of cardinal pN^Jr^ic^al

importance,  and it was essential that they should be introduceJd/^nA

before Christmas.    The Cabinet had approved the draft Speech atl^p&apos;tfe^to


C(87) 10,  subject to revision on the points she had indicated

and to miscellaneous drafting points that had been agreed in discussion,

k  Other changes might be necessitated by later developments.

&apos;VvV    The Cabinet -

%Subject to the changes agreed in discussion,

roved the draft Speech attached to C(87) 10.,

Ins true ted the Secretary of the Cabinet to

^J^ire a final revision of the draft Speech,

takopj^ account of these changes,  for the Prime

Minister to submit to The Queen.

3.      Invited the Lord President of the Council to

arrange for The Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future Legislation

Committee/Co^b&amp;rvy out a final review of the

legislatiyfe pwagramme in the light of the decisions

that the CaEoyfrreTy\had reached, and of the Prime Minister&apos;s

summing up o^J^J^discussion.
