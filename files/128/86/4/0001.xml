C^^^^eated by speculation about the date of an Election.

tenable the Government to seek and if possible secure a

e for the substantial plans of policy development which the

ment had in mind, and to provide the prospect of a further

f office in which to put those plans into effect.

stake, t/yenn any uncertainty about the British position on those

issues, sJg^^o&gt;ensure continuing consistency of policy.

as much outstanding feg^^gra^ion as possible through Parliament before
