P X^^n^ary

1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

of Commons in the following week.

MPs&apos; Pay

^fcflE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the House of Commons had resolved on

^f^-July 1983 that there should be phased increases in MPs&apos; pay to a link

89 per cent of the maximum of the scale for Senior Principals in

th^^vil Service.    The final phase, which would require an increase of

Mj}#^&gt;er cent, from  18,500 to  22,548, was due to take effect on

1 j^aujcfy 1988.    Under the terms of the 1983 resolution, it was

nece y r&apos;/^to confirm this within three months of the new Parliament

as s enmp^rfg and therefore a decision could not be postponed.    Despite the

difficulties of supporting an increase of this magnitude, he was of the

clear view that it would not be sustainable to seek to secure any

further phasing of this increase, and he believed that the Government

should now acc B&lt; the inevitable.    Since the time of the 1983

resolution,       extra point had been added to the Senior Principal scale

to provide foOwj^t pay.    The resolution on MPs&apos; pay would if necessary

need to make clerar Johat the linkage was with the top of the main scale

and not with the^-a^ixional point for merit pay.    Neither this nor the

proposal to freezft^tfjfe^ecretarial allowance at  20,140, in line with

the recommendation $&gt;^wv*. Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB), was likely to

give rise to any sigmRl^apt opposition.

In discussion the follo^^^^iain points were made -

a. Under the terms 1983 resolution, MPs would be due a

further increase in pav^w/LApril 1988, the settlement date for

Senior Principals.    An YnqK^Me then, coming so soon after the

substantial increase on KJamiary 1988, would be hard to defend and

it should be postponed untw^l^anuary 1989.

b. The Government would neSfr&amp;ytake a decision shortly on

Ministerial pay.    There was a sMxJiirg case for increasing the

differential between the pay ofparliamentary Under Secretaries and

of MPs and for improving the pay of Ministers in the House of

Lords.

c. While MPs had generous pension ariynngMnents, the pension

arrangements for Ministers were relatiw^y^geor.    This matter,

together with the question of severance pjayfor Ministers, might be

referred to the TSRB. ^^^&gt;7

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, sai^/^ut the Cabinet

agreed that the Government should not seek to blockv^n^ implementation

with effect from 1 January 1988 of the final phase of &gt;*^^983 pay

settlement.   Clearly, however, linkage of MPs&apos; pay shoaldj}* with the

top of the main point of the Senior Principal pay scale^Q^k&apos;frQt with the

additional point on the scale for merit pay.   The increas^WHh would

be due on 1 April 1988 should be held over to 1 January 19w^yw

consideration should be given to whether increases due in smimfant


years should be held over on a similar basis.    The Chancellor of the

Exchequer should bring forward proposals on Ministerial pay,  in the

light of which the Lord President of the Council might wish to comment

on the pay of Ministers in the House of Lords.    Further consideration

^^ould need to be given to the matters to be referred to the TSRB.

/yil    The Cabinet -

 

^^XJNnvited the Lord Privy Seal and the Chancellor

j&amp;the Exchequer to proceed in accordance with

&lt;^ he^Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.

2.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE said that at a

recent meeting be^had made clear to the National Union of Teachers (NUT)

and the Natior/a&lt;f~Association of Schoolmasters and the Union of Women

Teachers  (NASAQWT^-fchat it would not be possible to establish new

machinery for set/Qifig teachers&apos; pay and conditions in time for the next

pay round.    He ho^g^t&apos;b publish a Green Paper shortly setting out

proposals for estaltf^^rtig a permanent machinery.    The NAS/UWT would be

calling some selecti(ra^t kf-day strikes before the end of the summer

term but the effects vdu^cr^be barely discernible.    They had not decided

what action,  if any,  they^OTild take in the following term.    The NUT had

no plans to take f urtherVwlaustrial action.

Child Abuse

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCI&amp;E^S^WlCES said that the Minister of

State, Department of Health and S^iajv Security (the Minister for

Health) would announce later that d^y^tjjat an inquiry was to be

established into child abuse in Cle^i^r^Swl.    He hoped that the inquiry

could be completed by the end of SeptA&gt;&lt;m^^.

The Cabinet - V

Midland Bank

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said^tf/t^he was awaiting

advice from the Director General of Fair Trading on Xfl&amp;rher he should

refer to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, unde^t^e^Fair Trading

Act 1973, the proposed sale by the Midland Bank to the N&gt;* ^nal

Australian Bank of the Clydesdale Bank, Northern Bank aw^KcxKthern Bank

(Ireland). \&gt;~-S/S\


THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that there were parallel powers

under the Banking Act 1987 to scrutinise and if necessary block proposed

changes of control of banks involving 15 per cent or more of voting

?\rights.    The Bank of England were, however, satisfied on prudential

Os^j-ounds about the proposed take-over by the National Australian Bank.

^Me Banking Act 1987 also included powers for the Government to block

/BTp^osed take-overs by foreign undertakings on grounds of reciprocity,

Aproujg&apos;b the full powers would not become operative until 1 October 1987.

It^rasXflearly necessary for the Midland Bank to strengthen its

balaaf^-sheet which had been weakened by the deterioration in the

qual^ftf^fcrf its Latin American holdings and the losses it had suffered

over t^f^J^ocker Bank.

jCoal Industry

THE SECRETARY /J^-^TATE FOR ENERGY said that the National Union of

Mineworkers difegayte conference had voted the previous day against

flexible working,y^&lt;rK\had agreed to put the matter to a ballot of the

full membership.KjJWpe were signs that some areas would like to

negotiate indepencfSmaLywith the British Coal Corporation on this

matter. /

Northern

Ireland

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FoVt^^ERN IRELAND said that he had arranged

through the usual channeIs N^oNke^t the leaders of the Official Unionist

Party and the Democratic Unie^f&gt;^Rarty for exploratory talks. Although

it was impossible to predict whan^pyogress would be made,  it was an

encouraging sign that the leaders^&lt; r\jhe two unionist parties had agreed

to meet him. ^^^^^^

3.    THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY sa^JrtuSX there had been

conflicting rumours about the fate of Mr Terry Weite^,  the Archbishop of

Canterbury&apos;s Special Representative, who had disVpjfr^Ved in Lebanon some

six months previously.    In fact, there was no cleaVypi^Xcation at all

about Mr Waite&apos;s circumstances.    The Government conti^ue^to watch for

reliable indications and remained in close touch witrrtwe^ffice of the

Archbishop of Canterbury.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the draft resolution

calling for a ceasefire in the Gulf War, which had been agreed between

the five Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council, would

probably be tabled in the Council in the following week.    Comments were

.still being received from non-permanent members of the Council. This

&quot;Resolution would be a first step.    There was no confidence that Iran

^wieajld comply with the call for a ceasefire.   Enforcement measures might

^tfiius be needed, for instance, an embargo on arms supplies.    Pressure for

/afcyebA to the war would need to be maintained.

Mea&apos;nwip^le, he was promoting, with friendly states in the Gulf and

We s4a j*r^&amp;oun tries including the United States, the idea of pressing

Iraq^MOTie-eist from attacks on ships using the Gulf.    This was part of a

patterA^yr activity designed to defuse the situation.

Cyprus

THE FOREIGN A/wfc lMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Report on Cyprus by

the House of SjjgwwiBv Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, which had been

published on 2 JMly)Jhad caused irritation to both the Greek and Turkish

sides. The sugge-Swxfiy in the Report that the United Kingdom might adopt

a higher profile i^rltp^search for a Cyprus settlement was unlikely to

prove helpful. The(pjjw^ranent would reply to the Select Committee in

due course. ^&apos;js?

Turkey

CC(87) 13.2

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTRSSjMJRETARY said that the visit from 5-8 July

of the Foreign Minister of TurVf^^Mi: Vahit Halefoglu, had gone well.

There were prospects for signi^Kca^Korders in Turkey for the United

Kingdom. ^/^^

Indones ia

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the visit from 2-4 July

of the Minister for Research and Technology of_Jndonesia, Dr Bachruddin

Yusuf Habibie, had been useful.    He had met irash\of the major British

companies that were interested in business i^Jnjiooesia. Although

Dr Habibie had not concluded a co-operation ag/eremaiit that had been

contemplated with British Aerospace pic, the Coq^ury&apos;Vlid not think this

likely to affect its major prospects for contrac^&apos;xn^ndonesia.

In a brief discussion, it was noted that Dr Habibie^r&amp;^wn expert in

aircraft production and a man of notable vigour who was-^ep rgetically

promoting expansion of the private sector of the Indoit^  tm^economy.




THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Liberal and

Country Parties had made gains in the opinion polls preceding the

general election in Australia on 11 July; but, despite the closing of

vthe gap between the Opposition and the ruling Australian Labour Party,

wie general expectation was that the latter would win the election and

&gt;pe\nain in government.

/ryynie Cabinet -

Took note.

State Visit

by the King

of Morocco

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that King Hassan of Morocco

would be paying a State Visit to the United Kingdom from 14-17 July, in

return for Her/JJ3Sesty The Queen&apos;s State Visit to Morocco in 1980. The

press, recalling yicidents during the 1980 visit, would be alert for any

sign that KingNBte^Saiv might be slighting his hosts,  for instance by not

observing the titfesyo^the events on his programme.    Care was being

taken,  in planning-~Wj /programme,  to minimise the risk of this

happening.    When aSKapXm^nt the political purposes of the invitation to

King Hassan to make a^ra^e Visit,  the Government would say that it was

a return visit and woulo^p^int to trade relations between Britain and

Morocco and to the latt&lt;j^^moderate role in the politics of the Middle

The Cabinet - \OvO

2.      Invited the Foreign M^Cwnmonwealth Secretary

to consider whether the re5so r^\jhe Government

could give for the invitatio^n taking Hassan could

be strengthened. cCcT?

COMMUNITY

AFFAIRS

1987 Budget

4.    THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that,  following the European

Council, there had been a meeting of the Budge^ 6ouncil on 2-3 July to

discuss the 1987 budgetary situation.    The agreement reached was,  in all

the circumstances, reasonably satisfactory.    kto/tJEexspending on

agriculture would be covered by changing the adyVnc^Jpayment

arrangements.    The other changes involved more e\&amp;xa&amp;rf k of deferred

expenditure than of genuine savings.    There was, hvw^^. no financing

outside the system by an intergovernmental agreementC^Jra*\bere was no

tax on oils and fats.    The European Parliament had trne&amp;^k reject the

amended budget but had not been able to muster a suffic^fOiajority.

It would therefore be adopted. \S ))

In discussion it was said that some of the propositions whwfrvjpraer

member states had readily accepted in the European Council ^P^/ow

causing them difficulty at home or with their own Parliaments;

Budget Council had shown, for example, that the Dutch Government /OA


was in considerable difficulty over the temporary waiving of the 10 per

cent of levies and duties retained by member states for collection

costs.

Tax \^

Approximation

^SJuLCHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Commission was preparing

/w^msals, within the responsibility of Lord Cockfield, for the

cipr&gt;r ^mation of value added tax and excise duties in member states. So

f r tj^re was no agreement on this within the Commission.    When the

pro^&amp;aik appeared, these would be likely to create very serious

dif   %ies for many member states.    Under the Treaty unanimous

agreeriCw^&apos;would be required for their adoption, and this was not in

prospect

THE

LEGISLATIVE

PROGRAMME

Previous

Reference:

CC(87) 12.5

5.     The Cabinet co^^a^ed a memorandum by the Lord President of the

Council (C(87) 12) re^Jc^tjpig on the review of the provisional programme

that had been carried ojrf^JKThe Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future Legislation

Committee (QL). \k ))

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE dfrB^JJ&amp;L said that The Queen&apos;s Speech approved

by the Cabinet had committeeyi^ae Government to a massive and highly

controverisal programme.    He tim^Oi doubt that this was the right

approach at the outset of the vove^rmnent&apos;s third term of office, but the

programme would stretch the mach^rter^for preparing legislation to its

limits and would consume all the a^aVLable Parliamentary time.    It did

not at present contain any margin SSSjJ^ror unconvenanted additions, and

it certainly contained no margin for^kpwr.   QL therefore wished to

emphasise as strongly as they could twfit the programme needed to be

managed with exceptionally tight discipline and that the introduction of

Bills must not be allowed to drift late.    If that happened, there would

not only be an immediate impression of lack ofcompetence, but major

Bills would at the end of the Session pile u/v&apos;Tryso an unmanageable log

jam, in which Bills could well be lost, or He^ejtured only at the cost

of damaging concessions.

Against that background, QL was clear that a fiwa^ikcXsion now had to

be taken one way or the other on the inclusion of /p Mh Water

Privatisation Bill.    Keeping open the option of acc&lt;jamaow.ing such a

large and late Bill would henceforth absorb more resoujX^-ythan could be

spared from servicing the rest of the programme, and rotvOMice between

that Bill and another of equal weight now had to be con&apos;f^Jv^d.    If the

decision was to postpone the Bill, he was sure that QL woa&apos;WA^ok

favourably on giving it advance drafting authority for the^jflr^wing

Session.    The second major issue that preoccupied QL was thd ^^&gt;^


IconfidentIal

management of the three major Bills on Abolition of Domestic Rates,

Housing and Education.    These Bills would themselves monopolise all the

available time for legislation in the House of Lords between Easter and

the end of July and it was therefore essential that they should

introduced into the House of Commons by mid-November at the very

test.    He was grateful to the Secretaries of State for the Environment

for Education and Science for their recognition of this.   Whilst the

tion of Domestic Rates Bill formed a complete whole, and the

J*r^Sht8 of the Education Bill had been set out in fair detail in The

ua^jr*^ Speech, the Government had not entered into any specific

oimnvfcfre&apos;nts on the Housing Bill.    That measure would need to be followed

major housing legislation in the following Session in any

oped that the Secretary of State for the Environment would

introduce by mid-November all the housing proposals that he

d, but in the circumstances he had outlined it would be open

to the Government to defer those that were not then ready, and this was

the course that he would be bound to recommend.    He might need to return

to colleagues crtf^Khis point nearer the time.    Similarly, the Housing and

Rent (Scotlan/^ B^.1 had grown to some 100 clauses, which was clearly

more than the TtSfcCwftnentary machine could bear.    He looked to the

Secretary of Stape yyr^ Scotland for help in substantially reducing the

For the rest, QL&apos;s proposals, set out in C(87)

These were desirable on financial control grounds, however, and,

k while there might be no better way of securing the necessary

/ reduction in the Bill, the matter should be considered further.

V^PHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet

&lt;^^pQk full note of QL&apos;s assessment of the weight of the programme and

/ejCdWrsed the Lord President&apos;s comments on the importance of introducing

Mfi^M^promptly.   Ministers responsible for Bills should pay close

\ikxso^k\ attention to this.    The Cabinet agreed that a main Water

Pri^ij^ition Bill could not be accommodated in the present Session,

thou^w^hay invited QL to give it advance drafting authority for the

followarfg^Session.    The Secretary of State for the Environment should

conside  ways of shortening the period between the Bill&apos;s Royal Assent

and the first flotation of water undertakings.    The major Bills on

Abolition of Domestic Rates, Housing and Education should certainly be

introduced by Jth  end of the second week of November at the latest, and

the contents /ar&amp;fte Housing Bill, in particular, might need to be

adjusted to m^ei^thNat requirement.    The Secretary of State for Scotland

should considerj/furrier with the Lord President how the scope of the

Housing and Rent&lt;  jro^land) Bill might be reduced.   The Cabinet agreed

that the Prohibit tro%&gt;A Torture Bill should be dropped from the

programme and that $^Ahly new Bill to be added to it should be the

Financial Markets Br*l^wpj.ch should be prepared as drafting resources

became available.    Pavi^J&amp;J&amp;rovisions for electricity privatisation

should be incorporated tf* rn\hose for water privatisation in the manner

that had been described xffi^fe^cussion.    With these adjustments, the

programme was approved. \&lt;C\&gt;^\

The Cabinet - &lt;/K?&lt;\

1. Approved the legislature jJ*ogramme set out at

Annex A to C(87) 12, subject^^o^the deletion of the

Prohibition of Torture Bill, CESj^addition of the

Financial Markets Bill and the/raarj&amp;sion of the Water

(Powers and Charges) Bill to in^Hjde paving provisions

2. Invited the Lord President of the Council to arrange

for The Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future Lea^STtotion Committee

to give a main Water Privatisation Bil\RadVance drafting
