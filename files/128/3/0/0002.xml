THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT, - -The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.    . . .    ,It is issued for the personal use of....r^.?L..Oo^*^^TOP SECRET Copy N0...J..Q...c u.(us) 30th conclusions, minute confidential Annex(11th September, 19^-5 - 11.0 a.m. )PALESTINE The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord President of the Council, Chairman of the Palestine(Previous Committee,  to which there was attached a reportReference: (CP. (i+5) 156)  giving the recommendations of the.7.M. (M+)  155th   Palestine Committee on the short-term policy to be conclusions,        adopted, in that country.Minute 1 )THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL,   in introducing the report,  emphasised the importance of maintaining the utmost secrecy, both as regards the Committee&apos;srecommendations and,  indeed, as regards the fact thata Palestine Committee of the  Cabinet had beenconstituted.The quota of 75?000 Jewish immigrantspermissible under the provisions of the White paper of May, 1939, was now within 3,000 of exhaustion, andit was now a matter of urgency to reach conclusions as to a short-term policy which would bridge the period between the complete exhaustion of the immigrationquota and the devising and implementation of a long-term policy.      The position was one of great difficulty and we were unlikely to escape criticism whateverpolicy we adopted.      The position was aggravated by theinternal  situation in Palestine which showed signs ofdeterioration, Jews and Arabs alike being armed and very much on the alert against one another.It seemed essential that we should,  inaccordance with the pledge given in the White Paperobtain- the acquiescence of the Arabs of Palestine inthe continuance of any Jewish immigration after the exhaustion of the quota, but even if we could get theArabs to agree to the continuation of immigration ona very restricted scale (of which there seemed somelikelihood through the good offices of the Arab states)sthe Jewish feeling both here and in the United states would be that not enough had been done.      It was significant that the Jewish Agency, when offered the3,000 immgration certificates remaining from theWhite Paper quota to be expended at the rate of 1,500a month, .had flatly rejected this and had demanded a figure of 100,000.   - The Committee,  in thesecircumstances, had, after exhaustive discussionunanimously reached the view;-

(i)  that we should continue to conform to theexisting arrangements, .as prescribed inthe &quot;/kite Paper,  in respect of immigration&apos;during the interval between the exhaustion of the quota therein prescribed and thepromulgation of a long-term policy,  everyeffort being made to persuade the Arabsto agree to a continuation of immigrationduring this interval at the rate.atpresent permissible.(ii)  that before the approach was made to theArabs,  the United States Government shouldbe informed of the fact that His Maje sty&apos;sGovernment were urgently considering the formulation of a new long-term policy forPalestine,  that they intended to referthis policy to the &quot;/oriel Organisation indue course, and that they proposed in themeantime to act as in (i) and,(ill)  that the Chiefs of Staff should be ashed totake immediate steps to reinforce theMiddle East garrison to the extent necessary to meet the military commitmentinvolved in (i).The matter had since been discussed in- theForeign Secretary&apos;s Middle East Conference which now recommended that any announcement should be postponed until the pilgrimage to Mecca took place in Novemberbecause of the risk of Arab feeling becoming inflamedat that time and of the necessity for making certain military preparations.A general discussion took place,  in the courseof which the following points were made:- ,(a) The view was strongly expressed that it wouldbe very difficult    to  justify the suspension of immigration until after theforthcoming Mecca Pilgrimage.      Theproposal in this sense represented a material modification of the Report ofthe Palestine Committee.      A completesuspension might well be represented asbeing inconsistent with the spirit of the undertakings we had given in the V/hitePaper.      It might encourage Arab truculenceand labile it might ease matters with theArabs for the actual period of thePilgrimage,  it might well prove to be avery expensive concession.      While fulljustice should be done to Arab claims,  itwas possible to exaggerate their importance.(b) We were in the unfortunate position that whatever action we took we were likely tofind ourselves exposed to sharp criticism1 from one side or the other.      It was important in this connection,  so far aspracticable,  to take the United states with us.      //kilo opinion In that country was at the moment very free  in itscriticism of our policy in Palestine, theUnited States Government had not so far been prepared to accept any responsibilityfor helping in the handling of the situation.

(c) Was it not clear that the Palestine issue was one that would ultimately have to goto the World Organisation?     This being so,  would not the wise course, for us beto make it clear at once that it was our intention to refer,it to the world organisation?     A declaration of thiskind should ease the position as betweenthe Arabs end ourselves, for the Arabshad tended to complain in the past thattheir case had never been properly heard.We should be able to make it clear tothem that if the matter went before  theWorld Organisation they would have thefullest opportunity of making their case-before world opinion.      Equally, adeclaration in this sense should help us with the Jews,  since Jewish opinion would realise that matters were taking anew form,  and it might be hoped thatthere would be a tendency to concentrate on preparation of the case of the world organisation with a corresponding easingof the situation in Palestine.(d) If any statement on the lines suggested in(c) above was to be made&apos;by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment,&quot;was it not desirable that itshould be made within the. minimum of delay?-     That would make it clear thatthe initiative still rested, with us andit would be our answer to criticism,whether in this country or elsewhere.It would also greatly strengthen our hands in the event of outbreaks inPalestine, whether Jewish or Arab.(e) Should we not do better to approach theJewish Agency and tell them that wehad it in mind to put this whole matter to the World Organisation and acquiretheir understanding and support for such temporary suspension of immigration as might be necessary pending the working out of such a policy?THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES saidthat he had been in constant touch withthe Jewish Agency, but that body, whichwas now under considerable pressure byextreme elements, had adopted a quiteuncompromising line and was, he felt,primarily&quot; concerned, to make it clear thatthe White Paper was dead.      THE foreign secretary said that the news that theJewish Agency had declined to accept the3,000 immigration certificates offered to them,  and demanded a quota of 1 00,000,.which he- had now communicated, to the americans, had clearly mads a markedimpression on them.

(f) THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER emphasised   &quot;the importance of pressing on with&apos;economic development as a contributionto the solution of.the Palestine problem.While he accepted that it did not figure in the proposals in the PalestineCommittee8s Report since that Reportdealt with short-term policy only, he hoped that it might be possible now tosay something about it being our intentionnot merely to deal with Jewish immigration,but to arrange for full support, includingreasonable financial assistance, for theeconomic development of this backwardarea.(g) Attention was drawn to the military problems involved in the handling of the Palestineissue.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POP WAR and THESECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR informed theCabinet of the position as regards the availability of forces and possible time-tables for their moves.      It was generally felt that given the very threateningsituation disclosed by the lettercirculated by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies in the annex to CP. (1+5) 165,the Chiefs of Staff should again beinvited to review the security aspectsof this matter and the arrangements for moving troops.(h) Attention was drawn in this same connectionto the great importance of bringing thePalestine Police Force up to strength.The Cabinet were informed that the ColonialOffice and the War Office were already in contact as regards the possibility of employing men now due for demobilisationfor this purpose.(i) The point was also made that while we must,of course, take whatever security measures were practicable and. necessary,  it wouldbe most unfortunate were the need togarrison Palestine to result in further serious delays in demobilisation and stillmore in the deaths of British soldiers.The reactions in either event, both in thiscountry and among the troops might be veryunhappy.(3) The view was expressed that the lettercirculated as an enclosure to C, P. (45)  165showed, a certain lack of objectivity andmight be read, as Indicating a bias on thepart of its writer towards the Arab rather&apos; than the Jewish case.      It was. pointed outin this connection that while isolatedphrases in the letter might bear thatconstruction other parts of the letterwere strongly critical of the Arabs andthat the document must be judged as awhole.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOE THE COLONIESdrew attention to the extreme difficultieswhich fac ed the Fale s 11ne Admini strati on and to the skill and resolution with whichit had dealt with them.After further discussion,  THE PRIME ministers aid that It was clear that there were strong,arguments for a public statement on the policy ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government and of their intention indue course to put this matter to the World Organisation.-The question of timing was, however,  of critical importance and he suggested that the simplest coursewould be that the matter should be discussed furtherbetween the Lord President of the Council,  the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs,  the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies, and himself, with a view to -further discussion once the position in relation to timinghad been clarified,      Meantime,  there would be -advantage in a further review by the Chiefs of Staffof the security aspects of this problem.The Cabinet(1)Approved, the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestionat &apos;X&apos;  and invited the Secretary ofState for the Colonies,  in consultationwith the Lord President and the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs,  to make arrangements on the lines proposed.(2) Invited the Chie:the security aspc:a of Staff to reviewcts of the problem.Cabinet Office,.W. 1.
