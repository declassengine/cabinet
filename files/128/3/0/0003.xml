(45) 30thConclusions,Minute 5)At their he gting on 11th September the cabinet had approved proposals by the Secretary of State forForeign affairs for the line to be taken by him in discussions in the Council of Foreign Ministers asregards the disposal of Italian colonies and of italian Mediterranean Islands.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY now reported the progressof discussions in the Council of Foreign Ministers.He had found himself confronted with great difficultiesin respect of the Italian colonies.      There had been general agreement that they should be placed under international trusteeship.      The question in issue was however whether that trusteeship should be thatof an individual state or collective trusteeship.There were indications that Russia might be anxious to establish herself on the African continent.She had been very successful in establishing her position,  consequent on the end of the war,various territorial areas in which shein Europe and in the Far Eaststrong negotiating position,from certain points of view.in the&quot;was interested and she was in a veryThere were however,arguments of substanceagainst encouraging,herself in Africa.or allowing, her toab 1 i shSoUnion offer as the Dominions were concerned,  theSbuth. Africa,&apos; which with its small population to fight in two -wars againsti-ifrica had to a greater orin issue, felt strongly that had since 191k hadGermany in both of whichless extent been directlyno risk should be run of a situation arising at any future date in which, because of the establishment ofany fresh Great Power in Africa, contingent arrangements would again have to be made to protect her interests;and she would be opposed accordingly to granting anyspecial place to Russia on the African continent.Australia and New Zealand which though interested inthe safety of the sea-routes were geographically more remote, were attracted in principle by the idea of collective trusteeship.The United States, who, he thought, realised the possible trend of Russian interests, favoured asolution on the basis of collective trusteeship.

In these circumstances, Mr. Byrnes had proposedin the Council of Foreign Ministers arrangements asregards Libya under which that area would, receive a promise of independence after a 10-year period of trusteeship under an administrator appointed by the trusteeship Council of the United Nations.   &apos; All states members of the Council of Foreign Ministers would havea voice in the selection of this administrator.      Hewould be assisted by an Advisory Committee inexudingrepresentatives of all States menbers of the Councilof Foreign Ministers except China,  and also represent-atives of Libya and Italy, who would be able to provide information relating to the territory which would beof value to the Committee.      If the administratorfailed to discharge his responsibility to the satisfaction of any of the States represented on theCommittee, any one of them would be entitled to bringthe matter before the Trusteeship Council.This arrangement would,  it was suggested, give an assurance to all that the former Italian colonies would not be developed to the military advantage ofany one nation.      It would be left to the  security council to determine where,  if necessary, any strategicbases might be located.Mr. Byrnes had urged that such a plan wouldgive heart to the peoples of the world,  since it would show that the Great Powers sincerely intended to give them at the earliest possible opportunity freedom todetermine the type of government under which they wished to live.Mr. Byrnes&apos;  proposal was of course an attractiveone from the point of view of public opinion;    and,realising the impo.rtar.ice attached by the Chiefs ofGtaff5 with their responsibility for defending Egypt,and for the position there,   to securing our positionin Cyrenaica, he,  the Foreign Secretary, had thoughtit wiser to play for time and avoid taxing toodefinite a line on it for the moment.        He had accordingly pointed out that the United Statesmemorandum referred to Libya;    but that Libya in factcomprised two territories - Cyrenaica and Tripolitania,and had ashed whether these territories could be namedseparately?     To this Mr. Byrnes had agreed.He (the Foreign Secretary) had then enquire whether,  if this matter were remitted for examination -to the Deputies,&apos; it could be understood that the deputies were empowered to study not only the proposals in the United States memorandum, but also any such other proposals as might be put forward by other states members of the Council or by other United Nations at war with Italy?     He had emphasised further that hewould line the governments of  the British Dominions tobe given an opportunity of putting their views to  the deputies, and. he had touched on the fact that it wasnot yet known what form collective administration would take,  e.g. whether there would be an internationaladministrative service for this purpose, and a system for sharing the costs of collective administration.He had added that this was a new experiment which,  if adopted, we would try to make work, but that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would be placed in a greatdifficulty if they were to be committed to this methodof trusteeship without the possibility of altering it if it were found unworkable,

1 0A long discussion had. followed.      M.  Mdlotov,A-&quot;while agreeing that the principle of internationaltrusteeship might be applied to the Italian colonies,had expressed the view that the American scheme presented difficulties,  and hud pressed very strongly that this should be on the basis of individual trustee-ship by a single Allied nation chosen by the United-Nations and that the Soviet Government should be made responsible for the trusteeship of Tripolitania.    Hehad justified this on the grounds, first, that russia had suffered greatly at the hands of Italian troopsfighting on the side of the Germans,  and secondly,  thatthe Soviet had wide experience in establishing friendly relations between different nationalities which theycould turn to advantage in one of the Italian colonies,in which they would undertake to use the authority given them by the United Nations in such a way as notmerely to maintain but to enhance the prestige of theUnited Nations.Mr. Byrnes had^the re fore indicated that in his view it was important that the Council before referringthis question to the Deputies should themselves discuss it,  since  there were questions of policy that must bedetermined before the Deputies could consider thedetails.      He had urged that in particular the council should themselves decide:-(i) whether the Colonies were to be taken from italy;(ii) whether they agreed that the principle of trusteeship should be applied to these territories - on this the French had expressed some reservations, but theother Powers appeared to agree;(iii) whether,  if there were to be a trusteeshiparrangement, it could be limited to aten-year period&apos; for Libya and Eritrea;(iv) whether the colonies were to be administered by particular States or by individualsselected by the Trusteeship Council of theUnited Nations;(v)  if the colonies were to be administered by individual States, which States should beresponsible for which colonies.  -Mr. Byrnes had pointed out further that therewas no hope of securing reparations from these areas(in reply to which M. Molotov had said that he had nosuch intention), and that there-were strong arguments against their being developed militarily (in replyto which M. Molotov said that nobody had suggestedusing them for military purposes).The Foreign Secretary continued that thediscussion had come back to the question whether wewere going to have individual or collective trusteeship.It had been .adjourned until this afternoon and, while he had emphasised the importance of our interests, hehad refrained from committing himself in any way.But the point that now had to be settled, and on whichhe wished for the guidance of the Cabinet, was whatwas the position of the British Commonwealth if we decided to have collective trusteeship on the modelproposed by Mr. Byrnes, excluding any individual trustee-ship.      If he was to t definite line (as he felt hewould have to) he must have a clear lead from the Cabii6t.

Ill this connection he wished to add -(i) That the Conference of H.M. representatives in the Middle East which was at present sitting inthe Foreign Office had made it clear to him that theywere not a little concerned about the position of theSenussl.      We had to deal with an extremely delicateposition in Egypt,  and the Benuasi,  though no more thana nomadic ruler,,  played,  it now appeared, a largerpart in the Egyptian mentality than we had in the past been inclined to accept.      There was the risk of astorm in Egypt and the Middle East unless we handledthis &quot;whole issue tactfully and we must remember thatwe had not only in the Jest the Senussi, but in theEast the still more intractable problem of palestine and the Jews.(ii) The reaction of our decision in this matter on the project for a Greater Somalia had also to beborne in mind.argumentsThe cabinet for and first considered the generalagainst collective trusteeship on thebasis proposed by Mr. Byrnes as against individualtrusteeship,Cyrenaica.with particular reference to the case ofThe following points were made:(a) Was it notthe present stage?trusteeship should comeWorld Organisation?ourselves to be rushedpremature to take this issue atSurely the question of collectiveup in connection with the; ought to refuse to allow.,  and should first see that the framework into which collective trusteeship was to befitted&quot;was established.      THE FOREIGN SECRETARY,while accepting the force of this argument, suggestedthat in dealing with the question of timing we should bear in mind the feeling which he thought he detectedin the minds of Mr. Byrnes and the Americans that itwas only if a conclusion could be reached at this moment that Congress were likely to accept obligationssuch as those now in view.      He thought the Americanleaders were trying to reach a settlement while UnitedStates public opinion was in a mood for one.      Ifthere was delay,  that opinion might very well cease to  take active interest in, or be prepared to take ashare in, the settlement of these problems.      He had.not therefore thought it wise to urge postponementuntil the World Organisation position was clearer.(b) Security.      The Chiefs of Staff had strongly pressed the importance on strategical grounds of oursecuring responsibility for Cyrenaica.      Would it notbe better to concentrate on securing this, even at thecost of giving Russia a free hand in a single neigh-bouring territory such as Tripolitania, rather thanaccept a system of collective security which wouldentitle Russia, while not in sole control of anysing1e ex-Italian&quot;7fro1onlcj; to have a hand, as onethe United Nations,  in the affairs of every one ofTHE CHIEFS OF STAFF explained that their object in pressing for Cyrenaica was rather to deny it to other powers whose presence there might represent a potentialliability^for&quot;us than necessarily to acquire it forr  r .      .;s^     If that could be secured for us only atofthem?

the cost of having.Russia responsible for Tripolitania,a different situation would arise.      Our policy was sofar as possible, to keep any potentially hostile Poweraway from the shores of the Mediterranean, and theof Russia,  or a Russian base in the Mediterraneanbe most undesirable from the strategic angle,^suggested in this connection that the applicationystem of collective trusteeship,  under which noindividual nation would be free to establish bases,would be much the best safeguard against ambitions thatmight be  strategically embarrassing to us.(c) It was strongly urged, ^ n  Mi   ntnen ha-tarr-,that we had everything to gain by supporting a proposalsuch as that put forward by the this. Government, unlessdecisive objections could be established, to it..   If itwere accepted it would mean that the United States were committed to playing their part in the affairs of thispart of the world and to taking a share in responsibilityfor it.      There might be a possibility of theirproviding an Administrator for certain of these territories.      Not only would they be carrying a shareof political responsibility;    we might also reasonablyhope that they would bear a part of the cost.&apos;(d) We must consider also the probable attitude ofpublic opinion generally.      The American proposal wassuperficially a very attractive one from that point ofview, while the arguments that could be urged against it were not such as could all of them very easily be stated in ^public.      Had we not made it clear too at san Francisco that the Great powers would not strugglefor ascendancy in the application of systems of collective trusteeship?     We must run no risk of our attitude being misunderstood.(e) THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that the Dominions, while not objecting to theprinciple of trusteeship, attached the utmost importance to a clear prior understanding as to whatthe form of such trusteeship was to be.      They wishedto see what exactly was involved.     Who,  for instance,would appoint the Administrators?     What would theirnationality, and their powers be?     The Chartercontemplated two or three different forms of trusteeship.      The Dominions were anxious, therefore,that whatever was referred to the Deputies should be-----      ..... ....._______ref^rrcjd^as an open and not a decided issue.6. rogs-jQ^sg^^ that the form of trusteeshipwhich would,  on the American basis,  be remitted to the deputies to examine, would be collective, trusteeship,and that they would not be free to examine any other form of trusteeship.(f) THE PARLIAMENTARY UNDER SECRETARY.OF STATEFOR THE COLONIES said that the Secretary of State forthe Colonies felt that a very complicated form of trusteeship was involved.      International administration in territories under the supervision of an inter-national body with no fund of experience to draw on and inexperienced in the technique of administration was likely to be very difficult.

nEritrea The Cabinet next considered the reactions of theSomalia proposals now under discussion on the proposals for aGreater Somalia and the disposal of the Italian colonies in Eritrea and elsewhere in East Africa.      Under theAmerican scheme Eritrea would be accorded the same treatment as Libya,  though there would be a territorialconcession to Ethiopia which would give Ethiopia access to  the sea through the port of Assab.      In the case of italian Somaliland there would be a similar trusteeshiparrangement, but without any fixed date for independence.THE PRIME MINISTER enquired whether it wasnecessary to deal with all the ex-Italian colonies on precisely the same basis?     Need a decision in favourof collective trusteeship for all rule out e.g.consideration of a project for a Great Somalia?The following points were made in thisconnection:-(a) A Greater Somalia could not easily beestablished without the inclusion of British Somaliland.While  there were arguments for such inclusion,  thepolicy to. which the late Government, with the approvalof the House of Commons, had been working, had beenthat subject possibly to minor rectifications we shouldneither acquire nor surrender any territory as partof the&apos; peace settlement.      While that policy had notbeen formally reaffirmed by the present Government,it stood  it the moment on record.(b) British Somaliland was not an Italian colony and did not fall to be disposed of consequent on theterms of the peace treaty.      The Somalis could make up their own minds whether to stay with us or (assuming that we could safeguard arrangements for feeding them)to become part of a larger territorial unit.(c) THE CHIEFS OF STAFF said that Somaliland was of gWrfMfc importance in terms&apos;of security.      It was onthe long sea route to the Middle East if the Mediter-ranean were out of our control, and it was also on the short sea route to India,-Australia and the Far Eastvia the Red Sea.      An unfriendly administrationinstalled in it might be very embarrassing to us.      Thepoint was made in this connection that the conception of trusteeship was trusteeship under the United nations organisation;  that that organisation was for collective--:--__ security and that military bases etc. would fall to^be^Jjl -^JjLAxs^TI settled on-the adviceT^of the United Nations/fflVihvfiTsgj?M J^*****J*j^&apos; Sfe^ and. not in terms of the interest of a particular-:--I country.(d) In the case of British Somaliland we were committed by repeated pledges given in the House ofCommons, that there should be no transfer of this&apos;territory save&apos; after consultation with its people.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY pointed out that noquestion of the transfer of British Somaliland arose.Would it be well that he should take the line that inrespect of the Somali areas the Cabinet had worked out a plan intended to give a better economic unit, in-which the people could graze and live under conditions

i    not at the moment possible;    and that in considerationof this arrangement he would be prepared to allow theposition of /British Somali land- to be considered bythe Deputies&apos;?   *   He would commit himself to nothingbeyond examination and it would of course be for theChiefs of Staff to advise on the strategical aspect.He could,  on the other hand, play for time over thewhole question of Somalia and could in accepting,  if that was the sense of the Cabinet, Mr. Byrnes&apos;s schemefor collective security,  say that there might beterritorial considerations which governments might liketo put to the Deputies?      If the matter went to  the deputies on this basis that would provide an opportunityfor the Dominions and India to come in and have theirviews heard.After further discussion,  THE PRIME ministers aid that the  general sense of the Cabinet was clearly that on a balance of considerations the advantagerested with supporting the scheme put forward byMr. Byrnes for collective trusteeship and was againstthe allocation of responsibility for trusteeship to individual separate States.      Our assumption was ofcourse that if we supported the United States plan,  andit was accepted,  the United States would play its part.That was vital.      Equally we should have to  take full account of the guarantees which we had given to theSenussi as regards associating him with the administration and the honouring of our pledges,  the return of italian administration, and most fully honour ourpledges to him.      Subject to this,  and to the points raised in the discussion, he suggested that the Foreign&apos;X*    j       Secretary should, be authorised to support the proposal that Mr.  Byrnes&apos;  plan for collective trusteeshipshould be remitted for examination to  the Deputies.The Cabinet -Agreed with the Prime Minister&apos;suggestion at &apos;XS,  and invited theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.
