(us) 32ndGonclus ions)THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he had felt it right to consult his colleagues with regard to the position which had arisen at theCouncil of    Foreign Ministers.      He would explain first the disagreement on procedure which had arisen.Whenarranged that should attendheld for somethe confertheall thefifteenneehadbegunit had beenrepresentatives of France and Chinaneetings and this arrangement hadsittings.      In connection &quot;with thediscussion of thePeton idie tehad takice Treaties with Bulgaria andie Soviet Delegation,  basingrms of the Protocol of the Berlinn the view that France and ChinaRoumania, however,themselvesConferencesshould be excluded from the discussions.      &quot;While theactual terms of the Protocol strictly interpreted,lent some support to the Soviet view, he felt no doubtthat the intention had been that all members of theCouncil would take part in all its deliberations.Both the United States and the United Kingdom Delegationswere opposed to the exclusion of France and China.Moreover,  it was clear that any such exclusion wouldbe entirely unacceptable to France and that if it werepersisted in the French Delegation would be withdrawn.The Prime Minister had communicated with Premier Stalinbut the reply received showed that the attitude taxenby the Soviet Delegation was fully supported byPremier Stalin.      This disagreement on procedure was,of course,  only the outward manifestation of thefundamental disagreements on principle which had arisenwith the Soviet Delegation, who were obviouslydetermined to oppose any proposals which might affectthe territories within what they regarded, as their zone of influence.      For this reason it had been found impossible to make any progress with constructive proposals for the rehabilitation of Europe,  such asthe provision of food supplies for Austria or thecontrol of inland waterways.      Moreover, we were facedwith increasing hostility and distrust between theUnited States and Soviet Delegations, each of whomsought to strengthen its own position without regard toour point of view.      He had a long private talk withM.  Molotov on Sunday in the hope of bringing him round to a more reasonable frame of mind,  but had come to  theconclusion    that there was little or no hope of making further progress at the present Conference and that theright course was to adjourn.

In discussion there was general agreement that gfdp,we should not yield to the Soviet demand for the exclusion of Prance and China, and- that nothing wouldbe gained by prolonging the present Confex,ence.      Thesuggestion was also made that it would be desirable totransfer discussion of the outstanding questions to aconference on a wider basis,  in which all the united nations, including the Dominions,  could take part.The inclusion of the Dominions would, among other things, strengthen our position vis-a-vis the UnitedStates and the discussion of the matters at issue ata wider conference would enable the force of world opinion to be brought to bear more effectively on theRussian attitude.      On the other hand,  it was pointedout that there was a danger that a wider conference would result in the alignment of most of the smallerPowers in support of Russia or the United States.We should,  of course, seek the support of other nationsby making clear our determination to stand for aninternational settlement by open discussion, but carewould have to be taken to avoid any action which might bring us under the suspicion of attempting to  set upa Western Bloc.With regard to the adjournment of the present conference,  it was felt that it might be undesirable to break on the narrow issue of the proposal to excludePrance and China from the discussions on the peace treaties with Bulgaria and Rpumania and that it wouldbe preferable to take the line that, since it had become apparent that,  because of the lack of time forthe necessary preliminary work,  the interests of  the peoples concerned in the peace settlement were notbeing adequately safeguarded,  it had been decided to adjourn the Conference in order to give more time forthe preliminary work to be done, and to enable theGovernments concerned to explore what would be the bestprocedure for carrying on the work of preparing thepeace settlement.      We should in any event take allpossible steps to make it clear to  the world that our desire was for a peace settlement reached by fullinternational discussion and that we -were averse toplaying power politics.      Per this purpose the foreign secretary shoulel have a Press conference when theCouncil of Foreign Ministers adjourned.Other points in discussion were:-(a) We should make it clear to the United StatesGovernment that it was impossible for us to work withthem if they constantly took action in the internationalsphere, affecting our interests, without prior consulation with us.(b) The possibility of giving publicity to our attitude through the world Trade Union Congress whichwas now meeting in Paris should be considered.(c) Attention was drawn to an embarrassingbroadcast on the subject of the Council of foreign ministers which had been given at 9.15 on the previous evening.The Foreign Secretary undertook to look into thequestion whether anything could be done to remedy theimpression which had been created by this broadcast,  and,in particular, to consider whether some guidance could--not be given to the B.B.C. with -regard to the furtherbroadcast on the same subject which was due to be madein the following week.ablnet Of fie el S.W.1.
