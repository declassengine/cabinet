PARLIAMENTARY   1. The Cabinet considered the implications of the GovernmentsAFFAIRS defeat the previous evening in the House of Commons, following--- the debate on Public Expenditure, on a motion relating to its economic Policies&apos; economic policies. It was generally agreed that it was essentialVote of Confidence    to demonstrate without delay that the Government had support forthese policies.    It was procedurally impossible, however, to tablea specific motion of confidence for debate that day.   The optionsopen to the Government, therefore, were to carry a vote on the adjournment that evening, having previously made it plain that thiswould be regarded as a vote of confidence in the Governmentseconomic and financial policies:  or to put down a specific motion of confidence for debate the following day or on Monday.   a specific motion of confidence would have the advantage that thoseof the Governments supporters who had voted against theGovernment motion the previous evening would be obliged, if they wished to avoid a General Election, to vote expressly in favour ofthe Governments economic policies to which the parliamentary labour Party as a whole were committed.    Without such a vote,they might continue to feel free, on future occasions, to dissociatethemselves from these policies.    On the other hand there couldbe adverse effects on international confidence if, as a result oftabling a motion for debate on Friday or Monday, government business had to be suspended in the meantime and the mediahighlighted the supposed political uncertainty.    There was a precedent in 1940 for treating an adjournment motion as a motion of confidence and, in present circumstances, this appeared to bethe best way of dealing with the immediate situation,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the motion for the adjournment that eveningshould be treated as a motion of confidence in the Governmentseconomic and financial policies and that a brief Press statement to that effect, with an explanation of the procedural reasons foradopting this course, should be issued forthwith.    The Chief Whipwould inform the Opposition before the statement was issued.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the Houseof Commons during the following week.1
ForeignAffairsfthod-esiaReference:CC(76) 8thConclusions***nute 22.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat he had decided to see the two white Rhode si an businessmenwho had recently visited London, reportedly with proposals fromMr Smith.    The proposition they had advanced was quiteunacceptable: it was that the Government should appoint threewise men, preferably representatives from the House of lords of the three main Parties, to go to Rhodesia and make recommendations about its future constitution.    He had told themthat the time for proposals of this kind was long past.    He was however himself preparing, on a contingent basis only, a statementof the elements necessary for a total settlement in Rhodesia,covering Buch points as the transition to majority rule, an aid programme, provision for Civil Service pensions, etc.    It would however not be right to produce such a package until Mr Smith had accepted not only the principle of majority rule but also an earlydate for its introduction.    He had met the Foreign Minister ofZambia that week and was likely soon to meet the MozambicanForeign Minister.    The Zambian Foreign Minister would beasking President Kaunda to suggest to President Nyerere ofTanzania that the latter should invite Mr Callaghan to go toTanzania for talks with him.    The four African Presidents werethe key to the situation because of their influence on the guerillas.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.2
3.        The position of. sterling was considered by the Cabinet,Their discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.4.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C(76) 25) and a memorandum by theCentral Policy Review Staff (C(76) 27) about the medium term economic background for the Public Expenditure Survey 1976.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had last year circulated to cabinet a paper (C(75) 60) on the procedure to be followed for thediscussion of public expenditure; the adoption of this, with itsprovision for preliminary discussion of the economic backgroundand of public expenditure priorities, had led to some easing of the inevitable problems associated with this difficult question.    Theslightly modified procedure he had proposed for the current year was designed to enable the White Paper on public expenditure to) bepublished in November, and similarly allowed for Ministers to cleartheir minds on priorities in early discussions before taking firm decisions.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that this was thefirst in the series of discussions which would lead up to a white paper in the autumn; Ms memorandum was intended to sketch thegeneral background and to indicate the considerations which wouldinfluence the guidelines needed for the 1976 public expenditure survey.    The central economic case presented in the White paper on public expenditure published in February (Cmnd 6393) assumedan average annual increase in gross domestic product (GDP)between 1974 and 1979 of 3.4 per cent: it was now clear mat theHkeXhood of achieving this increase was much less than had previously been thought, although it was very difficult to interpret the current indicators.    The recent unemployment figures wereencouraging, but it was not easy to understand the reasons lyingbehind them: the volume of exports was rather higher than had been expected.    With the reduction which had now taken place in the sterling exchange rate, and assuming that the Government were successful in continuing the policy of restricting pay increases to a low level, it should not be too difficult to achieve the assumedgrowth in GDP, and in the output of manufacturing industry, overthe next year.    But it was extremely difficult to say whether this rate of growth could be maintained over the following years; much would turn upon the capacity constraints emerging in the first year.On pay, he had made it clear to the Trades Union Congress (TUC)mat it was not possible for him finally to settle what he could do in his budget about increasing domestic demand until he knew what the pay limit in the second round of the counter-inflation policy was going tobe.    The TUC, conrersely, had indicated that their view of what3
was possible on pay would be in part determined by the content ofthe forthcoming Budget.    It would be possible for him to amend the Finance Bill as late as June in order to provide any tax relief which might follow acceptance of a low pay limit, and he thoughtthat a sensible arrangement could be made with the TUC on that basis.    On unemployment the figure of 700, 000 by the end of 1979was not a target; it represented an assumption of what could bedone if the Government&apos;8 other policies were successful.    what he had said publicly was that the Government could not setthemselves a less ambitious target than this.    He had discussed with the TUC their target of 600, 000 unemployed by 1978 and had pointed out that, given the lag which occurred between the growth of output and the effect on employment, the achievement of thattarget would require an increase of 24 per cent in manufacturingoutput by 1978; this was not impossible but was exceedingly difficultto bring about in any manner consistent with a balance of paymentsdeficit which there would be any prospect of financing.    Theexperience of the last Administration had shown the dangers of trying to grow too fast and running into consequential shortages:it would be preferable to aim for a slower rate of growth which was consistent with the Government&apos;s other economic aims.    Theconclusion he drew from this background was that for the period upto 1979-80, which had been covered in the February White Paper,public expenditure should in total remain broadly unchanged, and he recommonded to his colleagues that the guidelines for the forthcomingSurvey should be based on this assumption.In discussion it was argued that the Government&apos;s present economic policy was too critically dependent upon events outside their control.So far, the forecasts about the upturn in world trade had not beenfulfilled; but the Government was still waiting for the economy tobe rescued from its present difficulties by an improvement in economic activity in other countries.    If this did not take place, or were unduly delayed, the prospects for our economy would be evenworse than were now assumed and the Government would come underincreasing criticism that there was nothing in its policies of a self-generated character to improve the situation.    The central case inthe White Paper, postulating a growth of Sj per cent in manufacturingoutput for three successive years, was highly improbable.    Thevolume of exports would rise, but the danger was that this might be offset by an increase in imports, depreciation of sterling having justadded 5 per cent to the import bill, while the benefit to exports was delayed through the J-curve effect.    It was argued that, while allforecasts were unreliable, those of the Department of AppliedEconomics at Cambridge showed that policies based on a monetaryor devaluation approach would lead to continuing high unemployment and reduction in the real value of wages.    Further falls in the valueof sterling would unsettle the overseas sterling holders, and, by cutting real wages, have an impact on the Governmenfa ability to achieve a satisfactory wages policy.    The TUC Economic Reviewargued in favour of a strategy of protection, and neither of the4
papers before Cabinet gave any consideration to this as a possible alternative to present economic policies.    If the promised upturnin world trade took place, it could only lead to a flood of imports into the country as activity revived, and after a short boom the resulting imbalance on external account would lead to a situationin which employment would suffer severely.    It was essential that ministers should have an opportunity to discuss seriously analternative strategey involving the use of import controls as a centralelement.On the other hand it was argued that the Cambridge school ofeconomists had been completely wrong in their predictions lastyear, and the forecasts by other outside institutions - the NationalInstitute and the independent forecast by the Bank of England - were a good deal more optimistic than previously.    This optimism was confirmed by the present state of export order books.   It was truethat the Government1 s policy depended crucially upon an upturn in world trade; but the truth was that Britain depended very heavilyindeed upon world trade for her economic well-being, and there was nothing the Government could do to change this: nor were we alone in this respect.    On import controls, it was arguable that not allthe leading members of the TUC were equally wedded to such apolicy, but they were no doubt anxious to find some means of gettinground the balance of payments constraints.    It was extremely doubtful whether import controls on the scale suggested would produce the employment effects for which the TUC hoped.   import controls would certainly drive up the cost of living, and any attemptto use them ran the serious risk of a crushing retaliation from othercountries which would completely nullify any benefit they mighthave.    However, there was much to be said for a full and searchingdiscussion of the arguments for and against the use of import controls,among Ministers and with the TUC, as well as with the national executive Committee of the Labour Party (NEC); the joint meeting between the Government and the NEC in the near future would be amost important occasion for this purpose.    The anxieties of the tuc and others on this issue must be treated as a serious element in the formulation of policy.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had surveyed the economic background against which public expenditure Survey plans for 1976 would have to be set.    Theywere content that at this stage the guidelines for the Survey shouldbe based on the assumption that total public expenditure In theyears to 1979-80 would broadly reflect the figures which had been published in the previous month&apos;s White Paper.    The next step would be for the Cabinet to have an opportunity to discuss public expenditure priorities and thereafter to a,gr*e the guidelines tor ffee1976 Survey.    There was agreement that the question of generalImport controls must be examined in depth and the argumentsdeployed before the TUC and the NEC.5
The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.2.      Took note of the paper by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C(76) 25).3.      Agreed that at this stage the guidelines for the2 976 public expenditure Survey should be framed onthe assumption that the total expenditure up to 1979-80would broadly reflect the published figures, and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to put forwardspecific proposals on this basis.4.      Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrangefor a paper to be circulated on public expenditurepriorities.5.      Agreed that there should be collective Ministerialdiscussion of the arguments relating to import controlsand their presentation to the Trades Union congress and the National Executive Committee of the LabourParty; and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer toprepare a paper for this purpose.6
5,      The Cabinet had before mem a memorandum by the Ministerof Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (C(76) 29) on the decisions on prices under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for 1976-77which had been reached the previous week by the Council ofMinisters (Agriculture) of the European Economic Community (e.c.),THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat the meeting of the Council of Ministers had been a very longand difficult one, lasting from Tuesday 2 March until the earlyhours of Saturday 6 March.   All the Ministers present had variousnational objectives they wished to achieve, and none1 of them wouldbe satisfied with every aspect of the final package.    In his case,within the general policy set by the Ministerial Committee on european Questions (EQ) to settle for the lowest price increasesnegotiable, he had been faced with problems caused by the fall inthe value of sterling which was taking place during the course ofthe meeting.    The eec&apos;s system of monetary compensatory amounts,which acted as Community-financed subsidies on many of our food imports to oomntsrbalance the drop in the value of sterling, wouldas a result of the decline in the pound during the week cost theCommunity in the coming year  75 million in addition to the 90 million previously expected.    He had come under heavy pressure to devalue the &quot;green pound&quot; so as to reduce the level of theseCommunity subsidies, but had refused to do so.    If however, becauseof dissatisfaction with other elements in the prices package, he had broken off negotiations and resumed them the following week, he might well not have been able to resist that pressure.On individual items the introduction of fully variable premiums forbeef, equivalent to our previous system of deficiency payments, hadbeen a major break-through.    In addition the Council would considerduring the year whether the system should be more widely adoptedthroughout the Community.    In bis view the hostility to the system which he had experienced the previous year was now much reduced.On milk, target price increases averaging 6 per cent over the yearhad been agreed, which were somewhat higher than the Commission^proposals; though for the major milk producers the price&apos; increases would in fact work out at only 3 per cent for France and 2 per cent for Germany - a sharp reduction in real terms.    There would be norise in the retail price of milk in this country before 1 January 1977,and the milk subsidy would be reduced by  70 million.    In addition the Council had accepted a firm commitment to the principle ofproducer co-responsibility for milk surpluses.   These decisions would reinforce the returning confidence in the dairy sector ofBritish farming, which also provided two-thirds of our beef.    Oncereals the prices finally agreed were lower than the Commissionsproposals.    Overall the effect of the price changes agreed at themeeting would add about l  per cent to our retail food prices by theend of the year (approximately the same as the effect of the commissions original proposals), which would be additional to the7COMMONAGRICULTURALPOUCV PRICESlfH-77
1 per cent increase in prices caused by our next transitional step tothe full level of e.c. prices.    He had admittedly been attacked inthe House of Commons for agreeing to this price settlement, but many of the attacks had come from Members who would not have accepted any settlement reached in Brussels.In discussion there was general recognition that the Minister ofAgriculture had fought hard in very difficult circumstances; but theextent to which the final outcome had fallen short of our objectivesemphasised the need for a more fundamental examination both of themachinery for settling farm prices in the e.c. and of the agricultural policy which we wished the e.c. to follow.   As to the machinery,there was a marked contrast between the way in which such decisions were taken by the British Government, in which the interests of all parties involved could be advocated, and the e.c. practice, wherethe decisions were taken by the Council of Ministers (Agriculture)almost all of the members of which were solely concerned withfarming interests.   Similarly it was noted that often in this area theCommission put forward proposals advocated by the Commissionerresponsible for agriculture, even though they were resisted byCommissioners with other responsibilities.    It might be desirable for the Prime Minister to raise, at the European Council meeting on1-2 April, the question of the machinery by which these decisions were taken.    An urgent study should therefore be put in hand, forexample, of whether farm prices should be decided by Finance and agriculture Ministers meeting jointly in Council, so that the cabinet could decide during the course of its whole-day discussion ofEuropean matters planned for 26 March whether such a proposal should be put forward.   Similarly the Governments machinery for taking such decisions needed examination.    The misunderstandingthat had arisen during a telephone conversation the previous Fridaybetween the Minister of Agriculture in Brussels and the Secretary ofState for Prices and Consumer Protection in London on whether or notnegotiations were being broken off for further consideration showed the difficulties inherent in present procedures.    It might be desirable for a Minister from the Treasury or the Department of Prices and consumer Protection to be added to the British team for negotiations on farm prices.    EQ should take as precise decisions as possible onthe negotiating limits, and the circumstances in which referenceback was required.    It was noticeable that other countries were notaverse to breaking off negotiations for a period if they considered itin their national interest to do so.As to the agricultural policy we wished the e.c. to adopt, EQ had decided that these negotiations would not be a good occasion to make amag or general stand of priacjpls against those ektxmnto of the CAP whichwe found distasteful.    It had however agreed that in the autumn thereshould be a thorough review of the situation, with a view to mountingan attack on those elements in the context of the next price negotiations.At present we appeared to be losing ground gained in renegotiation,8
for example on the need to avoid the creation of surpluses and on a fundamental stocktaking of the CAP.    This trend would be hound tostrengthen feeling against the Community.    It was however pointedout that the difficulties of insisting on a CAP designed to meet ourwishes should not be under-estimated.    It would be a mistake to threaten strong action if we could not carry it through.    We had torecognise we were just one country of Nine, and that while our economy was weak our voice in Europe would be correspondinglyweak.    We needed also to be clear on our own objectives - therewas at present a certain ambivalence between our desire for foodas cheap as possible and our wish to stimulate food production from our own resources.    On the decisions reached by the Council ofMinisters (Agriculture) the previous week, it was pointed out matthe increase in food prices involved would cause difficulties in reaching agreement with the trades unions on a continued counter-inflation policy, and it might be necessary for the Government to reconsider its policy on food subsidies.    We appeared to have had topay a negotiating price to obtain a continuance of variable premiumson beef, even though we had understood that this had been agreed inrenegotiation, and it was important that we should not pay again thefollowing year.    In the milk sector we had not seized the chance ofinsisting, as had been agreed at EQ, on the need to prevent the perpetuation of arrangements which built up surpluses.    EvenMr Lardinois, the e.c. Commissioner for agriculture, had been veryworried about continuing dairy surpluses.    However, we had accepted an increase in milk prices considerably higher than theCommission had proposed, and would inevitably as a result be facedwith even bigger surpluses.THE LORD PRESIDENT, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised that the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food had negotiated under very difficult circumstances.    No-one could say that a better result was in fact negotiable, or whether hewould have been able to obtain this result if he had insisted onsuspending the negotiations while he reported back to Cabinet.However, for counter-inflation policy reasons, it was important thatthe results should be presented carefully from the consumer point ofview, and the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretary of State for prices and Consumer Protection should consult about this.    TheMinister of Agriculture should report in detail to EQ on the resultsof the negotiations, and make proposals for the handling of those matters not yet decided.   EQ should undertake an urgent study of thequestion of the Community^ machinery for deciding farm prices, andreport to Cabinet,    The Committee should also pursue in the autumnits further study of the stocktaking of the CAP.    It would be desirable for EQ to be as precise as possible about negotiating limits whengiving guidance to negotiations about farm prices, and the extent towhich reference back might be required.9

LIMITED CIRCULATION annex cc(76) 9th Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday 11 March 1976 at 10, 30 amRULING THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he wished toemphasise to his colleagues that none of them should make any public comments whatsoever on the exchange rate without priorclearance from him of what they wished to say; and he would preferthem to avoid any reference to the exchange rate at all.   In view ofthe events of the last few days in the exchange market, he was preparing a brief comment which the Prime Minister might include in his speech to the House of Commons that afternoon.   Since thedecision to introduce a floating exchange rate in 1972, the Governmenthad not intervened in the market to try to counteract movementswhich genuinely arose from such economic circumstances as thefaster rate of inflation in the United Kingdom than in other countries.Intervention had been confined to smoothing what otherwise wouldhave been erratic movements.   As a result, the sterling exchange rate had moved down over the last four years; but since last november, because of the success of the  6 pay limit and thereduction in the rate of inflation, the rate had remained virtuallyunchanged until the previous week. On Thursday 4 March the Bankof England had sold some sterling to smooth the market, and this,combined with an unfounded rumour that Nigeria was selling hersterling, led the market to conclude that the Government was trying tobring the rate down.    This view was reinforced on Friday 5 March,when the Minimum Lending Rate was reduced by one-quarter per cent(a change which it was beyond the power of the Government to preventafter lunchtime on Thursday).   The reports on the British economyon Monday by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation andDevelopment that the sterling rate would need to fall, and on Tuesdayby the National Institute for Economic and Social Research that the pound should be depreciated by 5 per cent, had exacerbated theunsettled state of the markets, although he thought that their effect was now spent.   Since Thursday 4 March the pound had suffered adepreciation of around 4 per cent; and although some would argue that there were advantages in a movement of this kind, the stabilisation of the market in sterling had cost a considerable sum from the reserves.It had to be remembered that a 5 per cent fall in the rate added some&quot;thing like 1 per cent to the Retail Price Index,    However, the1DOCUMENT ZS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government copy NO        3 cabinet
Treasury^ forecast had assumed a fall in the rate of this order,and as long as there was no further slide there would be no need to amend the forecasts.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.Cabinet Office11 March 19762
