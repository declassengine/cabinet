1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons during the following week.2.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the Mozambique Foreign Minister, Mr Chissano, in his talk with the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs,Mr Ennals, had asked for an interest free loan of  5 million fromthe United Kingdom together with technical assistance.    He had proposed that a British aid mission should go out to Mozambique:and had given an assurance that any aid we provided would be usedfor peaceful purposes.   In the United Nations we had been co-sponsors of the resolution on aid for Mozambique which had beenadopted.   Our Permanent Representative to the United Nations,Mr Richard, had shown considerable skill in avoiding the dangerof a separate political resolution on Mozambique which we could have found embarrassing.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that hehad received a personal message from President Kaunda ofZambia to the effect that while the Zambians had earlier supportednegotiations for majority rule they had now to fall back on thesecond option for attaining the same objective, namely armedstruggle; but it also made it clear that if we thought that therewas still time to reach a peaceful solution it was for us to work for it.   He felt that the prospects were gloomy but he did not altogether rule out the possibility mat below the surface ofrigidity there could be a crack in the White Rhode sian s1 resistance to majority rule.    He was awaiting a definitive reply from president Kaunda and President Nyerere of Tanzania to his proposal that at the right moment the four African Presidents)and Her Majesty&apos;s Government acting jointly might put forwardcomprehensive proposals for a settlement.
&quot;Sola THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that,following a demarche which the Prime Minister and he had madeto the Soviet Ambassador, Mr Lunkov, about the situation in southern Africa, the latter had yesterday brought him a message from his Government approved by Mr Brezhnev and the Politburo,This must be treated as extremely confidential at this stage but it contained a five point plan communicated by the Government ofAngola, designed td permit the South African Government towithdraw their forces from the Cunene Dam, with suitableguarantees for the latter&apos;s safety.    Mr Lunkov had suggested thatwe might wish to consider conveying a message on these lines to theSouth African Government.    The situation whereby the Soviet Unionacted as the channel of communication with the Angolan Governmentand the United Kingdom as the channel with the South african government was not one which he much liked.    Nevertheless he had thought it right to pass on the message to the South african government and he had advised them strongly to seize this opportunity to complete the withdrawal of their forces from Angola.He very much hoped they would accept this advice.    If so, therewould no doubt have to be arrangements for simultaneous publicity to be given to their withdrawal and to the Angolan guarantees.    In a wider context he was greatly encouraged by this development as evidence that the Soviet Union Btill wished to pursue a policy ofdetente.    In the face of the semi-hysteria on mis subject which was developing in the United States during this election year, he regarded it as important that the United Kingdom should do allpossible to sustain a calmer atmosphere.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.3.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary (C(76) 33) inviting them to endorseconclusions reached by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committeeon future policy on the Falkland Islands,THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that a difficult choice of policy on the Falkland Islands had now to be faced.We had earlier decided not to recognise the long-standingArgentinian claim to sovereignty over the Islands.   In this we hadthe full support of the very small population of the Islands, whowere of British stock, proud of their links with the United Kingdomand completely dependent on us for their defence.    Since February1974 we had sought to engage the Argentine Government in discussions which would divert them from pressing their claim onsovereignty.    In 1975 we had offered talks on British-Argentinian2falklandNds
economic co-operation including the joint development of economic resources around the Falkland Islands.    In December there hadbeen signs that this approach might succeed.    The then ForeignMinister in the Argentine Government had shown interest, andhad suggested adding Argentine personnel to the team which wasto make an economic survey of the Falklands under Lord S hackle ton&apos;sleadership.    But subsequently, following a change of ForeignMinister, the Argentinians had backed off and had refused to talk about economic co-operation unless we agreed to talk aboutsovereignty.    They had not allowed Lord S hackle ton&apos;s mission topass through Argentinian territory; and in February they had madea premeditated attempt to stop the unarmed Royal Research ShipShackleton on the high seas, during which they had fired Bhots overher and across her bows.    There was now a real risk of further action against us by the very unstable Argentine Government.This could take the form of occupation or blockade of the Islands;or short of that there was a range of other options open to Argentina,which would be damaging to our interests.    As one example, valuableshipbuilding orders were at stake.We had reached a point, therefore, where we must reconsider our policy.    We could decide to stand firm and face the consequences.But in that event the risk of determined Argentinian action againstthe Islands must be accepted, and to counter it a substantialmilitary and naval force would be needed.    The alternative was tomove some way towards meeting the Argentine claim without prejudicing the Islanders1 wish to remain British.    He would start this process by sending the Argentine Foreign Minister Senor Quijado,a personal message proposing that the two Governments should starta fresh dialogue to cover all aspects of the Falkland Islands dispute,including the possibility of British-Argentinian economic co-operation and the nature of a hypothetical future constitutional relationship between the Falkland Islands and Argentina.    Rather than acondominion,  which the Conservative Administration had considered,he had in mind the possibility of a leaseback solution.    these discussions would be without prejudice to either Government&apos;eposition on sovereignty over the Islands.    The Defence and oversea Policy Committee had favoured this approach.    Itsdifficulties should not be underestimated.    We would have to takeclose account of the Islanders&apos; interests and consultations with them would have to be handled carefully.    There would be fiercecriticism in Parliament and elsewhere if the initiative went wrong.But the alternative was distinctly unpalatable.   If we stood firm and Argentina struck against the Falkland Islands, we would haveto undertake a major and continuing military commitment or accepthumiliation.*3
If the Cabinet endorsed the approach favoured by the Defence and oversea Policy Committee, he must ask for maximum discretionon timing.    Timing was dependent on a number of factors.    these included the General Election to be held in the Falkland Islands inMay.    But many were unpredictable at this stage.    He thought it possible that we could play the discussions long; in the past theArgentinians had shown themselves satisfied with protracted andinconclusive talks.    The Opposition spokesman on foreign affairs,Mr Maudling, had recently asked to discuss the Falkland Islandswith him.    He had given him on a Privy Counsellor basis a general indication of the line of action he was now proposing to the Cabinet.Mr Maudling had not dissented, but there was no certainty that theOpposition as a whole would take the same view,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that our garrison in the Falklands Islands, consisting of no more than a force of37 marines, would be quite unable to withstand a determinedArgentinian assault.   Nor could a sudden Argentine move againstthe Islands be countered by reinforcement.   Apart from south american airfields, which would be denied to us, the nearest usableairfield was over 3, 000 miles away at Ascension Island.    There was an airstrip at Port Stanley but this was short and had only the mostrudimentary facilities.    To defend or recapture the Islands in the face of the efficient Argentinian navy would require a brigade group,some 5, 000 strong, supported by a naval force which would have toinclude HMS Ark Royal to provide air cove r.    The view of theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee was that we should not bedrawn into a major and costly military commitment of this kind,which would involve a very large diversion of forces from theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation.hi discussion it was argued that a message offering talks aboutsovereignty might be interpreted by the Argentine Government asa sign of weakness and a loss of will on our part to protect theinterests of the Islanders.    This interpretation might itselfencourage the Argentinians to make a physical move against the falkland Islands.    Moreover there could be repercussions in gibraltar and Belize,    Pressure on our position there could growif we were seen to be contemplating concessions on the falkland islands.   Nor were we yet cleat about the value of the Islands1economic potential.    Rather than commit ourselves now todiscussions with Argentina on sovereignty, it might be preferable to await the report of Lord ShackletonJs mission and then make a considered assessment of the effect on our interests of the alternative courses of action open to us.On the other hand it was pointed out that the danger of a physical moveby Argentina against the Falkland Islands was an immediate one.    Wewere also in difficulty at the United Nations where the argentine government would have a fresh opportunity of pressing their case4
against us later in the month.    It was true that the presentArgentine Government was precarious but no successor to it could afford to adopt a more conciliatory attitude on the Falkland Islandsissue.    If a confrontation with Argentina was to be avoided, therewas no practicable alternative to talks on the lines proposed by theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary.    These would be in confidence and with luck their content would not become known forsome time.    They would involve no sacrifice of our economic interests since it bad long been accepted that the potential oil resources around the Falkland Islands could be exploited only inco-operation with Argentina.    It was noted that the question of extending the airfield at Port Stanley was to be considered by theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee and that the positions of theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary, the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister for Overseas Development were reservedon Ais matter,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that,although recognising the difficulty of the choice before them, theCabinet approved the proposals put forward by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary,    Both the discussions with the argentine government and the consultations with the Islanders would requirevery careful handling; it was therefore essential to maintain secrecyuntil the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary was ready to move.The Cabinet agreed that the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary should have discretion on the timing of each step.    They noted thatthe extension of the airfield at Port Stanley was to be considered further by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee,The Cabinet -1, Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.2,        Invited the Foreign and commonwealth secretary to proceed accordingly.5
4.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal (C(76) 28) containing proposals for discussions with theNational Staff Side on a closed shop for the Civil Service,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that since the rejection by the Cabineton 12 February of his recommendation that the issue of a closed shop for the Civil Service should be referred to a committee ofenquiry a Ministerial Group, under the Prime Minister1 chairmanship, had considered what line the Government shouldtake, as employer, in discussions with the Staff Side,    This hadnarrowed, but not removed, the area of disagreement between ministers,    The attitude of the unions was set out in the Annex tohis memorandum: the Civil and Public Services Association (CPSA)and the Society of Civil Servants (SCS) were the only unions to be committed to a closed shop; the remaining unions were either not committed or lukewarm; but all were agreed on the need to eliminate the &quot;free rider&quot; problem.    Recent legislation had madeclosed shops legal and the Government therefore, as an employer,had a duty to discuss the issue with the unions.    Union membershipagreements could be of a very rigid or a very loose kind.    In Msview, however, it would not be acceptable to the Civil Service or to public opinion generally for the Government to accept an agreement which entailed dismissal from the Civil Service for non-membership of a union.    The &quot;free rider&quot; problem, on the other hand, was onewhich it was in the Governments interest to resolve since It was desirable that the Civil Service unions should be financially sound and well-organised.   At present 20 per cent of civil servants did notbelong to a union, and mis involved a loss of  1.3 million in annualrevenues for the Civil Service unions as a whole.    He therefore proposed that a working party of the Official and Staff Sides shouldbe set up to consider, without commitment, possible solutions tomis problem and that, to avoid misleading the Staff Side, theGovernment should make clear from the outset that an agreementInvolving compulsory membership of unions would be unacceptable.He believed that the unions were more concerned with revenue than with membership and that they would be ready to engage in discussions on this basis.In discussion it was argued that it would be a serious mistake, bomtactically and In terms of the Governments overall policy on unionmembership agreements, to rule out in advance any particular formof agreement.    The Governments legislation allowed for greatflexibility in the framing of union membership agreements so matthey could provide for a wide variety of safeguards and exclusions,including the right to resign from a union on a point of principle which in itself could amount to an objection to union membership assuch.    If a particular form of agreement were ruled out from the start, tills would create great hostility In the CPSA, which was an6
important union from the point of view of the Government&apos;8transactions generally, and would place the moderate leadershipin a much more difficult position than was necessary.    TheGovernment1 a initial stance in the discussion should therefore belimited to a statement of the special factors which applied to theCivil Service, of the flexibility which the legislation allowed andof the need for very full and adequate safeguards in any arrangements which might be finally agreed.    On the other hand,it was argued that the question of compulsory membership raisedan important constitutional principle and that to allow discussionof a form of agreement which the Government were unlikely toaccept would be both misleading and likely to prejudice the positionof the moderates.    Some doubt was also expressed whether thefigures for non-member ship of unions were as large as appearedfrom the Whitley Council Bulletin which was the source of theinformation provided in the Annex to the Lord Privy SeaUsmemorandum.In further discussion there was a considerable measure ofagreement that the question whether to rule out compulsorymembership of a union from the outset of the discussions was essentially one of tactics.   At the end of the day the Cabinet mightwell decide against compulsory membership and at some point inthe discussions with the Staff Side the Governments position onthis question should be specifically reserved.    But the timing ofthis reservation should be left to the Governments negotiators,and there might be advantage in delaying it until the initial attitudesof the Staff Side representatives could be properly assessed.    Itwas also generally agreed that no useful purpose would be served by informing the Opposition of the Governments proposals for a working party since, in the light of their antagonism to theGovernments industrial legislation generally, the opposition might well adopt a public attitude which would prejudice theGovernments ability to arrive at a solution which fell short of compulsory membership.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that themajority of the Cabinet clearly felt that a solution involvingcompulsory union membership was unlikely to be acceptable.    Onthe other hand It would be tactically wrong to take a totally rigidline with the National Staff Side.    The reply to the latter should therefore say that a closed or union shop raised special problems for the Civil Service on which the Government must reserve their position.    They sympathised however with the Staff Side&apos;s concern about the problem of &quot;free riders&quot; and were ready to set up a working party at official level to investigate, without commitment on either side, the various ways of solving or minimising this.7
In the light of the working party S discussions the Lord Privy Sealwould make recommendations to the Cabinet on which a finaldecision could be taken.    The Cabinet were agreed that, in themeantime, no useful purpose would be served by informing theOpposition of the Governments proposals for a working party.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theLord Privy Seal to proceed accordingly.^OGRESS 5.        The Cabinet considered a note by the Chancellor of theJ^PORT ON Exchequer (C(76) 32) to which was attached a second progress report by the Chief Secretary, Treasury on the state of the contingency       Contingency Reserve.*SSErvej, THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that he was presentingf**vious a second report on the state of the Contingency Reserve in^Verence: accordance with the procedure which had been agreed by Cabinet?*(76) 6th on 5 February,    The first of the two tables annexed to his report^elusions dealt with the situation for the year 1976-77, and the secondj^ute 7 covered the whole period to 1979-80.    The Contingency reserve for 1976-77 published in the latest public expenditure White Paperamounted to  700 million at 1975 Survey prices, or  875 million at 1976-77 outturn prices: his further proposals were calculated on the latter basis.    So far, firm agreement had been reached onclaims against the Contingency Reserve for 1976-77 amounting to 132 million.    Further claims,     which he considered should beagreed would add another  167 million; this meant that 299 million of the Reserve for 1976-77 would now be committed.Against the remaining balance of  576 million there were alreadyfirm bids and other claims totalling  600- 630 million, which wasup to  54 million more than the provision which had been made inthe White Paper published only the previous month.    It wasnecessary to bear in mind that, other things being equal, anyexcess expenditure beyond the total of the Contingency Reservewould entail an addition either to taxation or to the borrowing requirement.    There was also an important political andpresentational aspect to the management of the Contingency Reserve.In the recent proceedings of the Expenditure Committee, he had come under strong pressure to report regularly on progress inmanaging the Reserve.    If the Governments performance in thisrespect was being kept under close public scrutiny, it was essentialthat they should not be discredited by over-commitment so soon after publication of the White Paper.    If there was any serious8
prospect of this, he would have no alternative but to inviteMinisters to consider how to correct the situation by curtailingexpenditure on particular programmes.    Moreover, if the Budgetprovisions implied higher spending in 1976-77 than was allowed for in the White Paper, this would mean that some claims wouldhave to be dropped.    He wished to draw the Cabinet&apos;a attentionto the difficulties that could arise from certain open-endedprogrammes such .:r: that on council house building: these mighthave to be reviewed at some later date.THE PRIME MlNISTEK, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet approved the additional claims on the contingency reserve for 1976-77 set out in paragraph 3 of the Chief Secretary&apos;sreport.    They note^l -vith concern the scale of the prospectivedemands on the Ret-* rve for 1976-77 and later years.   It would benecessary for all spending Ministers to reconsider most criticallythe need for any claims they had in mind to put forward; it was essential that the maximum possible off-setting savings should befound.    One or two further claims had been mentioned in thecourse of discussion, and the Ministers concerned should referthese to the Chief Secretary.The Cabinet -1, Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion,2.        Approved the additional claims againstthe Contingency Reserve for 1976-77 listed inparagraph 3 of the Chief Secretary&apos;s report.Jj^TE PAPER       6.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChancellorCASH of the Exchequer (C(76) 31) to which was attached the text of a white Paper on cash limits for publication on Budget Day.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that the Governmenthad announced in the White Paper &quot;The Attack on Inflation&quot;(Cmnd 6151) that, starting in 1976-77, extensive use would be madeof cash limits and Departments had co-operated closely with theTreasury in setting up the arrangements which were described tothe White Paper.    It was now necessary for the Government toshow their determination to make the new control arrangementswork,    hi the White Paper the main emphasis had been placed onthe application of cash limits to the Government1 s own expenditure,and this was the area in which their performance would be most closely watched.    But the arrangements being made for the capital
programmes of the local authorities and the nationalised industries were also important to the credibility of the operation.   As to thecircumstances in which cash limitb could be changed, these were described in paragraphs 18 and 19 of the White Paper,    It was most important not to create the impression that reviews of cashlimits would be lightly undertaken or that increases would followautomatically.    But it would be unrealistic to deny that reviewsduring the course of the financial year were possible.   Anundertaking had already been given to local authorities about thecircumstances in which the cash limits on the rate support grant would be reviewed.    If nothing were said in the White Paper onthis question there would certainly be questions about It, and it seemed better therefore to include a considered statement towhich questioners could be referred.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet endorsed the White Paper in principle on cash limits,subject to some redrafting of paragraph 19.    The Chief secretary should reconsider the drafting of this paragraph to emphasise thatthe position might have to be reviewed if the rate of inflation werehigher or lower than had been assumed: there might also be some reference to fee fact that since this was the first attempt tointroduce cash limits, adjustments might be needed because ofother unforeseen difficulties.    The last sentence of the paragraphdid not seem to be wholly appropriate and should be omitted oramended.The Cabinet -1. Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion,2.        Approved the publication on Budget Dayof the text of the White Paper attached to theChancellor of the Exchequers memorandum,subject to the proposed redrafting ofparagraph 19.Cabinet Office18 March 197610
