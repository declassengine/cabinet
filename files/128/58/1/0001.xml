CABINETPROCEDUREL. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the record of the present government in relation to leaks had earlier been good, but in the weeks immediately preceding Christmas there had been numerousand detailed Press reports about discussions in Cabinet and in cabinet committees, including disclosure of the positions adoptedby individual Ministers.    This was the first meeting of the Cabinetsince Christmas; but in the intervening period there had beensimilar reports of an informal meeting of Ministers which he hadchaired.   Some of the leaks appeared beyond doubt to have beenspecific and deliberate.    One result had been to render much moredifficult the Parliamentary position of the Prime Minister himself,particularly when answering Questions, and of the ministers responsible for handling specific items of business.    Even more serious was the general harm which had been done to theGovernments standing in the country by the creation of a misleading impression that there were serious and acrimonious differences between colleagues - an impression which had distracted attention from the very real divisions of opinion which currently existedwithin the Conservative Party.    In the present difficultParliamentary situation these leaks, if continued, could have very grave consequences for the Government,   All Ministers should therefore exercise the greatest self-restraint in talking to thePress and should take care to avoid any further leaks of this kind.The Cabinet -Tock note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement.ftRlJAMENTARY2,        The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.    It was noted that the speaker intended, at the end of the debate on Devolution on19 January, to call two of the amendments on the Order Paper -those put down by the Conservative Party and by the Scottish and welsh Nationalists - rather than one as was usual, and that theprocedural Motion which was needed to enable this to be done had accordingly been tabled.corde;8e Limit,It was reported that an announcement was to be made that afternoon in the House of Commons by the Secretary of State for trade indicating that Concorde was to be exempted for an indefinite period from the normal requirements as to noise limits for aircraft at Heathrow.    Exemption was essential if Concorde was to operatefrom London Airport legally; if the normal limits were not lifted
any interested individual or organisation would be able to go to thecourts for an injunction.    The announcement might however giverise to considerable public outcry - the Noise Advisory council would be particularly disturbed - and appreciable damage mightbe done to the Governments otherwise good standing on thegeneral question of environmental pollution.    The aspect of theproposed announcement which would cause most concern was thatthe noise limits were to be removed without any limit of time.The matter was arguably of sufficient importance to have called for a collective decision following discussion by the Cabinet, or at least by a Cabinet committee.    The original proposal, about which there had been an exchange of correspondence between ministers, had been to give exemption initially for a limited periodof three or twelve months; the decision to give permanent exemptionhad been taken only on the previous day, following urgentrepresentations from our Embassies in Washington and Paris,and without some of the Ministers with relevant responsibilitiesbeing consulted or informed in advance.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatwhile the urgency of the matter was clear, there appeared to havebeen inadequate advance inter-Ministerial consultation on a subject which was of considerable practical and presentational importance.The Secretaries of State for the Environment, Industry and trade should accordingly meet very urgently, under the chairmanship ofthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, in order to review theterms of the proposed announcement about the relaxation of noiselimits in relation to Concorde.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to proceed accordingly.2
1&apos;0REIGN 3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said-FFAlRs that, as in the past, the attitude of the Argentine Government onthe Falkland Islands issue was hardening as their economic^lkland Islands      situation deteriorated.    He had been trying to induce them todiscuss economic co-operation for which there were considerabledevious opportunities especially over fishing and oil exploration.-reference* Simultaneously he had been trying to convince the Islanders, with&apos;C(75J some degree of success, that their long-term interest requiredinclusions co-operation with Argentina,    But however reasonable our position theCnute 3 fact remained thatArgentina would have the support of the whole of SouthAmerica, and a majority in the United Nations in the event of a show-down.The pretext for the Argentine Governments present hostility to us was the Economic Mission to the Falkland Islands led byLord Shackleton,    He had gone a very long way in offering to associate the Argentine Government with the Mission and had offered to make its findings available to them.    But they had flatlyrefused to discuss economic co-operation unless he would alsodiscuss sovereignty over the Islands.    For thie he had no mandatefrom the Cabinet, Parliament or the Islanders,    The first need was to get Lord Shackleton back to the United Kingdom,    It was difficult to predict how the situation would then develop: but the falkland Islands were defended only by HMS Endurance and37 Royal Marines and HMS Endurance would need to remain onstation for the time being.y***A XHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theL dispute over fishing limits with Iceland had been discussed by theI ^ous Defence and Oversea Policy (OPD) Committee on the previous day.    TheJch^061 time factor was now working against us.   It was true that underfc:   ) 50th naval protection our trawlers were catching twice as much fish aeElusions the Icelanders had offered us, but the situation would change in theiute 1 course of 1976 when additional countries would claim a 200 milefishing limit and we might wish to do so ourselves.    The secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Dr Luns, hadtaken it upon himself to mediate in the dispute.    We had publiclywelcomed his initiative, but had privately warned him that it wouldnot be enough for him to secure a reinstatement by the icelandic government of their earlier offer of a 65, 000 tons catch.    We had said that we were prepared to reduce our catch to well below100, 000 tons to achieve a settlement, but the Icelandic government must also move on their figure.   If Dr Luns&apos; mediation provedineffective it might be advisable to seek collective action by theEuropean Economic Community to resolve the dispute; indeed theCommunity was already involved because of Protocol 6.    Theimmediate need was to find a way of getting genuine negotiationsre-opened, but the OPD Committee would be resuming its considerationof the negotiating position we should now adopt.3
The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.northern ireland previous reference:CC(75) 4fcthConclusionsMinute Z4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN ireland said that he proposed to issue the text of his letter to the Chairmanof the Constitutional Convention, which had been agreed with theMinisters concerned, as a White Paper.    The text followedclosely the lines of his speech to the House of Commons on12 January.   Although it was normal practice for Cabinet toconsider White Papers paragraph by paragraph, he hoped thatthe process could be waived in these circumstances.    There was some chance of progress in the Convention over the next six weeksbut he could not rate that chance highly.   He had had usefuldiscussions with the outgoing United States Ambassador,Mr Richardson, who was ready to help us to secure a better understanding of the Northern Ireland situation in his country:this might help towards diminishing the flow of arms from theUnited States to Northern Ireland.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Secretaryof State for Northern Ireland and approved theissue of the White Paper on the NorthernIreland Convention.4
IEw OF 50        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the^parliamentary    Lord President of the Council (C(76) 1) containing proposals for0CEDURE a review of the practice and procedure of Parliament,THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that his proposals were put forward against a background of increasing dissatisfaction with the way in which Parliament operated.    Members were drivenvery hard, long hours were worked, and recesses were short,allowing Members insufficient time with their families.    Therewas great pressure on Parliamentary time: debates on european economic Community (e.c.) matters were now taking upconsiderable time; it was difficult to fit in general debates; and,despite all efforts, the present Session was now becoming over-loaded.    New and able younger Members were frustrated by whatthey saw as the absence of a sufficiently constructive role.    Unlessradical changes were made there was a danger of Parliament falling into increasing disrepute.    He accordingly proposed that thereshould be an early one-day debate, on a Motion for the Adjournment,which would provide an opportunity for the House to express itsviews on the subject as a whole, without any commitment being undertaken by the Government,    hi the light of that debate, hewould formulate firm proposals and bring them before colleagues.He did not think that the review could or should be prevented fromconsidering sensitive areas, such as relations between parliament and Government and the possibility of a pre-legislative role forbackbenchers; no review could be described as radical whichexcluded such matters.    But he would make clear in debate thatany Government must be able to govern and to get their businessthrough.    He proposed to float the idea that there might be a minority of outsiders on the Committee, for which the Compton,Renton and Mikardo Committees provided recent precedents.    Ifthe House of Lords set up a similar Committee, there might be some points of common interest which could be discussed jointly.The review would take some time, but the Committee might submitinterim reports with specific proposals for improvements.    he saw his proposals as one of a number of recent moves to improvedemocracy in this country, which included the Houghton Committee,the devolution proposals, the referendum and the machinery for parliamentary scrutiny of e.c. proposals.In discussion general support was expressed for the proposal thatthere should be a review of Parliamentary procedure.   It was nevertheless suggested that in fact Parliament worked well -Mr Eliott Richardson, the retiring United States Ambassador, forexample, had been impressed by the working of the House ofCommons and its relations with the Government, which in his viewcontrasted favourably with the position in the United States - andradical changes might not be necessary.    Moreover, the history5
of past attempts at improving procedures would justify somescepticism about the likely outcome of a further review.    Thegeneral view was however that in recent years Paxliament hadfunctioned with decreasing efficacy, as pressures of all kinds had increased, and the time was ripe for a major review of the kind proposed by the Lord President of the Council,    government decisions had become more centralised, but consultation and consent were more and more necessary to make the decisions work;Parliament formed an essential link in the system, and the way inwhich it functioned affected the whole operation of government inthe United Kingdom.    Some doubts were expressed whether a parliamentary debate should be arranged until Ministers had beenable to reach a considered view as to the membership and termsof reference of the proposed Committee.    On the other hand, itwas pointed out that there could be a very open debate, which wouldbe welcomed by backbenchers, in which the Government need enterinto no commitments.   In this debate Ihe Lord President could make clear that he was expressing a personal view in his capacity as Leader of the House,In discussion of the way in which the review should be conducted,it was emphasised that the membership of the proposed Committeewould have to be chosen with great care, with a proper balance of older and younger members; it might be for consideration whether there should be Ministerial members.    On the one hand there wassupport for the proposal that some members should be chosenfrom outside Parliament, and the point was made that the review should take account of how Parliament appeared to the outside world.   On the other hand it was suggested that outside members were likely to be theorists, whereas the need was for a Committeeof MPs experienced in the practical workings and the psychologyof the House,    The idea of bringing in outsiders was likely to be criticised in the House, and it might be preferable to go no further than provide an opportunity for outsiders to express views to theCommittee,   It would be important to consult the other Partiesbefore the debate, since no reforms of procedure, however useful,would work unless they were accepted by the Opposition.   Ameeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party might also be desirable.Arrangements for giving Government evidence to the Committeewould need consideration later, as would the content of any evidence.Discussion by a group of Ministers might be useful before concreteproposals for the review were put to the Cabinet,hi further discussion, the following aspects of parliamentary procedure were mentioned as being in particular need of review:6
a. Hours of work and recesses - in particular, detailed and open-ended Report Stages of Bills after 10 pm, oftenrepeating debates in Committee, and recesses which prevented younger Members with families, especiallyScottish Members, from enjoying proper holidays withtheir families,,b. The legislative process and the pressure of thelegislative programme, including the possibility of automatic timetables for all Bills - which might usefullyform the subject of an interim report.c. The division of business between the floor of theHouse and Committees, and the growing Committee structure and the development of the work of Select Committees, withthe resultant pressure on the time of MPs and devaluationof debate on the floor.d. The impact of the arrangement of parliamentary business on the operation of the Government, and inparticular on the timetables of Ministers who had also toattend Ministerial meetings and deal with the business oftheir Departments.e. The size of the House, one of the largest legislaturesin the world, which might be one cause of frustration amongbackbenchers.f. The fact, which was causing growing anger, that only  j per cent of MPs, compared with 51 per cent of thepopulation, were women, so that the House was in thisrespect totally unrepresentative and failed to take accountof women&apos;s problems.It was also pointed out that some kinds of new arrangementeg pre-legislation Committees, might cause substantial additional work for Ministers and officials.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that a debate should now be arranged as proposedby the Lord President.    In that debate, the latter should make clear that he was speaking in his capacity as Leader of the House,and thus be free to put forward personal ideas without committing the Government; but he would of course have regard to theGovernments interests and the need to get the Governmentsbusiness through.   Any members of the Cabinet with ideas whichthey thought the Lord President might canvass in the debate shouldmake them known to him.   After the debate specific proposals for7
the conduct of the review should be brought back for considerationby the Cabinet, perhaps after prior examination by a ministerial group or committee.    If the House of -Lords decided to set up asimilar Committee, its work would have to be co-ordinated withthat of the House of Commons Committee.   In handling House ofLords aspects of the review, care should be taken to avoid giving any impression that the existing composition and powers of the lords should be regarded as permanent.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister, and invited the Lord President of the Council to be guided accordingly.8
efencependitureeference:C(?5) 55thon elusions,ute 26. THE DEFENCE SECRETARY said that he had been askedto examine the practicability and consequences of reducing thedefence budget in 1978-79 by  175 million more than the 100 million he had earlier offered, without impairing the critical Level of our contribution to the North Atlantic treaty organisation (NATO) or defaulting on our obligations under the brussels Treaty,    These savings would of course be additional tothe savings agreed in the 1974 Defence Review and the further cut of  136 million for 1976-77 announced in the pre vious year.Accordingly he had carried out a major re-examination item byitem of the whole of our defence support expenditure.   his conclusion was that with great difficulty he could achieve savings of  175 million in all.    This assumed  50 million in German offsetpayments and took account of  8^ million from the increaseddefence contribution agreed with the Hong Kong Government,    Inaddition to the 68, 000 jobs to be cut by 1979 under the defence review, his present proposals would involve a reduction of afurther 18, 000 jobs, making 86, 000 in all.    These reductions would inevitably result in intense feelings of annoyance and frustrationamong Ministry of Defence staffs, coming as they did on top of proposals for dispersal to Scotland and elsewhere which werehighly unpopular.    Furthermore since the Defence Review theMinistry of Defence had met extra commitments in Belize andIceland and might soon have to do so in the Falkland Islands: wehad been unable to withdraw from Cyprus as he would have liked:and the Northern Ireland situation had worsened, the extra cost of 45 million being borne on the Defence Budget in contrast to theposition before the Defence Review,    His offer of  175 millionfurther savings represented a detailed itemisation of what wouldbe involved even though mere was no military justification for anyfurther cuts.    To go beyond this would not only involve muchgreater industrial and employment consequences but would very considerably increase the problem with our NATO allies.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he deeplyresented the series of newspaper leaks which had been damaging to the Government and to the party.    He considered it untenablethat the United Kingdom should spend much more of its gross national Product (GNP) on defence than most of her allies.    Thiscalled for a re-examination of the Critical Level of our contributionto NATO: but he accepted that this could not be done in the time available.   A decision had therefore to be taken on the basis ofour existing defence role.    On that basis he accepted mat theDefence Secretary could not find the  400 million he had originallysought and that it might even be impossible to get all of the 275 million savings suggested in the previous Cabinet discussion.The Defence Secretary had however never sought to argue thatthere was a narrowly definable point at which marginal savings in
defence expenditure produced military and political effects of a quite disproportionate order.    The figure for Defence savingshad to be seen in the context of the global reduction in public expenditure which the Cabinet had sought.   If the Defence secretary had found  275 million and if all other Departments accepted theTreasury case on the number of small items still outstanding,the total saving achieved would have been  3, 582 million, whichwas still less than the  3, 750 million for which he had asked.He could not however be sure of achieving agreement on all the outstanding small items.    Presentationally it was essential toshow global reductions of at least  3, 500 million, or 3, 000 million if it was decWed not to show for the present the agreed savings resulting from the change in the social securityuprating arrangements.   Arithmetically, this meant a 193 million contribution from defence savings but that gave nolatitude for shortfalls elsewhere and was in any case an undulyprecise figure.    He must therefore press for a Defence saving of at least  200 million and he personally thought that a saving of  225 million was possible.    In addition he must make twoprovisos.    The first was that the level of defence expenditure in1978-79 must be continued unchanged into 1979-80 and that1977-78 figures should be achieved mid-way between the 1976-77and 1978-79 figures.    The second was that if it proved impossibleto get as much as  50 million in offset payments from theFederal Republic of Germany, compensating savings must befound from within the Defence Budget.   Agreement on the latter point was not only essential financially, but would increase thestrength of our bargaining position in the offset talks with theGerman Government.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe public expenditure savings already achieved were most satisfactory and that he would prefer not to make any reductionin defence expenditure.    To do so within the limits proposed bythe Defence Secretary might not make a significant actualdifference to our contribution to NATO, but the fact that furthercuts were being made could lead to a different perception by our allies, in particular the Americans and the Germans, of our defence contribution.    We were taking our decision at a time whenSoviet strength was growing and when we were perhaps seeing a soviet movement to a new strategy, with less reliance on nuclearstrength and more on conventional arms.    It was not so much that further cuts would cause us to be judged an unreliable ally as thatthey might lead to a different perception of our contribution.Nevertheless he recognised that, despite his personal preference,there would have to be a defence contribution to the public expenditure savings, but attached importance to the figure chosenbeing under  200 million since exceeding this figure could have a disproportionate symbolic effect upon our allies.10
THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that a defencesaving as low as  200 million would be seen as a hopelesslyinadequate contribution to an overall reduction of  3, 500 million in public expenditure.    The savings on equipment proposed bythe Defence Secretary were derisory, amounting to only  4 million for the Army and  7 million for the Royal Air Force.    The figureof 18, 000 jobs used by the Defence Secretary was misleading.   Infact only 10, 000 jobs would be lost; the other 8, 000 were jobswhich would have become available if equipment were ordered.A reduction of 10, 000 jobs meant a cut of under 4 per cent and thefinancial effects of this cut were included in the savings proposedby the Defence Secretary, whereas other Departments were being required to cut staff by 8 per cent on top of their expenditure cutsalready agreed.    Given the likelihood of some shortfalls onsavings by other Departments not yet settled, he argued for a defence saving of at least  225 million followed by a furtherDefence Review at a later stage.In discussion it was argued that the savings offered by the defence secretary would fall far short of ths Party*s expectationsparticularly in the light of the cuts being made in the social services.    We had been overstretched in defence expenditure over the last two decades and this was largely responsible forour disappointing economic performance.    It would thus be unreasonable for our allies to criticise us if we made furthersignificant reductions.    Our standing in the world would dependmore on the economic transformation that was required man ona specific level of contribution to NATO.On the other hand it was argued that the consequences of defencecuts for employment must be kept in mind.   Even the savingsidentified as acceptable by the Defence Secretary would mean a loss of some 3, 200 industrial jobs.    To go further would causevery severe problems in particular industries, especiallyshipbuilding and electronics, the effect of which would be feltquickly.    Many of the jobs lost would be in politically sensitiveareas with poor chances for redeployment.   In considering theParty&apos;s reaction it had also to be remembered that at the time ofthe 1974 Manifestos the Party had been more optimistic about thesituation in Northern Ireland than had turned out to be justified:this alone put considerable extra costs on the defence budget.    Inabsolute terms our defence expenditure was below that of Franceand Germany and we were in danger of ceasing to be even asecond class NATO power.    If Germany became the single biggestEuropean contributor to the Alliance this could upset the politicalbalance in Central Europe and reawaken Soviet suspicions ofGerman resurgence.11
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe preponderant view was that defence savings should be keptbelow  200 million.    On the other hand there was a measure Oisupport for the argument that  175 million were insufficient.The Defence Secretary should therefore find savings of 193 million.    Careful thought would be required in the next month on how this decision should be presented, both domesticallyand internationally.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.12
7, The Cabinet had before them the Report of the Committeeof Privy Counsellors (the Radcliffe Committee) on MinisterialMemoirs.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Report of the RadcliffeCommittee dealt with two main aspects - the conventions whichshould govern the publication of memoirs by ex-Ministers andthe arrangements for securing their observance.    On the firsttopic, the Committee*s recommendations were largely concernedwith formalising and making more precise the conventions whichhad been developed and applied by successive Secretaries of theCabinet.    Their most significant new proposal was that it shouldbe overtly recognised that in relation to confidential relationships between Ministers and between Ministers and officials thereshould be a watershed     15 years after the events in question.Up to that time information affecting the views of other people should be regarded as confidential and onus of proof for anydisclosure should rest on the writer.    Subsequently the onus ofproof would be reversed.    On enforcement, the committee proposed that observance of the conventions should be left to the writer as a matter of honour, and specifically found against new legislation creating a series of criminal offences.    particular problems would arise in this area over the publication of memoirsand diaries after the author&apos;s death.    The Report had beenconsidered by a representative group of senior Ministers under his chairmanship.    Their view had been that, bearing in mind that the Report was a thorough and carefully considered documentprepared by an unusually strong committee with seniorrepresentatives from both the main political Parties, the right course would be to accept its recommendations in full and withoutamendment.    On that basis he proposed that the Report should bepublished in the early part of the following week and that he shouldmake a simultaneous announcement indicating the Government&apos;acceptance of the recommendations.    Ministers would Subsequentlyneed to consider a number of subsidiary issues, particularly inrelation to machinery - for example, whether it would be useful,in dealing with manuscripts which had been submitted to theSecretary of the Cabinet, for the Prime Minister to be advised bya group of Privy Counsellors.In discussion it was argued that, while at a rapid reading theReport seemed acceptable, several Ministers had not had time to study it as fully as it deserved.    There also appeared to be severalwider Issues which were not dealt with in the Report but ought tobe considered - for example, the right point for striking a balance between the need to preserve confidentiality in the interests ofgood government and the need to make information available in theinterests of an informed public opinion; and the relative importance port of^ radcliffe&apos;0mmittee
of the convenience of Ministers on the one hand and the need foropen government on the other.    On the other hand it was pointedout that the Report dealt with the publication of accounts of events which had happened within a confidential relationship in the past,and that the question of open government in the future wasspecifically referred to in paragraph 101.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that itwas important to publish the Report without delay.    The majorityof the Cabinet seemed disposed to endorse the view of the ministerial Group that its recommendations should be accepted.Nevertheless he wished all his colleagues to have adequate timeto consider it.    If any member of the Cabinet then wished to lethim have further observations, he should do so urgently by minute.If it appeared that further discussion by the Cabinet was necessaryhe would arrange this on the following Tuesday; but if there was general agreement with the view of the Ministerial Group he would arrange for early publication, with a simultaneous announcementof the Governments decision to accept the Report,The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office15 January 197614
