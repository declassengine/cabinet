1, The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had for some time been concerned about the fact that copies of Confidential Final Revises(CFRs) of White Papers sent to the Press were reaching selectedMembers of Parliament and others before publication.    CFRswere by custom sent to the Press only so that the Press could have an opportunity of assimilating their content before publication;but following the publication in November of the White Paper onDevolution it had become apparent that some MPs, including theScottish Nationalists and Opposition Front Bench, had been givencopies of the CFR by the Press.    This had caused someresentment, particularly with backbench MPs on the Governmentside.    The issue had now arisen again in relation to the public expenditure White Paper: the leader of the Opposition had asked the Treasury for a copy of the CFR and the Prime Minister had agreed to this in view of the likelihood that a copy would in anycase have reached her from some other source.    On this occasion,however, there was a further question of principle involved in thatthe City columns of the newspapers had been reporting, up to theprevious evening, that both equity and gilt-edged markets werestagnant pending publication of the Public Expenditure White Paper.This might imply that the White Paper had, to a certain extent,become comparable with the Budget, and that money could be made out of advance knowledge of the contents.    It had to be recognisedthat the system of CFRs was for the convenience of the Government,particularly where the matter was complex and it was desirablethat reports should be accurate, as well as of the Press.    Therewas a strong case, therefore, for continuing the system but, in thelight of the circumstances surrounding the publication of the public expenditure White Paper, it was for consideration whether itshould be operated on a more selective basis.    His tentative view was that this matter could appropriately be examined by a SelectCommittee of the House of Commons, possibly by the SelectCommittee which it was proposed to set up in order to reviewParliamentary procedure.In a brief discussion, there was general agreement that the presentsystem of operating CFRs should be further examined.    Some doubt was expressed, however, whether the proposed Select Committeeon Parliamentary procedure would be the best instrument for considering matters of this kind, given the much wider issues whichit was proposed that this Select Committee should cover.1
The Cabinet -Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultationwith the Lord President of the Council, would consider further how the handling of ConfidentialFinal Revises should best be examined.2
TheWishingindustry2.        In the course of a short discussion concern was expressed about the future of the United Kingdom^ fishing industry.    Thisconcern extended beyond the possible consequences of theunresolved dispute with Iceland.    The Commission of the european economic Community (e.c.) had apparently put forward a newdocument, suggesting that a fishing zone only 12 miles wide shouldbe reserved off our coasts for our industry.    Although this mightnot be the Commission^ last word on the matter, this suggestion would cause despair in the industry.    There was urgent need of an examination of the long-term implications of the whole complex ofthe extension of fishery limits and tha development of the EECsCommon Fisheries Policy,THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had already discussed this aspect with the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.    they agreed that there was need for a comprehensive review of the issuesaffecting the fishing industry arising frpm the Common FisheriesPolicy, the United Nations Law of the Sea Conference,negotiations on fishing rights with countries outside the e.c. andany other matters relevant to reaching a view on the future size and shape of our fishing industry.    He had it in mind therefore toestablish a small Ministerial Group to oversee the work currently being undertaken in the relevant Ministerial Committees such asthe Ministerial Committee on European Questions (EQ) and theSub-Committee on the Sea of the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee (OPD(S)).The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the statement bythe Prime Minister.^desiarevious-Terence:t^K) 4thfusions^ute 23.

REVIEW OFPARLIAMENTARYPROCEDUREPreviousReferences:CC(76) 1stConclusionsMinute 5 and cc(76) 3rdConclusions,Minute 14.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (C(76) 15) containing proposals for theestablishment of a House of Commons Select Committee to carryout the major review of the practice and procedure of Parliamentmentioned in The Queen&apos;s Speech.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the cabinet had agreed on 15 January that the time was ripe for a major reviewof the kind he had proposed.   When the House of Commonsdebated this proposal on 2 February there had been generalagreement on the need for such a review.    He had, however,received little support for his suggestion that the Committeeshould include as full members a significant minority from outsidethe House, and, as an alternative, he proposed that the terms ofreference should empower the Committee to invite selected outsidersto attend meetings and to take part in their deliberations and inthe examination of witnesses, but not to vote.    The operative partof the terms of reference was the first paragraph, which chargedthe Select Committee to make recommendations for the more effective performance of the functions of the House, wording whichwould emphasise the radical nature of the review.    Thisparagraph should not be interpreted as covering the method ofelecting Members of Parliament, but it was otherwise very wide.It would enable the Select Committee to begin by considering whatthe functions of the House were, and would include such matters asthe size of the House (which could lead on to the question of the size of Scottish representation) and those features of the present arrangements which were thought to contribute to the very small proportion of women Members,    His memorandum did not cover the question of the size end membership of the Select Committee,on which there would need to be the umial consultations.In discussion the following points were made -a.        It was argued that the proposal to enable a small number of outsiders to play a full part in the deliberationsof the Select Committee, excluding only the power to vote,seemed close to the suggestion that outsiders should be fullmembers, which had not found favour in the House.    Theeffect might be to give disproportionate weight to the viewsof a very small number of people, and it would be better that assistance to the Committee by outsiders should be confined to the giving of evidence.    It seemed particularlydoubtful whether outsiders should take part in the questioningof witnesses, including Ministers.    On the other hand, itwas urged that a small number of outside persons would havea very valuable role to play in the deliberations of a Committeeotherwise composed wholly of Members of Parliament, and thatthe complete abandonment of this idea would be a mistake.
b.        The Select Committee^ work was likely to take some time, but its establishment n**ed not hold up all reformmeanwhile.    The Committee itself would have power tosubmit interim reports on any urgent matters, and thenormal sessional Procedure Committee could be set up, if need be, to consider any short-term or minor reforms,Co        The conduct of private business waa excluded fromthe terms of reference because it was a large and highly specialised area, which could be examined later in the lightof me Select Committee*s recommendations^d.        The Select Committee&apos;s remit would include theprocedure for enacting Northern Ireland legislation, mostof which at present took the form of Orders in CouncildiocusBed for only Ij hours.    It would be unfortunate if theCommittee recommended that Northern Ireland legislation should be dealt with in the same way as other legislation.a.        The Select Committee would be able to sit jointly with any corresponding Select Committee set up by theHouse of Lords,f. The Select Committee must be expected to consider proposals for expanding the role of Select Committees invarious ways, for example by the conferment of a pre-legislative role.    Such developments would need to be watched with care, in view of the very large amount ofwork for Ministers and their Departments already causedby Select Committees, and of the problems which had arisen in connection with requests by Select committees for oral evidence from Ministers and others, and withvisits overseas,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that a Select Committee should be set up with theterms of reference proposed by the Lord President of the Council,except that, as a compromise between the conflicting points ofview which had been expressed, the penultimate paragraph shouldempower the Committee to invite outside persons to attend itsmeetings and to participate in its deliberations, but not to take partin the examination of witnesses.    The Lord President would consulthim further about the composition of the Select Committee whichwould have to be considered with great care.    When the lord president of the Council and the Chief Whip had prepared a draftof the Governments initial written evidence to the Select Committee,this draft should be brought before the Cabinet, which would discussthe written evidence to be given to the Committee and thearrangements for giving oral evidence.    He was in touch with
Mr du Cann, as chairman of the informal liaison committee ofSelect Committee Chairmen, about current problems relating tothe operations of Select Committees, including the questions of overseas visits and of ensuring that only relevant Ministersappeared to give oral evidence; he would inform the Cabinet ofthe outcome of these discussions when they were concluded.    he hoped it would be possible to establish that the normal power ofSelect Committees to adjourn from place to place should be interpreted as relating only to the United Kingdom^ and that anyoverseas visits by a Select Committee should require a specialmotion passed by the House,The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister, and invited the Lord President of the Council to be guided accordingly.6
5.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (C(76) 16) on possible schemes to keepstudents out of unemployment offices during the coming Eastervacation^THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that on 5 february the Cabinet had asked him, in consultation with other ministers concerned, to oversee an urgent review by officials of possible means of keeping students out of supplementary benefits offices in the coming Easter vacation.    Four possible schemes had been examined, all of which presented serious difficulties.    The onewhich seemed to offer the best hope of a solution would be to asklocal education authorities to pay students their summer term granton or after the beginning of the next financial year.    Even thisscheme, however, was open to strong objections, the mostsubstantial being that the necessary amending regulations mightwell be ultra vires,    hi addition, the scheme could not be expectedto lead the Supplementary Benefits Commission to refuse benefit tostudents claiming it; and to invite local authorities to implementthis scheme could seriously damage attempts to secure their co-operation in the Governments general economic policies.He had accordingly reached the conclusion that the best that couldbe done for the coming Easter vacation would be to publish thestudent unemployment figures separately and to announce this intention,as already agreed, when this months unemployment figures were published; and at the same time to indicate the governments intentions fur student support in the next academic year on the linesof the scheme which the Social Services Committee had already approved.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCEsaid that the scheme for the next academic year would requireamending regulations the purpose of which must be sean to  lowfrom the Education Acte under which they were made.    Itaccordingly seemed appropriate that he should make theannouncement of this scheme.    The Law Officers had advised thatany suggestion that the object of the scheme was to keep studentsout of supplementary benefits offices might lead to a challenge inthe courts.    There should be no implication therefore that the amending regulations were being made for non-educational reasons of this kind.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed with the conclusions in the Lord President of theCouncil&apos;s memorandum.    The announcement of the new arrangements for the support of students during vacations in thenext academic year should, however, be made separately from theannouncement of the new arrangements relating to the unemployment7STUDENTS1FINANCE ANDUNEMPLOYMENTPreviousReference;CC(76) 4thConclusionsMinute 5
6.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Social Services (C(7c) 19) about private practice in theNational Health Service (NHS).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that,following the Cabinet discussion on 27 November, there had beenprotracted discussions, through the medium of Lord Goodman, witha widely representative group of leaders of the medical and dentalprofessions.    These had resulted in a package of proposals forthe separation of pay beds from the NHS;  and it was only at thevery end of the detailed negotiations that the representatives of the professions had refused to identify themselves with the package inthe sense of recommending it to consultants,    instead, the proposal had been put to a ballot of consultants the results of which had nowbeen declared.    The significant features of the results were that only 55 per cent of consultants took the trouble to vote; of these,only 2, 048 agreed to submit undated resignations from the NHS;and 1, 834 voted in favour of the separation of pay beds.    the indications were, therefore, that feelings against the Government&apos;apolicy were a good deal less pronounced than the British medical association (BMA) had claimed.    Jh the light of the ballot, however,the central BMA consultants committee had made unhelpful andtemporising recommendations to the BMA Council, as set out in annex 2 to her memorandum.    This would be considered by theBMA Council at its meeting on 24 February.The Prime Minister had at an earlier stage indicated to the professionthat the Government were committed to embodying the Goodmanproposals in legislation.    The Secretary of State for Social Serviceswas reasonably satisfied, from her recent contacts with the NationalPRIVATEpractice inthe nationalhealthservicePreviousReference:CC(75) 55thConclusionsMinute 28tstatistics.    The former announcement should be made as soon aspossible by the Secretary of State for Education and Science,, and theNational Union of Students should be informed in advance.    It mightbe better to announce the exclusion from the unemployment statistics of adult students registering for vacation employment on Monday,23 February, before the publication of the statistics themselves on24 February.    He himself, in consultation with the Secretary ofState for Employment, the Secretary of State for Social Services,the Secretary of State for Education and Science, the Secretary ofState for Scotland and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, would settle the precise form and timing of these announcements.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Mini3terfsbumming up of their discussion.
Executive Committee of the Labour Party and the health unions,that although there were a number of features in the Goodmanproposals which the unions disliked, they would be likely to accept that the main purpose of separating pay beds from the NHS wassecured, that the proposal for an independent Board, on which theunions would be represented, could be turned to their advantage and that a significant step forward had been taken towards the concept of common waiting lists.   Any delay in introducing legislation, however, would be very strongly resented and would run a real risk of precipitating further industrial action.In discussion, it was pointed out that the Governments commitment in The queen s Speech was to the introduction of legislation duringthe course of the Session, not necessarily to its enactment.    Thelegislation would undoubtedly be contentious, and it was important that the Government should not create additional difficulties byexposing themselves to accusations of bad faith as would happen if the consultations, which had been provided for in the Goodmanproposals, were seen to be inadequate or unduly rushed.    Theseconcerned the selection of the 1, 000 beds to be covered in a schedule to the Bill and the method of control of developments inthe private sector.    The negotiations on the Goodman proposalsrepresented a considerable achievement in devising a means of implementing the Governments policy on the basis of a reasonablywide measure of agreement, and this should not now be prejudiced by publication of a Bill containing provisions, in particular areserve power of control of the private sector, which did not followfull consultation.    On the other hand, considerable sympathy was expressed with the view that in the interests of maintaining an effective NHS and avoiding the risk of a further breakdown throughindustrial action, legislation should be introduced as soon aspossible, preferably with a view to a Second Reading before easter.   As regards the selection of the 1, 000 pay beds to be specified in a Schedule to the Bill, it would be enough, before theBill was published, to have identified the totals for each area health Authority, on the basis that the Schedule could be amendedduring the passage of the Bill.    Indeed, the advice of parliamentary counsel was that more detailed specification of the pay beds,hospital by hospital, would run the risk of hybridity because of difficulties inherent in a narrow application of the criteria forphasing out pay beds.    It was also suggested mat it would facilitateconsultations with the medical profession about the method ofcontrol of the private sector, and would be presentatlonally helpful,if the Secretary of State for Social Services were to publish a white paper on this aspect at the same time as the publication of the bill which, in these circumstances, would not contain any provision fora reserve, power, though this could subsequently be added byamendment at Report Stage.9
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that a Bill, embodying the Goodman proposals,should be introduced with a view to Second Reading before Easterand should be considered by Legislation Committee not later than16 March,    The Bill should not contain any provision for a reservepower of control of developments in the private sector, but theSecretary of State for Social Services should separately publish a white Paper in connection with her consultations with the professionsand other interests concerned which could include this aspect.Subject to these consultations, and to further consideration by theCabinet in the light of them, an amendment, providing for such a power, could be introduced at the Report Stage of the Bill,    Thelong title of the Bill should be framed in such a way as to allow foran amendment of this kind.    Meanwhile, the Secretary of State for social Services should bogin consultations with the BMA and theunions cn both the points identified in the Goodman proposals as requiring consultation, and with the NHS authorities on the selection of the 1, 000 beds.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Social Services, in consultation as necessary with the Lord President of the Counciland the Chief Whip, to proceed accordingly.10
7.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Social Services (C(76) 17) about the problemsof poor people faced with rising fuel bills, and a memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (C(76) 18) about the potentialdemands on the Contingency Reserve.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said thatthere had been heavy increases in fuel prices over the last twoyears, and she would be failing in her duty if she did not draw theattention of Cabinet to the Governments failure to protect the poorest members of the community against these rises in theirheating bills.    One of the root difficulties was the differences inthe rates of increase:  since October 1973 domestic gas prices had risen by 46. 5 per cent and domestic coal prices by 61. 8 per centbut the price of electricity in the home had risen by 96,4 per c*nt,while oil and paraffin had increased by 117.9 per cent.    Thesewidely differing rates of increase made it extremely difficult toset up arrangements which would cover all cases of hardship.    the uprating of social security benefits took account of a mix of fuelprice increases, but inevitably failed to cover adequately the impact of increased fuel bills on many of the recipients.    supplementary benefits were oniy available to those not in full-time work; not allpensioners received Supplementary Benefit;  and not all recipientsof Supplementary Benefit received the special heating allowances -indeed, only about one pensioner in ten got the present allowances.   Ithad been agreed in the Economic and Industrial Policy Committee that the allowances would be increased to take account of the forthcominground of fuel price increases, but this would add only 78 pence per quarter to the allowances, and would be regarded as derisory.    Shetherefore recommended to her colleagues that there should be a payment of a  10 tax free bonus to some 10% million people. including all retirement and supplementary pensioners, and all those inreceipt of widows benefit, invalidity pension and attendance allowance, as well a3 those on a continuing supplementary allowance and the recipients of the Family Income Supplement.THE CHIEF SECRETARY said that the report on the contingency reserve provided background against which the proposal of theSecretary of State for Social Services should be considered.   Hewas Bure that all members of the Cabinet would wish to avoiderosion of the difficult major expenditure decisions which had recently been taken.    Table 1 attached to the Chancellor of theExchequer^ paper (C(76) 18) demonstrated that the potential claims on the Contingency Reserve in 1976-77, including the  105 million which the Secretary of State&apos;s proposal would cost, amounted toslightly more than the total of  700 million ( 875 million at 1976-77prices) which was provided for in the Public Expenditure White Paper.There was thus a danger of the Reserve for 1976-77 being11
over-committed before the financial year had begun.    He pointedout mat in their discussion of public expenditure priorities at chequers in August of the previous year, the Cabinet had agreedthat their aim should be to make social benefits more, and not less,selective; but the proposal to pay a  10 bonus to a wide range of people in varying circumstances, some of whom were already morethan covered against higher fuel bills through upratings was completely non-discriminatory.    There was no need for theGovernment to undertake this expenditure for political reasonssince their record of what they had done for the pensioner sincetaking office was a very good one, the benefits for a marriedpensioner, for example, having been improved by some 13, 7 per centwhile the takt-home pay of the worker on average earnings had increased by only 1 per cent.    The special heating allowances,which went to half of the existing recipients of Supplementary Benefit,had been increased by 83 per cent since the Government took office.He saw no justification for spending  105 million on the bonuspayment which had been proposed.In discussion it was suggested that, while the payment of the proposedbonus was not the right solution, there nevertheless was a real and difficult problem which required further consideration.    Moreincreases in public sector prices, including electricity, were in the pipeline, and there would be advantage if the Cabinet could considerpossible ways of modifying the impact of these on the poorer sectionof the community in a&apos;comprehensive fashion, but without losingsight of the need for greater selectivity.    The Economic PolicyCommittee had already examined the possibility of restructuringtariffs so as to assist the poor, and had concluded that there wasno satisfactory answer through that route.    It had been agreed that,on wider grounds, it was not possible simply to hold down public sector prices.    Now it seemed that there was no satisfactory wayof helping through social security benefits.    One possibility mightbe to improve the discretionary heating allowances more than had so far been envisaged.    This, however, would only be one possibilityand it was desirable that Ministers collectively should consider thewhole problem.    Indeed, the opportunity might be taken to cover allpublic sector price increases, including bus fares, which wereimportant for many people.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that whilesympathising with the difficulties to which the Secretary of Statefor Social Services had drawn attention, the Cabinet did not agreethat a  10 bonus should be paid to assist poorer people to meetrising fuel bills.    But there was need for a wider study coveringall possible ways of mitigating the impact of public sector pricesupon those least able to cope with the increases.    It would be appropriate for this to be considered by the Ministerial Committee12
on Economic and Industrial Policy, who, if they were not able toreach agreement, could bring it back to Cabinet.    The Secret? ryof State for Social Services should be associated with theCommittee in that work.The Cabinet -1. ^ook note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2,        Invited the Chancellor of the exchequer to bring the problem of assisting poorer people to cope with the consequences of higher public sector prices before the Ministerial Committeeon Economic and Industrial Poliny, for resolutionthere or further reference to the Cabinet ifnecessary.developmentTAXPreviousReference:CCtffc) 4thConclusions8,        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of thu Exchequer (C(76) 14) to which was attached amemorandum by the Paymaster General setting out certain proposals on Development Land Tax; and a memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (C(76) 20) commenting on the proposed abandonment of roll-over relief.THE PAYMASTER GENERAL said that at their meeting on February the Cabinet had agreed that Development Land Tax(DLT) should be introduced at 80 per cent, but that the limitedform of roll-over relief at present granted on Development GainsCharge should be applied to DLT.    The Cabinet had, however,given him and the Minister for Planning and Local government authority to consider as a possible alternative to the 80 per concentrate, the introduction of a two tranche arrangement, whereby thefirst band of any development value realised would be subject toa lower rate of tax than 80 per cent.   As a result of discussions with the other Ministers concerned he and the Minister for Planningnow put forward the compromise proposal mat, up to 31 March 1979,there would be a tranche of  150, 000 of development valuerealised in a year (over and above the exempt  10, 000) whichwould be taxable at 66f per cent, the balance being charged at80 per cent; but that at the same time there should be no roll-overrelief.    In his view this compromise would go a good way toovercoming the fear that an initial rate of tax of 80 per cent would lead to a drying up in the supply of building land.   At the sametime it avoided conceding too much on large developments.    he appreciated that the Minister of Agriculture would prefer to retain13ft
roll-over relief; but pointed out that the compromise arrangement on the rate would be useful to agricultural land owners, and therewere of course other tax concessions, as well as grants, toencourage agricultural investment.    It was true mat the twotranche arrangement was a temporary one, lasting only threeyears; but then roll-over relief would itself have been only temporary, disappearing when sales at current use value were established practice.    He recommended the compromisearrangement to his colleagues.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE said that in his view thearrangement for roll-over relief, which was only a deferment ofa tax liability, was a better system for encouraging moreagric^tural investment.    He would be willing to accept the twotranche proposal, with a reduced rate of tax for the first tranche;but he eaw no reason why the Cabinet should reverse their previous decision on roll-over relief.In discussion it was pointed out that the compromise proposed wasa good deal more generous to the seller of land than theGovernments original White Paper, since it embodied both the reduced rate of tax on  150, 000 of development value, worth 20, 000, and an additional  5, 000 on the exemption.    To addroll-over relief to this would be to go too far.    The CommunityLand Scheme had been put forward on the basis that the benefits would accrue to local authorities, and the introduction of roll-overrelief would work in the opposite direction.    Some scepticismwas expressed on whether in fact the compromise arrangement would appreciably increase the supply of building land - indeed,there might be a danger that sellers would seek to phase their salesover the three year period so as to obtain the maximum advantage from the two tranche arrangement, thereby actually reducing theamount of land coming forward.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that therewas a clear majority in favour of the compromise proposal whichhad been put forward by the Paymaster General and the Minister for planning and Local Government,    This meant that the first  150, 000of development value realised (over and above the  10, 000 exemption)would be charged Development Land Tax at 66f per cent, the balancebeing charged at 80 per cent.    There would be no roll-over relief.The Cabinet -1, Took note with approval of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.

So farMr Smith had been completely intransigent.    The Foreign and commonwealth Secretary had already sent a strong message to him,and, depending on his reaction, the possibility was now beingconsidered of sending a senioi emissary to Salisbury to urgeflexibility on him in his negotiations with Mr Nkomo,    There was just a possibility that Mr Smith might now wish us to become involved in his discussions with Mr Nkomo,hi discussion it was suggested that, if Mr Smith were to show anysign of a more co-operative attitude, he might seek someundertaking of support from us in return.    It would be most undesirable to offer this,    hi any case we did not have the necessaryforces for effective military intervention in Rhodesia, even though in international law we remained the responsible Government.    Itwas particularly unfortunate that the impression was being givenin some sections of the media that in certain circumstances we might have to intervene militarily,    hi this connection it was notedthat should Rhodesia be invaded, and especially if the invasion wereled by Russian or Cuban forces, there could well be a problemover mercenaries or volunteers seeking to fight in Rhodesia,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would of course consider the matter fully should the situationdeteriorate further.    In the meantime it was of the highest importanceto maintain total secrecy about both any possibility of sending anemissary to Mr Smith or of our involvement in his talks withMr Nkomo.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary would bearranging for the media to be given a clear briefing againstsuggestions that we might intervene militarily.
