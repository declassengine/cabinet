1.        The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.    It was noted thatin the debate on unemployment that day the Speaker was not expectedto call the amendment put down by members of the Tribune Group,but there was likely to be a vote on the Government Motion.    It wasalso noted that the Opposition might decide to vote against the motion on fihii Lcodon Councillors Order on 4 February,The Cabinet discussed a problem arising over the re-appointmentof last Session&apos;a Select Committee on Cyprus.The Government had initially resisted the establishment of thisCommittee, but following considerable pressure the Governmenthad agreed to its appointment just before the Summer Recess.The Select Committee had not completed its task by the end of the session, and wished to be re-appointed.    It had indicated that itwould wish to call for papers about diplomatic exchanges on Cyprus,including our negotiations with the previous Government in Cyprus;and also to summon the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary togive evidence in person about events during the Cyprus crisis of1974, including in particular conversations he had with the TurkishPrime Minister, Mr. Ecevit. Following consultation with theChairman of the Select Committee a Government Motion had beenput down, but not moved, to re-appoint the Committee until Easterand to enable it to complete its report, but without powers to call for persons, papers and records or to travel.    The other membersof the Select Committee had however been adamant mat it must also have power to send for persons and papers, and there was considerable support for this view in the House and in theParliamentary Labour Party.    It was difficult to see how this demand could be resisted on this occasion: but there could be noquestion of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary having to answer on very sensitive matters.    Not only would this create amost undesirable precedent but it would make it more difficult toget agreement in Cyprus and could have a serious effect on theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation.    indeed to accept that select committees should be given information about confidential diplomaticexchanges on sensitive subjects would make diplomacy impossible.In discussion it was pointed out that a number of problems were currently being experienced in consequence of the more frequentappointment of Select Committees in recent years.    Some of theirchairmen and members wished to move towards an Americansystem of Congressional investigation; and there were problems arising from the increasing desire of Select Committees to traveloverseas.    The Trade and Industry Sub-Committee of the SelectCommittee on Expenditure, for instance, proposed to travel to Iranin the course of its investigation of the Chrysler affair and to question Iranian officials who, if they agreed to be questioned, might1
look for reciprocity if the Government of Iran wished to investigate the performance of British firms with contracts there.    It would be undesirable that Select Committees should obtain more information from Ministers man they would feel able to give on the floor of theHouse; and it was equally unsatisfactory that Ministers should beexpected to attend upon Select Committees to be asked questionswhich they were not prepared to answer.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that hewould that evening be seeing Mr Du Cann, in his capacity as chairman of the Group of Select Committee Chairmen, about theneed for the Government to maintain its collective responsibility in Ministerial appearances before Select Committees.    He wouldtake the opportunity also to mention to him the problems that wereoccuring in relation to Cyprus and Iran.   The Cabinet had earlierbeen disposed not to refer the general question of Ministerialappearances before Select Committees to a Committee on Procedure,but it was for consideration whether there might be informal discussions on Privy Counsellor terms with the Opposition leaderswho could be expected to be responsive to the dangers of attemptedmoves towards a Congressional system and enquiries touching uponsensitive diplomatic issues.    If the Select Committee on Cypruswere to be re-appointed - and this probably could not be avoided -it should be possible to adopt the line that information could not begiven to the Select Committee if it could not be given to the House.The Cabinet were not, however, yet in a position to come to a finalview on the re-establishment and powers of the Select Committee;if therefore this was raised at the Party meeting that day it shouldbe explained that there were real problems relating to the taking offurther evidence and that if necessary a statement would be made ata subsequent meeting.    He would himself arrange for an examination,in conjunction with other Ministers directly concerned, of thegeneral problems relating to Select Committees which had been raised in discussion; better control over overseas visits might beachieved by requiring the specific permission of the House on each occasion.The Cabinet -1.    Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2
THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that hehad written to the Chief Whips of the other parties in Parliament,and similarly to the General Secretary of the Labour Party and tothe Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP), tellingthem that he was thinking of tabling proposals on direct elections tothe European Assembly as a basis for early debate in Parliament,indicating briefly the likely scope of the proposals, and invitingtheir views.    The proposals would probably take the form of a white Paper: however, while some issues, mainly those to bedecided on a Community basis, would require reasonably firm decisions, those for subsequent   national decision could be dealtwith more tentatively and more closely in form to a Green Paper.The Cabinet were informed that the Liaison Committee of the PLPhad asked that any debate in the House of Commons should be deferred until after a PLP discussion of the proposals, and itwould be sensible for that discussion to be arranged when those PLPmembers who were also members of the European Assembly couldattend.    It was intended that the discussion should take the form ofan expression of views, and not lead to a vote.    Since the next meeting of the European Council, at which the Heads of Governmentof the Member States of the European Economic Community were expected to take decisions on a number of these matters, had been deferred until 1 and. 2 April, it should be possible to meet this request.In discussion it was suggested that, given the considerable importance and known differences of views on this matter, it wouldhave been better for the Cabinet to have discussed the issue and tohave formed a view before consultations were entered into withother parties.    On the other hand it was explained that these consultations would not involve negotiations but would gather views.It would be sensible for this to be done before the Cabinet consideredthe text of a White Paper and approved it for publication.    All those concerned had been promised full consultation; the procedure being followed had been indicated in answers to Questions in the House bythe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary on 17 December and thePrime Minister on 27 January, and had seemed to meet with approval from those likely to have differing views on the merits ofthe issue.   A draft of the White Paper had been circulated to theCabinet under the cover of a memorandum (C(76) 2) by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Home Secretary: but this hadnot of course been sent to the political parties whose views werebeing sought.    With the deferment of the date of the EuropeanCouncil, there was no need for the Cabinet to consider the draft white Paper now, but it should do so when a finalised text, amended as necessary in the light of the views expressed in the consultations,was available.3
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should aim tocomplete his consultations with the other parties within the next two weeks.    He and the Home Secretary should then circulate the text of the White paper, revised as necessary to take into account the views expressed, for the Cabinet to consider with a view to publication in the latter part of February.   A meeting of the PLPshould be arranged to discuss the issue before a debate in theHouse of Commons.    In the meantime the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary should circulate to other members of theCabinet the text of his letter to the other political parties.The Cabinet -2.    Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;8summing up of the discussion.4
foreign 2.      the foreign and commonwealth secretary saidAFFAIRS that the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA),with Soviet and Cuban support, were now clearly getting the upperhand in the Angolan fighting.    As many as 12, 000 Cubans were nowAngola in Angola or on the way there.    The South Africans were disengaging:they had of course never admitted their involvement.    The American1 Secretary of State, Dr Kissinger, had made no headway in his efforts to persuade the Soviet Union to withdraw their support from the MPLA.The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs had told our Ambassador thattheir intervention had been at the request of the MPLA whom they had long supported.    They saw no reason not to continue to do so.    TheSouth Africans could take no comfort from the indecisive outcome ofI the Council of the Organisation of African Unity since those african states which had not recognised the MPLA were likely to change1 their stance one by one before very long.    Although a governmenti composed of the three factions in Angola, for which he had hoped,I was now unlikely, he still hoped that the MPLA might see the wisdom of forming a government of national reconciliation, including somerepresentatives of the tribes which had opposed them, since militaryi victory would otherwise not end their problems.    Our own policy should be to continue low level coo.ta.cta with the MPLA, and to go onpressing publicly for the withdrawal of all external forces.    He had considered several times the possibility of raising the issue in theUnited Nations Security Council but had decided that it would be unwise to do so against the express wish of the African Governmentswho, with the exception of Zaire, had unanimously opposed Unitedj Nations involvement in the dispute.    We had to recognise that manyAfrican States must now be feeling insecure under the impact of what,in East/West terms, could only be regarded as a major Sovietsuccess.    There would also be repercussions on the Chinese position in Africa which had been built up with great skill but would now be! weakened: this was already heightening the dispute between Chinaand the Soviet Union.    The only ray of hope was that, if the MPLAfinally prevailed, other African Government&apos;s would subsequentlyput pressure on the MPLA for the withdrawal of the Russians andCubans.The Cabinet -1.      Took note of the statement by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.I There was a brief discussion of the proposal for a loan of somej $33 million to Chile from the International Bank for Reconstruction! and Development (IBRD) for a copper project.    It was explainedi that, in keeping with the Governmenfs firm policy towards thepresent Chilean Government, the United Kingdom representatives on international bodies consistently refrained from supporting proposalsj for economic assistance to Chile.    Our representative in the IBRD5
would consequently abstain in the vote on the proposed loan for thecopper project, and it was well understood in international bankingcircles that such abstention, combined with a statement inexplanation of vote, was equivalent to an adverse vote.    It was argued that this would not be understood by the general public andthat it would be better for our representative to vote against the loan.On the other hand, the point was made that decisions on loans by theInternational Bank were taken on strict economic criteria which thisparticular loan was likely to satisfy.    It was important to theUnited Kingdom, on wider grounds, to support the general policy that political factors should not be allowed to sway IBRD decisions.The Cabinet -2.      Took note.3.        THE PRIME MINISTER said that the negotiations with the icelandic Prime Minister, Mr Hallgrimeson, and his delegation hadbeen both full and serious: in the course of four days they hadextended for more than sixteen hours.    Much of the difficulty in themarose from the weak position of Mr Hallgrimsson as Hie head of a coalition administration.    Paradoxically, this weakness made himextremely tough in bargaining, since he knew that any other attitude would involve his almost certain fall from power.    He had broughtwith him the leader of the minority Party in his coalition,Mr Thorarinsson, whose attitude had been even tougher.    We hadacknowledged the importance of conservation of cod stocks and,although there had been some disagreement between the scientistsabout the desirable catch figure for 1976, it had seemed possiblethat the two delegations might have reached some compromise figureon this key point.    It was then necessary to establish a basis for the division of this catch between the United Kingdom and Iceland,allowing a small proportion for third countries.    After discussion ofmany possible formulae, our final proposal to the Icelanders wasthat they should fix the total allowable catch, of which the UnitedKingdom would have the right to a specific proportion, subject to this proportion falling within a fairly narrow range between agreedminimum and maximum tonnages.    The proportion we had suggestedwas 28 per cent, and in doing so we had had it in mind that a suitablecompromise figure for the total allowable catch might be of the orderof 265, 000 tons of cod.    In addition to cod, our trawlers would catchvarying quantities of certain other species, perhaps amounting to10, 000 tone in all, though these were mainly of low value.    the precise catch figure to which such a formula would lead was one whichthe Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food had consideredacceptable to the British fishing industry.    Mr Hallgrimsson had asked for time to discuss mis proposal with his Cabinet colleagues,6
and to cover the Interim period of a few days we had worked out withthe Icelandic delegation an arrangement for the temporary cessation of harassment of our trawlers, balanced by a reduction in thenumber of trawlers to thirty.    Mr Hallgrimsson had not been ableto agree even to this interim arrangement without reference to hiscolleagues on his return to Reykjavik, but had promised a reply on it by midday on 28 January: in the event he had then had to ask fora further delay of twenty-four hours.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that our offer had been an extremely reasonable one.    In effect we were proposing that the Icelandic fishing industry should make a short termsacrifice, perhaps of only one year, after which substantially increasedcatches would accrue to the Icelandic industry.    Nevertheless, hethought it likely that the Icelandic Prime Minister would be inhibitedby the weakness of his internal position from accepting even a veryreasonable offer.    If in consequence we had to return to providingnaval protection for our trawlers, certain international consequenceswere virtually certain to follow, regardless of the rights and wrongsof the issues in dispute.    The Icelandic Government would break offdiplomatic relations with the United Kingdom.    They would renewthoir protests to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) andthe United Nations, would probably cease to participate in NATOmeetings and would perhaps threaten to withdraw from the Alliance,There would then be heavy NATO pressure on ub to make concessionsand we should be faced with the argument from our allies that NATOfacilities on Iceland were worth far more than 10, 000 or 20,000 tonsof fish.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said thata critical situation had arisen on the fishing grounds off Iceland.The Icelandic coastguard vessels were patrolling so closely aroundour trawlers that no fishing had been possible for the last forty-eight hours.    If Mr Hallgrimsson accepted the interim arrangement itwould still remain to be seen whether he could carry out his side ofthe bargain.    If he failed to do so, we should be faced with twochoices.    Were we to resume naval protection? or, failing that,would we compensate the fishermen for their financial losses?In discussion it was argued that the problem which we were facingmight not last beyond July or August, depending upon the outcome ofthe session of the United Nations Law of the Sea Conference whichwas due to open in March.    There were incentives for the Icelandersto reach agreement with us.    If they failed to do so, we should catchunder protection at an annual rate of 100, 000 or even 120, 000 tons ofcod.    And without an agreement with us they could not obtain themore favourable access to Community markets which would be opento them under Protocol 6 of their agreement with the european economic Community.    Should it become clear that direct7
negotiations had failed, there would remain the possibility ofmediation, with Sweden as a suitable candidate for mediator.    Ifthe Icelanders were too weak even to accept mediation, the offer of it would count to our credit in NATO.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, referred to aReuters message which had been received in the course of thediscussion.    This reported the Icelandic coastguard vessels as having received instructions to cease harassment of our trawlers.Immediate steps should be taken to seek confirmation of theauthenticity of this report.    If it proved true, it would influenceour fishermen to accept the interim arrangement for fishing inreduced numbers.    If proved untrue, then either the trawlersmight carry out their threat to withdraw from waters off Iceland,or else harassment would sooner or later lead to warp cuttingincidents.    In the latter event it would no doubt prove necessaryto send back our frigates to provide protection, but this was nota decision which should be taken now in view of the obscurities of theposition.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.8
&apos;RANIUM SUPPLIES    4. THE PRIME MINISTER said that a decision was neededR.OM NAMIBIA before the end of the month whether British Nuclear Fuels Ltd(BNFL) should be authorised to take up an option for supply ofan additional 1,100 tons of uranium from Namibia in 1977-82under their present contract with RosBing Uranium Ltd.    TheSecretary of State for Energy considered that this authority shouldnot be given.    The majority of the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee, by whom the subject had been considered, took the opposite view.    The Committee had decided however that, sincethe issue was politically sensitive, it should be raised at Cabinet.The relevant minutes and papers of the Defence and overseas policy Committee had accordingly been made available to membersof Ihe Cabinet and with his agreement the Secretary of State forEnergy had circulated an aide memoire expressing his views.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that whenMinisters had taken their decisions on the Roe sing contracts in1968 and 1970 they had not been aware that uranium supplied from South Africa would come from Namibia or that the SouthAfrican government would have a power of veto over such supplies.Also the estimate then made of the urgency of our need for additional uranium had proved to have been overestimated.    Theattitude of the Labour Party in Opposition to the Rossing contractwas on record.    In 1974 it had been decided that the contractshould not be terminated but there had been important changessince that time.    The United Nations views on Namibia hadstrengthened.    Events in Angola had put the security of supplies from Namibia in some doubt.    The South West Africa People&quot;organisation (SWAPO) had expressed publicly their oppoeition tothe contract.   And the slowing down world wide in nuclear powerprogrammes had given us a little more time in which to decide our policy.    His view was that BNFL should not be authorised to take up the option open to them under their present contract withRossing, supplies under which would in any event be small inrelation to our total needs;   that we should discuss with theUnited Nations Council for Namibia and with SWAPO whethersatisfactory arrangements could be arrived at; and that we shouldbe prepared to seek uranium elsewhere than in Namibia.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the majority of the Defence and oversea Policy Committee was opposed to the recommendations made by the Secretary of State for Energy, and their view had been based on a careful analysis of our future needs for uranium and the availability of sources of supply outside Namibia.    The Committeehad taken into account the advice of the Law Officers that ourcontracts in Namibia were not contrary to our obligations under united Nations Resolutions, and they had noted also that by thetime supplies of uranium under the option became available9
Namibia was unlikely still to be under South African control.There was in his view no immediate prospect of obtaining elsewhereeven the relatively small quantities of uranium which would beprovided under the option.    Canada and Australia for examplehad adopted a very restrictive attitude towards exports of uranium,and any sales by them were likely to be of uranium in itsprocessed form, which was costly and not suitable for all ourgenerating stations.In discussion it was argued that, although the proceedings of theUnited Nations Council for Namibia were not binding on us, weshould pay serious regard to the views expressed at the united nations and also to the attitude of African countries.    Oppositionto the policies of South Africa was likely to grow more intense inthe years immediately ahead and it would not be in our interests to place ourselves in the minority of world opinion.    MoreoverSouth West Africa was in a state of change and pressure forNamibian independence was growing.    There was a positive need to ensure that our supply of uranium was secure and was not put at risk by these developments.   Economically the amount of uraniumwhich we would obtain under the option was of relatively smallvalue to us but the political difficulty of taking up the option was considerable.    The right course was tc forego the option and todiscuss with the Commissioner for Namibia, Mr Sean MacBrida,the attitude we should take on 0&apos;ir contract in Namibia, with the objective of securing our uranium supplies.It was pointed out on the other hand that world demand for uraniumwas rising and that competition for available supplies was likely tobe intense in the 1980s.    There were few sources of supply outsideSouthern Africa.    Purchases from Niger were no more than apossibility.    The prospect of supply from Canada or Australia waspoor, new mines took up to 8 years to develop.    Nuclear powerproduced the cheapest electricity, and in the interests of holdingdown industrial and other costs we should take whatever opportunitypresented itself of satisfying our future needs for uranium.    the analysis made for the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee had stated that cancellation of the main Roe sing contract could imperilour supplies because it could not be replaced in the time scalerequired.    But if it was accepted that the main contract shouldcontinue there was logically no reason why we should not takeadvantage of the option also and there would be substantialadvantage in doing so.   African countries felt it necessary toexpress public opposition to our contracts in Namibia but the viewsboth they and SWAPO expressed in private were different.    TheForeign and Commonwealth Secretary would be prepared to talkto Mr Mac Bride about our purchases of uranium from Namibiabut only after a decision had been taken to authorise BNFL to take up the option.10
THE PRIME MINISTER, Bumming up the discussion, said that amajority of the Cabinet agreed that BNFL should be authorised totake up the option open to them under their present contract withRossing.    They agreed that thereafter the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary should discuss the general question ofour purchases of uranium from Namibia with Mr Mac Bride andthat the Secretary of State for Energy should be present at thediscussion.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.2.      Invited the Secretary of State for energy and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaryto proceed accordingly.londonWeighting for,:*unisters and1 ^embers ofparliament5.

fattS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTlondonsupplementfor ministers and membersof parliamentPreviousReference:CC(75) 36thConclueiotiB,Minute copy no37CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cc(76) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 5Thursday 29 January 1976 at 11.30 am the PRIME MINISTER said that the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy (MES) had earlier that morning consideredthe payment of London Supplement to Ministers and Members ofParliament.    The Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) had reportedin the summer of 1975 on the remuneration of Ministers, Membersof Parliament and Peers recommending that the London SupplementBhould be increased to  340 a year, and that in future it should be adjusted automatically to keep it in line with changes in the CivilService rate of Inner London Weighting.    Loadoa Supplement hadbeen increased to the level recommended by the TSRB with effect from 13 June 1975, the date on which the report was received;and the House of Commons had passed a Resolution on 23 July 1975,the effect of which was to provide that increases in LondonSupplement for Ministers and Members of Parliament were nowautomatically linked to increases in the relevant Civil Service rate.Since then the Civil Service Inner London Weighting had increasedwith effect from 1 July 1975 in a way which, under the Resolution,would lead to an increase fjk the London Supplement from  340 to 385.    Unless any steps were taken to amend the Resolution of23 July 1975, the effect would be that the London Supplement wouldhave been increased twice in the space of one month.    Although this increase would be entirely consistent with the pay policy and withdecisions that had already been taken about similar cases, it had beenargued in MES that Ministers and Members of Parliament should not take advantage of what would be seen as a technical point to increaseLondon Supplement because of the possible damage this might do tothe pay policy.    It had therefore been proposed that Ministers and members of Parliament should forgo the  45 increase in LondonSupplement to which they were entitled as one way of reinforcing theoperation of the pay policy.    MES had however recognised that anyattempt to amend the Resolution of 23 July in such a way as toprevent the payment of  45 might give rise to even more undesirablepublicity if it were opposed; and mis was likely given the importance which many backbenchers on both Bides attached to the principle oflinkage.     The Committee had therefore decided on balance that
London Supplement should be increased by  45 with effect from1 July 1975 as already provided for by the Resolution of23 July 1975.    It would however be helpful if Ministers who were members of the Cabinet were to forgo this increase: this would be useful ammunition if later the Government were criticised for notintervening.    In the light of this decision no further Parliamentaryaction was needed.    It was to be hoped that the payment of theincrease would attract no publicity: and if this were so membersof the Cabinet should not draw attention to the payment of this increase or to the fact that they would not themselves be receivingit.    He would take steps to ensure that no difficulties arose, forexample with the Inland Revenue, because of the fact that the  45increase would not be drawn by Cabinet Ministers,The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of tha Prime Minister^statement.Cabinet Office30 January 19762
